A jury awarded Mark Izen both compensatory\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\nand punitive  damages on his  claim of  retaliatory discharge  in\r\n\nthis  diversity case  brought pursuant  to Massachusetts  General\r\n\nLaws, ch.  151B   4.   Toshiba American Consumer  Products, Inc.,\r\n\ndefendant below, appeals this verdict.   Because we find that the\r\n\ndistrict  court, in  granting  Izen's 50(a)  motion,  erroneously\r\n\nfound as a matter of law -- and instructed the jury --  that Izen\r\n\nwas  discharged and did  not resign, we reverse  and remand for a\r\n\nnew trial.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Mark Izen worked for Toshiba managing sales accounts in\r\n\nBoston and reported  to the New  England Regional Manager,  James\r\n\nDonahue.    Izen claims  that,  during  the  time he  worked  for\r\n\nToshiba, Donahue  expressed  antisemitic  bias  which  materially\r\n\naffected  Izen's  working  conditions.   After  receiving  a poor\r\n\nevaluation from Donahue  in April of 1992 --  an evaluation which\r\n\nrecommended that  Izen be demoted  -- Izen consulted  an attorney\r\n\nand  began  pursuing  his  complaint  of  discrimination  through\r\n\nToshiba's internal dispute resolution program.  Izen claims that,\r\n\nshortly  after he brought Donahue's behavior  to the attention of\r\n\nToshiba's management,  Donahue called  Izen into  his office  and\r\n\nyelled at him.   Izen also alleges  that, during May and  June of\r\n\n1992,  Donahue harassed him through phone calls, conferences, and\r\n\nmemoranda and intentionally  did not invite  Izen to a  quarterly\r\n\nsales meeting.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The  Toshiba dispute  resolution program  began  with a\r\n\nhearing in  front of David  Baesler, Donahue's supervisor.   Both\r\n\nDonahue and  Izen  presented  their sides  of  the  conflict  and\r\n\nBaesler  issued a written  decision, in  which he  concluded that\r\n\nIzen  had not been  discriminated against but  that communication\r\n\nbetween Donahue and Izen was poor.  Baesler assured Izen that  he\r\n\nwould intervene  if  future conflicts  arose  and that  he  would\r\n\nmonitor  the  work  relationship  with  Donahue  through  monthly\r\n\nmeetings.   After Baesler's decision issued, Izen  wrote a letter\r\n\nto  Baesler  and  Toshiba's   senior  management  expressing  his\r\n\ndisagreement  with   Baesler's  decision   but  reaffirming   his\r\n\ncommitment to the company.\r\n\n          On  June  17,   1992,  Robert  Valentine,  representing\r\n\nToshiba's personnel  department, and John  Anderson, representing\r\n\nToshiba's legal department, sent a letter  signed by Valentine to\r\n\nIzen informing him that if  he did not appeal Baesler's decision,\r\n\nToshiba would  consider the matter  resolved.  On July  1, Izen's\r\n\nattorney, John  Deacon, responded  with a  letter complaining  of\r\n\nDonahue's  continuing  retaliation,   characterizing  Valentine's\r\n\nletter  as a ratification  of Donahue's retaliatory  actions, and\r\n\nstating that:\r\n\n          As a  result of Mr. Donahue's misconduct, and\r\n          the  company's  refusal to  correct  it, Mark\r\n          Izen's  employment  conditions   have  become\r\n          intolerable  and  constitute  a  constructive\r\n          termination.  All  remedies available by  law\r\n          will be pursued.\r\n\n          On  July 8,  Anderson  responded  to  Deacon's  letter,\r\n\nstating in part:\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          I am sincerely sorry that Mark has decided to\r\n          leave  the company.   I am  also disappointed\r\n          that he has elected not to try to resolve his\r\n          problem within  the Company.   I believe that\r\n          Toshiba's effort  to resolve  the matter  was\r\n          genuine and sincere.\r\n\nAnderson  concluded  his  letter by  informing  Deacon  that Izen\r\n\nshould  get  in   touch  with  Valentine  to   make  arrangements\r\n\nconcerning  his  final  check.    Deacon  responded  on July  10,\r\n\ndisputing   Anderson's   assertion   that   Izen  had   resigned,\r\n\nreasserting  his  claim  that  Toshiba  had   endorsed  Donahue's\r\n\nactions, and further stating that:\r\n\n          If  the   Company  wishes   to  retract   its\r\n          termination  of  Mark's   employment  and  to\r\n          retract  its  endorsement  of  Mr.  Donahue's\r\n          discriminatory  mistreatment,  please contact\r\n          me in writing by July  15.  Otherwise, I will\r\n          have  Mark follow  your  instruction to  make\r\n          arrangements with Mr. Valentine for his final\r\n          check.\r\n\nAnderson wrote Deacon back on July 17, stating that Deacon's last\r\n\nletter made it \"crystal  clear that Mr. Izen claims to  be unable\r\n\nto  do  his  job  under  what  he  perceives  to  be  intolerable\r\n\nconditions\" and affirming  that the separation process  should be\r\n\nconcluded.  Izen was paid through July 22 and left on that date.\r\n\n          Izen then  brought this action,  claiming that  Toshiba\r\n\ndiscriminated against him because of his Jewish religion, origin,\r\n\nand ancestry, and that, when he reported  that violation, Toshiba\r\n\nretaliated and  ultimately discharged  him, all  in violation  of\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 151B   4.1  Izen's claims went before  a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Section 4 provides in relevant part that:\r\n\n          It shall be an unlawful practice:\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\njury and, at the close  of all the evidence, Izen  moved pursuant\r\n\nto Fed. R. Civ.  P. 50(a) for the district court to  find that he\r\n\nwas terminated  and did not  resign.  The district  court granted\r\n\nIzen's motion and, accordingly, instructed  the jury that on  the\r\n\nretaliatory  discharge claim  the  jury  was  to  determine  only\r\n\nwhether Izen was terminated in retaliation  for his complaints of\r\n\ndiscrimination.  The jury was  also instructed on Izen's claim of\r\n\ndiscrimination.\r\n\n          The  jury  found  that Toshiba  had  not  discriminated\r\n\nagainst  Izen  but  that  retaliation was  the  cause  of  Izen's\r\n\ntermination;  based on its  finding of retaliatory  discharge the\r\n\njury  awarded  Izen $36,680  for  economic loss  and  $150,000 in\r\n\npunitive  damages.  Post-trial,  the district court  awarded Izen\r\n\n$120,337  in  attorney's  fees and  denied  Toshiba's  motion for\r\n\njudgment  as  a  matter  of  law  on  the  claim  of  retaliatory\r\n\ndischarge.  \r\n\n          In  this appeal, Toshiba claims that the district court\r\n\nerred in not allowing the  jury to consider whether Izen resigned\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            1)   For  an employer,  by  himself or  his\r\n          agent, because of  the . . .  religious creed\r\n          . .  . of any individual to refuse to hire or\r\n          employ   or  to  bar  or  to  discharge  from\r\n          employment such individual or to discriminate\r\n          against such individual in compensation or in\r\n          terms, conditions or privileges of employment\r\n          . . . . \r\n            . . . .\r\n            4)    For   any  person,  employer,   labor\r\n          organization   or   employment    agency   to\r\n          discharge,  expel  or  otherwise discriminate\r\n          against any person because he has opposed any\r\n          practices  forbidden  under  this  chapter  .\r\n          . . .  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nor was terminated.  Toshiba also claims that:  1) the trial court\r\n\nerred  in limiting  Anderson's  testimony as  to his  motives for\r\n\nwriting  the letters  to Deacon;  and  2) the  award of  punitive\r\n\ndamages and attorneys'  fees was improper.  Because  we find, for\r\n\nthe reasons given in part II  of this opinion, that a jury  could\r\n\nreasonably  have concluded that Izen resigned, and that therefore\r\n\nthe district court  erred in taking that question  from the jury,\r\n\nwe  reverse the judgment  of the district court  and remand for a\r\n\nnew  trial on Izen's claim of retaliatory discharge.  In light of\r\n\nreversal on this  ground, we find it unnecessary to  reach any of\r\n\nthe other errors urged by Toshiba.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Judgment as a matter of law  may be granted only if the\r\n\nevidence viewed from the  perspective most favorable to the  non-\r\n\nmovant is  so one-sided  that the movant  is plainly  entitled to\r\n\njudgment, for  reasonable  minds  could  not  differ  as  to  the\r\n\noutcome.   Gibson  v. City  of  Cranston, 37  F.3d 731  (1st Cir.\r                                                  \r\n\n1994).  We review a grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo.\r                                                                          \r\n\nCPC Int'l, Inc. v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus  Ins. Co., 46 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n1211, 1214 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\n\n          The district court  found that no jury could infer from\r\n\nthe letters  exchanged in June  and July  of 1992  that Izen  had\r\n\nresigned  and,  therefore,  the district  court  determined  as a\r\n\nmatter of law  that Toshiba terminated Izen.  In  so finding, the\r\n\ndistrict court stated  that, even if Anderson's letter  of July 8\r\n\nwas motivated by a sincere belief  that Izen had resigned (\"I  am\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nsincerely sorry  that Mark  has decided  to leave  the company\"),\r\n\nDeacon's July  10 letter should  have disabused Anderson  of that\r\n\nnotion  (\"If the  company wishes  to retract  its  termination of\r\n\nMark's employment . . . \").  \r\n\n          The  district court's result would be sound if Deacon's\r\n\nJuly  10  letter  maintained only  that  Izen  had not  resigned.\r\n\nHowever,  that letter appeared  to lay out  conditions for Izen's\r\n\ncontinuing  his employment  with Toshiba.    Specifically, Deacon\r\n\nstated  that Anderson should write  to him by  July 15 if Toshiba\r\n\nwanted \"to  retract its termination  of Mark's employment  and to\r\n\nretract   its  endorsement   of   Mr.  Donahue's   discriminatory\r\n\nmistreatment,\" and  that \"[o]therwise,  I will  have Mark  follow\r\n\nyour instruction to make arrangements with Mr.  Valentine for his\r\n\nfinal check.\"   Given Toshiba's basic position --  that there had\r\n\nbeen no  \"termination\" or  \"discriminatory mistreatment\" of  Izen\r\n\nand that Toshiba's actions in no way constituted an \"endorsement\"\r\n\nof  such  alleged  \"mistreatment\" --  Toshiba  clearly  could not\r\n\nsatisfy Izen's request.  A  jury could reasonably have found that\r\n\nIzen's conditions for his return implied that he had already left\r\n\nthe  company,   whether  through  resignation,   termination,  or\r\n\nconstructive discharge.   For this reason,  we conclude that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred in granting judgment  as a matter of law on\r\n\nthe question of whether Izen was terminated and charging the jury\r\n\nin accordance with that Rule 50(a) determination.  Therefore, the\r\n\njury  verdict and  the judgment  in  Izen's favor  based on  that\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nverdict  cannot be  sustained.   In consequence,  we reverse  and\r\n\nremand for a new trial on Izen's claim of retaliatory discharge.\r\n\n          Toshiba  argues that this court should grant its motion\r\n\nfor  judgment as  a matter  of  law and  find that  Izen  was not\r\n\nconstructively  discharged.  The  district court denied Toshiba's\r\n\nmotion because it  ruled that Izen  was terminated, thus  mooting\r\n\nthe question of whether a reasonable person in his position would\r\n\nfeel compelled  to  resign.   Now  that we  have ruled  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court's Rule 50(a)  determination was erroneous, whether\r\n\nIzen has put forth sufficient  proof of constructive discharge to\r\n\ngo to  the  jury is  once again  a live  question.   However,  we\r\n\ndecline to reach that question because the district court will be\r\n\nable to address it on remand.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt  is reversed and this case remanded for further proceedings\r                    reversed               remanded\r\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n",

A jury awarded Mark Izen both compensatory\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\nand punitive  damages on his  claim of  retaliatory discharge  in\r\n\nthis  diversity case  brought pursuant  to Massachusetts  General\r\n\nLaws, ch.  151B   4.   Toshiba American Consumer  Products, Inc.,\r\n\ndefendant below, appeals this verdict.   Because we find that the\r\n\ndistrict  court, in  granting  Izen's 50(a)  motion,  erroneously\r\n\nfound as a matter of law -- and instructed the jury --  that Izen\r\n\nwas  discharged and did  not resign, we reverse  and remand for a\r\n\nnew trial.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Mark Izen worked for Toshiba managing sales accounts in\r\n\nBoston and reported  to the New  England Regional Manager,  James\r\n\nDonahue.    Izen claims  that,  during  the  time he  worked  for\r\n\nToshiba, Donahue  expressed  antisemitic  bias  which  materially\r\n\naffected  Izen's  working  conditions.   After  receiving  a poor\r\n\nevaluation from Donahue  in April of 1992 --  an evaluation which\r\n\nrecommended that  Izen be demoted  -- Izen consulted  an attorney\r\n\nand  began  pursuing  his  complaint  of  discrimination  through\r\n\nToshiba's internal dispute resolution program.  Izen claims that,\r\n\nshortly  after he brought Donahue's behavior  to the attention of\r\n\nToshiba's management,  Donahue called  Izen into  his office  and\r\n\nyelled at him.   Izen also alleges  that, during May and  June of\r\n\n1992,  Donahue harassed him through phone calls, conferences, and\r\n\nmemoranda and intentionally  did not invite  Izen to a  quarterly\r\n\nsales meeting.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The  Toshiba dispute  resolution program  began  with a\r\n\nhearing in  front of David  Baesler, Donahue's supervisor.   Both\r\n\nDonahue and  Izen  presented  their sides  of  the  conflict  and\r\n\nBaesler  issued a written  decision, in  which he  concluded that\r\n\nIzen  had not been  discriminated against but  that communication\r\n\nbetween Donahue and Izen was poor.  Baesler assured Izen that  he\r\n\nwould intervene  if  future conflicts  arose  and that  he  would\r\n\nmonitor  the  work  relationship  with  Donahue  through  monthly\r\n\nmeetings.   After Baesler's decision issued, Izen  wrote a letter\r\n\nto  Baesler  and  Toshiba's   senior  management  expressing  his\r\n\ndisagreement  with   Baesler's  decision   but  reaffirming   his\r\n\ncommitment to the company.\r\n\n          On  June  17,   1992,  Robert  Valentine,  representing\r\n\nToshiba's personnel  department, and John  Anderson, representing\r\n\nToshiba's legal department, sent a letter  signed by Valentine to\r\n\nIzen informing him that if  he did not appeal Baesler's decision,\r\n\nToshiba would  consider the matter  resolved.  On July  1, Izen's\r\n\nattorney, John  Deacon, responded  with a  letter complaining  of\r\n\nDonahue's  continuing  retaliation,   characterizing  Valentine's\r\n\nletter  as a ratification  of Donahue's retaliatory  actions, and\r\n\nstating that:\r\n\n          As a  result of Mr. Donahue's misconduct, and\r\n          the  company's  refusal to  correct  it, Mark\r\n          Izen's  employment  conditions   have  become\r\n          intolerable  and  constitute  a  constructive\r\n          termination.  All  remedies available by  law\r\n          will be pursued.\r\n\n          On  July 8,  Anderson  responded  to  Deacon's  letter,\r\n\nstating in part:\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          I am sincerely sorry that Mark has decided to\r\n          leave  the company.   I am  also disappointed\r\n          that he has elected not to try to resolve his\r\n          problem within  the Company.   I believe that\r\n          Toshiba's effort  to resolve  the matter  was\r\n          genuine and sincere.\r\n\nAnderson  concluded  his  letter by  informing  Deacon  that Izen\r\n\nshould  get  in   touch  with  Valentine  to   make  arrangements\r\n\nconcerning  his  final  check.    Deacon  responded  on July  10,\r\n\ndisputing   Anderson's   assertion   that   Izen  had   resigned,\r\n\nreasserting  his  claim  that  Toshiba  had   endorsed  Donahue's\r\n\nactions, and further stating that:\r\n\n          If  the   Company  wishes   to  retract   its\r\n          termination  of  Mark's   employment  and  to\r\n          retract  its  endorsement  of  Mr.  Donahue's\r\n          discriminatory  mistreatment,  please contact\r\n          me in writing by July  15.  Otherwise, I will\r\n          have  Mark follow  your  instruction to  make\r\n          arrangements with Mr. Valentine for his final\r\n          check.\r\n\nAnderson wrote Deacon back on July 17, stating that Deacon's last\r\n\nletter made it \"crystal  clear that Mr. Izen claims to  be unable\r\n\nto  do  his  job  under  what  he  perceives  to  be  intolerable\r\n\nconditions\" and affirming  that the separation process  should be\r\n\nconcluded.  Izen was paid through July 22 and left on that date.\r\n\n          Izen then  brought this action,  claiming that  Toshiba\r\n\ndiscriminated against him because of his Jewish religion, origin,\r\n\nand ancestry, and that, when he reported  that violation, Toshiba\r\n\nretaliated and  ultimately discharged  him, all  in violation  of\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 151B   4.1  Izen's claims went before  a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Section 4 provides in relevant part that:\r\n\n          It shall be an unlawful practice:\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\njury and, at the close  of all the evidence, Izen  moved pursuant\r\n\nto Fed. R. Civ.  P. 50(a) for the district court to  find that he\r\n\nwas terminated  and did not  resign.  The district  court granted\r\n\nIzen's motion and, accordingly, instructed  the jury that on  the\r\n\nretaliatory  discharge claim  the  jury  was  to  determine  only\r\n\nwhether Izen was terminated in retaliation  for his complaints of\r\n\ndiscrimination.  The jury was  also instructed on Izen's claim of\r\n\ndiscrimination.\r\n\n          The  jury  found  that Toshiba  had  not  discriminated\r\n\nagainst  Izen  but  that  retaliation was  the  cause  of  Izen's\r\n\ntermination;  based on its  finding of retaliatory  discharge the\r\n\njury  awarded  Izen $36,680  for  economic loss  and  $150,000 in\r\n\npunitive  damages.  Post-trial,  the district court  awarded Izen\r\n\n$120,337  in  attorney's  fees and  denied  Toshiba's  motion for\r\n\njudgment  as  a  matter  of  law  on  the  claim  of  retaliatory\r\n\ndischarge.  \r\n\n          In  this appeal, Toshiba claims that the district court\r\n\nerred in not allowing the  jury to consider whether Izen resigned\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            1)   For  an employer,  by  himself or  his\r\n          agent, because of  the . . .  religious creed\r\n          . .  . of any individual to refuse to hire or\r\n          employ   or  to  bar  or  to  discharge  from\r\n          employment such individual or to discriminate\r\n          against such individual in compensation or in\r\n          terms, conditions or privileges of employment\r\n          . . . . \r\n            . . . .\r\n            4)    For   any  person,  employer,   labor\r\n          organization   or   employment    agency   to\r\n          discharge,  expel  or  otherwise discriminate\r\n          against any person because he has opposed any\r\n          practices  forbidden  under  this  chapter  .\r\n          . . .  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nor was terminated.  Toshiba also claims that:  1) the trial court\r\n\nerred  in limiting  Anderson's  testimony as  to his  motives for\r\n\nwriting  the letters  to Deacon;  and  2) the  award of  punitive\r\n\ndamages and attorneys'  fees was improper.  Because  we find, for\r\n\nthe reasons given in part II  of this opinion, that a jury  could\r\n\nreasonably  have concluded that Izen resigned, and that therefore\r\n\nthe district court  erred in taking that question  from the jury,\r\n\nwe  reverse the judgment  of the district court  and remand for a\r\n\nnew  trial on Izen's claim of retaliatory discharge.  In light of\r\n\nreversal on this  ground, we find it unnecessary to  reach any of\r\n\nthe other errors urged by Toshiba.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Judgment as a matter of law  may be granted only if the\r\n\nevidence viewed from the  perspective most favorable to the  non-\r\n\nmovant is  so one-sided  that the movant  is plainly  entitled to\r\n\njudgment, for  reasonable  minds  could  not  differ  as  to  the\r\n\noutcome.

In  so finding, the\r\n\ndistrict court stated  that, even if Anderson's letter  of July 8\r\n\nwas motivated by a sincere belief  that Izen had resigned (\"I  am\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nsincerely sorry  that Mark  has decided  to leave  the company\"),\r\n\nDeacon's July  10 letter should  have disabused Anderson  of that\r\n\nnotion  (\"If the  company wishes  to retract  its  termination of\r\n\nMark's employment . . . \").  \r\n\n          The  district court's result would be sound if Deacon's\r\n\nJuly  10  letter  maintained only  that  Izen  had not  resigned.\r\n\nHowever,  that letter appeared  to lay out  conditions for Izen's\r\n\ncontinuing  his employment  with Toshiba.    Specifically, Deacon\r\n\nstated  that Anderson should write  to him by  July 15 if Toshiba\r\n\nwanted \"to  retract its termination  of Mark's employment  and to\r\n\nretract   its  endorsement   of   Mr.  Donahue's   discriminatory\r\n\nmistreatment,\" and  that \"[o]therwise,  I will  have Mark  follow\r\n\nyour instruction to make arrangements with Mr.  Valentine for his\r\n\nfinal check.\"   Given Toshiba's basic position --  that there had\r\n\nbeen no  \"termination\" or  \"discriminatory mistreatment\" of  Izen\r\n\nand that Toshiba's actions in no way constituted an \"endorsement\"\r\n\nof  such  alleged  \"mistreatment\" --  Toshiba  clearly  could not\r\n\nsatisfy Izen's request.  A  jury could reasonably have found that\r\n\nIzen's conditions for his return implied that he had already left\r\n\nthe  company,   whether  through  resignation,   termination,  or\r\n\nconstructive discharge.   For this reason,  we conclude that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred in granting judgment  as a matter of law on\r\n\nthe question of whether Izen was terminated and charging the jury\r\n\nin accordance with that Rule 50(a) determination.  Therefore, the\r\n\njury  verdict and  the judgment  in  Izen's favor  based on  that\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nverdict  cannot be  sustained.   In consequence,  we reverse  and\r\n\nremand for a new trial on Izen's claim of retaliatory discharge.\r\n\n          Toshiba  argues that this court should grant its motion\r\n\nfor  judgment as  a matter  of  law and  find that  Izen  was not\r\n\nconstructively  discharged.  The  district court denied Toshiba's\r\n\nmotion because it  ruled that Izen  was terminated, thus  mooting\r\n\nthe question of whether a reasonable person in his position would\r\n\nfeel compelled  to  resign.   Now  that we  have ruled  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court's Rule 50(a)  determination was erroneous, whether\r\n\nIzen has put forth sufficient  proof of constructive discharge to\r\n\ngo to  the  jury is  once again  a live  question.   However,  we\r\n\ndecline to reach that question because the district court will be\r\n\nable to address it on remand.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt  is reversed and this case remanded for further proceedings\r                    reversed               remanded\r\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n</pre>",
