Defendant-appellant  Ramberto\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nHern ndez was  convicted of  (1) conspiring  with five  other co-\r\n\ndefendants  to possess with the intent to distribute in excess of\r\n\nfive  kilograms of cocaine in  violation of 21  U.S.C.   846; and\r\n\n(2)  along with  three other  co-defendants, aiding  and abetting\r\n\neach  other in  knowingly and intentionally  distributing twenty-\r\n\nnine  kilograms of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1)\r\n\nand   841(b)(1)(B)  and  18  U.S.C.     2.    Hern ndez  appeals,\r\n\nchallenging the sufficiency of the evidence and claiming that his\r\n\nSixth  Amendment rights to confrontation and to a fair trial were\r\n\ndenied because the government was  permitted to convict him based\r\n\non the  uncorroborated testimony  of a single  unindicted alleged\r\n\ncoconspirator, William Negr n-Zapata  (\"Negr n-Zapata\"), who  was\r\n\nawaiting sentencing in another case.  We affirm.\r\n\n          At  trial  Negr n-Zapata  testified  as  follows.    He\r\n\nreceived   a  call   from  Willie   Maya-Acosta  (\"Maya-Acosta\"),\r\n\ninquiring whether Negr n-Zapata knew  of any kilograms of cocaine\r\n\navailable for  purchase.  Negr n-Zapata, in  turn, contacted Jos \r\n\nLuis V lez-Carrero (\"V lez-Carrero\").  On October 27, 1991, Maya-\r\n\nAcosta  delivered $290,000  to  Negr n-Zapata.   Later that  day,\r\n\nV lez-Carrero and  Negr n-Zapata went to  a fish market  owned by\r\n\nappellant  Hern ndez  and   delivered  $261,000  to   Hern ndez.1\r\n\nHern ndez gave them twenty-nine  kilograms of cocaine.  Hern ndez\r\n\nwas acting as an intermediary in exchange for a commission.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Of the original $290,000, $29,000 was divided between Negr n-\r\nZapata and V lez-Carrero as a commission.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n                 I.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                           I.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\n\n          Hern ndez'  first claim  challenges the  sufficiency of\r\n\nthe evidence.  In reviewing such claims, we  view the evidence in\r\n\nthe light most favorable  to the prosecution and ask  whether any\r\n\nrational factfinder  could have  found guilt beyond  a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.  See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                         \r\n\n          It is well established  that an accomplice is qualified\r\n\nto  testify  as long  as  any agreements  he  has  made with  the\r\n\ngovernment are presented to the jury and the \"judge gave complete\r\n\nand  correct instructions  detailing  the special  care the  jury\r\n\nshould take in assessing the testimony.\"  United States v. Ortiz-\r                                                                           \r\n\nArrigoit a,  996 F.2d  436, 438-39  (1st Cir.  1993).   Indeed, a\r                    \r\n\nconviction based  solely upon the uncorroborated  testimony of an\r\n\naccomplice  can  be  upheld, as  long  as  the  jury is  properly\r\n\ninstructed and the  testimony is  not incredible as  a matter  of\r\n\nlaw.   See United States  v. And jar,  49 F.3d 16,  21 (1st  Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1995).  As  always, the credibility of a witness  is a matter for\r\n\nthe jury.  See Ortiz-Arrigoit a, 996 F.2d at 439.\r                                         \r\n\n          The government's  case relied  on the testimony  of its\r\n\nonly witness, Negr n-Zapata.  Negr n-Zapata testified that he was\r\n\na long-time  drug dealer,  had already  been convicted twice  for\r\n\ndrug trafficking, had one sentence  reduced from sixty months  to\r\n\ntwenty-four months  because of his willingness to testify for the\r\n\ngovernment, and was still  awaiting sentencing in a drug  case in\r\n\nwhich he  had been convicted over  two and a half  years prior to\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nhis testimony in the instant case.  Negr n-Zapata cooperated with\r\n\nthe  prosecution  in  exchange  for more  lenient  treatment  and\r\n\ncertification of his cooperation  to a judge who was  to sentence\r\n\nhim  after the  Hern ndez trial.   He  was eventually  given time\r\n\nserved in the case for which his sentence was pending.\r\n\n          Although   these   circumstances  raise   questions  of\r\n\ncredibility  regarding Negr n-Zapata's testimony, this court does\r\n\nnot engage in a  plenary review of the credibility  of witnesses.\r\n\nA rational  juror could have believed  Negr n-Zapata's version of\r\n\nevents.  Negr n-Zapata testified in considerable detail regarding\r\n\nthe crime and  Hern ndez' role in it.   Viewing the testimony  in\r\n\nthe  light most  favorable to  the verdict,  the jury  could have\r\n\nconcluded that the testimony established that Hern ndez joined in\r\n\nthe conspiracy,  and possessed and distributed  cocaine.  Negr n-\r\n\nZapata was cross-examined in  detail regarding both his testimony\r\n\nand  his credibility.   Finally,  appellant fails  to demonstrate\r\n\nthat there existed  overwhelming evidence to contradict  Negr n's\r\n\ntestimony.   For all of these reasons, we deny the sufficiency of\r\n\nthe evidence claim.\r\n\n                  II.  The Confrontation Clause\r                            II.  The Confrontation Clause\r\n\n          Hern ndez  claims  that  his Sixth  Amendment  right to\r\n\ncross-examine Negr n-Zapata was denied.  The    Sixth   Amendment\r\n\nstates  that \"[i]n  all criminal  proceedings, the  accused shall\r\n\nenjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against\r\n\nhim.\"  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  The Sixth Amendment guarantees the\r\n\naccused the right to cross-examine government witnesses fully and\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nfairly.   See  Delaware  v. Van  Arsdale,  475 U.S.  673,  678-79\r                                                  \r\n\n(1985);  United States  v. Rivera-Santiago,  872 F.2d  1073, 1084\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).  \r\n\n          It  is well established  that \"the Confrontation Clause\r\n\nguarantees  an opportunity  for effective  cross-examination, not\r                                    \r\n\ncross-examination  that  is effective  in  whatever  way, and  to\r\n\nwhatever extent, the defense might wish.\"  Delaware v. Fensterer,\r                                                                          \r\n\n474 U.S. 15, 20 (1985).  \"[T]he Confrontation Clause is generally\r\n\nsatisfied  when the defense is given full and fair opportunity to\r\n\nprobe  and  expose these  infirmities  through cross-examination,\r\n\nthereby calling  to the attention  of the factfinder  the reasons\r\n\nfor giving scant  weight to the witness' testimony.\"   Id. at 22.\r                                                                    \r\n\nFurthermore,  once  the defendant  is  given  the opportunity  to\r\n\ncross-examine   government  witnesses,   the  extent   of  cross-\r\n\nexamination is within the sound discretion of the trial court and\r\n\nwe review only for abuse of discretion.  See Rivera-Santiago, 872\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 1085.\r\n\n          In  the instant  case, there  can be  no question  that\r\n\nHern ndez  was permitted  a full and  fair opportunity  to cross-\r\n\nexamine the witness.  Indeed, the defendant fails to identify any\r                                                                           \r\n\ncircumscription  imposed  on  his  cross-examination  of  Negr n-\r\n\nZapata, much less a  restriction that would rise to the  level of\r\n\nan abuse of discretion.2  The defense argues that \"[t]he jury was\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   We add that defense  counsel did not raise  the confrontation\r\nissue  at trial.   Arguments raised for the  first time on appeal\r\nare forfeited and reversible only upon a demonstration  of \"plain\r\nerror.\"   United States v.  Sullivan, 98 F.3d  686, 687 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n1996).  \"The  plain error  doctrine of Federal  Rule of  Criminal\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nallowed to  hear Negr n-Zapata's testimony unaware  that he would\r\n\nbe  rewarded with  a sentence  of time  served because  of, among\r\n\nother things, his testimony in  this case.  As a result,  defense\r\n\ncounsel  were denied  a 'full  and fair'  opportunity  to impeach\r\n\nNegr n-Zapata   by  showing   his   motivation  to   please   the\r\n\ngovernment.\"  Appellant's Brief at 11.\r\n\n          In fact,  the defense  was afforded the  opportunity to\r\n\ncross-examine Negr n-Zapata  on every  aspect of  his cooperation\r\n\nagreement  with the  government.   On cross-examination,  Negr n-\r\n\nZapata admitted that  he had been  awaiting sentence for  twenty-\r\n\nnine  months and  that he  had a  cooperation agreement  with the\r\n\ngovernment.  He testified that, in exchange for  his cooperation,\r\n\nthe  government would recommend a reduced sentence in the case in\r\n\nwhich he  was  awaiting sentencing.   In  addition, the  district\r\n\ncourt  judge read  portions of  the Sentencing Guidelines  to the\r\n\njury  to  make it  clear that  Negr n-Zapata's sentence  could be\r\n\nreduced  below the minimum mandatory sentence in exchange for his\r\n\ncooperation.\r\n\n          Hern ndez argues that the defense could have  impeached\r\n\nNegr n-Zapata's testimony more successfully  if it had known that\r\n\nhe would be  credited for time served and released.  Whether true\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nProcedure  52(b) tempers the blow  of a rigid  application of the\r\ncontemporaneous-objection  requirement.  The  Rule authorizes the\r\nCourts   of  Appeals  to  correct  only  'particularly  egregious\r\nerrors,'  those  errors  that  'seriously  affect  the  fairness,\r\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"  United\r                                                                           \r\nStates v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985) (citations omitted).  Even\r                         \r\nif  we  were to  conclude  that there  had  been  a violation  of\r\nHern ndez' right  to cross-examination, appellant  would have  to\r\ndemonstrate plain error in order to win a reversal.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nor not, this contention does not lead to the conclusion that  the\r\n\nright  to  cross-examine was  compromised.   At  the time  of the\r\n\ntestimony,  Negr n-Zapata  had  no  assurance that  he  would  be\r\n\ncredited for  time served  and released.    He only  knew, as  he\r\n\ntestified,  that  his  cooperation  would  be  certified  to  the\r\n\nsentencing judge.  In  other words, the defense was  permitted to\r\n\npresent to the jury the conditions  under which Negr n-Zapata was\r\n\ntestifying.    The jury  was fully  informed  and able  to assess\r\n\nNegr n-Zapata's credibility.   We  conclude, therefore,  that the\r\n\ndefense was granted a full and fair opportunity to  cross-examine\r\n\nNegr n-Zapata.\r\n\n          Finally, we note that  appellant's appeal to Rule 32(a)\r\n\nof  the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,3 the Local Rules for\r\n\nthe  District  of Puerto  Rico,  and  Sixth Amendment  guarantees\r\n\nregarding  speedy sentencing  belong  to  the defendant  awaiting\r\n\nsentencing, in this case Negr n-Zapata.  Violation of these rules\r\n\ndoes not give Hern ndez grounds for a reversal of his conviction.\r\n\n                     III.  Jury Instructions\r                               III.  Jury Instructions\r\n\n          Finally,  Hern ndez objects  to the  jury instructions.\r\n\nThe relevant portion of the instructions is as follows:\r\n\n               You   have    also   heard   testimony\r\n            regarding   the   Government's   witness'\r\n            reputation    in   the    community   for\r\n            truthfulness   or  untruthfulness.     In\r\n            deciding this case,  you should  consider\r\n            that  evidence together  with and  in the\r\n            same manner as all the  other evidence in\r\n            the case.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  32(a)  requires  that\r\nsentencing should take place without \"undue delay.\"\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n               You  have also heard testimony from an\r\n            unindicted   co-conspirator  who   has  a\r\n            cooperation     agreement    with     the\r\n            Government.   That testimony was given in\r\n            exchange for a  promise by the Government\r\n            that  the witness will  not be prosecuted\r\n            for   some   crimes  he   has  admittedly\r\n            committed,  including  the  ones in  this\r\n            case.   The Government  will also certify\r\n            his cooperation to another judge who will\r\n            sentence  him  in  another  case  in  the\r\n            future.\r\n\n               In  evaluating   this  testimony,  you\r\n            should  consider  whether that  testimony\r\n            may   have   been   influenced   by   the\r\n            Government's   promise  and   you  should\r\n            consider  that   testimony  with  greater\r\n            caution than that of an ordinary witness.\r\n            Such agreements are legal.

The judge  accurately summed\r\n\nup the  conditions under which Negr n-Zapata  testified and added\r\n\nthat jurors should  \"consider whether the testimony may have been\r\n\ninfluenced by  the government's  promise and you  should consider\r\n\nthe  testimony with  greater  caution than  that  of an  ordinary\r\n\nwitness.\"   Tr. IV, at 896.   Because the jury  was informed that\r\n\nNegr n-Zapata's testimony  should be  viewed with caution,  we do\r\n\nnot believe there was error in the instructions and certainly not\r\n\n\"plain error.\"4\r\n\n          Although  appellant's claims cannot  justify a reversal\r\n\nin this case,  we add  that we find  troubling certain  practices\r\n\nbrought  to light in this case.   In particular, we are concerned\r\n\nwith the practice of incarcerating an individual  for an extended\r\n\nperiod of  time without sentencing,  while holding out  a promise\r\n\nthat his or her cooperation will lead to a more lenient sentence.\r\n\nAt  least two aspects of  this practice are  problematic.  First,\r\n\nalthough  the   government's  offer  may  be   attractive  to  an\r\n\nindividual  defendant, we do not believe that the right to prompt\r\n\nsentencing exists merely as a bargaining chip for defendants.  It\r\n\nis inappropriate to hold  a defendant in prison for  long periods\r\n\nof time pending  sentencing, in this case  two and a half  years,\r\n\nwhile the government tries to extract information from him.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  We add that Hern ndez not only fails to point to error  in the\r\ninstructions, but  concedes that they  were \"perhaps  technically\r\ncorrect.\"  Appellant's Brief at 12.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          The second problem is  that this practice increases the\r\n\nlikelihood  that  innocent  individuals  will  be  implicated  by\r\n\ndefendants trying to placate the government.  This is obviously a\r\n\nconcern whenever  a defendant  cooperates with the  government in\r\n\nexchange  for lenience,  but  we  feel  that  as  the  period  of\r\n\nincarceration  increases  unduly, the  risk  of false  statements\r\n\nintended to appease the defendant's captors becomes too great.\r\n\n          Although  this is not the case for corrective action by\r\n\nthis  court, suffice  it to  say that  we caution  the government\r\n\nagainst  abuse  of  this practice  and  that  we  will view  with\r\n\nsuspicion its continued use.   Nothing in this opinion  should be\r\n\ntaken to support such conduct.\r\n\n                         IV.  Conclusion\r                                   IV.

Hernandez appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and claiming that his Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation and to a fair trial were denied because the government was permitted to convict him based on the uncorroborated testimony of a single unindicted alleged coconspirator, William Negrn-Zapata (\"Negrn-Zapata\"), who was awaiting sentencing in another case.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Negrn-Zapata testified as follows.  He received a call from Willie Maya-Acosta (\"Maya-Acosta\"), inquiring whether Negrn-Zapata knew of any kilograms of cocaine available for purchase.  Negrn-Zapata, in turn, contacted Jose Luis VelezCarrero (\"Velez-Carrero\").  On October 27, 1991, Maya-Acosta delivered $290,000 to Negrn-Zapata.  Later that day, Velez-Carrero and Negrn-Zapata went to a fish market owned by appellant Hernandez and delivered $261,000 to Hernandez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Hernandez gave them twenty-nine kilograms of cocaine.  Hernandez was acting as an intermediary in exchange for a commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez' first claim challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.  In reviewing such claims, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and ask whether any rational factfinder could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979);  United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that an accomplice is qualified to testify as long as any agreements he has made with the government are presented to the jury and the \"judge gave complete and correct instructions detailing the special care the jury should take in assessing the testimony.\"  United States v. Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d 436, 438-39 (1st Cir.1993).  Indeed, a conviction based solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice can be upheld, as long as the jury is properly instructed and the testimony is not incredible as a matter of law.  See United States v. Andjar, 49 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.1995).  As always, the credibility of a witness is a matter for the jury.  See Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d at 439.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case relied on the testimony of its only witness, Negrn-Zapata.  Negrn-Zapata testified that he was a long-time drug dealer, had already been convicted twice for drug trafficking, had one sentence reduced from sixty months to twenty-four months because of his willingness to testify for the government, and was still awaiting sentencing in a drug case in which he had been convicted over two and a half years prior to his testimony in the instant case.  Negrn-Zapata cooperated with the prosecution in exchange for more lenient treatment and certification of his cooperation to a judge who was to sentence him after the Hernandez trial.  He was eventually given time served in the case for which his sentence was pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these circumstances raise questions of credibility regarding Negrn-Zapata's testimony, this court does not engage in a plenary review of the credibility of witnesses.  A rational juror could have believed Negrn-Zapata's version of events.  Negrn-Zapata testified in considerable detail regarding the crime and Hernandez' role in it.  Viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the verdict, the jury could have concluded that the testimony established that Hernandez joined in the conspiracy, and possessed and distributed cocaine.  Negrn-Zapata was cross-examined in detail regarding both his testimony and his credibility.  Finally, appellant fails to demonstrate that there existed overwhelming evidence to contradict Negrn's testimony.  For all of these reasons, we deny the sufficiency of the evidence claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Confrontation Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez claims that his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Negrn-Zapata was denied.  The Sixth Amendment states that \"[i]n all criminal proceedings, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\"  U.S. Const. amend.  VI. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused the right to cross-examine government witnesses fully and fairly.  See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678-79, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1434-35, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986);  United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1084 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that \"the Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\"  Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 294, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985).  \"[T]he Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given full and fair opportunity to probe and expose these infirmities through cross-examination, thereby calling to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness' testimony.\"  Id. at 22, 106 S.Ct. at 295.   Furthermore, once the defendant is given the opportunity to cross-examine government witnesses, the extent of cross-examination is within the sound discretion of the trial court and we review only for abuse of discretion.  See Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d at 1085.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there can be no question that Hernandez was permitted a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine the witness.  Indeed, the defendant fails to identify any circumscription imposed on his cross-examination of Negrn-Zapata, much less a restriction that would rise to the level of an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The defense argues that \"[t]he jury was allowed to hear Negrn-Zapata's testimony unaware that he would be rewarded with a sentence of time served because of, among other things, his testimony in this case.  As a result, defense counsel were denied a 'full and fair' opportunity to impeach Negrn-Zapata by showing his motivation to please the government.\"   Appellant's Brief at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the defense was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine Negrn-Zapata on every aspect of his cooperation agreement with the government.  On cross-examination, Negrn-Zapata admitted that he had been awaiting sentence for twenty-nine months and that he had a cooperation agreement with the government.  He testified that, in exchange for his cooperation, the government would recommend a reduced sentence in the case in which he was awaiting sentencing.  In addition, the district court judge read portions of the Sentencing Guidelines to the jury to make it clear that Negrn-Zapata's sentence could be reduced below the minimum mandatory sentence in exchange for his cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that the defense could have impeached Negrn-Zapata's testimony more successfully if it had known that he would be credited for time served and released.  Whether true or not, this contention does not lead to the conclusion that the right to cross-examine was compromised.  At the time of the testimony, Negrn-Zapata had no assurance that he would be credited for time served and released.  He only knew, as he testified, that his cooperation would be certified to the sentencing judge.  In other words, the defense was permitted to present to the jury the conditions under which Negrn-Zapata was testifying.  The jury was fully informed and able to assess Negrn-Zapata's credibility.  We conclude, therefore, that the defense was granted a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Negrn-Zapata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that appellant's appeal to Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the Local Rules for the District of Puerto Rico, and Sixth Amendment guarantees regarding speedy sentencing belong to the defendant awaiting sentencing, in this case Negrn-Zapata.  Violation of these rules does not give Hernandez grounds for a reversal of his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hernandez objects to the jury instructions.  The relevant portion of the instructions is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have also heard testimony regarding the Government's witness' reputation in the community for truthfulness or untruthfulness.  In deciding this case, you should consider that evidence together with and in the same manner as all the other evidence in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have also heard testimony from an unindicted co-conspirator who has a cooperation agreement with the Government.  That testimony was given in exchange for a promise by the Government that the witness will not be prosecuted for some crimes he has admittedly committed, including the ones in this case.  The Government will also certify his cooperation to another judge who will sentence him in another case in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating this testimony, you should consider whether that testimony may have been influenced by the Government's promise and you should consider that testimony with greater caution than that of an ordinary witness.  Such agreements are legal.  The only--the law only requires that you consider testimony given under those circumstances with greater caution than that of an ordinary witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript, vol.  VI, at 896.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entirety of appellant's argument with respect to the jury instructions is to quote the last two paragraphs of the above excerpt and to state that \"the trial judge, in giving the legally required instruction to the jury on the care with which it must consider the testimony of an accomplice, minimized the importance of the charge by adding the word 'only.' \"   Appellant's Brief at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant failed to object to the jury instructions at trial, we review only for plain error.  See Sullivan, 98 F.3d at 687.  \"Our principal focus in reviewing jury instructions is to determine whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.\"   See Service Merchandise Co. v. Boyd Corp., 722 F.2d 945, 950 (1st Cir.1983).  We do not believe that the instructions provided by the trial judge confused or misled the jury.  The judge accurately summed up the conditions under which Negrn-Zapata testified and added that jurors should \"consider whether the testimony may have been influenced by the government's promise and you should consider the testimony with greater caution than that of an ordinary witness.\"   Tr. IV, at 896.  Because the jury was informed that Negrn-Zapata's testimony should be viewed with caution, we do not believe there was error in the instructions and certainly not \"plain error.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant's claims cannot justify a reversal in this case, we add that we find troubling certain practices brought to light in this case.  In particular, we are concerned with the practice of incarcerating an individual for an extended period of time without sentencing, while holding out a promise that his or her cooperation will lead to a more lenient sentence.  At least two aspects of this practice are problematic.  First, although the government's offer may be attractive to an individual defendant, we do not believe that the right to prompt sentencing exists merely as a bargaining chip for defendants.  It is inappropriate to hold a defendant in prison for long periods of time pending sentencing, in this case two and a half years, while the government tries to extract information from him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second problem is that this practice increases the likelihood that innocent individuals will be implicated by defendants trying to placate the government.  This is obviously a concern whenever a defendant cooperates with the government in exchange for lenience, but we feel that as the period of incarceration increases unduly, the risk of false statements intended to appease the defendant's captors becomes too great.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is not the case for corrective action by this court, suffice it to say that we caution the government against abuse of this practice and that we will view with suspicion its continued use.  Nothing in this opinion should be taken to support such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, appellant's conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Of the original $290,000, $29,000 was divided between NegrnZapata and Velez-Carrero as a commission</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We add that defense counsel did not raise the confrontation issue at trial.

Hernandez was acting as an intermediary in exchange for a commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez' first claim challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.  In reviewing such claims, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and ask whether any rational factfinder could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Jackson v. Virginia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ortiz-Arrigoita, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609732\"><a href=\"/opinion/609732/united-states-v-luis-e-ortiz-arrigoitia-aka-colibri-united-states-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 438-39 (1st Cir.1993).  Indeed, a conviction based solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice can be upheld, as long as the jury is properly instructed and the testimony is not incredible as a matter of law.  See United States v. Andjar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1995).  As always, the credibility of a witness is a matter for the jury.  See Ortiz-Arrigoita, 996 F.2d at 439.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case relied on the testimony of its only witness, Negrn-Zapata.  Negrn-Zapata testified that he was a long-time drug dealer, had already been convicted twice for drug trafficking, had one sentence reduced from sixty months to twenty-four months because of his willingness to testify for the government, and was still awaiting sentencing in a drug case in which he had been convicted over two and a half years prior to his testimony in the instant case.  Negrn-Zapata cooperated with the prosecution in exchange for more lenient treatment and certification of his cooperation to a judge who was to sentence him after the Hernandez trial.  He was eventually given time served in the case for which his sentence was pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these circumstances raise questions of credibility regarding Negrn-Zapata's testimony, this court does not engage in a plenary review of the credibility of witnesses.  A rational juror could have believed Negrn-Zapata's version of events.  Negrn-Zapata testified in considerable detail regarding the crime and Hernandez' role in it.  Viewing the testimony in the light most favorable to the verdict, the jury could have concluded that the testimony established that Hernandez joined in the conspiracy, and possessed and distributed cocaine.  Negrn-Zapata was cross-examined in detail regarding both his testimony and his credibility.  Finally, appellant fails to demonstrate that there existed overwhelming evidence to contradict Negrn's testimony.  For all of these reasons, we deny the sufficiency of the evidence claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Confrontation Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez claims that his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Negrn-Zapata was denied.  The Sixth Amendment states that \"[i]n all criminal proceedings, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\"  U.S. Const. amend.  VI. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused the right to cross-examine government witnesses fully and fairly.  See Delaware v.

Furthermore, once the defendant is given the opportunity to cross-examine government witnesses, the extent of cross-examination is within the sound discretion of the trial court and we review only for abuse of discretion.  See Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d at 1085.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there can be no question that Hernandez was permitted a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine the witness.  Indeed, the defendant fails to identify any circumscription imposed on his cross-examination of Negrn-Zapata, much less a restriction that would rise to the level of an abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The defense argues that \"[t]he jury was allowed to hear Negrn-Zapata's testimony unaware that he would be rewarded with a sentence of time served because of, among other things, his testimony in this case.  As a result, defense counsel were denied a 'full and fair' opportunity to impeach Negrn-Zapata by showing his motivation to please the government.\"   Appellant's Brief at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the defense was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine Negrn-Zapata on every aspect of his cooperation agreement with the government.  On cross-examination, Negrn-Zapata admitted that he had been awaiting sentence for twenty-nine months and that he had a cooperation agreement with the government.  He testified that, in exchange for his cooperation, the government would recommend a reduced sentence in the case in which he was awaiting sentencing.  In addition, the district court judge read portions of the Sentencing Guidelines to the jury to make it clear that Negrn-Zapata's sentence could be reduced below the minimum mandatory sentence in exchange for his cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that the defense could have impeached Negrn-Zapata's testimony more successfully if it had known that he would be credited for time served and released.  Whether true or not, this contention does not lead to the conclusion that the right to cross-examine was compromised.  At the time of the testimony, Negrn-Zapata had no assurance that he would be credited for time served and released.  He only knew, as he testified, that his cooperation would be certified to the sentencing judge.  In other words, the defense was permitted to present to the jury the conditions under which Negrn-Zapata was testifying.  The jury was fully informed and able to assess Negrn-Zapata's credibility.  We conclude, therefore, that the defense was granted a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine Negrn-Zapata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that appellant's appeal to Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the Local Rules for the District of Puerto Rico, and Sixth Amendment guarantees regarding speedy sentencing belong to the defendant awaiting sentencing, in this case Negrn-Zapata.  Violation of these rules does not give Hernandez grounds for a reversal of his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hernandez objects to the jury instructions.  The relevant portion of the instructions is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have also heard testimony regarding the Government's witness' reputation in the community for truthfulness or untruthfulness.  In deciding this case, you should consider that evidence together with and in the same manner as all the other evidence in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have also heard testimony from an unindicted co-conspirator who has a cooperation agreement with the Government.  That testimony was given in exchange for a promise by the Government that the witness will not be prosecuted for some crimes he has admittedly committed, including the ones in this case.  The Government will also certify his cooperation to another judge who will sentence him in another case in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating this testimony, you should consider whether that testimony may have been influenced by the Government's promise and you should consider that testimony with greater caution than that of an ordinary witness.  Such agreements are legal.  The only--the law only requires that you consider testimony given under those circumstances with greater caution than that of an ordinary witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial Transcript, vol.  VI, at 896.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entirety of appellant's argument with respect to the jury instructions is to quote the last two paragraphs of the above excerpt and to state that \"the trial judge, in giving the legally required instruction to the jury on the care with which it must consider the testimony of an accomplice, minimized the importance of the charge by adding the word 'only.' \"   Appellant's Brief at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant failed to object to the jury instructions at trial, we review only for plain error.  See Sullivan, 98 F.3d at 687.  \"Our principal focus in reviewing jury instructions is to determine whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.\"   See Service Merchandise Co. v. Boyd Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428314\"><a href=\"/opinion/428314/service-merchandise-company-inc-v-the-boyd-corporation-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span>, 950 (1st Cir.1983).  We do not believe that the instructions provided by the trial judge confused or misled the jury.  The judge accurately summed up the conditions under which Negrn-Zapata testified and added that jurors should \"consider whether the testimony may have been influenced by the government's promise and you should consider the testimony with greater caution than that of an ordinary witness.\"   Tr. IV, at 896.  Because the jury was informed that Negrn-Zapata's testimony should be viewed with caution, we do not believe there was error in the instructions and certainly not \"plain error.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant's claims cannot justify a reversal in this case, we add that we find troubling certain practices brought to light in this case.  In particular, we are concerned with the practice of incarcerating an individual for an extended period of time without sentencing, while holding out a promise that his or her cooperation will lead to a more lenient sentence.  At least two aspects of this practice are problematic.  First, although the government's offer may be attractive to an individual defendant, we do not believe that the right to prompt sentencing exists merely as a bargaining chip for defendants.  It is inappropriate to hold a defendant in prison for long periods of time pending sentencing, in this case two and a half years, while the government tries to extract information from him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second problem is that this practice increases the likelihood that innocent individuals will be implicated by defendants trying to placate the government.  This is obviously a concern whenever a defendant cooperates with the government in exchange for lenience, but we feel that as the period of incarceration increases unduly, the risk of false statements intended to appease the defendant's captors becomes too great.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is not the case for corrective action by this court, suffice it to say that we caution the government against abuse of this practice and that we will view with suspicion its continued use.  Nothing in this opinion should be taken to support such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, appellant's conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Of the original $290,000, $29,000 was divided between NegrnZapata and Velez-Carrero as a commission</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We add that defense counsel did not raise the confrontation issue at trial.
