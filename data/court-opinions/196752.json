The  district court  granted NET's motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment on  Hodgkins' claims, which include  breach of contract,\r\n\nquantum  meruit,  equitable  estoppel,  unjust   enrichment,  and\r\n\nnegligent  misrepresentation.

According to an\r\n\nIAW  program handbook that NET  supplied to its employees, \"[a]ll\r\n\ntangible  ideas which were awarded  an initial award  will be re-\r\n\nevaluated one year from  the date of implementation to  determine\r\n\nthe actual savings or profits.\"\r\n\n          William Hodgkins, Jr. was employed by NET in Maine from\r\n\n1956 until February 1992.   Hodgkins produced an idea  that would\r\n\nreduce  the  cost  of  changing  telephone  service  for  certain\r\n\nmultisubscribers  such  as dormitories  and  nursing  homes.   On\r\n\nApril 20,  1989, Hodgkins submitted his idea  to the IAW program.\r\n\nHodgkins conducted his own study, and based on his own managerial\r\n\nexpertise, concluded that the idea would save NET money, and that\r\n\ntherefore NET would implement the idea, evaluate it under the IAW\r\n\nprogram,  and  grant  him fifteen  percent  of  the first  year's\r\n\nsavings.   Based  on his  own knowledge  of NET's  operations and\r\n\ncosts, Hodgkins expected that he  would receive the maximum under\r\n\nthe IAW program, $50,000.\r\n\n          Hodgkins  submitted  his idea  to  the  IAW program  by\r\n\nsigning  a submission  form in  which he  agreed to abide  by the\r\n\nrules of the program as laid out  on the reverse side of the form\r\n\nand in a NET document called General Administrative Procedure No.\r\n\n53 (\"GAP 53\").   Both the back of the submission  form and GAP 53\r\n\nspecified that NET had the\r\n\n            sole, exclusive,  and complete discretion\r\n            and right to determine the terms, policy,\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n            structure,  operation  and administration\r\n            of the Program, including the right:  . .\r\n            . . \r\n            e)   To   determine   the    method   for\r\n            calculating the amount of any award.    \r\n\n            f)  To determine the  amount of any award\r\n            granted.\r\n\n            g)  To determine  the person  entitled to\r\n            receive any award.\r\n\n            h) To  determine the  extent, if any,  of\r\n            the  application, implementation,  or use\r\n            of an idea.\r\n\nThe  same documents also provided  that \"[t]he   decisions of the\r\n\nCompany  concerning  the terms,  policy, structure,  operation or\r\n\nadministration of the  Program are within the  sole and exclusive\r\n\ndiscretion   of  the   Company  and   are  final,   binding,  and\r\n\nconclusive.\"\r\n\n          In August  1990, NET's initial evaluation reported that\r\n\nHodgkins' suggestion was \"an  excellent idea to move the  company\r\n\nforward in its goal of automated  provisioning.\"  As a result, he\r\n\nreceived the maximum  Initial Award of $5,000 in  September 1990.\r\n\nIn January 1991, NET announced in its weekly in-house publication\r\n\nthat Hodgkins' idea had been adopted  and that it \"earned for its\r\n\nsuggester  a  Tangible  Award  of 15  percent  of  its  estimated\r\n\nsavings.\"   NET implemented Hodgkins' idea in July 1991, and thus\r\n\nno determination of  the first-year savings  for a Special  Merit\r\n\nAward could be made until after July 1992.            \r\n\n          Expecting to  receive the  maximum award for  his idea,\r\n\nHodgkins retired from NET in February 1992, earlier than he would\r\n\nhave retired had he  not expected the award.   In September 1992,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nNET manager Philip DuBois informed Hodgkins by telephone that NET\r\n\nhad  awarded him  $17,500 for  his idea.1   Hodgkins  told DuBois\r\n\nthat  the amount of the award was too  low.  DuBois then sent the\r\n\nevaluation  form  back   to  the  IAW  program  manager  for  re-\r\n\nevaluation.\r\n\n          In August 1993, NET informed Hodgkins that he would not\r\n\nreceive a Special Merit Award.   According to NET's re-evaluation\r\n\nreport,  NET could  not quantify  savings associated  exclusively\r\n\nwith Hodgkins'  idea because  other innovations had  produced the\r\n\nsame results as Hodgkins' idea.  Hodgkins appealed this decision,\r\n\nand a  second re-evaluation was  performed, which arrived  at the\r\n\nsame  conclusion.   NET's evaluation  reports indicated  that the\r\n\ntask of  measuring savings  had been  rendered impossible by  the\r\n\ndestruction of cost records, given the passage of time.\r\n\n          As  a result,  NET has  not awarded Hodgkins  any money\r\n\nbeyond  the  $5,000  Initial Award.    Because  Hodgkins did  not\r\n\nreceive the  total amount  he expected, his  financial plans  for\r\n\nretirement have  been disturbed, causing him  to draw prematurely\r\n\non certain investments and incur early withdrawal penalties.   On\r\n\ntheories  of   breach  of   contract,   quantum  meruit,   unjust\r\n\nenrichment, equitable estoppel  and negligent  misrepresentation,\r\n\nHodgkins brought suit in  district court seeking damages incurred\r\n\nin reliance on statements made by NET, as well as the  additional\r\n\n$45,000  of award money he expected, plus money for income taxes,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  NET contests this assertion.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nwhich NET had agreed to pay on any IAW program award amount.  The\r\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment on all counts.\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review a district  court's grant of summary judgment\r\n\nde novo,  viewing the facts  in the light  most favorable  to the\r                 \r\n\nnonmovant,  Hodgkins.

Summary  judgment is  appropriate when,  based upon  the\r\n\npleadings,  affidavits,  and depositions,  \"there  is  no genuine\r\n\nissue as to  any material fact, and  [where] the moving party  is\r\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.

Hodgkins also  advances\r\n\nclaims  under  theories  of  equitable  estoppel  and  promissory\r\n\nestoppel.   Finally, Hodgkins  claims that the  evidence requires\r\n\nthat a factfinder  decide whether NET  negligently misrepresented\r\n\nto Hodgkins that he was entitled to additional compensation.\r\n\n                      I.  Breach of Contract\r                                I.  Breach of Contract\r\n\n          The district court decided  that the IAW program formed\r\n\npart  of Hodgkins' contract of employment with NET.  The district\r\n\ncourt  also  found that  the provision  of  the IAW  program that\r\n\nstates  that \"[a]ll  ideas  which result  in  Initial Awards  for\r\n\ntangible ideas  shall receive  consideration for a  Special Merit\r\n\nAward\" was  \"clearly enforceable.\"   However, the  district court\r\n\nfound crucial  the IAW program's  express condition that  NET had\r\n\n\"the  sole,  exclusive,  and  complete discretion  and  right  to\r\n\ndetermine   the   terms,   policy,   structure,   operation   and\r\n\nadministration of  the Program.\"   The district court  pointed to\r\n\nthe IAW program Submission Form, which along with allocating such\r\n\ndiscretion  to NET, provides that NET has the right \"to determine\r\n\nthe  method for  evaluating  ideas which  are submitted\"  and \"to\r\n\ndetermine the method for  calculating the amount of any  award to\r\n\nbe   granted.\"    As  a  result,  the  district  court  found  an\r\n\nenforceable contract -- one which it found NET did not breach.\r\n\n          On  appeal, Hodgkins  argues  that the  IAW program  is\r\n\nseverable from his employment contract, and that by accepting his\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nsubmission and implementing his idea, NET was bound to pay him if\r\n\nit was successful.   Hodgkins also contends that while  there was\r\n\nno explicit reasonableness requirement in Hodgkins' contract with\r\n\nNET, other terms in  the contract substitute for it.   Under this\r\n\nreading of the contract, Hodgkins asserts that a genuine issue of\r\n\nmaterial fact  persisted with respect to whether NET breached the\r\n\ncontract.\r\n\n          Hodgkins argues that, in  the event that NET's reserved\r\n\ndiscretion  was  so  broad  as to  encompass  its  actions,  such\r\n\ndiscretion must have  been too  broad for the  district court  to\r\n\nfind an enforceable agreement.   The district court's key finding\r\n\nwas  that NET  and  Hodgkins formed  an  agreement that  remained\r\n\nenforceable despite the clause granting NET \"sole, exclusive, and\r\n\ncomplete discretion\"  over the IAW program's operation, including\r\n\nauthority \"to  determine the method for calculating the amount of\r\n\nany award to  be granted.\"  According to the  district court, the\r\n\nlatitude  this provision  afforded NET  was sufficiently  wide to\r\n\nencompass NET's conduct in evaluating Hodgkins' idea.  Therefore,\r\n\nthe district court concluded, there was no breach.\r\n\n          Hodgkins  contends that  the district  court's analysis\r\n\nmust  be erroneous.  According to  Hodgkins, the district court's\r\n\nreading of the clause  granting NET discretion is so  generous to\r\n\nNET that it must lead to the conclusion that Hodgkins received no\r\n\nconsideration or enforceable promise in return for submitting his\r\n\nidea, since NET had the unbridled discretion to vary the contract\r\n\nat will.

The IAW program form\r\n\nsubmitted   by   Hodgkins   clearly  reserves   calculation   and\r\n\ndetermination of  awards to  NET's discretion, and  Hodgkins does\r\n\nnot argue  that he was  not aware  of these provisions.   In  the\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nabsence of any evidence proffered by Hodgkins that NET engaged in\r\n\nbad faith acts such as intentionally destroying records, we agree\r\n\nwith the  district court's finding that  NET's conduct, including\r\n\nits  repeated evaluations  of Hodgkins'  ideas, falls  within the\r\n\nambit of its \"sole, exclusive, and complete  discretion\" over the\r\n\nIAW program's operation.\r\n\n          However,   a   question  lingers   regarding  Hodgkins'\r\n\nargument that the  discretion reserved by NET was  so \"unlimited\"\r\n\nas to  void the agreement.   See Corthell,  167 A. at  81 (noting\r                                                   \r\n\nthat a party's reservation of an unlimited right to determine the\r                                                    \r\n\nnature and extent  of its performance renders  its obligation too\r\n\nindefinite  for legal enforcement).

In that  case, the plaintiff Corthell\r\n\nexecuted  an agreement  with  his employer  whereby  he would  be\r\n\ncompensated   for  \"all   future  inventions\"   with  \"reasonable\r\n\nrecognition,\"  \"the basis and amount [of which] to rest with\" the\r\n\nemployer  \"at  all  times.\"   Id.    Despite  the reservation  of\r                                           \r\n\ndiscretion to the  employer, the  Maine Law Court  held that  the\r\n\nemployer's promise  was not  illusory and  that the  contract was\r\n\nvalid.    Id. at  82.    Stating that  the  contract  \"was to  be\r                       \r\n\ninterpreted in good faith on the basis  of what is reasonable and\r\n\nintended,  and not  technically,\" and  also emphasizing  that the\r\n\ncontract contained specific  language instructing that it  should\r\n\nbe  construed in that manner, the court found that the employer's\r\n\npromise was not  illusory based on the provision  for \"reasonable\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nrecognition\" and the parties' exhibition of a contractual intent.\r\n\nId.

Viewing the  facts in the best light  for Hodgkins, the\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ngeneral  purpose  of the  IAW  program  agreement appears  fairly\r\n\nstraightforward.   An employee  suggestion plan  such as  the IAW\r\n\nprogram  is intended  to  reward ideas  and  promote more  active\r\n\nemployee participation in  the productive process.   See Fish  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nFord Motor  Co., 534 N.E.2d 911, 913 (Ohio Ct. App. 1987).  These\r                         \r\n\nprograms give employees incentives in the form of rewards to work\r\n\nharder  and generate  possible improvements.   Id.   At  the same\r                                                            \r\n\ntime, the  clauses in  the employment contract  and the  proposal\r\n\nplan document must be upheld  to protect the company's interests.\r\n\nId.   Among  those interests  is the  ability of the  employer to\r             \r\n\nquickly  resolve  instances  where  the  suggestion involved  may\r\n\nprovide benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify.\r\n\n          We find that the district court properly concluded that\r\n\nno  genuine issue of  material fact existed to  cast doubt on the\r\n\nproposition  that,  under  Maine   law,  NET's  promise  was  not\r\n\nillusory.  Given the context of employee relations and incentives\r\n\nsurrounding  the  IAW program,  NET's  promise  was not  rendered\r\n\nunenforceable  by  a  grant   of  unfettered  discretion.    Even\r\n\nassuming, arguendo,  that Hodgkins correctly argues  that the IAW\r                            \r\n\nprogram  constitutes an  agreement severable from  his employment\r\n\nrelationship with NET, we  cannot accept Hodgkins' assertion that\r\n\nhe provided NET with  a suggestion in exchange for  NET's promise\r\n\nthat  it would give him  an award if  it wished to,  at its total\r\n\ndiscretion.    Given  its  policies of  generally  informing  its\r\n\nemployees  when one  of them  received an  award, the  context in\r\n\nwhich NET  made its promise  did not  allow it to  refuse to  pay\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nawards  arbitrarily at  its discretion.   If  NET refused  to pay\r\n\nawards,  then the  IAW program  in the  future would  not provide\r\n\nincentives  to  employees   to  suggest  improvements.     Future\r\n\nimprovements depended,  and still  depend, on current  payment of\r\n\nawards.2    In  sum,  the lack  of  an  explicit \"reasonableness\"\r\n\nprovision  alone  does  not   render  the  IAW  program  contract\r\n\nunenforceable, and  this factual background further justifies the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  conclusion,  especially   in  the  absence  of\r\n\nproffered contravening evidence by Hodgkins.  \r\n\n          Like the district court before us, we believe that  the\r\n\nMaine Law Court would conclude that the IAW program constituted a\r\n\nvalid agreement between NET and Hodgkins. Before  determining the\r\n\nprecise  contractual  duty  that  NET  faced,  however,  we  must\r\n\nconsider  the alleged tender by DuBois of a $17,500 special award\r\n\nto Hodgkins.   This is  certainly a disputed  issue of fact;  the\r\n\nquestion  is whether it represents a material dispute.  Taken, in\r\n\nHodgkins' favor, as true, this statement could not create any new\r\n\nobligation on the  part of  the company: the  submitted idea  was\r\n\n\"past  consideration\"  and thus  insufficient  to  support a  new\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Perhaps  NET could have quietly  refused to pay  higher awards\r\nand  publicize smaller  but still  significant awards.   However,\r\nHodgkins  has  presented   no  evidence  of  such  a  NET  policy\r\nsufficient  for  his  summary  judgment burden.

Under Maine  law, equitable\r\n\nestoppel \"bars the assertion of the truth by one whose misleading\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nconduct has induced another  to act to his detriment  in reliance\r\n\non what is untrue.\"  See Anderson v.

Hodgkins argues  that under Maine's\r\n\ndoctrine of equitable estoppel, NET's course of conduct precludes\r\n\nNET  from asserting  rights of  contract against  Hodgkins, since\r\n\nHodgkins  in good  faith relied  upon NET's  conduct and  was led\r\n\nthereby  to  change  his position  for  the  worse.

Furthermore, the  district court  found\r\n\nthat  Hodgkins  could not  have  reasonably  relied  on  the  NET\r\n\nemployee  newsletter of January  3, 1991,  listing him  as having\r\n\nsubmitted  a winning  idea, since:   (1)  Hodgkins knew  that the\r\n\nannouncement was made before  his idea was even  implemented, let\r\n\nalone evaluated after  one year; (2) the newsletter  reference to\r\n\n\"15 percent of the estimated savings\" is a clear reference  to an\r\n\n\"Initial Award for a tangible idea,\" not a \"Special Merit Award\";\r\n\nand (3)  the announcement's reference  to a \"Tangible  Award\" for\r\n\nHodgkins clearly  meant an Initial  Award, since the  IAW program\r\n\nrules  and  publications  use  the term  \"tangible\"  to  describe\r\n\n\"Initial  Awards  for tangible  ideas,\"  but  not \"Special  Merit\r\n\nAwards.\"\r\n\n          On appeal,  Hodgkins attempts to sidestep  the district\r\n\ncourt's  analysis in two ways.   First, he asserts that a factual\r\n\nquestion  existed  as  to  whether Hodgkins'  reliance  on  NET's\r\n\npromise  was  reasonable,  since   he  had  used  his  experience\r\n\nprojecting  costs for NET to estimate the likely savings that NET\r\n\nwould  realize  from implementing  his  idea.   Second,  Hodgkins\r\n\ncontends that \"taken as a whole,\" rather  than looking at the IAW\r\n\nprogram publications  and the NET newsletter  in isolation, NET's\r\n\nconduct justifies both estoppel theories.\r\n\n          We   find  the  district  court's  analysis  convincing\r\n\nnonetheless.   With respect to his first assertion, regardless of\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nhis  assessment  of  likely  savings  from  his  idea,  under  an\r\n\nequitable  estoppel  theory  Hodgkins  was required  to  show  he\r\n\nreasonably relied  or that NET  made statements  which it  should\r\n\nreasonably  have  expected  to  induce Hodgkins'  actions.    The\r\n\nargument that  a  factual question  existed as  to his  estimates\r\n\nsimply  does  not respond  to the  crux  of the  district court's\r\n\nanalysis:  that his reliance was not reasonable.  With respect to\r\n\nHodgkins'  emphasis on the IAW program \"taken as a whole\" forming\r\n\nan  issue of  triable fact,  that allegation  by itself  does not\r\n\nconvert the issue into a question of fact for the  jury.  Because\r\n\nHodgkins has failed in his brief to  point to evidence other than\r\n\nthat considered by the district court in assessing  NET's conduct\r\n\nunder equitable  estoppel, we  cannot  determine what  additional\r\n\nfacts  Hodgkins  may  be referring  to  by  his  invocation of  a\r\n\nholistic approach.  As a result of this failure to point to other\r\n\ncompetent  evidence  to  surmount a  supported  summary  judgment\r\n\nmotion,  see Thomas v. Metropolitan  Life Ins. Co.,  40 F.3d 505,\r                                                            \r\n\n510  (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that \"[t]o avoid summary judgment, a\r\n\nnonmoving party must be able to point to some specific, competent\r\n\nevidence in support of  its claim\"); Cloutier v. Town  of Epping,\r                                                                          \r\n\n714  F.2d 1184, 1192 (1st Cir.  1983) (\"surmount[ing] a supported\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment\"  requires that plaintiffs \"set forth\r\n\nspecific  facts showing a  triable issue\"), we  conclude that the\r\n\nIAW  program  publications and  the  NET  newsletter compose  the\r\n\ncompetent evidence  regarding the relevant course  of conduct for\r\n\nboth estoppel  theories.   We  agree  with the  district  court's\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ndiscussion of this  evidence, and find  that, under an  equitable\r\n\nestoppel  theory, Hodgkins  could not  have reasonably  relied on\r\n\nstatements or conduct  as evidenced  in these sources.   For  the\r\n\nsame reasons, under  a promissory estoppel theory, NET should not\r\n\nreasonably  have   expected  to  induce   Hodgkins'  actions   in\r\n\nreliance.3\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Hodgkins' promissory  estoppel argument was not a count in his\r\ncomplaint.   Because  it  fails  for  the  same  reasons  as  his\r\nequitable  estoppel claim, we do not address the issue of whether\r\nthe  district  court  erred  in concluding  that  the  promissory\r\nestoppel argument was waived.  See Hodgkins v. New England Tel. &amp;\r                                                                           \r\nTel. Co., slip op. at 8 n.2 (D.

Negligent Misrepresentation\r\n\n          Maine  has adopted  the Restatement  (Second) of  Torts\r\n\ndefinition of the tort of negligent misrepresentation, which runs\r\n\nas follows:\r\n\n            One who,  in the course  of his business,\r\n            profession or employment, or in any other\r\n            transaction in  which he has  a pecuniary\r\n            interest, supplies  false information for\r\n            the  guidance of others in their business\r\n            transactions, is subject to liability for\r\n            pecuniary  loss caused  to them  by their\r\n            justifiable     reliance     upon     the\r\n            information,  if  he  fails  to  exercise\r\n            reasonable   care    or   competence   in\r\n            obtaining     or     communicating    the\r\n            information.\r\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts    552(1) (1977), cited  in Chapman\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Rideout, 568 A.2d 829, 830 (Me. 1990).\r                    \r\n\n          Hodgkins argued below  that the newsletter announcement\r\n\nand IAW program publications  contained false statements on which\r\n\nhe justifiably relied in  deciding when to retire.   The district\r\n\ncourt  was unconvinced  by  this argument.    We agree  with  the\r\n\ndistrict    court's    finding    that     Hodgkins'    negligent\r\n\nmisrepresentation claim  must  fail for  the same  reason as  his\r\n\nestoppel arguments,  namely, that specific statements  in the IAW\r\n\nprogram  publications  and the  NET  newsletter, as  well  as the\r\n\ncontext  in  which they  were  read,  clearly rendered  Hodgkins'\r\n\nalleged  reliance unreasonable.  We note in passing that the only\r\n\nfalse statement Hodgkins has pointed to, the alleged statement by\r\n\nDuBois,  taken as true, would still have been made after Hodgkins\r\n\nhad  already retired,  and  thus Hodgkins  cannot  claim to  have\r\n\nrelied upon it,  nor does Hodgkins so  claim.  Hodgkins  does not\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\npoint  to  evidence contradicting  NET's  statements  in the  IAW\r\n\nprogram  publications  and  the   NET  newsletter  that  rendered\r\n\njustifiable any reliance on those materials in his retirement and\r\n\nrelated  decisions.    Because  Hodgkins  must  show  justifiable\r\n\nreliance in order to sustain a negligent misrepresentation claim,\r\n\nhe consequently cannot establish that a genuine issue of material\r\n\nfact remains  that would compel us  to grant him a  trial under a\r\n\nMaine law theory of negligent misrepresentation.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt is reversed  in part,  affirmed in part,  and remanded  for\r                   reversed  in part   affirmed in part   and remanded  for\r                                                                      \r\n\nfurther proceedings.\r          further proceedings\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n",

Hodgkins (\"Hodgkins\") sued his former employer, defendant-appellee New England Telephone and Telegraph Company (\"NET\"), because he believes that NET paid him an insufficient amount for a cost-saving idea he submitted in its employee suggestion program.   The district court granted NET's motion for summary judgment on Hodgkins' claims, which include breach of contract, quantum meruit, equitable estoppel, unjust enrichment, and negligent misrepresentation.   Hodgkins appeals the district court's decision.   We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff's claims, giving him the benefit of all reasonably supported inferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NET has an employee suggestion program named \"Ideas at Work\" (\"the IAW program\"), that encourages and rewards employee ideas that produce savings or increased profits for NET.   According to NET's \"Suggester's Guide,\" reviewed by Hodgkins before he submitted his idea, the IAW program \"rewards the people who come up with ideas the company uses by paying the originators fifteen percent of the savings or earnings from the first year of implementation--up to a limit of $50,000.\"   The IAW program provides for \"Initial Awards\" of 15 percent (minimum of $75 and maximum of $5,000) of the estimated net savings or profits for one year on so-called \"tangible ideas,\" and \"Special Merit Awards\" of up to 15% of the actual savings or profits produced by the idea in its first year of implementation.   According to an IAW program handbook that NET supplied to its employees, \"[a]ll tangible ideas which were awarded an initial award will be re-evaluated one year from the date of implementation to determine the actual savings or profits.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Hodgkins, Jr. was employed by NET in Maine from 1956 until February 1992.   Hodgkins produced an idea that would reduce the cost of changing telephone service for certain multisubscribers such as dormitories and nursing homes.   On April 20, 1989, Hodgkins submitted his idea to the IAW program.   Hodgkins conducted his own study, and based on his own managerial expertise, concluded that the idea would save NET money, and that therefore NET would implement the idea, evaluate it under the IAW program, and grant him fifteen percent of the first year's savings.   Based on his own knowledge of NET's operations and costs, Hodgkins expected that he would receive the maximum under the IAW program, $50,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins submitted his idea to the IAW program by signing a submission form in which he agreed to abide by the rules of the program as laid out on the reverse side of the form and in a NET document called General Administrative Procedure No. 53 (\"GAP 53\").   Both the back of the submission form and GAP 53 specified that NET had the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>sole, exclusive, and complete discretion and right to determine the terms, policy, structure, operation and administration of the Program, including the right:  ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>e) To determine the method for calculating the amount of any award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>f) To determine the amount of any award granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>g) To determine the person entitled to receive any award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>h) To determine the extent, if any, of the application, implementation, or use of an idea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same documents also provided that \"[t]he decisions of the Company concerning the terms, policy, structure, operation or administration of the Program are within the sole and exclusive discretion of the Company and are final, binding, and conclusive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, NET's initial evaluation reported that Hodgkins' suggestion was \"an excellent idea to move the company forward in its goal of automated provisioning.\"   As a result, he received the maximum Initial Award of $5,000 in September 1990.   In January 1991, NET announced in its weekly in-house publication that Hodgkins' idea had been adopted and that it \"earned for its suggester a Tangible Award of 15 percent of its estimated savings.\"   NET implemented Hodgkins' idea in July 1991, and thus no determination of the first-year savings for a Special Merit Award could be made until after July 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Expecting to receive the maximum award for his idea, Hodgkins retired from NET in February 1992, earlier than he would have retired had he not expected the award.   In September 1992, NET manager Philip DuBois informed Hodgkins by telephone that NET had awarded him $17,500 for his idea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Hodgkins told DuBois that the amount of the award was too low.   DuBois then sent the evaluation form back to the IAW program manager for re-evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1993, NET informed Hodgkins that he would not receive a Special Merit Award.   According to NET's re-evaluation report, NET could not quantify savings associated exclusively with Hodgkins' idea because other innovations had produced the same results as Hodgkins' idea.   Hodgkins appealed this decision, and a second re-evaluation was performed, which arrived at the same conclusion.   NET's evaluation reports indicated that the task of measuring savings had been rendered impossible by the destruction of cost records, given the passage of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, NET has not awarded Hodgkins any money beyond the $5,000 Initial Award.   Because Hodgkins did not receive the total amount he expected, his financial plans for retirement have been disturbed, causing him to draw prematurely on certain investments and incur early withdrawal penalties.   On theories of breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, equitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation, Hodgkins brought suit in district court seeking damages incurred in reliance on statements made by NET, as well as the additional $45,000 of award money he expected, plus money for income taxes, which NET had agreed to pay on any IAW program award amount.   The district court granted summary judgment on all counts.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Hodgkins.

Summary judgment is appropriate when, based upon the pleadings, affidavits, and depositions, \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and [where] the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Hope Furnace Assocs., Inc. v.

Alternatively, in the absence of an enforceable contract, Hodgkins claims that he is entitled to a trial on a theory of unjust enrichment or quantum meruit.   Hodgkins also advances claims under theories of equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel.   Finally, Hodgkins claims that the evidence requires that a factfinder decide whether NET negligently misrepresented to Hodgkins that he was entitled to additional compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided that the IAW program formed part of Hodgkins' contract of employment with NET.   The district court also found that the provision of the IAW program that states that \"[a]ll ideas which result in Initial Awards for tangible ideas shall receive consideration for a Special Merit Award\" was \"clearly enforceable.\"   However, the district court found crucial the IAW program's express condition that NET had \"the sole, exclusive, and complete discretion and right to determine the terms, policy, structure, operation and administration of the Program.\"   The district court pointed to the IAW program Submission Form, which along with allocating such discretion to NET, provides that NET has the right \"to determine the method for evaluating ideas which are submitted\" and \"to determine the method for calculating the amount of any award to be granted.\"   As a result, the district court found an enforceable contract--one which it found NET did not breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hodgkins argues that the IAW program is severable from his employment contract, and that by accepting his submission and implementing his idea, NET was bound to pay him if it was successful.   Hodgkins also contends that while there was no explicit reasonableness requirement in Hodgkins' contract with NET, other terms in the contract substitute for it.   Under this reading of the contract, Hodgkins asserts that a genuine issue of material fact persisted with respect to whether NET breached the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins argues that, in the event that NET's reserved discretion was so broad as to encompass its actions, such discretion must have been too broad for the district court to find an enforceable agreement.   The district court's key finding was that NET and Hodgkins formed an agreement that remained enforceable despite the clause granting NET \"sole, exclusive, and complete discretion\" over the IAW program's operation, including authority \"to determine the method for calculating the amount of any award to be granted.\"   According to the district court, the latitude this provision afforded NET was sufficiently wide to encompass NET's conduct in evaluating Hodgkins' idea.   Therefore, the district court concluded, there was no breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins contends that the district court's analysis must be erroneous.   According to Hodgkins, the district court's reading of the clause granting NET discretion is so generous to NET that it must lead to the conclusion that Hodgkins received no consideration or enforceable promise in return for submitting his idea, since NET had the unbridled discretion to vary the contract at will.   See, e.g., Whitten v. Greeley-Shaw, 520 A.2d 1307, 1309 (Me.1987) (noting that \"[e]very contract requires 'consideration' to support it\");  Corthell v. Summit Thread Co., 132 Me. 94, 167 A. 79, 81 (1933) (stating that \"a reservation to either party of an unlimited right to determine the nature and extent of his performance renders his obligation too indefinite for legal enforcement, making it, as it is termed, merely illusory\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering this argument, we agree with the district court and the parties that Maine law applies.   See Moores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 n. 2 (1st Cir.1987) (stating that \"[w]here the parties agree what substantive law controls in a diversity case, we can--and ordinarily should--accept such a concession.\").   Under Maine law,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>the paramount principle in the construction of contracts is to give effect to the intention of the parties as gathered from the language of the agreement viewed in the light of all the circumstances under which it was made....

Lewiston Raceways, Inc., 654 A.2d 1293, 1295-96 (Me.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reading of the written instrument's literal terms is not disputed.   The IAW program form submitted by Hodgkins clearly reserves calculation and determination of awards to NET's discretion, and Hodgkins does not argue that he was not aware of these provisions.   In the absence of any evidence proffered by Hodgkins that NET engaged in bad faith acts such as intentionally destroying records, we agree with the district court's finding that NET's conduct, including its repeated evaluations of Hodgkins' ideas, falls within the ambit of its \"sole, exclusive, and complete discretion\" over the IAW program's operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, a question lingers regarding Hodgkins' argument that the discretion reserved by NET was so \"unlimited\" as to void the agreement.   See Corthell, 167 A. at 81 (noting that a party's reservation of an unlimited right to determine the nature and extent of its performance renders its obligation too indefinite for legal enforcement).   In Corthell, 167 A. at 81, the Maine Law Court confronted facts bearing some resemblance to those of the instant case.   In that case, the plaintiff Corthell executed an agreement with his employer whereby he would be compensated for \"all future inventions\" with \"reasonable recognition,\" \"the basis and amount [of which] to rest with\" the employer \"at all times.\"  Id.  Despite the reservation of discretion to the employer, the Maine Law Court held that the employer's promise was not illusory and that the contract was valid.  Id. at 82.   Stating that the contract \"was to be interpreted in good faith on the basis of what is reasonable and intended, and not technically,\" and also emphasizing that the contract contained specific language instructing that it should be construed in that manner, the court found that the employer's promise was not illusory based on the provision for \"reasonable recognition\" and the parties' exhibition of a contractual intent.  Id. (finding a valid enforceable agreement and also concluding that the employer breached it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing Corthell, Hodgkins argues that because the IAW program agreement did not include any mention of \"reasonable recognition,\" as the agreement in Corthell did, the IAW program agreement reserved excessive discretion for NET and was thus void.   We do not agree.   See Brooking v. Maine Employment Sec. Comm'n, 449 A.2d 1116, 1118 (Me.1982) (noting that it was \"highly unlikely\" that an employment agreement would have been unenforceable for vagueness even though compensation for services was not stated, and failing to note any provision requiring a reasonable amount) (citing Corthell, 167 A. at 81).   We cannot therefore accept Hodgkins' semantic emphasis based on Corthell.   See Towne v. Larson, 142 Me. 301, 51 A.2d 51, 53 (1947) (noting that while \"it is true that a contract must be sufficiently definite to enable the court to determine its meaning and fix the legal liability of the parties ... [t]he court looks to substance rather than to form, and is reluctant to construe a contract so as to render it unenforceable if that result can be avoided\") (discussing Corthell ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we must look beyond the mere wording of the agreement.   In this regard, Top of the Track directs that, to ascertain what was reasonable and intended, we look at the facts surrounding an agreement's making.  Top of the Track, 654 A.2d at 1295-96.   Viewing the facts in the best light for Hodgkins, the general purpose of the IAW program agreement appears fairly straightforward.   An employee suggestion plan such as the IAW program is intended to reward ideas and promote more active employee participation in the productive process.   See Fish v. Ford Motor Co., 41 Ohio App.3d 113, 534 N.E.2d 911, 913 (1987).   These programs give employees incentives in the form of rewards to work harder and generate possible improvements.  Id.  At the same time, the clauses in the employment contract and the proposal plan document must be upheld to protect the company's interests.  Id.  Among those interests is the ability of the employer to quickly resolve instances where the suggestion involved may provide benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court properly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact existed to cast doubt on the proposition that, under Maine law, NET's promise was not illusory.   Given the context of employee relations and incentives surrounding the IAW program, NET's promise was not rendered unenforceable by a grant of unfettered discretion.   Even assuming, arguendo, that Hodgkins correctly argues that the IAW program constitutes an agreement severable from his employment relationship with NET, we cannot accept Hodgkins' assertion that he provided NET with a suggestion in exchange for NET's promise that it would give him an award if it wished to, at its total discretion.   Given its policies of generally informing its employees when one of them received an award, the context in which NET made its promise did not allow it to refuse to pay awards arbitrarily at its discretion.   If NET refused to pay awards, then the IAW program in the future would not provide incentives to employees to suggest improvements.   Future improvements depended, and still depend, on current payment of awards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In sum, the lack of an explicit \"reasonableness\" provision alone does not render the IAW program contract unenforceable, and this factual background further justifies the district court's conclusion, especially in the absence of proffered contravening evidence by Hodgkins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court before us, we believe that the Maine Law Court would conclude that the IAW program constituted a valid agreement between NET and Hodgkins.   Before determining the precise contractual duty that NET faced, however, we must consider the alleged tender by DuBois of a $17,500 special award to Hodgkins.   This is certainly a disputed issue of fact;  the question is whether it represents a material dispute.   Taken, in Hodgkins' favor, as true, this statement could not create any new obligation on the part of the company:  the submitted idea was \"past consideration\" and thus insufficient to support a new contract or a modification.   See Greater Boston Cable Corp. v. White Mountain Cable Constr.  Co., 414 Mass. 76, 604 N.E.2d 1315, 1317 (1992) (stating that \"[p]ast consideration does not support a contract\");  Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co., 438 A.2d 1091, 1093 (R.I.1982) (concluding that because \"[v]alid consideration ... must be bargained for ... [t]o be valid, therefore, the purported consideration must not have been delivered before a promise is executed, that is, given without reference to the promise\");  4 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts &#167; 8:9, at 193-202 (4th ed. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we conclude that whether the agreement contained an implicit obligation of reasonable efforts, good faith, accurate evaluation of the idea's worth, or other such treatment, the alleged offer of $17,500 represents evidence from which a jury could infer that NET did not live up to its obligations when it later claimed that Hodgkins' idea did not merit more than the Initial Award.   Having allegedly tendered a $17,500 Special Award, NET cannot avoid factfinding as to whether its subsequent refusal to pay any amount as a special award breached its duty regarding the Hodgkins idea.   As a result, on the breach of contract claim, we must reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment, and remand for further proceedings in accord with this opinion.   We leave it to the district court, in the first instance, to determine the precise contractual duty which arose under Maine law pursuant to the parties' agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Unjust Enrichment and Quantum Meruit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins also seeks damages under unjust enrichment and quantum meruit theories.   Under Maine law, \"[u]njust enrichment describes recovery for the value of the benefit retained when there is no contractual relationship, but when, on the grounds of fairness and justice, the law compels performance of a legal and moral duty to pay,\" while \"quantum meruit involves recovery for services or materials provided under an implied contract.\"  Aladdin Elec. Assoc. v. Town of Old Orchard Beach, 645 A.2d 1142, 1145 (Me.1994);  see A.F.A.B., Inc. v. Town of Old Orchard Beach, 639 A.2d 103, 105 n. 3 (Me.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have already discussed and upheld the district court's finding of an enforceable agreement between NET and Hodgkins.   Without evidence of fraud, or other circumstances that render the contract inoperative, Hodgkins is foreclosed from seeking additional payment outside the contract terms.   See Top of the Track, 654 A.2d at 1296 (contract between the parties forecloses unjust enrichment claim);  Prest v. Inhabitants of Farmington, 117 Me. 348, 104 A. 521, 524 (1918) (valid express contract forecloses a quantum meruit action).   Because Hodgkins has put forth no such evidence, we agree with the district court that Hodgkins' unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>III. Equitable Estoppel and Promissory Estoppel</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins also seeks damages under theories of equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel.   Under Maine law, equitable estoppel \"bars the assertion of the truth by one whose misleading conduct has induced another to act to his detriment in reliance on what is untrue.\"   See Anderson v. Commissioner of the Dep't of Human Servs., 489 A.2d 1094, 1099 (Me.1985) (adding that \"[a] misunderstanding will not support application of equitable estoppel\").   According to Maine law on promissory estoppel, \"[a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\"  Martin v. Scott Paper Co., 511 A.2d 1048, 1050 (Me.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins contends that, taken as a whole, the IAW program encouraged the submission of ideas and made specific representations to employees, including Hodgkins, about the evaluation process and the compensation to be paid for ideas that produced financial results.   Hodgkins argues that under Maine's doctrine of equitable estoppel, NET's course of conduct precludes NET from asserting rights of contract against Hodgkins, since Hodgkins in good faith relied upon NET's conduct and was led thereby to change his position for the worse.   See, e.g., Waterville Homes, Inc. v. Maine Dep't of Transp., 589 A.2d 455, 457 (Me.1991).   Citing Martin, 511 A.2d at 1050 (Me.1986), Hodgkins also argues that promissory estoppel similarly applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found this argument unconvincing because it concluded that since the various IAW program publications made it clear that NET retained complete discretion as to the evaluation methods and conclusions, it would have been unreasonable for Hodgkins to conclude that such publications promised him an award.   Furthermore, the district court found that Hodgkins could not have reasonably relied on the NET employee newsletter of January 3, 1991, listing him as having submitted a winning idea, since:  (1) Hodgkins knew that the announcement was made before his idea was even implemented, let alone evaluated after one year;  (2) the newsletter reference to \"15 percent of the estimated savings\" is a clear reference to an \"Initial Award for a tangible idea,\" not a \"Special Merit Award\";  and (3) the announcement's reference to a \"Tangible Award\" for Hodgkins clearly meant an Initial Award, since the IAW program rules and publications use the term \"tangible\" to describe \"Initial Awards for tangible ideas,\" but not \"Special Merit Awards.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hodgkins attempts to sidestep the district court's analysis in two ways.   First, he asserts that a factual question existed as to whether Hodgkins' reliance on NET's promise was reasonable, since he had used his experience projecting costs for NET to estimate the likely savings that NET would realize from implementing his idea.   Second, Hodgkins contends that \"taken as a whole,\" rather than looking at the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter in isolation, NET's conduct justifies both estoppel theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the district court's analysis convincing nonetheless.   With respect to his first assertion, regardless of his assessment of likely savings from his idea, under an equitable estoppel theory Hodgkins was required to show he reasonably relied or that NET made statements which it should reasonably have expected to induce Hodgkins' actions.   The argument that a factual question existed as to his estimates simply does not respond to the crux of the district court's analysis:  that his reliance was not reasonable.   With respect to Hodgkins' emphasis on the IAW program \"taken as a whole\" forming an issue of triable fact, that allegation by itself does not convert the issue into a question of fact for the jury.   Because Hodgkins has failed in his brief to point to evidence other than that considered by the district court in assessing NET's conduct under equitable estoppel, we cannot determine what additional facts Hodgkins may be referring to by his invocation of a holistic approach.   As a result of this failure to point to other competent evidence to surmount a supported summary judgment motion, see Thomas v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 40 F.3d 505, 510 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that \"[t]o avoid summary judgment, a nonmoving party must be able to point to some specific, competent evidence in support of its claim\");  Cloutier v. Town of Epping, 714 F.2d 1184, 1192 (1st Cir.1983) (\"surmount[ing] a supported motion for summary judgment\" requires that plaintiffs \"set forth specific facts showing a triable issue\"), we conclude that the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter compose the competent evidence regarding the relevant course of conduct for both estoppel theories.   We agree with the district court's discussion of this evidence, and find that, under an equitable estoppel theory, Hodgkins could not have reasonably relied on statements or conduct as evidenced in these sources.   For the same reasons, under a promissory estoppel theory, NET should not reasonably have expected to induce Hodgkins' actions in reliance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Negligent Misrepresentation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine has adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts definition of the tort of negligent misrepresentation, which runs as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 552(1) (1977), cited in Chapman v. Rideout, 568 A.2d 829, 830 (Me.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins argued below that the newsletter announcement and IAW program publications contained false statements on which he justifiably relied in deciding when to retire.   The district court was unconvinced by this argument.   We agree with the district court's finding that Hodgkins' negligent misrepresentation claim must fail for the same reason as his estoppel arguments, namely, that specific statements in the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter, as well as the context in which they were read, clearly rendered Hodgkins' alleged reliance unreasonable.   We note in passing that the only false statement Hodgkins has pointed to, the alleged statement by DuBois, taken as true, would still have been made after Hodgkins had already retired, and thus Hodgkins cannot claim to have relied upon it, nor does Hodgkins so claim.   Hodgkins does not point to evidence contradicting NET's statements in the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter that rendered justifiable any reliance on those materials in his retirement and related decisions.   Because Hodgkins must show justifiable reliance in order to sustain a negligent misrepresentation claim, he consequently cannot establish that a genuine issue of material fact remains that would compel us to grant him a trial under a Maine law theory of negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> NET contests this assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Perhaps NET could have quietly refused to pay higher awards and publicize smaller but still significant awards.   However, Hodgkins has presented no evidence of such a NET policy sufficient for his summary judgment burden.   While summary judgment is only appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and [ ] the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Coll v. PB Diagnostic Sys., Inc., 50 F.3d 1115, 1121 (1st Cir.1995), the nonmoving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the ... pleadings, but ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e);  Coll, 50 F.3d at 1121</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Hodgkins' promissory estoppel argument was not a count in his complaint.   Because it fails for the same reasons as his equitable estoppel claim, we do not address the issue of whether the district court erred in concluding that the promissory estoppel argument was waived.

The district court granted NET's motion for summary judgment on Hodgkins' claims, which include breach of contract, quantum meruit, equitable estoppel, unjust enrichment, and negligent misrepresentation.   Hodgkins appeals the district court's decision.

According to NET's \"Suggester's Guide,\" reviewed by Hodgkins before he submitted his idea, the IAW program \"rewards the people who come up with ideas the company uses by paying the originators fifteen percent of the savings or earnings from the first year of implementation--up to a limit of $50,000.\"   The IAW program provides for \"Initial Awards\" of 15 percent (minimum of $75 and maximum of $5,000) of the estimated net savings or profits for one year on so-called \"tangible ideas,\" and \"Special Merit Awards\" of up to 15% of the actual savings or profits produced by the idea in its first year of implementation.   According to an IAW program handbook that NET supplied to its employees, \"[a]ll tangible ideas which were awarded an initial award will be re-evaluated one year from the date of implementation to determine the actual savings or profits.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Hodgkins, Jr. was employed by NET in Maine from 1956 until February 1992.   Hodgkins produced an idea that would reduce the cost of changing telephone service for certain multisubscribers such as dormitories and nursing homes.   On April 20, 1989, Hodgkins submitted his idea to the IAW program.   Hodgkins conducted his own study, and based on his own managerial expertise, concluded that the idea would save NET money, and that therefore NET would implement the idea, evaluate it under the IAW program, and grant him fifteen percent of the first year's savings.   Based on his own knowledge of NET's operations and costs, Hodgkins expected that he would receive the maximum under the IAW program, $50,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins submitted his idea to the IAW program by signing a submission form in which he agreed to abide by the rules of the program as laid out on the reverse side of the form and in a NET document called General Administrative Procedure No. 53 (\"GAP 53\").

In January 1991, NET announced in its weekly in-house publication that Hodgkins' idea had been adopted and that it \"earned for its suggester a Tangible Award of 15 percent of its estimated savings.\"   NET implemented Hodgkins' idea in July 1991, and thus no determination of the first-year savings for a Special Merit Award could be made until after July 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Expecting to receive the maximum award for his idea, Hodgkins retired from NET in February 1992, earlier than he would have retired had he not expected the award.   In September 1992, NET manager Philip DuBois informed Hodgkins by telephone that NET had awarded him $17,500 for his idea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Hodgkins told DuBois that the amount of the award was too low.   DuBois then sent the evaluation form back to the IAW program manager for re-evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1993, NET informed Hodgkins that he would not receive a Special Merit Award.   According to NET's re-evaluation report, NET could not quantify savings associated exclusively with Hodgkins' idea because other innovations had produced the same results as Hodgkins' idea.   Hodgkins appealed this decision, and a second re-evaluation was performed, which arrived at the same conclusion.   NET's evaluation reports indicated that the task of measuring savings had been rendered impossible by the destruction of cost records, given the passage of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, NET has not awarded Hodgkins any money beyond the $5,000 Initial Award.   Because Hodgkins did not receive the total amount he expected, his financial plans for retirement have been disturbed, causing him to draw prematurely on certain investments and incur early withdrawal penalties.   On theories of breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, equitable estoppel and negligent misrepresentation, Hodgkins brought suit in district court seeking damages incurred in reliance on statements made by NET, as well as the additional $45,000 of award money he expected, plus money for income taxes, which NET had agreed to pay on any IAW program award amount.   The district court granted summary judgment on all counts.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Hodgkins.

Alternatively, in the absence of an enforceable contract, Hodgkins claims that he is entitled to a trial on a theory of unjust enrichment or quantum meruit.   Hodgkins also advances claims under theories of equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel.   Finally, Hodgkins claims that the evidence requires that a factfinder decide whether NET negligently misrepresented to Hodgkins that he was entitled to additional compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided that the IAW program formed part of Hodgkins' contract of employment with NET.   The district court also found that the provision of the IAW program that states that \"[a]ll ideas which result in Initial Awards for tangible ideas shall receive consideration for a Special Merit Award\" was \"clearly enforceable.\"   However, the district court found crucial the IAW program's express condition that NET had \"the sole, exclusive, and complete discretion and right to determine the terms, policy, structure, operation and administration of the Program.\"   The district court pointed to the IAW program Submission Form, which along with allocating such discretion to NET, provides that NET has the right \"to determine the method for evaluating ideas which are submitted\" and \"to determine the method for calculating the amount of any award to be granted.\"   As a result, the district court found an enforceable contract--one which it found NET did not breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hodgkins argues that the IAW program is severable from his employment contract, and that by accepting his submission and implementing his idea, NET was bound to pay him if it was successful.   Hodgkins also contends that while there was no explicit reasonableness requirement in Hodgkins' contract with NET, other terms in the contract substitute for it.   Under this reading of the contract, Hodgkins asserts that a genuine issue of material fact persisted with respect to whether NET breached the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins argues that, in the event that NET's reserved discretion was so broad as to encompass its actions, such discretion must have been too broad for the district court to find an enforceable agreement.   The district court's key finding was that NET and Hodgkins formed an agreement that remained enforceable despite the clause granting NET \"sole, exclusive, and complete discretion\" over the IAW program's operation, including authority \"to determine the method for calculating the amount of any award to be granted.\"   According to the district court, the latitude this provision afforded NET was sufficiently wide to encompass NET's conduct in evaluating Hodgkins' idea.   Therefore, the district court concluded, there was no breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins contends that the district court's analysis must be erroneous.   According to Hodgkins, the district court's reading of the clause granting NET discretion is so generous to NET that it must lead to the conclusion that Hodgkins received no consideration or enforceable promise in return for submitting his idea, since NET had the unbridled discretion to vary the contract at will.   See, e.g., Whitten v. Greeley-Shaw, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1535515\"><a href=\"/opinion/1535515/whitten-v-greeley-shaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span>, 1309 (Me.1987) (noting that \"[e]very contract requires 'consideration' to support it\");  Corthell v.

The IAW program form submitted by Hodgkins clearly reserves calculation and determination of awards to NET's discretion, and Hodgkins does not argue that he was not aware of these provisions.   In the absence of any evidence proffered by Hodgkins that NET engaged in bad faith acts such as intentionally destroying records, we agree with the district court's finding that NET's conduct, including its repeated evaluations of Hodgkins' ideas, falls within the ambit of its \"sole, exclusive, and complete discretion\" over the IAW program's operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, a question lingers regarding Hodgkins' argument that the discretion reserved by NET was so \"unlimited\" as to void the agreement.   See Corthell, 167 A. at 81 (noting that a party's reservation of an unlimited right to determine the nature and extent of its performance renders its obligation too indefinite for legal enforcement).   In Corthell, 167 A. at 81, the Maine Law Court confronted facts bearing some resemblance to those of the instant case.   In that case, the plaintiff Corthell executed an agreement with his employer whereby he would be compensated for \"all future inventions\" with \"reasonable recognition,\" \"the basis and amount [of which] to rest with\" the employer \"at all times.\"  Id.  Despite the reservation of discretion to the employer, the Maine Law Court held that the employer's promise was not illusory and that the contract was valid.  Id. at 82.   Stating that the contract \"was to be interpreted in good faith on the basis of what is reasonable and intended, and not technically,\" and also emphasizing that the contract contained specific language instructing that it should be construed in that manner, the court found that the employer's promise was not illusory based on the provision for \"reasonable recognition\" and the parties' exhibition of a contractual intent.  Id. (finding a valid enforceable agreement and also concluding that the employer breached it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing Corthell, Hodgkins argues that because the IAW program agreement did not include any mention of \"reasonable recognition,\" as the agreement in Corthell did, the IAW program agreement reserved excessive discretion for NET and was thus void.   We do not agree.   See Brooking v. Maine Employment Sec. Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2108843\"><a href=\"/opinion/2108843/brooking-v-maine-employment-security-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></a></span>, 1118 (Me.1982) (noting that it was \"highly unlikely\" that an employment agreement would have been unenforceable for vagueness even though compensation for services was not stated, and failing to note any provision requiring a reasonable amount) (citing Corthell, 167 A. at 81).   We cannot therefore accept Hodgkins' semantic emphasis based on Corthell.   See Towne v. Larson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Me.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, 53 (1947) (noting that while \"it is true that a contract must be sufficiently definite to enable the court to determine its meaning and fix the legal liability of the parties ... [t]he court looks to substance rather than to form, and is reluctant to construe a contract so as to render it unenforceable if that result can be avoided\") (discussing Corthell ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we must look beyond the mere wording of the agreement.   In this regard, Top of the Track directs that, to ascertain what was reasonable and intended, we look at the facts surrounding an agreement's making.  Top of the Track, 654 A.2d at 1295-96.   Viewing the facts in the best light for Hodgkins, the general purpose of the IAW program agreement appears fairly straightforward.   An employee suggestion plan such as the IAW program is intended to reward ideas and promote more active employee participation in the productive process.   See Fish v. Ford Motor Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3710651\"><a href=\"/opinion/3960755/fish-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3710651\"><a href=\"/opinion/3960755/fish-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span>, 913 (1987).   These programs give employees incentives in the form of rewards to work harder and generate possible improvements.  Id.  At the same time, the clauses in the employment contract and the proposal plan document must be upheld to protect the company's interests.  Id.  Among those interests is the ability of the employer to quickly resolve instances where the suggestion involved may provide benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court properly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact existed to cast doubt on the proposition that, under Maine law, NET's promise was not illusory.   Given the context of employee relations and incentives surrounding the IAW program, NET's promise was not rendered unenforceable by a grant of unfettered discretion.   Even assuming, arguendo, that Hodgkins correctly argues that the IAW program constitutes an agreement severable from his employment relationship with NET, we cannot accept Hodgkins' assertion that he provided NET with a suggestion in exchange for NET's promise that it would give him an award if it wished to, at its total discretion.   Given its policies of generally informing its employees when one of them received an award, the context in which NET made its promise did not allow it to refuse to pay awards arbitrarily at its discretion.   If NET refused to pay awards, then the IAW program in the future would not provide incentives to employees to suggest improvements.   Future improvements depended, and still depend, on current payment of awards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In sum, the lack of an explicit \"reasonableness\" provision alone does not render the IAW program contract unenforceable, and this factual background further justifies the district court's conclusion, especially in the absence of proffered contravening evidence by Hodgkins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the district court before us, we believe that the Maine Law Court would conclude that the IAW program constituted a valid agreement between NET and Hodgkins.   Before determining the precise contractual duty that NET faced, however, we must consider the alleged tender by DuBois of a $17,500 special award to Hodgkins.   This is certainly a disputed issue of fact;  the question is whether it represents a material dispute.   Taken, in Hodgkins' favor, as true, this statement could not create any new obligation on the part of the company:  the submitted idea was \"past consideration\" and thus insufficient to support a new contract or a modification.   See Greater Boston Cable Corp. v. White Mountain Cable Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1315</span></span>, 1317 (1992) (stating that \"[p]ast consideration does not support a contract\");  Hayes v.

Lord, Williston on Contracts &#167; 8:9, at 193-202 (4th ed. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we conclude that whether the agreement contained an implicit obligation of reasonable efforts, good faith, accurate evaluation of the idea's worth, or other such treatment, the alleged offer of $17,500 represents evidence from which a jury could infer that NET did not live up to its obligations when it later claimed that Hodgkins' idea did not merit more than the Initial Award.   Having allegedly tendered a $17,500 Special Award, NET cannot avoid factfinding as to whether its subsequent refusal to pay any amount as a special award breached its duty regarding the Hodgkins idea.   As a result, on the breach of contract claim, we must reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment, and remand for further proceedings in accord with this opinion.   We leave it to the district court, in the first instance, to determine the precise contractual duty which arose under Maine law pursuant to the parties' agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Unjust Enrichment and Quantum Meruit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins also seeks damages under unjust enrichment and quantum meruit theories.   Under Maine law, \"[u]njust enrichment describes recovery for the value of the benefit retained when there is no contractual relationship, but when, on the grounds of fairness and justice, the law compels performance of a legal and moral duty to pay,\" while \"quantum meruit involves recovery for services or materials provided under an implied contract.\"  Aladdin Elec.

Without evidence of fraud, or other circumstances that render the contract inoperative, Hodgkins is foreclosed from seeking additional payment outside the contract terms.   See Top of the Track, 654 A.2d at 1296 (contract between the parties forecloses unjust enrichment claim);  Prest v. Inhabitants of Farmington, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Me.</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></span>, 524 (1918) (valid express contract forecloses a quantum meruit action).   Because Hodgkins has put forth no such evidence, we agree with the district court that Hodgkins' unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>III. Equitable Estoppel and Promissory Estoppel</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins also seeks damages under theories of equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel.   Under Maine law, equitable estoppel \"bars the assertion of the truth by one whose misleading conduct has induced another to act to his detriment in reliance on what is untrue.\"   See Anderson v. Commissioner of the Dep't of Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2001695\"><a href=\"/opinion/2001695/anderson-v-comr-of-dept-of-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span>, 1099 (Me.1985) (adding that \"[a] misunderstanding will not support application of equitable estoppel\").   According to Maine law on promissory estoppel, \"[a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\"  Martin v.

Hodgkins argues that under Maine's doctrine of equitable estoppel, NET's course of conduct precludes NET from asserting rights of contract against Hodgkins, since Hodgkins in good faith relied upon NET's conduct and was led thereby to change his position for the worse.   See, e.g., Waterville Homes, Inc. v. Maine Dep't of Transp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291391\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291391/waterville-homes-v-dept-of-transp/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span>, 457 (Me.1991).   Citing Martin, 511 A.2d at 1050 (Me.1986), Hodgkins also argues that promissory estoppel similarly applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found this argument unconvincing because it concluded that since the various IAW program publications made it clear that NET retained complete discretion as to the evaluation methods and conclusions, it would have been unreasonable for Hodgkins to conclude that such publications promised him an award.   Furthermore, the district court found that Hodgkins could not have reasonably relied on the NET employee newsletter of January 3, 1991, listing him as having submitted a winning idea, since:  (1) Hodgkins knew that the announcement was made before his idea was even implemented, let alone evaluated after one year;  (2) the newsletter reference to \"15 percent of the estimated savings\" is a clear reference to an \"Initial Award for a tangible idea,\" not a \"Special Merit Award\";  and (3) the announcement's reference to a \"Tangible Award\" for Hodgkins clearly meant an Initial Award, since the IAW program rules and publications use the term \"tangible\" to describe \"Initial Awards for tangible ideas,\" but not \"Special Merit Awards.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hodgkins attempts to sidestep the district court's analysis in two ways.   First, he asserts that a factual question existed as to whether Hodgkins' reliance on NET's promise was reasonable, since he had used his experience projecting costs for NET to estimate the likely savings that NET would realize from implementing his idea.   Second, Hodgkins contends that \"taken as a whole,\" rather than looking at the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter in isolation, NET's conduct justifies both estoppel theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the district court's analysis convincing nonetheless.   With respect to his first assertion, regardless of his assessment of likely savings from his idea, under an equitable estoppel theory Hodgkins was required to show he reasonably relied or that NET made statements which it should reasonably have expected to induce Hodgkins' actions.   The argument that a factual question existed as to his estimates simply does not respond to the crux of the district court's analysis:  that his reliance was not reasonable.   With respect to Hodgkins' emphasis on the IAW program \"taken as a whole\" forming an issue of triable fact, that allegation by itself does not convert the issue into a question of fact for the jury.   Because Hodgkins has failed in his brief to point to evidence other than that considered by the district court in assessing NET's conduct under equitable estoppel, we cannot determine what additional facts Hodgkins may be referring to by his invocation of a holistic approach.   As a result of this failure to point to other competent evidence to surmount a supported summary judgment motion, see Thomas v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195753\"><a href=\"/opinion/195753/thomas-v-metropolitan/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 510 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that \"[t]o avoid summary judgment, a nonmoving party must be able to point to some specific, competent evidence in support of its claim\");  Cloutier v. Town of Epping, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423649\"><a href=\"/opinion/423649/wilfred-cloutier-v-the-town-of-epping-wilfred-cloutier-v-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1192 (1st Cir.1983) (\"surmount[ing] a supported motion for summary judgment\" requires that plaintiffs \"set forth specific facts showing a triable issue\"), we conclude that the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter compose the competent evidence regarding the relevant course of conduct for both estoppel theories.   We agree with the district court's discussion of this evidence, and find that, under an equitable estoppel theory, Hodgkins could not have reasonably relied on statements or conduct as evidenced in these sources.   For the same reasons, under a promissory estoppel theory, NET should not reasonably have expected to induce Hodgkins' actions in reliance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Negligent Misrepresentation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine has adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts definition of the tort of negligent misrepresentation, which runs as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 552(1) (1977), cited in Chapman v. Rideout, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1989733\"><a href=\"/opinion/1989733/chapman-v-rideout/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span>, 830 (Me.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgkins argued below that the newsletter announcement and IAW program publications contained false statements on which he justifiably relied in deciding when to retire.   The district court was unconvinced by this argument.   We agree with the district court's finding that Hodgkins' negligent misrepresentation claim must fail for the same reason as his estoppel arguments, namely, that specific statements in the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter, as well as the context in which they were read, clearly rendered Hodgkins' alleged reliance unreasonable.   We note in passing that the only false statement Hodgkins has pointed to, the alleged statement by DuBois, taken as true, would still have been made after Hodgkins had already retired, and thus Hodgkins cannot claim to have relied upon it, nor does Hodgkins so claim.   Hodgkins does not point to evidence contradicting NET's statements in the IAW program publications and the NET newsletter that rendered justifiable any reliance on those materials in his retirement and related decisions.   Because Hodgkins must show justifiable reliance in order to sustain a negligent misrepresentation claim, he consequently cannot establish that a genuine issue of material fact remains that would compel us to grant him a trial under a Maine law theory of negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> NET contests this assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Perhaps NET could have quietly refused to pay higher awards and publicize smaller but still significant awards.   However, Hodgkins has presented no evidence of such a NET policy sufficient for his summary judgment burden.   While summary judgment is only appropriate when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and [ ] the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Coll v. PB Diagnostic Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195995\"><a href=\"/opinion/195995/coll-v-pb-diagnostics/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1121 (1st Cir.1995), the nonmoving party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the ... pleadings, but ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e);  Coll, 50 F.3d at 1121</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Hodgkins' promissory estoppel argument was not a count in his complaint.   Because it fails for the same reasons as his equitable estoppel claim, we do not address the issue of whether the district court erred in concluding that the promissory estoppel argument was waived.
