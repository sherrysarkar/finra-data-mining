  "plain_text": "United States Court of Appeals\r\n For the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 98-1010\r\n\n ARTHUR D. LITTLE, INC., \r\nARTHUR D. LITTLE INTERNATIONAL, INC.,\r\n\n  Plaintiffs, Appellees,\r\n\n            v.\r\n\n  DOOYANG CORPORATION, \r\nDOOYANG AMERICA, INC., \r\nDOOYANG INTERNATIONAL, INC.,\r\n\n Defendants, Appellants.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n[Hon. Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n          Before\r\n\n Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nSelya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nRobert L. Weigel, with whom Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, John A.\r\nDonovan, Jr., and Burns &amp; Levinson were on brief, for appellants.\r\nPeter J. Macdonald, with whom Charles P. Kindregan and Hale &amp;\r\nDorr were on brief, for appellees.\r\n\nJune 25, 1998\r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  This case demonstrates the high\r\ncosts Massachusetts imposes on businesses which engage in unfair or\r\ndeceptive trade practices prohibited by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. \r\nThe legal question raised here, one of first impression for this\r\ncourt, is whether when one business engages in unfair and deceptive\r\npractices towards another and the harm consists of a delay in\r\npayments owed (and the usual accompanying expenses), that is a\r\n\"loss of money or property\" establishing a violation under Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 93A,  11.  The high costs imposed are that the\r\ndamages awarded are not those attributed solely to the nonpayment\r\nbut rather may be multiples of the amount of payments originally\r\nowed.\r\nGuided by the decisions of the courts of Massachusetts,\r\nas we must be in this diversity case, we answer this question in\r\nthe affirmative and affirm the judgment of the district court.  We\r\nresolve the \"loss of money or property\" issue and the other issues\r\nagainst appellants Dooyang.  For Dooyang's failure to pay invoices\r\ntotaling $460,000, the jury and court awarded Arthur D. Little\r\n$920,000 in damages, plus interest, plus over a million dollars in\r\nattorney's fees and costs.\r\n           I.\r\nTwo large international companies, each unhappy with its\r\ndealings with the other, and each with some justification for that\r\nunhappiness, are involved in this litigation.  We review the facts\r\n\"as the jury and district court could have found them.\"  Cambridge\r\nPlating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 756 (1st Cir. 1996). \r\n\"Where specific findings are lacking, we view the record in the\r\nlight most favorable to the ruling, making all reasonably supported\r\ninferences.\"  Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820, 821 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nADL is an international consulting firm with its home\r\noffice in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  ADL has an office in Caracas,\r\nVenezuela.  Dooyang is an industrial conglomerate with headquarters\r\nin Seoul, South Korea.  Dooyang hired ADL from 1988 to 1991 to\r\nassist it in a conceptualized aluminum smelter project.  Though\r\nprojects in other countries were initially considered, Dooyang soon\r\ninstructed ADL to focus on opportunities for building a new smelter\r\nin Venezuela.\r\nAt the outset, ADL informed Dooyang that it also worked\r\nfor the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (\"CVG\"), an arm of the\r\nVenezuelan government responsible for awarding valuable \"debt-\r\nequity swap\" subsidies, and for the Venezuelan minister responsible\r\nfor energy and metal production.  ADL was assisting CVG to attract\r\ninvestment in Venezuela.  Acquisition of the debt-equity swap\r\nsubsidies awarded by CVG was thought to be the key to the success\r\nof a smelter project in Venezuela.  Dooyang consented to this\r\nconflict, apparently believing that ADL's insider influence would\r\nredound to Dooyang's benefit.  In March of 1989, ADL recommended\r\nthat Dooyang invest in the construction of a new smelter rather\r\nthan join an existing project.  \r\nSoon after, and wearing its other hat, ADL met with CVG\r\nto assist it in attracting international investment in the\r\nVenezuelan aluminum industry, and contracted with CVG to evaluate\r\nthe relative merits of various aluminum smelter proposals. \r\nObviously, one of the proposals ADL could end up evaluating was\r\nthat of its other client, Dooyang.\r\nIn June of 1989, ADL and Dooyang entered into the first\r\nin a series of agreements under which ADL would assist Dooyang in\r\ndeveloping a new smelter.  ADL pledged to use its \"best efforts\" to\r\nassist Dooyang in a wide variety of areas, including assembling the\r\nnecessary financing and technical support, and lobbying the\r\nVenezuelan government on Dooyang's behalf.  ADL evaluated and\r\nselected advisers and partners in the project.  At no time,\r\nhowever, was ADL empowered to enter into contracts or make other\r\ncommitments on Dooyang's behalf.\r\nIn its other capacity, ADL advised CVG in July of 1989 to\r\nseek an investor which had the capacity to develop a smelter\r\nwithout partners.  ADL advised CVG to focus on projects by ALCOA\r\nand ALUMAX, and to consider as a third possibility either\r\nCisneros/Rich or Austria Metall.  Dooyang could not develop a\r\nsmelter by itself, but had to enter into partnerships with other\r\ncompanies.  At this point, however, Dooyang had not decided to go\r\nforward with a project in Venezuela, and so had no proposal then\r\nfor consideration.  But that changed: in January of 1990, Dooyang\r\nand CVG entered into an agreement which stated Dooyang's intent to\r\nbuild a smelter in Venezuela.\r\nThe contract between ADL and Dooyang was to expire by its\r\nterms at the end of 1989.  ADL and Dooyang agreed to extend the\r\ncontract for an additional six months in January of 1990.  During\r\n1990, ADL also represented CVG in negotiations with other potential\r\ninvestors such as ALCOA.  Dooyang was aware that ADL's work for CVG\r\ninvolved contacting other competing investors.  ADL and Dooyang\r\nagreed to a third six-month extension of the contract in July of\r\n1990. \r\nIn April of 1990, ADL compared for CVG the relative\r\nmerits of three smelter project proposals by ALCOA, Dooyang, and\r\nALUMAX.  ADL stressed that ALCOA was the only company capable of\r\nproceeding with a smelter on its own.  ADL recommended that CVG \"be\r\nmore aggressive\" with ALUMAX in order to keep its interest.  With\r\nregard to Dooyang, ADL said that Dooyang was \"serious about the\r\nproject\" and that they were \"spending major funds to advance their\r\nposition,\" and that ADL was \"confident that they will continue to\r\nmove very rapidly.\"  ADL later reiterated to CVG that because ALCOA\r\nhad all of the needed elements \"in house,\" great effort should be\r\nexpended to realize the ALCOA project.  In a July 1990 report, ADL\r\nidentified the ALCOA and ALUMAX projects as the \"focus\" projects,\r\nand stated that Dooyang was \"one of the leading projects.\"\r\nDooyang was aware that ADL was evaluating competing\r\nprojects for CVG.  ADL provided Dooyang with partial copies of its\r\npresentations to CVG, and assured Dooyang that ADL had convinced\r\nCVG \"that the Dooyang project is the number one project to\r\nsupport.\"  Dooyang submitted its project proposal and bid for\r\nsubsidies from the Venezuelan government in December of 1990. \r\nDooyang and its equity partners proposed building a smelter on the\r\nOrinoco river, dubbed the \"Orinoco project.\"  CVG rejected\r\nDooyang's Orinoco project application in March of 1991 in favor of\r\nthe ALCOA project.\r\nDooyang met with ADL in Caracas to discuss resubmitting\r\nthe proposal.  In early 1991, ADL and Dooyang again extended the\r\nletter agreement.  At least by April 20, 1991, as the district\r\njudge subsequently found, Dooyang decided not to pay ADL.  Dooyang\r\nfelt that ADL should do the work on the second subsidy application\r\nfor free because Dooyang had spent millions on this project with no\r\nresult.  Dooyang did not inform ADL that it expected ADL to\r\ncontinue working for no compensation, and Dooyang continued to\r\nrequest ADL's services after it had decided not to pay for them.  \r\nThe Dooyang Orinoco project proposal was resubmitted on\r\nApril 26, 1991.  In June, the Venezuelan government approved the\r\nproject, and in July it awarded subsidy rights to Dooyang as well\r\nas to a third company.  Dooyang thanked ADL for its assistance, and\r\ndid not further extend its contract with ADL.  The smelter was\r\nnever built.  Dooyang's major partners pulled out of the project,\r\nand the collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a plunge in aluminum\r\nprices which rendered the project economically infeasible then. \r\nDooyang had incurred over $9 million in costs connected to the\r\nOrinoco project.  ADL had been paid over $2.2 million for its work.\r\nADL had worked from March through June of 1991, and\r\nbilled Dooyang approximately $460,000 for these services.  It is\r\nthe invoices for this work which were not paid and became the\r\nsubject of a breach of contract claim.  It is how Dooyang behaved\r\nin not paying the bills which became the basis for the unfair and\r\ndeceptive trade practices claim. \r\nDooyang repeatedly promised to pay the outstanding ADL\r\ninvoices, though it had no intent to do so.  Dooyang falsely blamed\r\nthe hold-up in payment on bureaucratic delays and supposed problems\r\nwith currency regulations.  After ADL inquired about the unpaid\r\ninvoices, Dooyang provided ADL with a letter stating that Dooyang\r\nwas \"sorry for your inconvenience caused by the delay of payment,\r\nand . . . appreciate[d] . . . your kind understanding of the time\r\nconsuming procedure.\"  The letter stated that the outstanding\r\nbalance would be settled by the end of October 1991 at the latest.\r\nIn late October 1991, ADL again insisted on payment and\r\nDooyang replied that the invoices would be settled by \"December\r\n1991/January 1992.\"  In a November 1991 meeting in ADL's Cambridge\r\noffices, Dooyang agreed to pay the outstanding invoices by January\r\n1, 1992.  Dooyang missed that deadline, and ADL again made repeated\r\ninquiries about payment.  \r\nFinally, Dooyang sent a letter to ADL's Cambridge office\r\nin March of 1992 stating that Dooyang had \"no intention to delay or\r\ndiscard the payment\" and promised to pay starting in January of\r\n1993.   The letter assured ADL that \"[a]ll outstanding payment will\r\nbe cleared up no later than June 30, 1993 at the latest.\"  Dooyang\r\nmissed that deadline, and an ADL executive contacted the President\r\nof Dooyang directly, who professed to be unaware of the problem. \r\nDooyang again promised to pay ADL by June of 1993.  Once again,\r\nDooyang missed the deadline.\r\nEven while Dooyang was falsely promising to pay ADL and\r\nits other creditors, it continued to exploit the benefits of their\r\nunpaid work.  Dooyang continued to pursue the smelter project, and\r\nas late as August of 1994, Dooyang was dealing directly with CVG\r\nand expressing \"keen interest\" in pursuing the project.  It still\r\ndid not pay ADL.\r\nDooyang's dissembling was part of its deliberate strategy\r\non the Orinoco project.  Dooyang's strategy was to force its\r\ncreditors to accept deeply discounted payments by forcing them to\r\nlitigate to collect on their bills.  This was not a matter of\r\ninference.  Dooyang said as much in its business documents.  In its\r\ninternal 1992 Business Report, Dooyang stated that it had been\r\n\"delaying accounts payable associated with the Orinoco project by\r\nall possible means.\"  The Business Report included a chart listing\r\neach of Dooyang's advisors on the Orinoco project, followed by a\r\ncolumn titled \"ACCOUNT PAYABLE\" listing the amounts Dooyang owed\r\nthem, and another, blank column titled \"Settlement\" for listing the\r\namounts to which Dooyang was able to reduce the fee through its\r\ndelaying tactics.  Other advisors on the project also had to resort\r\nto litigation to recover their unpaid fees after receiving similar\r\nempty promises about the payment of outstanding bills.  Not one of\r\nDooyang's five largest creditors was paid anything without first\r\nresorting to litigation.\r\nThe district court found that Dooyang made repeated\r\nwritten intentional representations to ADL concerning its intent to\r\npay the invoices, and found that from at least April 20, 1991,\r\nDooyang had no intent to pay ADL.  The district court found that,\r\nonce the project began to founder, \"Dooyang abandoned any intent to\r\npay any consultants, including ADL, made false representations\r\nabout intent to pay, never had any good faith basis for delaying\r\npayment, and intended to force ADL to litigate as leverage to force\r\na favorable settlement.\"  ADL II, 979 F. Supp. at 924.\r\n          II.\r\nADL sued Dooyang in Massachusetts state court in August\r\n1994 on theories of breach of contract, fraud, and unfair and\r\ndeceptive trade practices in violation of Chapter 93A.  Dooyang\r\nremoved the case to federal court in September 1994.  Dooyang\r\ncounterclaimed, arguing that it did not have to pay ADL.  Dooyang\r\nalleged that ADL fraudulently induced it to enter into the\r\nconsulting agreements and made continuous fraudulent and negligent\r\nmisrepresentations, that ADL failed to provide Dooyang with\r\n\"accurate and complete information\" about the smelter project in\r\nVenezuela, that ADL breached its contract because it failed to use\r\nits \"best efforts,\" and that ADL violated Chapter 93A through\r\nunfair or deceptive business practices.  Dooyang's counterclaims\r\nwere based on ADL's work for the Venezuelan government and\r\nDooyang's perception that ADL was duplicitous.\r\nThe district court granted ADL's motion for summary\r\njudgment on Dooyang's Chapter 93A claim.  ADL voluntarily dismissed\r\nits fraud claims on the eve of trial.  After a jury trial on the\r\nremaining claims and counterclaims, except ADL's Chapter 93A claim,\r\nthe jury found, after two days of deliberation, in favor of ADL on\r\nits breach of contract claim and awarded it $460,000 in damages\r\n(the full amount of its bills for services rendered from March to\r\nJune 1991).\r\nAs to the Chapter 93A claim (triable to the court under\r\nMassachusetts law), the district court concluded that ADL had\r\nproved that Dooyang engaged in \"unfair or deceptive acts or\r\npractices.\"  These acts or practices were: Dooyang's ordering\r\nconsulting services without intending to pay for them, Dooyang's\r\nexpressing intent to pay ADL when it had no intent to do so, and\r\nDooyang's strategy of \"commercial extortion\" by which it attempted\r\nto force favorable price concessions through the threat of\r\nlitigation.  See ADL II, 979 F. Supp. at 925.  Under Chapter 93A,\r\nthe unfair or deceptive conduct must \"occur primarily and\r\nsubstantially within Massachusetts\" to be actionable.  The court\r\nruled that only Dooyang's conduct in misleading ADL about paying\r\nits bills was a 93A violation, because this conduct occurred in\r\nMassachusetts.  See id.  Because the violation was willful, the\r\ncourt doubled ADL's damages to $920,000 plus statutory interest. \r\nSee id. at 927-28.\r\n          III.\r\nDooyang raises two issues on this appeal.  Dooyang first\r\ncontends that the special verdict form improperly precluded\r\nconsideration of Dooyang's counterclaims.  Second, Dooyang argues\r\nthat the district court misapplied the law in holding that\r\nDooyang's false promises to pay ADL constituted a Chapter 93A\r\nviolation.\r\nA.  The Special Verdict Form\r\nDooyang argues that the district court improperly\r\nprecluded consideration of its counterclaims by instructing the\r\njury to consider Dooyang's counterclaims only if it found that ADL\r\nhad failed to prove that Dooyang \"materially breached its contract\r\nto pay for services provided by ADL without legal excuse\" (emphasis\r\nadded).  According to Dooyang, the district court improperly\r\ncollapsed the whole of Dooyang's counterclaims into the phrase\r\n\"without legal excuse.\"\r\nThe parties dispute whether Dooyang properly objected to\r\nthe verdict form.  Where there has been a proper objection to a\r\nclaimed error in a special verdict form, our review is for an abuse\r\nof discretion.  See Transamerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, 107 F.3d\r\n925, 933 (1st Cir. 1997).  But where there is no objection, our\r\nreview is for plain error only.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d\r\nat 767.  Because even under the less deferential abuse of\r\ndiscretion standard there was no error, we do not decide whether\r\nDooyang's somewhat vague objection was adequate to preserve the\r\nclaim.\r\nUnder the abuse of discretion standard, we examine the\r\njury instructions as a whole to determine whether they confused or\r\nmisled the jury on the applicable law.  See Tatro v. Kervin, 41\r\nF.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1994).  We assume the jury listens to and\r\nfollows the judge's entire charge.  See United States v. Gonzalez-\r\nGonzalez, 136 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1998).  Nonconstitutional errors\r\nin a civil suit are harmless if it is probable that the error did\r\nnot affect the outcome of the case.  See Moulton v. Rival Co., 116\r\nF.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Putnam Resources v. Pateman,\r\n958 F.2d 448, 456 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[A] district court has wide\r\ndiscretion in constructing and utilizing verdict forms.\" (citations\r\nomitted)).\r\nThe district court's jury instructions made clear the\r\nburden ADL had to meet to prove that Dooyang breached the contract\r\n\"without legal excuse.\"  The court instructed the jury at length\r\nthat ADL had to prove the elements of its breach of contract\r\nclaim.            In addition, the court made it clear that it was ADL's\r\nburden to show that Dooyang did not have any \"legal excuse\" for its\r\nnon-payment.          \r\n     In fact, Dooyang was the beneficiary of this instruction. \r\nThe effect of the \"without legal excuse\" language was to shift the\r\nburden of proof on Dooyang's claims from Dooyang to ADL.  ADL was\r\nrequired to disprove Dooyang's counterclaims to prevail on its\r\nbreach of contract claim.  Because Dooyang presented its\r\ncounterclaims as defenses to ADL's breach of contract claim, it was\r\nrelieved of the burden of proving its assertions.  See ADL I, 928\r\nF. Supp. at 1205.  Instead, ADL had the burden to prove that\r\nDooyang's failure to pay the 1991 bills was \"without legal excuse.\" \r\nThe instructions on \"legal excuse\" make it clear that Dooyang did\r\nnot have to pay ADL if Dooyang's counterclaims had merit.  \r\n     Because the case involved a single contract, the jury\r\ncould not have found both in ADL's and Dooyang's favor.            Because\r\nthe jury found in ADL's favor, it necessarily rejected Dooyang's\r\ncounterclaims.  There was no abuse of discretion in the format of\r\nthe verdict form.\r\n          B.  The Chapter 93A Violation\r\n               Dooyang's second claim of error is that the district\r\ncourt misapplied the law of Chapter 93A.  Dooyang's argument has\r\ntwo components: first, that its actions were not \"unfair or\r\ndeceptive,\" and second, that those actions did not, in any event,\r\ncause a \"loss of money or property.\"  We review the district\r\ncourt's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law\r\nde novo.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d at 769.  \"Although\r\nwhether a particular set of acts, in their factual setting, is\r\nunfair or deceptive is a question of fact, the boundaries of what\r\nmay qualify for consideration as a [Chapter] 93A violation is a\r\nquestion of law.\"  Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 797 (1st Cir.\r\n1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n     Our review is of the district court's finding that the\r\n\"second act of deception,\" Dooyang's continual promises to pay ADL\r\nwhen it had no intent to do so as part of a strategy to force its\r\ncreditors to accept discounted settlements, constituted a violation\r\nof Chapter 93A.  Under Chapter 93A, the act or practice must be\r\n\"unfair or deceptive,\" must occur \"primarily and substantially\" in\r\nMassachusetts, and must cause a loss of \"money or property.\"  Based\r\non our review of the evidence, we find that the district court's\r\nfindings of fact are not clearly erroneous and we will not disturb\r\nthem.  We agree with the district court that Dooyang's \"second act\r\nof deception\" qualifies as a Chapter 93A violation.\r\n     1.  Unfair or Deceptive\r\n     Under  2 and 11 of Chapter 93A, it is unlawful for\r\nthose engaged in trade or commerce to employ \"unfair methods of\r\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in business\r\ntransactions with others engaged in trade or commerce.  Chapter 93A\r\n\"was designed to encourage more equitable behavior in the\r\nmarketplace and impose liability on persons seeking to profit from\r\nunfair practices.\"  Linkage Corp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 679\r\nN.E.2d 191, 208 (Mass. 1997) (citation, internal quotation marks\r\nand alterations omitted).  The statute does not specifically define\r\n\"unfair\" or \"deceptive.\"  See Ahern, 85 F.3d at 798 (\"[T]he statute\r\ndoes not contemplate an overly precise standard of ethical or moral\r\nbehavior.  It is the standard of the commercial marketplace.\"\r\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); Linkage Corp.,\r\n679 N.E.2d at 209 (\"A practice is unfair if it is within the\r\npenumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established\r\nconcept of unfairness; is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or\r\nunscrupulous; and causes substantial injury to other businessmen.\"\r\n(citation, internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).\r\n     The courts of Massachusetts have consistently held that\r\n\"conduct in disregard of known contractual arrangements and\r\nintended to secure benefits for the breaching party constitutes an\r\nunfair act or practice for c. 93A purposes.\"  Anthony's Pier Four,\r\nInc. v. HBC Assocs., 583 N.E.2d 806, 821 (Mass. 1991) (citation and\r\ninternal quotation marks omitted).  See Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling\r\nCo. v. Checkers, Inc., 754 F.2d 10, 17-19 (1st Cir. 1985) (Chapter\r\n93A violation found where payment withheld as a \"wedge\" to enhance\r\nbargaining power); Wang Labs., Inc. v. Business Incentives, Inc.,\r\n501 N.E.2d 1163 (Mass. 1986).  Where one party to an agreement\r\nemploys a breach of contract to gain an unfair advantage over the\r\nother, the breach \"has an extortionate quality that gives it the\r\nrancid flavor of unfairness.\"  Atkinson v. Rosenthal, 598 N.E.2d\r\n666, 670 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992) (citation omitted).  Indeed, conduct\r\nlargely equivalent to Dooyang's second act of deception has\r\nrecently been held to violate Chapter 93A.  See Community Builders,\r\nInc. v. Indian Motocycle Assocs., Inc., 692 N.E.2d 964, 978 (Mass.\r\nApp. Ct. 1998) (defendants \"withheld payment unconscionably,\r\nstringing [plaintiff] along . . . with a purpose of coercing\r\n[plaintiff] to settle for substantially less compensation than the\r\nparties had agreed to before the services were performed\").\r\n     The district court's factual finding of unfair practices\r\nis clearly supported by the evidence.  The court based its Chapter\r\n93A ruling both on testimony that Dooyang did not intend to pay ADL\r\nfor the work it performed and on documents which stated that\r\nDooyang was avoiding paying its creditors \"by all possible means\"\r\nand which created a mechanism for measuring the success of its\r\nstrategy by listing the reductions that resulted from Dooyang's\r\ndeceptive tactics.  As the district court found, Dooyang intended\r\nto force ADL into an unfavorable settlement by threatening\r\nlitigation.  There was no error in the court's finding that the\r\n\"second act of deception\" amounted to an \"unfair or deceptive act\r\nor practice\" under Chapter 93A.\r\n     Chapter 93A liability is decided case-by-case, and\r\nMassachusetts courts have consistently emphasized the \"fact-\r\nspecific nature of the inquiry.\"  Linkage Corp., 679 N.E.2d at 209.\r\nWe emphasize that this case did not involve a good faith dispute\r\nover billing or a simple breach of contract, each of which is an\r\ninsufficient basis for 93A liability.  See, e.g., Pepsi-Cola Metro.\r\nBottling Co., 754 F.2d at 18 (stating that \"mere breaches of\r\ncontract, without more, do not violate [C]hapter 93A\");\r\nWhitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas, 390 N.E.2d 243, 251 (Mass.\r\n1979).  This case is not like Quaker State Oil Ref. Corp. v.\r\nGarrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513-14 (1st Cir. 1989), which held\r\nthat refusal to pay an invoice without \"more\" was not enough to\r\nconstitute a 93A violation.  Here, Dooyang's wrongful purpose was\r\nto extract a favorable settlement from ADL for less than the amount\r\nDooyang knew that it owed by repeatedly promising to pay, not doing\r\nso, stringing out the process, and forcing ADL to sue.\r\n     These developments in Massachusetts law will require the\r\nMassachusetts courts to give greater definition and clarity to the\r\nparameters of  11 liability for those who do business in\r\nMassachusetts.  Mere failure to pay a bill, standing alone, does\r\nnot, it appears, give rise to such liability.  See id.  Where there\r\nis a good faith dispute over whether payment is actually owed, and\r\nthat dispute is clearly articulated, it also appears there is no\r\nChapter 93A liability.  See id.; Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc.,\r\n396 N.E.2d 149, 153 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979).  Of course, due to the\r\nfact-specific nature of the Chapter 93A inquiry, generalizations\r\nare always somewhat indeterminate.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85\r\nF.3d at 769 (\"Perhaps by design, the dimensions of Chapter 93A\r\nliability are difficult to discern with precision.\").  This case\r\ndoes not involve a mere failure to pay a bill, and the facts are\r\nsufficiently strong that we easily conclude they are actionable as\r\n\"unfair or deceptive\" under Chapter 93A.  We leave to the\r\ndevelopment of state law where the lines will be drawn in these\r\n\"the check is in the mail\" type cases.\r\n     2.  Loss of Money or Property\r\n     ADL had the burden of showing not only that the acts were\r\nunfair or deceptive, but also that it suffered a \"loss of money or\r\nproperty\" under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A,  11.  \"'[M]oney' means\r\nmoney, not time, and . . . 'property' means the kind of property\r\nthat is purchased or leased, not such intangibles as a right to a\r\nsense of security, to peace of mind, or to personal liberty.\" \r\nBaldassari v. Public Fin. Trust, 337 N.E.2d 701, 709 (Mass. 1975). \r\nAnd that loss of money or property must stem from Dooyang's\r\nmisrepresentations regarding payment.  See Lyle Richards Int'l,\r\nLtd. v. Ashworth, 132 F.3d 111, 114-15 (1st Cir. 1997) (loss of\r\nmoney or property required under  11 must stem from deceptive\r\nact).  It is the misrepresentations about payment which must have\r\ncaused the loss because those misrepresentations, not the formation\r\nof the contract extension itself, took place in Massachusetts and\r\nso are subject to Chapter 93A.  \"[W]hether the requisite causal\r\nconnection has been proven is one of fact\" that will not be set\r\naside unless clearly erroneous.  DiMarzo v. American Mut. Ins. Co.,\r\n449 N.E.2d 1189, 1199 (Mass. 1983) (citation omitted).\r\n     This requirement is satisfied by the combination of ADL's\r\nloss of the use of the money owed by Dooyang together with ADL's\r\nexpenses incurred attempting to collect Dooyang's debt.  While we\r\nhave found no  11 cases directly on point, a number of cases under\r\n 9 are helpful in the analysis.  The closest  11 case is\r\nCommunity Builders, in which false promises to pay and delay caused\r\na loss of use of money, attendant expenses, and caused plaintiff to\r\ncontinue to do work.  Here plaintiff did not continue to do work\r\nand so the Appeals Court did not face the precise issue that we\r\nface.\r\n     Massachusetts courts have held in  9 cases against\r\ninsurers under Chapter 93A and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D that the\r\nloss of the use of money owed to a plaintiff, once liability is\r\n\"reasonably clear,\" is a form of damage compensable by Chapter 93A. \r\nSee Clegg v. Butler, 676 N.E.2d 1134, 1139 (Mass. 1997) (stating\r\nthat \"when an insurer wrongfully withholds funds from a claimant,\r\nit is depriving the claimant of the use of those funds\" and so\r\nconstitutes injury cognizable under Chapter 93A though the insurer\r\neventually pays).  Clegg reiterated the rule announced in Schwartzv. Rose, 643 N.E.2d 105, 109 (Mass. 1994), that the loss of the use\r\nof money \"is precisely the type of damage we have described as\r\nappropriately being subject to multiplication . . . under c. 93A.\" \r\nSchwartz was not a claim against an insurer under Chapter 176D, and\r\nso we take it that the Schwartz rule has general application, at\r\nleast under  9.\r\n     In 1979 the Massachusetts legislature amended Chapter 93A\r\nto eliminate the requirement of pleading a loss of money or\r\nproperty under  9.  See Smith v. Caggiano, 421 N.E.2d 473, 475\r\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1981).  Now, under  9, a plaintiff must prove that\r\nhe or she has \"been injured\" by the defendant's unfair or deceptive\r\npractices.  Mass Gen. Laws. ch. 93A,  9.  One question is whether\r\nthe cases under  9, which requires only a showing that plaintiff\r\nhas \"been injured,\" provide guidance on what is meant by \"loss of\r\nmoney or property\" under  11.  The two phrases are not\r\ncoextensive.  \"Injury\" is a broader term, and includes, for\r\nexample, emotional distress.  See Leardi v. Brown, 474 N.E.2d 1094,\r\n1101 (Mass. 1985) (interpreting \"injury\" under  9 to include \"an\r\ninvasion of a legally protected interest, but no harm for which\r\nactual damages can be awarded\").  But loss of money or property is\r\ncertainly one form of injury.  \r\n     We think the  9 cases provide guidance.  In these  9\r\ncases, the court rejected arguments that the plaintiff suffered no\r\ninjury because he suffered only a delay in payment rather than an\r\nabsolute loss.  Certainly, the loss of use of money, along with\r\nattendant collection and other expenses would seem to be both an\r\n\"injury\" under  9 and a \"loss of money or property\" under  11. \r\nCf. Caggiano, 421 N.E.2d at 476 (\"'Money' means . . . 'money,' but\r\nits loss may occur short of physical transfer of legal tender.\").\r\n     In addition to the loss of the use of the money,\r\nDooyang's unfair withholding of payment caused ADL to make\r\nexpenditures to recover the money owed: long-distance phone calls\r\nand faxes to South Korea, and meetings with Dooyang executives. \r\nSuch expenditures have been found to satisfy the \"loss of money or\r\nproperty\" requirement.  See Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. Carlton\r\nAluminum of New England, 617 N.E.2d 1005, 1013 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1993) (\"Carlton did suffer an actual loss of money or property --\r\nby responding to customer complaints and lawsuits about the\r\ndefective siding . . . .\"); Bump v. Robbins, 509 N.E.2d 12, 22\r\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1987) (\"There is evidence of out-of-pocket\r\nexpenditures for travel and long-distance telephone calls, time\r\nspent at meetings and in other related activities, and the usual\r\ncharges Bump made for his time.\"); see also Baldassari, 337 N.E.2d\r\nat 709 (when plaintiffs suffered only emotional distress, no loss\r\nof money or property, but a different question would have been\r\npresented had plaintiffs suffered expenses).            This combination of\r\nexpenses and loss of use of money meant that ADL suffered a \"loss\r\nof money or property\" caused by Dooyang's second act of deception.\r\n     A question remains about the proper measure of damages in\r\nthis case.  The district court doubled the breach of contract\r\ndamages, but also ruled that Dooyang's initial act of deception was\r\nnot covered by Chapter 93A.  This theoretically could raise the\r\nissue of whether damages should be limited to only those damages\r\ncaused by the second act of deception or whether  11 precludes\r\nsuch a measure of damages.  Dooyang does not argue in its brief\r\nthat the court's doubling of the entire amount of the underlying\r\ncontract damages was error, but maintains only that there was no\r\nloss of money or property caused by the second deceptive act as\r\nrequired by  11.  Dooyang's brief perfunctorily challenges the\r\ndistrict court's decision to award double damages, but does not\r\naddress the proper amount to be doubled.  Dooyang has thus conceded\r\nthe issue of the amount to be doubled, and we do not reach the\r\ntheoretical issue.  See King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (claims not argued on appeal are deemed waived).\r\n     The district court awarded ADL double damages on the\r\nground that Dooyang's misconduct was \"willful and knowing.\"  The\r\ndistrict court clearly articulated its reasons for levying multiple\r\ndamages, and we agree.  See ADL II, 979 F. Supp. at 926-28.  For\r\nthe reasons stated in the opinion of the district court, we do not\r\nfind the award of double damages based on Dooyang's willful\r\ndeceptive acts to be excessive in this case.\r\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  Costs\r\nare awarded to ADL.\n",

Gen. Laws ch.  93A. The legal question raised here, one of first impression for this court, is whether when one business engages in unfair and deceptive practices towards another and the harm consists of a delay in payments owed (and the usual accompanying expenses), that is a \"loss of money or property\" establishing a violation under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11.

ADL has an office in Caracas, Venezuela.  Dooyang is an industrial conglomerate with headquarters in Seoul, South Korea.  Dooyang hired ADL from 1988 to 1991 to assist it in a conceptualized aluminum smelter project.  Though projects in other countries were initially considered, Dooyang soon instructed ADL to focus on opportunities for building a new smelter in Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, ADL informed Dooyang that it also worked for the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (\"CVG\"), an arm of the Venezuelan government responsible for awarding valuable \"debt-equity swap\" subsidies, and for the Venezuelan minister responsible for energy and metal production.  ADL was assisting CVG to attract investment in Venezuela.  Acquisition of the debt-equity swap subsidies awarded by CVG was thought to be the key to the success of a smelter project in Venezuela.  Dooyang consented to this conflict, apparently believing that ADL's insider influence would redound to Dooyang's benefit.  In March of 1989, ADL recommended that Dooyang invest in the construction of a new smelter rather than join an existing project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after, and wearing its other hat, ADL met with CVG to assist it in attracting international investment in the Venezuelan aluminum industry, and contracted with CVG to evaluate the relative merits of various aluminum smelter proposals.  Obviously, one of the proposals ADL could end up evaluating was that of its other client, Dooyang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1989, ADL and Dooyang entered into the first in a series of agreements under which ADL would assist Dooyang in developing a new smelter.  ADL pledged to use its \"best efforts\" to assist Dooyang in a wide variety of areas, including assembling the necessary financing and technical support, and lobbying the Venezuelan government on Dooyang's behalf.  ADL evaluated and selected advisers and partners in the project.  At no time, however, was ADL empowered to enter into contracts or make other commitments on Dooyang's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its other capacity, ADL advised CVG in July of 1989 to seek an investor which had the capacity to develop a smelter without partners.  ADL advised CVG to focus on projects by ALCOA and ALUMAX, and to consider as a third possibility either Cisneros/Rich or Austria Metall.  Dooyang could not develop a smelter by itself, but had to enter into partnerships with other companies.  At this point, however, Dooyang had not decided to go forward with a project in Venezuela, and so had no proposal then for consideration.  But that changed:  in January of 1990, Dooyang and CVG entered into an agreement which stated Dooyang's intent to build a smelter in Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract between ADL and Dooyang was to expire by its terms at the end of 1989.  ADL and Dooyang agreed to extend the contract for an additional six months in January of 1990.  During 1990, ADL also represented CVG in negotiations with other potential investors such as ALCOA.  Dooyang was aware that ADL's work for CVG involved contacting other competing investors.  ADL and Dooyang agreed to a third six-month extension of the contract in July of 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1990, ADL compared for CVG the relative merits of three smelter project proposals by ALCOA, Dooyang, and ALUMAX.  ADL stressed that ALCOA was the only company capable of proceeding with a smelter on its own.  ADL recommended that CVG \"be more aggressive\" with ALUMAX in order to keep its interest.  With regard to Dooyang, ADL said that Dooyang was \"serious about the project\" and that they were \"spending major funds to advance their position,\" and that ADL was \"confident that they will continue to move very rapidly.\"   ADL later reiterated to CVG that because ALCOA had all of the needed elements \"in house,\" great effort should be expended to realize the ALCOA project.  In a July 1990 report, ADL identified the ALCOA and ALUMAX projects as the \"focus\" projects, and stated that Dooyang was \"one of the leading projects.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang was aware that ADL was evaluating competing projects for CVG. ADL provided Dooyang with partial copies of its presentations to CVG, and assured Dooyang that ADL had convinced CVG \"that the Dooyang project is the number one project to support.\"   Dooyang submitted its project proposal and bid for subsidies from the Venezuelan government in December of 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Dooyang and its equity partners proposed building a smelter on the Orinoco river, dubbed the \"Orinoco project.\"   CVG rejected Dooyang's Orinoco project application in March of 1991 in favor of the ALCOA project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang met with ADL in Caracas to discuss resubmitting the proposal.  In early 1991, ADL and Dooyang again extended the letter agreement.  At least by April 20, 1991, as the district judge subsequently found, Dooyang decided not to pay ADL.  Dooyang felt that ADL should do the work on the second subsidy application for free because Dooyang had spent millions on this project with no result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Dooyang did not inform ADL that it expected ADL to continue working for no compensation, and Dooyang continued to request ADL's services after it had decided not to pay for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dooyang Orinoco project proposal was resubmitted on April 26, 1991.  In June, the Venezuelan government approved the project, and in July it awarded subsidy rights to Dooyang as well as to a third company.  Dooyang thanked ADL for its assistance, and did not further extend its contract with ADL.  The smelter was never built.  Dooyang's major partners pulled out of the project, and the collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a plunge in aluminum prices which rendered the project economically infeasible then.  Dooyang had incurred over $9 million in costs connected to the Orinoco project.  ADL had been paid over $2.2 million for its work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ADL had worked from March through June of 1991, and billed Dooyang approximately $460,000 for these services.  It is the invoices for this work which were not paid and became the subject of a breach of contract claim.  It is how Dooyang behaved in not paying the bills which became the basis for the unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang repeatedly promised to pay the outstanding ADL invoices, though it had no intent to do so.  Dooyang falsely blamed the hold-up in payment on bureaucratic delays and supposed problems with currency regulations.  After ADL inquired about the unpaid invoices, Dooyang provided ADL with a letter stating that Dooyang was \"sorry for your inconvenience caused by the delay of payment, and ... appreciate[d] ... your kind understanding of the time consuming procedure.\"   The letter stated that the outstanding balance would be settled by the end of October 1991 at the latest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late October 1991, ADL again insisted on payment and Dooyang replied that the invoices would be settled by \"December 1991/January 1992.\"   In a November 1991 meeting in ADL's Cambridge offices, Dooyang agreed to pay the outstanding invoices by January 1, 1992.  Dooyang missed that deadline, and ADL again made repeated inquiries about payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Dooyang sent a letter to ADL's Cambridge office in March of 1992 stating that Dooyang had \"no intention to delay or discard the payment\" and promised to pay starting in January of 1993.  The letter assured ADL that \"[a]ll outstanding payment will be cleared up no later than June 30, 1993 at the latest.\"   Dooyang missed that deadline, and an ADL executive contacted the President of Dooyang directly, who professed to be unaware of the problem.  Dooyang again promised to pay ADL by June of 1993.  Once again, Dooyang missed the deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even while Dooyang was falsely promising to pay ADL and its other creditors, it continued to exploit the benefits of their unpaid work.  Dooyang continued to pursue the smelter project, and as late as August of 1994, Dooyang was dealing directly with CVG and expressing \"keen interest\" in pursuing the project.  It still did not pay ADL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang's dissembling was part of its deliberate strategy on the Orinoco project.  Dooyang's strategy was to force its creditors to accept deeply discounted payments by forcing them to litigate to collect on their bills.  This was not a matter of inference.  Dooyang said as much in its business documents.  In its internal 1992 Business Report, Dooyang stated that it had been \"delaying accounts payable associated with the Orinoco project by all possible means.\"   The Business Report included a chart listing each of Dooyang's advisors on the Orinoco project, followed by a column titled \"ACCOUNT PAYABLE\" listing the amounts Dooyang owed them, and another, blank column titled \"Settlement\" for listing the amounts to which Dooyang was able to reduce the fee through its delaying tactics.  Other advisors on the project also had to resort to litigation to recover their unpaid fees after receiving similar empty promises about the payment of outstanding bills.  Not one of Dooyang's five largest creditors was paid anything without first resorting to litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Dooyang made repeated written intentional representations to ADL concerning its intent to pay the invoices, and found that from at least April 20, 1991, Dooyang had no intent to pay ADL.  The district court found that, once the project began to founder, \"Dooyang abandoned any intent to pay any consultants, including ADL, made false representations about intent to pay, never had any good faith basis for delaying payment, and intended to force ADL to litigate as leverage to force a favorable settlement.\"  ADL II, 979 F.Supp. at 924.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ADL sued Dooyang in Massachusetts state court in August 1994 on theories of breach of contract, fraud, and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of Chapter 93A.  Dooyang removed the case to federal court in September 1994.  Dooyang counterclaimed, arguing that it did not have to pay ADL.  Dooyang alleged that ADL fraudulently induced it to enter into the consulting agreements and made continuous fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations, that ADL failed to provide Dooyang with \"accurate and complete information\" about the smelter project in Venezuela, that ADL breached its contract because it failed to use its \"best efforts,\" and that ADL violated Chapter 93A through unfair or deceptive business practices.  Dooyang's counterclaims were based on ADL's work for the Venezuelan government and Dooyang's perception that ADL was duplicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted ADL's motion for summary judgment on Dooyang's Chapter 93A claim.  ADL voluntarily dismissed its fraud claims on the eve of trial.  After a jury trial on the remaining claims and counterclaims, except ADL's Chapter 93A claim, the jury found, after two days of deliberation, in favor of ADL on its breach of contract claim and awarded it $460,000 in damages (the full amount of its bills for services rendered from March to June 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Chapter 93A claim (triable to the court under Massachusetts law), the district court concluded that ADL had proved that Dooyang engaged in \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"   These acts or practices were:  Dooyang's ordering consulting services without intending to pay for them, Dooyang's expressing intent to pay ADL when it had no intent to do so, and Dooyang's strategy of \"commercial extortion\" by which it attempted to force favorable price concessions through the threat of litigation.  See ADL II, 979 F.Supp. at 925.   Under Chapter 93A, the unfair or deceptive conduct must \"occur primarily and substantially within Massachusetts\" to be actionable.  The court ruled that only Dooyang's conduct in misleading ADL about paying its bills was a 93A violation, because this conduct occurred in Massachusetts. See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because the violation was willful, the court doubled ADL's damages to $920,000 plus statutory interest.  See id. at 927-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang raises two issues on this appeal.  Dooyang first contends that the special verdict form improperly precluded consideration of Dooyang's counterclaims.  Second, Dooyang argues that the district court misapplied the law in holding that Dooyang's false promises to pay ADL constituted a Chapter 93A violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Special Verdict Form</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang argues that the district court improperly precluded consideration of its counterclaims by instructing the jury to consider Dooyang's counterclaims only if it found that ADL had failed to prove that Dooyang \"materially breached its contract to pay for services provided by ADL without legal excuse \" (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  According to Dooyang, the district court improperly collapsed the whole of Dooyang's counterclaims into the phrase \"without legal excuse.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether Dooyang properly objected to the verdict form.  Where there has been a proper objection to a claimed error in a special verdict form, our review is for an abuse of discretion.  See Transamerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, 107 F.3d 925, 933 (1st Cir.1997).  But where there is no objection, our review is for plain error only.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d at 767.   Because even under the less deferential abuse of discretion standard there was no error, we do not decide whether Dooyang's somewhat vague objection was adequate to preserve the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the abuse of discretion standard, we examine the jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they confused or misled the jury on the applicable law.  See Tatro v. Kervin, 41 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.1994).  We assume the jury listens to and follows the judge's entire charge.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 136 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.1998).  Nonconstitutional errors in a civil suit are harmless if it is probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.  See Moulton v. Rival Co., 116 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1997);  see also Putnam Resources v. Pateman, 958 F.2d 448, 456 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[A] district court has wide discretion in constructing and utilizing verdict forms.\"  (citations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's jury instructions made clear the burden ADL had to meet to prove that Dooyang breached the contract \"without legal excuse.\"   The court instructed the jury at length that ADL had to prove the elements of its breach of contract claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In addition, the court made it clear that it was ADL's burden to show that Dooyang did not have any \"legal excuse\" for its non-payment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, Dooyang was the beneficiary of this instruction.  The effect of the \"without legal excuse\" language was to shift the burden of proof on Dooyang's claims from Dooyang to ADL.  ADL was required to disprove Dooyang's counterclaims to prevail on its breach of contract claim.  Because Dooyang presented its counterclaims as defenses to ADL's breach of contract claim, it was relieved of the burden of proving its assertions.  See ADL I, 928 F.Supp. at 1205.   Instead, ADL had the burden to prove that Dooyang's failure to pay the 1991 bills was \"without legal excuse.\"   The instructions on \"legal excuse\" make it clear that Dooyang did not have to pay ADL if Dooyang's counterclaims had merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the case involved a single contract, the jury could not have found both in ADL's and Dooyang's favor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Because the jury found in ADL's favor, it necessarily rejected Dooyang's counterclaims.  There was no abuse of discretion in the format of the verdict form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Chapter 93A Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang's second claim of error is that the district court misapplied the law of Chapter 93A.  Dooyang's argument has two components:  first, that its actions were not \"unfair or deceptive,\" and second, that those actions did not, in any event, cause a \"loss of money or property.\"   We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d at 769.  \"Although whether a particular set of acts, in their factual setting, is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact, the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a [Chapter] 93A violation is a question of law.\"  Ahern v.

Under Chapter 93A, the act or practice must be \"unfair or deceptive,\" must occur \"primarily and substantially\" in Massachusetts, and must cause a loss of \"money or property.\"   Based on our review of the evidence, we find that the district court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and we will not disturb them.  We agree with the district court that Dooyang's \"second act of deception\" qualifies as a Chapter 93A violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Unfair or Deceptive</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167;&#167; 2 and 11 of Chapter 93A, it is unlawful for those engaged in trade or commerce to employ \"unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in business transactions with others engaged in trade or commerce.  Chapter 93A \"was designed to encourage more equitable behavior in the marketplace and impose liability on persons seeking to profit from unfair practices.\"  Linkage Corp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 425 Mass. 1, 679 N.E.2d 191, 208 (1997) (citation, internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  The statute does not specifically define \"unfair\" or \"deceptive.\"   See Ahern, 85 F.3d at 798 (\"[T]he statute does not contemplate an overly precise standard of ethical or moral behavior.  It is the standard of the commercial marketplace.\"  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted));  Linkage Corp., 679 N.E.2d at 209 (\"A practice is unfair if it is within the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness;  is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous;  and causes substantial injury to other businessmen.\"  (citation, internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts of Massachusetts have consistently held that \"conduct in disregard of known contractual arrangements and intended to secure benefits for the breaching party constitutes an unfair act or practice for c. 93A purposes.\"  Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., 411 Mass. 451, 583 N.E.2d 806, 821 (1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  See Pepsi-Cola Metro.  Bottling Co. v. Checkers, Inc., 754 F.2d 10, 17-19 (1st Cir.1985) (Chapter 93A violation found where payment withheld as a \"wedge\" to enhance bargaining power);  Wang Labs., Inc. v. Business Incentives, Inc., 398 Mass. 854, 501 N.E.2d 1163 (1986).  Where one party to an agreement employs a breach of contract to gain an unfair advantage over the other, the breach \"has an extortionate quality that gives it the rancid flavor of unfairness.\"  Atkinson v. Rosenthal, 33 Mass.App.Ct. 219, 598 N.E.2d 666, 670 (1992) (citation omitted).  Indeed, conduct largely equivalent to Dooyang's second act of deception has recently been held to violate Chapter 93A.  See Community Builders, Inc. v. Indian Motocycle Assocs., Inc., 44 Mass.App.Ct. 537, 692 N.E.2d 964, 978 (1998) (defendants \"withheld payment unconscionably, stringing [plaintiff] along ... with a purpose of coercing [plaintiff] to settle for substantially less compensation than the parties had agreed to before the services were performed\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's factual finding of unfair practices is clearly supported by the evidence.  The court based its Chapter 93A ruling both on testimony that Dooyang did not intend to pay ADL for the work it performed and on documents which stated that Dooyang was avoiding paying its creditors \"by all possible means\" and which created a mechanism for measuring the success of its strategy by listing the reductions that resulted from Dooyang's deceptive tactics.  As the district court found, Dooyang intended to force ADL into an unfavorable settlement by threatening litigation.  There was no error in the court's finding that the \"second act of deception\" amounted to an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" under Chapter 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapter 93A liability is decided case-by-case, and Massachusetts courts have consistently emphasized the \"fact-specific nature of the inquiry.\"  Linkage Corp., 679 N.E.2d at 209.   We emphasize that this case did not involve a good faith dispute over billing or a simple breach of contract, each of which is an insufficient basis for 93A liability.  See, e.g., Pepsi-Cola Metro.  Bottling Co., 754 F.2d at 18 (stating that \"mere breaches of contract, without more, do not violate [C]hapter 93A\");  Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v. Kotseas, 378 Mass. 85, 390 N.E.2d 243, 251 (1979).  This case is not like Quaker State Oil Refining Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513-14 (1st Cir.1989), which held that refusal to pay an invoice without \"more\" was not enough to constitute a 93A violation.  Here, Dooyang's wrongful purpose was to extract a favorable settlement from ADL for less than the amount Dooyang knew that it owed by repeatedly promising to pay, not doing so, stringing out the process, and forcing ADL to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These developments in Massachusetts law will require the Massachusetts courts to give greater definition and clarity to the parameters of &#167; 11 liability for those who do business in Massachusetts.  Mere failure to pay a bill, standing alone, does not, it appears, give rise to such liability.  See id.   Where there is a good faith dispute over whether payment is actually owed, and that dispute is clearly articulated, it also appears there is no Chapter 93A liability.  See id.;  Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., 8 Mass.App.Ct. 498, 396 N.E.2d 149, 153 (1979).  Of course, due to the fact-specific nature of the Chapter 93A inquiry, generalizations are always somewhat indeterminate.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d at 769 (\"Perhaps by design, the dimensions of Chapter 93A liability are difficult to discern with precision.\").  This case does not involve a mere failure to pay a bill, and the facts are sufficiently strong that we easily conclude they are actionable as \"unfair or deceptive\" under Chapter 93A.  We leave to the development of state law where the lines will be drawn in these \"the check is in the mail\" type cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Loss of Money or Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ADL had the burden of showing not only that the acts were unfair or deceptive, but also that it suffered a \"loss of money or property\" under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11.  \" '[M]oney' means money, not time, and ... 'property' means the kind of property that is purchased or leased, not such intangibles as a right to a sense of security, to peace of mind, or to personal liberty.\"  Baldassari v. Public Fin.  Trust, 369 Mass. 33, 337 N.E.2d 701, 709 (1975).  And that loss of money or property must stem from Dooyang's misrepresentations regarding payment.  See Lyle Richards Int'l, Ltd. v. Ashworth, 132 F.3d 111, 114-15 (1st Cir.1997) (loss of money or property required under &#167; 11 must stem from deceptive act).  It is the misrepresentations about payment which must have caused the loss because those misrepresentations, not the formation of the contract extension itself, took place in Massachusetts and so are subject to Chapter 93A.  \"[W]hether the requisite causal connection has been proven is one of fact\" that will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.  DiMarzo v. American Mut. Ins. Co., 389 Mass. 85, 449 N.E.2d 1189, 1199 (1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This requirement is satisfied by the combination of ADL's loss of the use of the money owed by Dooyang together with ADL's expenses incurred attempting to collect Dooyang's debt.  While we have found no &#167; 11 cases directly on point, a number of cases under &#167; 9 are helpful in the analysis.  The closest &#167; 11 case is Community Builders, in which false promises to pay and delay caused a loss of use of money, attendant expenses, and caused plaintiff to continue to do work.  Here plaintiff did not continue to do work and so the Appeals Court did not face the precise issue that we face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts have held in &#167; 9 cases against insurers under Chapter 93A and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  176D that the loss of the use of money owed to a plaintiff, once liability is \"reasonably clear,\" is a form of damage compensable by Chapter 93A.  See Clegg v. Butler, 424 Mass. 413, 676 N.E.2d 1134, 1139 (1997) (stating that \"when an insurer wrongfully withholds funds from a claimant, it is depriving the claimant of the use of those funds\" and so constitutes injury cognizable under Chapter 93A though the insurer eventually pays).  Clegg reiterated the rule announced in Schwartz v. Rose, 418 Mass. 41, 634 N.E.2d 105, 109 (1994), that the loss of the use of money \"is precisely the type of damage we have described as appropriately being subject to multiplication ... under c. 93A.\"  Schwartz was not a claim against an insurer under Chapter 176D, and so we take it that the Schwartz rule has general application, at least under &#167; 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1979 the Massachusetts legislature amended Chapter 93A to eliminate the requirement of pleading a loss of money or property under &#167; 9. See Smith v. Caggiano, 12 Mass.App.Ct. 41, 421 N.E.2d 473, 475 (1981).  Now, under &#167; 9, a plaintiff must prove that he or she has \"been injured\" by the defendant's unfair or deceptive practices.  Mass Gen. Laws. ch.  93A, &#167; 9. One question is whether the cases under &#167; 9, which requires only a showing that plaintiff has \"been injured,\" provide guidance on what is meant by \"loss of money or property\" under &#167; 11.  The two phrases are not coextensive.  \"Injury\" is a broader term, and includes, for example, emotional distress.  See Leardi v. Brown, 394 Mass. 151, 474 N.E.2d 1094, 1101 (1985) (interpreting \"injury\" under &#167; 9 to include \"an invasion of a legally protected interest, but no harm for which actual damages can be awarded\").  But loss of money or property is certainly one form of injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the &#167; 9 cases provide guidance.  In these &#167; 9 cases, the court rejected arguments that the plaintiff suffered no injury because he suffered only a delay in payment rather than an absolute loss.  Certainly, the loss of use of money, along with attendant collection and other expenses would seem to be both an \"injury\" under &#167; 9 and a \"loss of money or property\" under &#167; 11.  Cf. Caggiano, 421 N.E.2d at 476 (\" 'Money' means ... 'money,' but its loss may occur short of physical transfer of legal tender.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the loss of the use of the money, Dooyang's unfair withholding of payment caused ADL to make expenditures to recover the money owed:  long-distance phone calls and faxes to South Korea, and meetings with Dooyang executives.  Such expenditures have been found to satisfy the \"loss of money or property\" requirement.  See Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. Carlton Aluminum of New England, 35 Mass.App.Ct. 161, 617 N.E.2d 1005, 1013 (1993) (\"Carlton did suffer an actual loss of money or property--by responding to customer complaints and lawsuits about the defective siding....\");  Bump v. Robbins, 24 Mass.App.Ct. 296, 509 N.E.2d 12, 22 (1987) (\"There is evidence of out-of-pocket expenditures for travel and long-distance telephone calls, time spent at meetings and in other related activities, and the usual charges Bump made for his time.\");   see also Baldassari, 337 N.E.2d at 709 (when plaintiffs suffered only emotional distress, no loss of money or property, but a different question would have been presented had plaintiffs suffered expenses).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  This combination of expenses and loss of use of money meant that ADL suffered a \"loss of money or property\" caused by Dooyang's second act of deception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A question remains about the proper measure of damages in this case.  The district court doubled the breach of contract damages, but also ruled that Dooyang's initial act of deception was not covered by Chapter 93A.  This theoretically could raise the issue of whether damages should be limited to only those damages caused by the second act of deception or whether &#167; 11 precludes such a measure of damages.  Dooyang does not argue in its brief that the court's doubling of the entire amount of the underlying contract damages was error, but maintains only that there was no loss of money or property caused by the second deceptive act as required by &#167; 11.  Dooyang's brief perfunctorily challenges the district court's decision to award double damages, but does not address the proper amount to be doubled.  Dooyang has thus conceded the issue of the amount to be doubled, and we do not reach the theoretical issue.  See King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st Cir.1997) (claims not argued on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded ADL double damages on the ground that Dooyang's misconduct was \"willful and knowing.\"   The district court clearly articulated its reasons for levying multiple damages, and we agree.  See ADL II, 979 F.Supp. at 926-28.   For the reasons stated in the opinion of the district court, we do not find the award of double damages based on Dooyang's willful deceptive acts to be excessive in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

Gen. Laws ch.  93A. The legal question raised here, one of first impression for this court, is whether when one business engages in unfair and deceptive practices towards another and the harm consists of a delay in payments owed (and the usual accompanying expenses), that is a \"loss of money or property\" establishing a violation under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11.  The high costs imposed are that the damages awarded are not those attributed solely to the nonpayment but rather may be multiples of the amount of payments originally owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guided by the decisions of the courts of Massachusetts, as we must be in this diversity case, we answer this question in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of the district court.

ADL has an office in Caracas, Venezuela.  Dooyang is an industrial conglomerate with headquarters in Seoul, South Korea.  Dooyang hired ADL from 1988 to 1991 to assist it in a conceptualized aluminum smelter project.  Though projects in other countries were initially considered, Dooyang soon instructed ADL to focus on opportunities for building a new smelter in Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, ADL informed Dooyang that it also worked for the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (\"CVG\"), an arm of the Venezuelan government responsible for awarding valuable \"debt-equity swap\" subsidies, and for the Venezuelan minister responsible for energy and metal production.  ADL was assisting CVG to attract investment in Venezuela.  Acquisition of the debt-equity swap subsidies awarded by CVG was thought to be the key to the success of a smelter project in Venezuela.  Dooyang consented to this conflict, apparently believing that ADL's insider influence would redound to Dooyang's benefit.  In March of 1989, ADL recommended that Dooyang invest in the construction of a new smelter rather than join an existing project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after, and wearing its other hat, ADL met with CVG to assist it in attracting international investment in the Venezuelan aluminum industry, and contracted with CVG to evaluate the relative merits of various aluminum smelter proposals.  Obviously, one of the proposals ADL could end up evaluating was that of its other client, Dooyang.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1989, ADL and Dooyang entered into the first in a series of agreements under which ADL would assist Dooyang in developing a new smelter.  ADL pledged to use its \"best efforts\" to assist Dooyang in a wide variety of areas, including assembling the necessary financing and technical support, and lobbying the Venezuelan government on Dooyang's behalf.  ADL evaluated and selected advisers and partners in the project.  At no time, however, was ADL empowered to enter into contracts or make other commitments on Dooyang's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its other capacity, ADL advised CVG in July of 1989 to seek an investor which had the capacity to develop a smelter without partners.  ADL advised CVG to focus on projects by ALCOA and ALUMAX, and to consider as a third possibility either Cisneros/Rich or Austria Metall.  Dooyang could not develop a smelter by itself, but had to enter into partnerships with other companies.  At this point, however, Dooyang had not decided to go forward with a project in Venezuela, and so had no proposal then for consideration.  But that changed:  in January of 1990, Dooyang and CVG entered into an agreement which stated Dooyang's intent to build a smelter in Venezuela.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract between ADL and Dooyang was to expire by its terms at the end of 1989.  ADL and Dooyang agreed to extend the contract for an additional six months in January of 1990.  During 1990, ADL also represented CVG in negotiations with other potential investors such as ALCOA.  Dooyang was aware that ADL's work for CVG involved contacting other competing investors.  ADL and Dooyang agreed to a third six-month extension of the contract in July of 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1990, ADL compared for CVG the relative merits of three smelter project proposals by ALCOA, Dooyang, and ALUMAX.  ADL stressed that ALCOA was the only company capable of proceeding with a smelter on its own.  ADL recommended that CVG \"be more aggressive\" with ALUMAX in order to keep its interest.  With regard to Dooyang, ADL said that Dooyang was \"serious about the project\" and that they were \"spending major funds to advance their position,\" and that ADL was \"confident that they will continue to move very rapidly.\"   ADL later reiterated to CVG that because ALCOA had all of the needed elements \"in house,\" great effort should be expended to realize the ALCOA project.  In a July 1990 report, ADL identified the ALCOA and ALUMAX projects as the \"focus\" projects, and stated that Dooyang was \"one of the leading projects.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang was aware that ADL was evaluating competing projects for CVG. ADL provided Dooyang with partial copies of its presentations to CVG, and assured Dooyang that ADL had convinced CVG \"that the Dooyang project is the number one project to support.\"   Dooyang submitted its project proposal and bid for subsidies from the Venezuelan government in December of 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Dooyang and its equity partners proposed building a smelter on the Orinoco river, dubbed the \"Orinoco project.\"   CVG rejected Dooyang's Orinoco project application in March of 1991 in favor of the ALCOA project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang met with ADL in Caracas to discuss resubmitting the proposal.  In early 1991, ADL and Dooyang again extended the letter agreement.  At least by April 20, 1991, as the district judge subsequently found, Dooyang decided not to pay ADL.  Dooyang felt that ADL should do the work on the second subsidy application for free because Dooyang had spent millions on this project with no result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Dooyang did not inform ADL that it expected ADL to continue working for no compensation, and Dooyang continued to request ADL's services after it had decided not to pay for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Dooyang Orinoco project proposal was resubmitted on April 26, 1991.  In June, the Venezuelan government approved the project, and in July it awarded subsidy rights to Dooyang as well as to a third company.  Dooyang thanked ADL for its assistance, and did not further extend its contract with ADL.  The smelter was never built.  Dooyang's major partners pulled out of the project, and the collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a plunge in aluminum prices which rendered the project economically infeasible then.  Dooyang had incurred over $9 million in costs connected to the Orinoco project.  ADL had been paid over $2.2 million for its work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ADL had worked from March through June of 1991, and billed Dooyang approximately $460,000 for these services.  It is the invoices for this work which were not paid and became the subject of a breach of contract claim.  It is how Dooyang behaved in not paying the bills which became the basis for the unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang repeatedly promised to pay the outstanding ADL invoices, though it had no intent to do so.  Dooyang falsely blamed the hold-up in payment on bureaucratic delays and supposed problems with currency regulations.  After ADL inquired about the unpaid invoices, Dooyang provided ADL with a letter stating that Dooyang was \"sorry for your inconvenience caused by the delay of payment, and ... appreciate[d] ... your kind understanding of the time consuming procedure.\"   The letter stated that the outstanding balance would be settled by the end of October 1991 at the latest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late October 1991, ADL again insisted on payment and Dooyang replied that the invoices would be settled by \"December 1991/January 1992.\"   In a November 1991 meeting in ADL's Cambridge offices, Dooyang agreed to pay the outstanding invoices by January 1, 1992.  Dooyang missed that deadline, and ADL again made repeated inquiries about payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Dooyang sent a letter to ADL's Cambridge office in March of 1992 stating that Dooyang had \"no intention to delay or discard the payment\" and promised to pay starting in January of 1993.  The letter assured ADL that \"[a]ll outstanding payment will be cleared up no later than June 30, 1993 at the latest.\"   Dooyang missed that deadline, and an ADL executive contacted the President of Dooyang directly, who professed to be unaware of the problem.  Dooyang again promised to pay ADL by June of 1993.  Once again, Dooyang missed the deadline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even while Dooyang was falsely promising to pay ADL and its other creditors, it continued to exploit the benefits of their unpaid work.  Dooyang continued to pursue the smelter project, and as late as August of 1994, Dooyang was dealing directly with CVG and expressing \"keen interest\" in pursuing the project.  It still did not pay ADL.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang's dissembling was part of its deliberate strategy on the Orinoco project.  Dooyang's strategy was to force its creditors to accept deeply discounted payments by forcing them to litigate to collect on their bills.  This was not a matter of inference.  Dooyang said as much in its business documents.  In its internal 1992 Business Report, Dooyang stated that it had been \"delaying accounts payable associated with the Orinoco project by all possible means.\"   The Business Report included a chart listing each of Dooyang's advisors on the Orinoco project, followed by a column titled \"ACCOUNT PAYABLE\" listing the amounts Dooyang owed them, and another, blank column titled \"Settlement\" for listing the amounts to which Dooyang was able to reduce the fee through its delaying tactics.  Other advisors on the project also had to resort to litigation to recover their unpaid fees after receiving similar empty promises about the payment of outstanding bills.  Not one of Dooyang's five largest creditors was paid anything without first resorting to litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Dooyang made repeated written intentional representations to ADL concerning its intent to pay the invoices, and found that from at least April 20, 1991, Dooyang had no intent to pay ADL.  The district court found that, once the project began to founder, \"Dooyang abandoned any intent to pay any consultants, including ADL, made false representations about intent to pay, never had any good faith basis for delaying payment, and intended to force ADL to litigate as leverage to force a favorable settlement.\"  ADL II, 979 F.Supp. at 924.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ADL sued Dooyang in Massachusetts state court in August 1994 on theories of breach of contract, fraud, and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of Chapter 93A.  Dooyang removed the case to federal court in September 1994.  Dooyang counterclaimed, arguing that it did not have to pay ADL.  Dooyang alleged that ADL fraudulently induced it to enter into the consulting agreements and made continuous fraudulent and negligent misrepresentations, that ADL failed to provide Dooyang with \"accurate and complete information\" about the smelter project in Venezuela, that ADL breached its contract because it failed to use its \"best efforts,\" and that ADL violated Chapter 93A through unfair or deceptive business practices.  Dooyang's counterclaims were based on ADL's work for the Venezuelan government and Dooyang's perception that ADL was duplicitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted ADL's motion for summary judgment on Dooyang's Chapter 93A claim.  ADL voluntarily dismissed its fraud claims on the eve of trial.  After a jury trial on the remaining claims and counterclaims, except ADL's Chapter 93A claim, the jury found, after two days of deliberation, in favor of ADL on its breach of contract claim and awarded it $460,000 in damages (the full amount of its bills for services rendered from March to June 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Chapter 93A claim (triable to the court under Massachusetts law), the district court concluded that ADL had proved that Dooyang engaged in \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"   These acts or practices were:  Dooyang's ordering consulting services without intending to pay for them, Dooyang's expressing intent to pay ADL when it had no intent to do so, and Dooyang's strategy of \"commercial extortion\" by which it attempted to force favorable price concessions through the threat of litigation.  See ADL II, 979 F.Supp. at 925.   Under Chapter 93A, the unfair or deceptive conduct must \"occur primarily and substantially within Massachusetts\" to be actionable.  The court ruled that only Dooyang's conduct in misleading ADL about paying its bills was a 93A violation, because this conduct occurred in Massachusetts. See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Because the violation was willful, the court doubled ADL's damages to $920,000 plus statutory interest.  See id. at 927-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang raises two issues on this appeal.  Dooyang first contends that the special verdict form improperly precluded consideration of Dooyang's counterclaims.  Second, Dooyang argues that the district court misapplied the law in holding that Dooyang's false promises to pay ADL constituted a Chapter 93A violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Special Verdict Form</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang argues that the district court improperly precluded consideration of its counterclaims by instructing the jury to consider Dooyang's counterclaims only if it found that ADL had failed to prove that Dooyang \"materially breached its contract to pay for services provided by ADL without legal excuse \" (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  According to Dooyang, the district court improperly collapsed the whole of Dooyang's counterclaims into the phrase \"without legal excuse.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties dispute whether Dooyang properly objected to the verdict form.  Where there has been a proper objection to a claimed error in a special verdict form, our review is for an abuse of discretion.  See Transamerica Premier Ins. Co. v. Ober, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197226\"><a href=\"/opinion/197226/transamerica-v-ober/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span>, 933 (1st Cir.1997).  But where there is no objection, our review is for plain error only.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d at 767.   Because even under the less deferential abuse of discretion standard there was no error, we do not decide whether Dooyang's somewhat vague objection was adequate to preserve the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the abuse of discretion standard, we examine the jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they confused or misled the jury on the applicable law.  See Tatro v. Kervin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195760\"><a href=\"/opinion/195760/tatro-v-kervin/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1994).  We assume the jury listens to and follows the judge's entire charge.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197783\"><a href=\"/opinion/197783/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1998).  Nonconstitutional errors in a civil suit are harmless if it is probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.  See Moulton v. Rival Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741905\"><a href=\"/opinion/741905/prodliabrep-cch-p-14989-christopher-moulton-v-the-rival-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1997);  see also Putnam Resources v.

The effect of the \"without legal excuse\" language was to shift the burden of proof on Dooyang's claims from Dooyang to ADL.  ADL was required to disprove Dooyang's counterclaims to prevail on its breach of contract claim.  Because Dooyang presented its counterclaims as defenses to ADL's breach of contract claim, it was relieved of the burden of proving its assertions.  See ADL I, 928 F.Supp. at 1205.   Instead, ADL had the burden to prove that Dooyang's failure to pay the 1991 bills was \"without legal excuse.\"   The instructions on \"legal excuse\" make it clear that Dooyang did not have to pay ADL if Dooyang's counterclaims had merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the case involved a single contract, the jury could not have found both in ADL's and Dooyang's favor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Because the jury found in ADL's favor, it necessarily rejected Dooyang's counterclaims.  There was no abuse of discretion in the format of the verdict form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Chapter 93A Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dooyang's second claim of error is that the district court misapplied the law of Chapter 93A.  Dooyang's argument has two components:  first, that its actions were not \"unfair or deceptive,\" and second, that those actions did not, in any event, cause a \"loss of money or property.\"   We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d at 769.  \"Although whether a particular set of acts, in their factual setting, is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact, the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a [Chapter] 93A violation is a question of law.\"  Ahern v.

Under Chapter 93A, the act or practice must be \"unfair or deceptive,\" must occur \"primarily and substantially\" in Massachusetts, and must cause a loss of \"money or property.\"   Based on our review of the evidence, we find that the district court's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and we will not disturb them.  We agree with the district court that Dooyang's \"second act of deception\" qualifies as a Chapter 93A violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

The court based its Chapter 93A ruling both on testimony that Dooyang did not intend to pay ADL for the work it performed and on documents which stated that Dooyang was avoiding paying its creditors \"by all possible means\" and which created a mechanism for measuring the success of its strategy by listing the reductions that resulted from Dooyang's deceptive tactics.  As the district court found, Dooyang intended to force ADL into an unfavorable settlement by threatening litigation.  There was no error in the court's finding that the \"second act of deception\" amounted to an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" under Chapter 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapter 93A liability is decided case-by-case, and Massachusetts courts have consistently emphasized the \"fact-specific nature of the inquiry.\"  Linkage Corp., 679 N.E.2d at 209.   We emphasize that this case did not involve a good faith dispute over billing or a simple breach of contract, each of which is an insufficient basis for 93A liability.  See, e.g., Pepsi-Cola Metro.  Bottling Co., 754 F.2d at 18 (stating that \"mere breaches of contract, without more, do not violate [C]hapter 93A\");  Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. v.

Here, Dooyang's wrongful purpose was to extract a favorable settlement from ADL for less than the amount Dooyang knew that it owed by repeatedly promising to pay, not doing so, stringing out the process, and forcing ADL to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These developments in Massachusetts law will require the Massachusetts courts to give greater definition and clarity to the parameters of &#167; 11 liability for those who do business in Massachusetts.  Mere failure to pay a bill, standing alone, does not, it appears, give rise to such liability.  See id.   Where there is a good faith dispute over whether payment is actually owed, and that dispute is clearly articulated, it also appears there is no Chapter 93A liability.  See id.;  Levings v. Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., 8 Mass.App.Ct. 498, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240417\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240417/levings-v-forbes-wallace-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 153 (1979).  Of course, due to the fact-specific nature of the Chapter 93A inquiry, generalizations are always somewhat indeterminate.  See Cambridge Plating Co., 85 F.3d at 769 (\"Perhaps by design, the dimensions of Chapter 93A liability are difficult to discern with precision.\").  This case does not involve a mere failure to pay a bill, and the facts are sufficiently strong that we easily conclude they are actionable as \"unfair or deceptive\" under Chapter 93A.  We leave to the development of state law where the lines will be drawn in these \"the check is in the mail\" type cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Loss of Money or Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ADL had the burden of showing not only that the acts were unfair or deceptive, but also that it suffered a \"loss of money or property\" under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11.  \" '[M]oney' means money, not time, and ... 'property' means the kind of property that is purchased or leased, not such intangibles as a right to a sense of security, to peace of mind, or to personal liberty.\"  Baldassari v. Public Fin.

And that loss of money or property must stem from Dooyang's misrepresentations regarding payment.  See Lyle Richards Int'l, Ltd. v.

It is the misrepresentations about payment which must have caused the loss because those misrepresentations, not the formation of the contract extension itself, took place in Massachusetts and so are subject to Chapter 93A.  \"[W]hether the requisite causal connection has been proven is one of fact\" that will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.

While we have found no &#167; 11 cases directly on point, a number of cases under &#167; 9 are helpful in the analysis.  The closest &#167; 11 case is Community Builders, in which false promises to pay and delay caused a loss of use of money, attendant expenses, and caused plaintiff to continue to do work.  Here plaintiff did not continue to do work and so the Appeals Court did not face the precise issue that we face.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts have held in &#167; 9 cases against insurers under Chapter 93A and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  176D that the loss of the use of money owed to a plaintiff, once liability is \"reasonably clear,\" is a form of damage compensable by Chapter 93A.  See Clegg v. Butler, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1134</span></span>, 1139 (1997) (stating that \"when an insurer wrongfully withholds funds from a claimant, it is depriving the claimant of the use of those funds\" and so constitutes injury cognizable under Chapter 93A though the insurer eventually pays).  Clegg reiterated the rule announced in Schwartz v. Rose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243220\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243220/schwartz-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243220\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243220/schwartz-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 109 (1994), that the loss of the use of money \"is precisely the type of damage we have described as appropriately being subject to multiplication ... under c. 93A.\"  Schwartz was not a claim against an insurer under Chapter 176D, and so we take it that the Schwartz rule has general application, at least under &#167; 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1979 the Massachusetts legislature amended Chapter 93A to eliminate the requirement of pleading a loss of money or property under &#167; 9. See Smith v. Caggiano, 12 Mass.App.Ct. 41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230406\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230406/smith-v-caggiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 475 (1981).  Now, under &#167; 9, a plaintiff must prove that he or she has \"been injured\" by the defendant's unfair or deceptive practices.  Mass Gen. Laws. ch.  93A, &#167; 9. One question is whether the cases under &#167; 9, which requires only a showing that plaintiff has \"been injured,\" provide guidance on what is meant by \"loss of money or property\" under &#167; 11.  The two phrases are not coextensive.  \"Injury\" is a broader term, and includes, for example, emotional distress.  See Leardi v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1988517\"><a href=\"/opinion/1988517/leardi-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1988517\"><a href=\"/opinion/1988517/leardi-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span>, 1101 (1985) (interpreting \"injury\" under &#167; 9 to include \"an invasion of a legally protected interest, but no harm for which actual damages can be awarded\").  But loss of money or property is certainly one form of injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the &#167; 9 cases provide guidance.  In these &#167; 9 cases, the court rejected arguments that the plaintiff suffered no injury because he suffered only a delay in payment rather than an absolute loss.  Certainly, the loss of use of money, along with attendant collection and other expenses would seem to be both an \"injury\" under &#167; 9 and a \"loss of money or property\" under &#167; 11.  Cf. Caggiano, 421 N.E.2d at 476 (\" 'Money' means ... 'money,' but its loss may occur short of physical transfer of legal tender.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the loss of the use of the money, Dooyang's unfair withholding of payment caused ADL to make expenditures to recover the money owed:  long-distance phone calls and faxes to South Korea, and meetings with Dooyang executives.  Such expenditures have been found to satisfy the \"loss of money or property\" requirement.  See Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. Carlton Aluminum of New England, 35 Mass.App.Ct. 161, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2040877\"><a href=\"/opinion/2040877/alcan-aluminum-v-carlton-aluminum-of-new-eng/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1013 (1993) (\"Carlton did suffer an actual loss of money or property--by responding to customer complaints and lawsuits about the defective siding....\");  Bump v.

The district court doubled the breach of contract damages, but also ruled that Dooyang's initial act of deception was not covered by Chapter 93A.  This theoretically could raise the issue of whether damages should be limited to only those damages caused by the second act of deception or whether &#167; 11 precludes such a measure of damages.  Dooyang does not argue in its brief that the court's doubling of the entire amount of the underlying contract damages was error, but maintains only that there was no loss of money or property caused by the second deceptive act as required by &#167; 11.  Dooyang's brief perfunctorily challenges the district court's decision to award double damages, but does not address the proper amount to be doubled.  Dooyang has thus conceded the issue of the amount to be doubled, and we do not reach the theoretical issue.  See King v. Town of Hanover, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742622\"><a href=\"/opinion/742622/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1266-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44807-bruce-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 970 (1st Cir.1997) (claims not argued on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded ADL double damages on the ground that Dooyang's misconduct was \"willful and knowing.\"   The district court clearly articulated its reasons for levying multiple damages, and we agree.

Thus, if you find that ADL committed a material breach of the agreement according to the instructions I have just given you, then [Dooyang] is legally excused from making its payment to ADL.</p>\n        <p>It is well established that a material breach by one party excuses the other party from further performance under the contract.  Thus, if ADL did not perform [its] own obligations under the contract, then it cannot recover for Dooyang's breach because ADL's voluntary failure to complete its own agreement prevents recovery.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> This case involves a single contract that was repeatedly extended by the parties.  The district court instructed the jury, without objection, that \"the parties do not dispute that they entered into a six-month contract in June of 1989, which was extended twice, through to the end of 1990, in which Dooyang promised to pay for services rendered by ADL.  The parties further agree that they entered into a modified extension of this basic agreement ... for the months, of March, April and May of 1991.\"   Dooyang now attempts to characterize the final extension as a separate \"Spring 1991 contract,\" but this novel argument is unavailing.  See Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196149\"><a href=\"/opinion/196149/windsor-v-giragosian/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 56 n. 7 (1st Cir.1995) (arguments not properly raised below are waived on appeal);  La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc. v.

Nor was there cause for objection, as this instruction was amply supported by the evidence, such as a letter dated January 15, 1991, from Dooyang to ADL, discussing \"an extension of [ADL's] service contract.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Similarly, NASCO, Inc. v.
