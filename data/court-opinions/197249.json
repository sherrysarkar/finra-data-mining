The appellant  was thereafter sentenced to a  term of\r\n\nimprisonment of seventy months,  to be followed by four  years of\r\n\nsupervised release.   She  appeals her conviction  on the  ground\r\n\nthat the  district court erred in denying  a motion to suppress a\r\n\nwritten  statement elicited  from her  shortly after  her arrest.\r\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In October 1994, agents from the Maine Drug Enforcement\r\n\nAgency (\"MDEA\")  commenced an investigation into the distribution\r\n\nof crack  cocaine in Portland,  Maine.  Specifically,  the agents\r\n\ntargeted a group  of individuals who  purchased the substance  in\r\n\nBoston, Massachusetts, transported it to Portland, and thereafter\r\n\nsold  it out  of various hotel  rooms and houses  in the Portland\r\n\narea.  The investigation  continued for approximately two months,\r\n\nand was aided on several occasions by the cooperation of a number\r\n\nof \"concerned citizens.\"1\r\n\n          The  investigation  culminated  at approximately  11:00\r\n\np.m. on December 9, 1994, when agents from the MDEA and  officers\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   A detailed account of  the investigation can be  found in the\r\nJuly 17,  1995 Memorandum and Order  of the district  court.  See\r                                                                           \r\nUnited  States  v. Marenghi,  896 F.  Supp.  207, 209-13  (D. Me.\r                                     \r\n1995).\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nfrom  the Portland  Police Department pulled  into a  driveway in\r\n\nPortland behind a vehicle driven by the appellant and occupied by\r\n\nfive others.  All of the occupants, including the appellant, were\r\n\nremoved from the  vehicle and separately  detained at the  scene.\r\n\nThe  agents thereafter proceeded  to search the  vehicle in which\r\n\nthe individuals were riding.  \r\n\n          The  appellant was  handcuffed and  placed in  the back\r\n\nseat of an unmarked  police car in which Portland  Police Officer\r\n\nRobert  Pelletier sat.   Robert  Pelletier's brother  and brother\r\n\nofficer, Scott  Pelletier, a detective assigned to  the MDEA, got\r\n\ninto the  car shortly thereafter.   Scott Pelletier  proceeded to\r\n\nexplain to the  appellant why  the vehicle had  been stopped  and\r\n\nthat  she would soon be transported to a Portland police station.\r\n\nScott Pelletier informed the  appellant that a drug-detecting dog\r\n\nhad  alerted  to  drugs  on  the  bodies  of  two  of  the  other\r\n\nindividuals who had been  riding in the appellant's  vehicle, and\r\n\nthat  the  dog would  be  used  to search  her  as  well.   Scott\r\n\nPelletier then exited the vehicle.\r\n\n          At that point, Robert Pelletier told the appellant that\r\n\nthe dog could find drugs  anywhere on a person, even if  a person\r\n\nwas  carrying  the  drugs  in  a  body  cavity.    The  appellant\r\n\nresponded, stating \"I  don't have  it up  there, I  have it  down\r\n\nhere.\"   Transcript, April 4, 1995 Hearing on Motion to Suppress,\r\n\nat 174.  Robert Pelletier then got out of the automobile and told\r\n\nScott  Pelletier  that the  appellant wanted  to speak  with him.\r\n\nWhen  Scott  Pelletier returned  to  the  vehicle, the  appellant\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nstated that the officers would not need to use the  dog to search\r\n\nher and that she did indeed possess crack cocaine.\r\n\n          At several points  during this exchange, the  appellant\r\n\nindicated that she needed to use a bathroom.   At no time was she\r\n\nadvised  of her Miranda rights, however.  See Miranda v. Arizona,\r                                                                          \r\n\n384 U.S.  436 (1966).   Approximately  ninety  minutes after  the\r\n\nappellant was first detained,  Scott Pelletier transported her to\r\n\nthe Portland Police Department.2  \r\n\n          Upon  arriving at  the  police  station, the  appellant\r\n\nagain told Scott Pelletier  that she needed to use  the bathroom.\r\n\nScott Pelletier advised her  that a female officer would  have to\r\n\naccompany  her, but that none were present at the police station.\r\n\nScott Pelletier placed the appellant in a room with Officer Bruce\r\n\nChase, and left in an effort to locate a female officer.  \r\n\n          Scott Pelletier  returned ten  minutes later.   At that\r\n\npoint, he advised the appellant of  her Miranda rights, inquiring\r                                                         \r\n\nof  the appellant after reading each right if she understood what\r\n\nit meant.  The appellant indicated that she did.\r\n\n          Scott Pelletier then left to inquire as to whether  the\r\n\nefforts to locate  a female  officer had been  successful.   Upon\r\n\nlearning that  they had not,  Scott Pelletier returned  and asked\r\n\nthe  appellant whether she had  inserted the drugs  inside a body\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2     The  MDEA  agents   stopped  the  appellant s   vehicle  at\r\napproximately  11:00  p.m.   Scott  Pelletier  testified that  he\r\narrived at the scene between 11:40 p.m. and  11:50 p.m., and that\r\nhe   departed  with   the  appellant   for  the   police  station\r\napproximately forty minutes later.  See Transcript, April 4, 1995\r                                                 \r\nHearing on Motion to Suppress, at 44 &amp; 111.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncavity  or whether  they were  merely inside  her clothing.   The\r\n\nappellant stated that the  narcotics were easily retrievable and,\r\n\nin  the presence of Scott Pelletier  and Officer Chase, proceeded\r\n\nto reach into her pants and remove a plastic bag,  which she then\r\n\nplaced on the floor.   The appellant was thereafter  permitted to\r\n\nuse the bathroom without the accompaniment of a female officer.\r\n\n          The appellant was then  moved to a station  lunch room,\r\n\nwhere  she  proceeded  to  dictate  a  statement  concerning  her\r\n\ninvolvement  in distributing  crack  cocaine in  Portland.   When\r\n\ncomplete, Scott Pelletier had the appellant read each page of the\r\n\ndocument for  inaccuracies.   After correcting one  sentence, the\r\n\nappellant  initialed  the corner  of each  page,  as well  as the\r\n\ncorrection, and then signed the statement.\r\n\n          On December 20, 1994, a grand jury returned a two-count\r\n\nindictment charging the appellant with conspiracy to possess with\r\n\nintent to distribute  more than  five grams of  cocaine base,  as\r\n\nwell as  possession with  intent to distribute  cocaine base,  in\r\n\nviolation of  21 U.S.C.     846  and 841(a)(1).   On February  9,\r\n\n1995, the appellant filed a motion to suppress as evidence in her\r\n\ncriminal  trial  \"any  and all  statements  and  evidence  . .  .\r\n\nobtained  on  the  night of  her  arrest,\"  including:   (1)  any\r\n\nstatements that she made to the Pelletiers in the unmarked police\r\n\ncruiser  (hereafter referred  to as  the \"roadside  statements\");\r\n\nand,  (2)  the  written statement  made  at  the  Portland Police\r\n\nStation (hereafter referred to as the \"written statement\").\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          The district court conducted  an evidentiary hearing on\r\n\nthe  suppression motion and issued a memorandum and order on July\r\n\n17, 1995 granting the motion in part and denying it in part.  The\r\n\ndistrict court found that the roadside statements were made while\r\n\nthe appellant  was  in custody  and  without benefit  of  Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nwarnings.   See United States  v. Marenghi, 896 F.  Supp. at 215.\r                                                    \r\n\nThe  roadside  statements were  therefore  excluded  from use  at\r\n\ntrial.  See id.\r                         \r\n\n          The district court then  proceeded to make two findings\r\n\nwith  respect to the written  statement.  First,  the court found\r\n\nthat the appellant  dictated the written statement  after she had\r\n\nmade a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of  her Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nrights.  See  id. at 217-19.   Second, the  court found that  the\r                           \r\n\ncircumstances surrounding the appellant's written confession were\r\n\nsufficiently attenuated from the constitutional infirmities which\r\n\nrendered the  roadside statements inadmissible.   See id. at 216.\r                                                                   \r\n\nThus, the  district court  permitted the government  to introduce\r\n\nthe written statement at trial.  \r\n\n          The appellant challenges the district court's denial of\r\n\nher motion to suppress the written statement.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          At  the  outset, it  is  incumbent upon  this  court to\r\n\ndelineate the correct standard of its review.  In the context  of\r\n\na motion to suppress,  we examine a district court's  findings of\r\n\nfact  for clear error.   See United  States v.  Mitchell, 85 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n800,  804 (1st Cir. 1996);  United States v.  Valle, 72 F.3d 210,\r                                                             \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n214 (1st Cir.  1995).  In contrast, we  conduct de novo inquiries\r                                                                 \r\n\ninto district  court determinations with respect  to questions of\r\n\nlaw,  including those  involving  the Constitution.   See  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Valle, 72 F.3d at 214; United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          In this case, the  appellant challenges the validity of\r\n\nthe district court's order  with respect to the  admissibility of\r\n\nthe  written   statement.    The  suppression   of  the  roadside\r\n\nstatements  is  not at  issue.    Nevertheless, this  court  must\r\n\nexamine  the  circumstances under  which the  roadside statements\r\n\nwere made, as the  admissibility of the written statement  is, in\r\n\npart,  dependent upon whether the police  conduct at the roadside\r\n\nwas coercive.\r\n\n          When  law  enforcement  officials  do  not deliberately\r\n\nengage in  coercive or improper  tactics in obtaining  an initial\r\n\nstatement, but rather  only fail to advise a defendant  of his or\r\n\nher  Miranda   warnings,  a  court's  task   in  determining  the\r                      \r\n\nadmissibility   of   a   subsequent   statement   is   relatively\r\n\nstraightforward.   Such  a  statement  is  admissible if  it  was\r\n\nobtained  after the  defendant:  (1)  was advised  of his  or her\r\n\nMiranda rights;  and, (2) knowingly and  voluntarily waived those\r                 \r\n\nrights.  See Oregon  v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 318  (1985); Bryant\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Vose, 785 F.2d 364, 366-67 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 477  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n907  (1986).   This  standard reflects  the  belief that  \"[w]hen\r\n\nneither  the initial  nor  the subsequent  admission is  coerced,\r\n\nlittle justification  exists for permitting  the highly probative\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nevidence of a  voluntary confession to  be irretrievably lost  to\r\n\nthe factfinder.\"   Oregon v. Elstad,  470 U.S. at 312.   \"In such\r                                             \r\n\ncircumstances, the  finder of  fact may reasonably  conclude that\r\n\nthe suspect  made a  rational and  intelligent choice whether  to\r\n\nwaive or invoke [his or her] rights.\"  Id. at 314.\r                                                    \r\n\n          There  is an enormous difference, however, between \"the\r\n\nuncertain consequences of disclosure  of a 'guilty secret' freely\r\n\ngiven  in response to  an unwarned but  noncoercive question\" and\r\n\n\"the direct consequences flowing from coercion of a confession by\r\n\nphysical violence  or other deliberate means  calculated to break\r\n\nthe suspect's will  . .  . .\"   Id. at  312.  As  such, when  the\r                                             \r\n\ninfirmity  underlying an  initial  statement transcends  the mere\r\n\nfailure  to follow the dictates  of Miranda, the determination as\r                                                     \r\n\nto the  admissibility  of a  subsequent  statement is  much  more\r\n\ninvolved.    A careful  and  thorough  administration of  Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nwarnings  alone  is  not  necessarily sufficient  to  ensure  the\r\n\nvalidity of the subsequent statement.  See id. at 310.\r                                                        \r\n\n          This is so because the  danger exists that the coercive\r\n\nnature of the circumstances under which the initial statement was\r\n\nobtained lingered  in the mind of the defendant at the time he or\r\n\nshe provided  the subsequent statement, irrespective  of the fact\r\n\nthat he or she had been advised of the Miranda  warnings and made\r                                                        \r\n\nthe subsequent statement in an  atmosphere devoid of coercion  or\r\n\ncompulsion.  See id.   In this instance, a court cannot determine\r                              \r\n\nthe admissibility of the subsequent statement solely by examining\r\n\nthe circumstances  surrounding that statement.   Instead, it must\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ndetermine   whether  the  subsequent  statement  is  sufficiently\r\n\nremoved  from  the  milieu of  the  coerced  statement  so as  to\r\n\npreclude any lingering taint.\r\n\n          There  is no dispute in  this case as  to the fact that\r\n\nthe  appellant provided  the  roadside statements  without having\r\n\nfirst been advised of her Miranda rights.  The  parties differ as\r                                           \r\n\nto whether these statements  were the product of  improper police\r\n\ncoercion.    The  appellant  contends that  the  police  officers\r\n\ncoerced  the  statement by  threatening to  use  a police  dog to\r\n\nsearch  the  appellant  for  drugs and  denying  the  appellant's\r\n\nrequests  to use  the bathroom.   The  government discounts  this\r\n\nnotion, arguing instead that at no point was the appellant's will\r\n\noverborne such that she was not able to act voluntarily.\r\n\n          The district  court examined  the admissibility of  the\r\n\nwritten statement as if the roadside statements had been coerced.\r\n\nThe  court  concluded that  \"the  statements made  in  the police\r\n\nstation  were  sufficiently  removed  from  the  setting  of  the\r\n\nillegally obtained . . . inculpatory statements\" at the roadside.\r\n\nUnited  States v. Marenghi, 896 F. Supp. at 216.  Notwithstanding\r                                    \r\n\nthis  fact, the  court  never explicitly  determined whether  the\r\n\nroadside statements were indeed coerced.  The district court only\r\n\nwent as  far  as  saying that  those  statements  were  \"possibly\r                                                                           \r\n\ncoerced.\"  Id. (emphasis added).\r                        \r\n\n          We decline  the parties' invitations to  label, for the\r\n\nfirst time, the circumstances surrounding the roadside statements\r\n\nas either coercive  or noncoercive.  This exercise  would require\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nus to make critical  determinations as to the credibility  of the\r\n\nindividuals  present at  the roadside  as, not  surprisingly, the\r\n\nrecitations of the events that transpired that evening  vary from\r\n\nwitness to witness.  It would not be  wise for us to attempt such\r\n\nan endeavor from a cold record.\r\n\n          Further, a  definitive resolution of this  issue is not\r\n\nnecessary in the present  case.  We believe that  the appellant s\r\n\nwritten statement would be admissible even if we were to conclude\r\n\nthat the roadside statements were indeed coerced.\r\n\n          We   therefore  apply   the  heightened   threshold  of\r\n\nadmissibility  and   begin   our  analysis   by   examining   the\r\n\nvoluntariness  of  the  written  statement  independent  of   any\r\n\npotential  taint that may have  lingered from the  roadside.  The\r\n\nvoluntariness of a statement \"depends on 'whether the will of the\r\n\ndefendant  [was] overborne so that the statement was not his free\r\n\nand voluntary act, and that question [is] to be resolved in light\r\n\nof the  totality  of  the  circumstances.'\"    United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nJackson, 918 F.2d  236, 241  (1st Cir. 1990)  (quoting Bryant  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nVose, 785 F.2d  at 367-68).  The appellant argued  below that the\r              \r\n\ndenial of her  repeated requests to use  the bathroom constituted\r\n\nimproper  influence.  Indeed, she averred that she was willing to\r\n\nsay anything at the police station to  obtain permission to go to\r\n\nthe bathroom.\r\n\n          The district  court, having the benefit  of hearing the\r\n\ntestimony of both the appellant and  Scott Pelletier, reached two\r\n\nconclusions  on  this point.   First,  the  court found  that the\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nappellant's requests to  use the  bathroom were only  part of  \"a\r\n\nploy  to obtain  an  opportunity to  destroy  evidence.\"   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Marenghi,  896 F.  Supp. at  217.   Second, the  court\r                             \r\n\ndetermined that Scott Pelletier's refusal to permit the appellant\r\n\nto use the  bathroom was  prompted solely by  his valid  concerns\r\n\nthat the appellant might  dispose of any contraband concealed  on\r\n\nher person, and did not  amount to improper police conduct.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. \r             \r\n\n          We,  much like  the  district court,  are reluctant  to\r\n\nexcuse the absence of a female officer at the police station that\r\n\nevening.   It was, at  the very  least, imprudent not  to have  a\r\n\nfemale officer  immediately available that  evening, particularly\r\n\nsince the police  knew that  two females were  going to be  taken\r\n\ninto custody more than  ninety minutes prior to their  arrival at\r\n\nthe police station. \r\n\n          Notwithstanding our concern on this point, the evidence\r\n\nclearly supports the district court's conclusions with respect to\r\n\nthe  motivations of  both the  officers and  the appellant.   The\r\n\nappellant  has  not  directed   our  attention  to  any  evidence\r\n\nsuggesting  that  she was  denied access  to  the bathroom  in an\r\n\neffort  to  induce her  to  provide  a statement.    As such,  we\r\n\nconclude that the district  court s determination with respect to\r\n\nthe voluntariness of the written statement was correct.\r\n\n          Ordinarily, we  would proceed to inquire  as to whether\r\n\nthe appellant had been advised of, and waived, her constitutional\r\n\nrights.   In this case, however, the appellant does not challenge\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  district court's  findings with respect  to her  knowing and\r\n\nintelligent waiver of these rights.3\r\n\n          The sole  question that  remains, then, is  whether the\r\n\nwritten  statement  could  possibly  have  been  tainted  by  any\r\n\ncoercion lingering from the  roadside.  In order to  resolve this\r\n\nissue, we must compare and contrast the circumstances surrounding\r\n\neach  of the  two statements.   In so  doing, we  look to several\r\n\nfactors:  the change in the place of the interrogations; the time\r\n\nthat  passed  between  the  statements; and  the  change  in  the\r\n\nidentity of the interrogators.  See Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n310;  United States  v.

There  is no suggestion\r\n\nthat any of the  \"possibly\" coercive elements from the  roadside,\r\n\nin  particular,  the drug-detecting  dog,  were  present at  this\r\n\nlocation.

Marenghi of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance containing cocaine base, as well as the underlying substantive offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1).  The appellant was thereafter sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seventy months, to be followed by four years of supervised release.  She appeals her conviction on the ground that the district court erred in denying a motion to suppress a written statement elicited from her shortly after her arrest.  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1994, agents from the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") commenced an investigation into the distribution of crack cocaine in Portland, Maine.  Specifically, the agents targeted a group of individuals who purchased the substance in Boston, Massachusetts, transported it to Portland, and thereafter sold it out of various hotel rooms and houses in the Portland area.  The investigation continued for approximately two months, and was aided on several occasions by the cooperation of a number of \"concerned citizens.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigation culminated at approximately 11:00 p.m. on December 9, 1994, when agents from the MDEA and officers from the Portland Police Department pulled into a driveway in Portland behind a vehicle driven by the appellant and occupied by five others.  All of the occupants, including the appellant, were removed from the vehicle and separately detained at the scene.  The agents thereafter proceeded to search the vehicle in which the individuals were riding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was handcuffed and placed in the back seat of an unmarked police car in which Portland Police Officer Robert Pelletier sat.  Robert Pelletier's brother and brother officer, Scott Pelletier, a detective assigned to the MDEA, got into the car shortly thereafter.  Scott Pelletier proceeded to explain to the appellant why the vehicle had been stopped and that she would soon be transported to a Portland police station.  Scott Pelletier informed the appellant that a drug-detecting dog had alerted to drugs on the bodies of two of the other individuals who had been riding in the appellant's vehicle, and that the dog would be used to search her as well.  Scott Pelletier then exited the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, Robert Pelletier told the appellant that the dog could find drugs anywhere on a person, even if a person was carrying the drugs in a body cavity.  The appellant responded, stating \"I don't have it up there, I have it down here.\"   Transcript, April 4, 1995 Hearing on Motion to Suppress, at 174.  Robert Pelletier then got out of the automobile and told Scott Pelletier that the appellant wanted to speak with him.  When Scott Pelletier returned to the vehicle, the appellant stated that the officers would not need to use the dog to search her and that she did indeed possess crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At several points during this exchange, the appellant indicated that she needed to use a bathroom.  At no time was she advised of her Miranda rights, however.  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  Approximately ninety minutes after the appellant was first detained, Scott Pelletier transported her to the Portland Police Department.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving at the police station, the appellant again told Scott Pelletier that she needed to use the bathroom.  Scott Pelletier advised her that a female officer would have to accompany her, but that none were present at the police station.  Scott Pelletier placed the appellant in a room with Officer Bruce Chase, and left in an effort to locate a female officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott Pelletier returned ten minutes later.  At that point, he advised the appellant of her Miranda rights, inquiring of the appellant after reading each right if she understood what it meant.  The appellant indicated that she did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott Pelletier then left to inquire as to whether the efforts to locate a female officer had been successful.  Upon learning that they had not, Scott Pelletier returned and asked the appellant whether she had inserted the drugs inside a body cavity or whether they were merely inside her clothing.  The appellant stated that the narcotics were easily retrievable and, in the presence of Scott Pelletier and Officer Chase, proceeded to reach into her pants and remove a plastic bag, which she then placed on the floor.  The appellant was thereafter permitted to use the bathroom without the accompaniment of a female officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was then moved to a station lunch room, where she proceeded to dictate a statement concerning her involvement in distributing crack cocaine in Portland.  When complete, Scott Pelletier had the appellant read each page of the document for inaccuracies.  After correcting one sentence, the appellant initialed the corner of each page, as well as the correction, and then signed the statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 1994, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging the appellant with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base, as well as possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1).  On February 9, 1995, the appellant filed a motion to suppress as evidence in her criminal trial \"any and all statements and evidence ... obtained on the night of her arrest,\" including:  (1) any statements that she made to the Pelletiers in the unmarked police cruiser (hereafter referred to as the \"roadside statements\");  and, (2) the written statement made at the Portland Police Station (hereafter referred to as the \"written statement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion and issued a memorandum and order on July 17, 1995 granting the motion in part and denying it in part.  The district court found that the roadside statements were made while the appellant was in custody and without benefit of Miranda warnings.  See United States v. Marenghi, 896 F.Supp. at 215.   The roadside statements were therefore excluded from use at trial.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then proceeded to make two findings with respect to the written statement.  First, the court found that the appellant dictated the written statement after she had made a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of her Miranda rights.  See id. at 217-19.   Second, the court found that the circumstances surrounding the appellant's written confession were sufficiently attenuated from the constitutional infirmities which rendered the roadside statements inadmissible.  See id. at 216.   Thus, the district court permitted the government to introduce the written statement at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant challenges the district court's denial of her motion to suppress the written statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it is incumbent upon this court to delineate the correct standard of its review.  In the context of a motion to suppress, we examine a district court's findings of fact for clear error.  See United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 804 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir.1995).  In contrast, we conduct de novo inquiries into district court determinations with respect to questions of law, including those involving the Constitution.  See United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d at 214;  United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the appellant challenges the validity of the district court's order with respect to the admissibility of the written statement.  The suppression of the roadside statements is not at issue.  Nevertheless, this court must examine the circumstances under which the roadside statements were made, as the admissibility of the written statement is, in part, dependent upon whether the police conduct at the roadside was coercive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When law enforcement officials do not deliberately engage in coercive or improper tactics in obtaining an initial statement, but rather only fail to advise a defendant of his or her Miranda warnings, a court's task in determining the admissibility of a subsequent statement is relatively straightforward.  Such a statement is admissible if it was obtained after the defendant:  (1) was advised of his or her Miranda rights;  and, (2) knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights.  See Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1297-98, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985);  Bryant v. Vose, 785 F.2d 364, 366-67 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 907, 106 S.Ct. 3281, 91 L.Ed.2d 570 (1986).  This standard reflects the belief that \"[w]hen neither the initial nor the subsequent admission is coerced, little justification exists for permitting the highly probative evidence of a voluntary confession to be irretrievably lost to the factfinder.\"  Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. at 312, 105 S.Ct. at 1294-95.  \"In such circumstances, the finder of fact may reasonably conclude that the suspect made a rational and intelligent choice whether to waive or invoke [his or her] rights.\"  Id. at 314, 105 S.Ct. at 1296.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an enormous difference, however, between \"the uncertain consequences of disclosure of a 'guilty secret' freely given in response to an unwarned but noncoercive question\" and \"the direct consequences flowing from coercion of a confession by physical violence or other deliberate means calculated to break the suspect's will....\"  Id. at 312, 105 S.Ct. at 1295.   As such, when the infirmity underlying an initial statement transcends the mere failure to follow the dictates of Miranda, the determination as to the admissibility of a subsequent statement is much more involved.  A careful and thorough administration of Miranda warnings alone is not necessarily sufficient to ensure the validity of the subsequent statement.  See id. at 310, 105 S.Ct. at 1293-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is so because the danger exists that the coercive nature of the circumstances under which the initial statement was obtained lingered in the mind of the defendant at the time he or she provided the subsequent statement, irrespective of the fact that he or she had been advised of the Miranda warnings and made the subsequent statement in an atmosphere devoid of coercion or compulsion.  See id.   In this instance, a court cannot determine the admissibility of the subsequent statement solely by examining the circumstances surrounding that statement.  Instead, it must determine whether the subsequent statement is sufficiently removed from the milieu of the coerced statement so as to preclude any lingering taint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute in this case as to the fact that the appellant provided the roadside statements without having first been advised of her Miranda rights.  The parties differ as to whether these statements were the product of improper police coercion.  The appellant contends that the police officers coerced the statement by threatening to use a police dog to search the appellant for drugs and denying the appellant's requests to use the bathroom.  The government discounts this notion, arguing instead that at no point was the appellant's will overborne such that she was not able to act voluntarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court examined the admissibility of the written statement as if the roadside statements had been coerced.  The court concluded that \"the statements made in the police station were sufficiently removed from the setting of the illegally obtained ... inculpatory statements\" at the roadside.  United States v. Marenghi, 896 F.Supp. at 216.   Notwithstanding this fact, the court never explicitly determined whether the roadside statements were indeed coerced.  The district court only went as far as saying that those statements were \"possibly coerced.\"  Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline the parties' invitations to label, for the first time, the circumstances surrounding the roadside statements as either coercive or noncoercive.  This exercise would require us to make critical determinations as to the credibility of the individuals present at the roadside as, not surprisingly, the recitations of the events that transpired that evening vary from witness to witness.  It would not be wise for us to attempt such an endeavor from a cold record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, a definitive resolution of this issue is not necessary in the present case.  We believe that the appellant's written statement would be admissible even if we were to conclude that the roadside statements were indeed coerced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore apply the heightened threshold of admissibility and begin our analysis by examining the voluntariness of the written statement independent of any potential taint that may have lingered from the roadside.  The voluntariness of a statement \"depends on 'whether the will of the defendant [was] overborne so that the statement was not his free and voluntary act, and that question [is] to be resolved in light of the totality of the circumstances.' \"  United States v. Jackson, 918 F.2d 236, 241 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting Bryant v. Vose, 785 F.2d at 367-68).   The appellant argued below that the denial of her repeated requests to use the bathroom constituted improper influence.  Indeed, she averred that she was willing to say anything at the police station to obtain permission to go to the bathroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, having the benefit of hearing the testimony of both the appellant and Scott Pelletier, reached two conclusions on this point.  First, the court found that the appellant's requests to use the bathroom were only part of \"a ploy to obtain an opportunity to destroy evidence.\"  United States v. Marenghi, 896 F.Supp. at 217.   Second, the court determined that Scott Pelletier's refusal to permit the appellant to use the bathroom was prompted solely by his valid concerns that the appellant might dispose of any contraband concealed on her person, and did not amount to improper police conduct.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, much like the district court, are reluctant to excuse the absence of a female officer at the police station that evening.  It was, at the very least, imprudent not to have a female officer immediately available that evening, particularly since the police knew that two females were going to be taken into custody more than ninety minutes prior to their arrival at the police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding our concern on this point, the evidence clearly supports the district court's conclusions with respect to the motivations of both the officers and the appellant.  The appellant has not directed our attention to any evidence suggesting that she was denied access to the bathroom in an effort to induce her to provide a statement.  As such, we conclude that the district court's determination with respect to the voluntariness of the written statement was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, we would proceed to inquire as to whether the appellant had been advised of, and waived, her constitutional rights.  In this case, however, the appellant does not challenge the district court's findings with respect to her knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole question that remains, then, is whether the written statement could possibly have been tainted by any coercion lingering from the roadside.  In order to resolve this issue, we must compare and contrast the circumstances surrounding each of the two statements.  In so doing, we look to several factors:  the change in the place of the interrogations;  the time that passed between the statements;  and the change in the identity of the interrogators.  See Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. at 310, 105 S.Ct. at 1293-94;  United States v. Mendoza-Cecelia, 963 F.2d 1467, 1475-76 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 964, 113 S.Ct. 436, 121 L.Ed.2d 356 (1992);  Holland v. McGinnis, 963 F.2d 1044, 1050 (7th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1082, 113 S.Ct. 1053, 122 L.Ed.2d 360 (1993);  United States v. Daniel, 932 F.2d 517, 519 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 890, 112 S.Ct. 252, 116 L.Ed.2d 206 (1991);  cf.  Medeiros v. Shimoda, 889 F.2d 819, 823-25 (9th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 938, 110 S.Ct. 3219, 110 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990);  McFadden v. Garraghty, 820 F.2d 654, 660 (4th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, these factors suggest that the written statement was sufficiently attenuated from any possible coercion at the roadside so as to ensure that it was not tainted.  First, several hours elapsed between the time the appellant made the roadside statements and the time she provided the written statement.  Second, the appellant dictated the written statement in a lunch room at the police station.  There is no suggestion that any of the \"possibly\" coercive elements from the roadside, in particular, the drug-detecting dog, were present at this location.  Moreover, the appellant provided the statement after she had been permitted to use a bathroom.  Finally, the impact of Scott Pelletier's presence at both locations is not appreciable:  neither the appellant nor the record suggest that he was personally responsible for any coercive behavior at the police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A thorough examination of the briefs and record in this case reveals nothing to support the appellant's contention that her written statement was coerced.  Instead, the evidence bolsters the district court's conclusion that the appellant voluntarily provided the statement to the authorities.  Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A detailed account of the investigation can be found in the July 17, 1995 Memorandum and Order of the district court.

Marenghi of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance containing cocaine base, as well as the underlying substantive offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1).  The appellant was thereafter sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seventy months, to be followed by four years of supervised release.  She appeals her conviction on the ground that the district court erred in denying a motion to suppress a written statement elicited from her shortly after her arrest.  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1994, agents from the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency (\"MDEA\") commenced an investigation into the distribution of crack cocaine in Portland, Maine.  Specifically, the agents targeted a group of individuals who purchased the substance in Boston, Massachusetts, transported it to Portland, and thereafter sold it out of various hotel rooms and houses in the Portland area.  The investigation continued for approximately two months, and was aided on several occasions by the cooperation of a number of \"concerned citizens.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigation culminated at approximately 11:00 p.m. on December 9, 1994, when agents from the MDEA and officers from the Portland Police Department pulled into a driveway in Portland behind a vehicle driven by the appellant and occupied by five others.  All of the occupants, including the appellant, were removed from the vehicle and separately detained at the scene.  The agents thereafter proceeded to search the vehicle in which the individuals were riding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was handcuffed and placed in the back seat of an unmarked police car in which Portland Police Officer Robert Pelletier sat.  Robert Pelletier's brother and brother officer, Scott Pelletier, a detective assigned to the MDEA, got into the car shortly thereafter.  Scott Pelletier proceeded to explain to the appellant why the vehicle had been stopped and that she would soon be transported to a Portland police station.  Scott Pelletier informed the appellant that a drug-detecting dog had alerted to drugs on the bodies of two of the other individuals who had been riding in the appellant's vehicle, and that the dog would be used to search her as well.  Scott Pelletier then exited the vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, Robert Pelletier told the appellant that the dog could find drugs anywhere on a person, even if a person was carrying the drugs in a body cavity.  The appellant responded, stating \"I don't have it up there, I have it down here.\"   Transcript, April 4, 1995 Hearing on Motion to Suppress, at 174.  Robert Pelletier then got out of the automobile and told Scott Pelletier that the appellant wanted to speak with him.  When Scott Pelletier returned to the vehicle, the appellant stated that the officers would not need to use the dog to search her and that she did indeed possess crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At several points during this exchange, the appellant indicated that she needed to use a bathroom.  At no time was she advised of her Miranda rights, however.  See Miranda v. Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966).  Approximately ninety minutes after the appellant was first detained, Scott Pelletier transported her to the Portland Police Department.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon arriving at the police station, the appellant again told Scott Pelletier that she needed to use the bathroom.  Scott Pelletier advised her that a female officer would have to accompany her, but that none were present at the police station.  Scott Pelletier placed the appellant in a room with Officer Bruce Chase, and left in an effort to locate a female officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott Pelletier returned ten minutes later.  At that point, he advised the appellant of her Miranda rights, inquiring of the appellant after reading each right if she understood what it meant.  The appellant indicated that she did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott Pelletier then left to inquire as to whether the efforts to locate a female officer had been successful.  Upon learning that they had not, Scott Pelletier returned and asked the appellant whether she had inserted the drugs inside a body cavity or whether they were merely inside her clothing.  The appellant stated that the narcotics were easily retrievable and, in the presence of Scott Pelletier and Officer Chase, proceeded to reach into her pants and remove a plastic bag, which she then placed on the floor.  The appellant was thereafter permitted to use the bathroom without the accompaniment of a female officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was then moved to a station lunch room, where she proceeded to dictate a statement concerning her involvement in distributing crack cocaine in Portland.  When complete, Scott Pelletier had the appellant read each page of the document for inaccuracies.  After correcting one sentence, the appellant initialed the corner of each page, as well as the correction, and then signed the statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 1994, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging the appellant with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base, as well as possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1).  On February 9, 1995, the appellant filed a motion to suppress as evidence in her criminal trial \"any and all statements and evidence ... obtained on the night of her arrest,\" including:  (1) any statements that she made to the Pelletiers in the unmarked police cruiser (hereafter referred to as the \"roadside statements\");  and, (2) the written statement made at the Portland Police Station (hereafter referred to as the \"written statement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion and issued a memorandum and order on July 17, 1995 granting the motion in part and denying it in part.  The district court found that the roadside statements were made while the appellant was in custody and without benefit of Miranda warnings.  See United States v. Marenghi, 896 F.Supp. at 215.   The roadside statements were therefore excluded from use at trial.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then proceeded to make two findings with respect to the written statement.  First, the court found that the appellant dictated the written statement after she had made a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of her Miranda rights.  See id. at 217-19.   Second, the court found that the circumstances surrounding the appellant's written confession were sufficiently attenuated from the constitutional infirmities which rendered the roadside statements inadmissible.  See id. at 216.   Thus, the district court permitted the government to introduce the written statement at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant challenges the district court's denial of her motion to suppress the written statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it is incumbent upon this court to delineate the correct standard of its review.  In the context of a motion to suppress, we examine a district court's findings of fact for clear error.  See United States v. Mitchell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196797\"><a href=\"/opinion/196797/united-states-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 804 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Valle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196494\"><a href=\"/opinion/196494/united-states-v-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 214 (1st Cir.1995).  In contrast, we conduct de novo inquiries into district court determinations with respect to questions of law, including those involving the Constitution.  See United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d at 214;  United States v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the appellant challenges the validity of the district court's order with respect to the admissibility of the written statement.  The suppression of the roadside statements is not at issue.  Nevertheless, this court must examine the circumstances under which the roadside statements were made, as the admissibility of the written statement is, in part, dependent upon whether the police conduct at the roadside was coercive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When law enforcement officials do not deliberately engage in coercive or improper tactics in obtaining an initial statement, but rather only fail to advise a defendant of his or her Miranda warnings, a court's task in determining the admissibility of a subsequent statement is relatively straightforward.  Such a statement is admissible if it was obtained after the defendant:  (1) was advised of his or her Miranda rights;  and, (2) knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights.  See Oregon v. Elstad, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111364\"><a href=\"/opinion/111364/oregon-v-elstad/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111364\"><a href=\"/opinion/111364/oregon-v-elstad/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></span> (1986).  This standard reflects the belief that \"[w]hen neither the initial nor the subsequent admission is coerced, little justification exists for permitting the highly probative evidence of a voluntary confession to be irretrievably lost to the factfinder.\"  Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. at 312, 105 S.Ct. at 1294-95.  \"In such circumstances, the finder of fact may reasonably conclude that the suspect made a rational and intelligent choice whether to waive or invoke [his or her] rights.\"  Id. at 314, 105 S.Ct. at 1296.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an enormous difference, however, between \"the uncertain consequences of disclosure of a 'guilty secret' freely given in response to an unwarned but noncoercive question\" and \"the direct consequences flowing from coercion of a confession by physical violence or other deliberate means calculated to break the suspect's will....\"  Id. at 312, 105 S.Ct. at 1295.   As such, when the infirmity underlying an initial statement transcends the mere failure to follow the dictates of Miranda, the determination as to the admissibility of a subsequent statement is much more involved.  A careful and thorough administration of Miranda warnings alone is not necessarily sufficient to ensure the validity of the subsequent statement.  See id. at 310, 105 S.Ct. at 1293-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is so because the danger exists that the coercive nature of the circumstances under which the initial statement was obtained lingered in the mind of the defendant at the time he or she provided the subsequent statement, irrespective of the fact that he or she had been advised of the Miranda warnings and made the subsequent statement in an atmosphere devoid of coercion or compulsion.  See id.   In this instance, a court cannot determine the admissibility of the subsequent statement solely by examining the circumstances surrounding that statement.  Instead, it must determine whether the subsequent statement is sufficiently removed from the milieu of the coerced statement so as to preclude any lingering taint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute in this case as to the fact that the appellant provided the roadside statements without having first been advised of her Miranda rights.  The parties differ as to whether these statements were the product of improper police coercion.  The appellant contends that the police officers coerced the statement by threatening to use a police dog to search the appellant for drugs and denying the appellant's requests to use the bathroom.  The government discounts this notion, arguing instead that at no point was the appellant's will overborne such that she was not able to act voluntarily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court examined the admissibility of the written statement as if the roadside statements had been coerced.  The court concluded that \"the statements made in the police station were sufficiently removed from the setting of the illegally obtained ... inculpatory statements\" at the roadside.  United States v. Marenghi, 896 F.Supp. at 216.   Notwithstanding this fact, the court never explicitly determined whether the roadside statements were indeed coerced.  The district court only went as far as saying that those statements were \"possibly coerced.\"  Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline the parties' invitations to label, for the first time, the circumstances surrounding the roadside statements as either coercive or noncoercive.  This exercise would require us to make critical determinations as to the credibility of the individuals present at the roadside as, not surprisingly, the recitations of the events that transpired that evening vary from witness to witness.  It would not be wise for us to attempt such an endeavor from a cold record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, a definitive resolution of this issue is not necessary in the present case.  We believe that the appellant's written statement would be admissible even if we were to conclude that the roadside statements were indeed coerced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore apply the heightened threshold of admissibility and begin our analysis by examining the voluntariness of the written statement independent of any potential taint that may have lingered from the roadside.  The voluntariness of a statement \"depends on 'whether the will of the defendant [was] overborne so that the statement was not his free and voluntary act, and that question [is] to be resolved in light of the totality of the circumstances.' \"  United States v. Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551271\"><a href=\"/opinion/551271/united-states-v-walter-v-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 241 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting Bryant v. Vose, 785 F.2d at 367-68).   The appellant argued below that the denial of her repeated requests to use the bathroom constituted improper influence.  Indeed, she averred that she was willing to say anything at the police station to obtain permission to go to the bathroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, having the benefit of hearing the testimony of both the appellant and Scott Pelletier, reached two conclusions on this point.  First, the court found that the appellant's requests to use the bathroom were only part of \"a ploy to obtain an opportunity to destroy evidence.\"  United States v. Marenghi, 896 F.Supp. at 217.   Second, the court determined that Scott Pelletier's refusal to permit the appellant to use the bathroom was prompted solely by his valid concerns that the appellant might dispose of any contraband concealed on her person, and did not amount to improper police conduct.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We, much like the district court, are reluctant to excuse the absence of a female officer at the police station that evening.  It was, at the very least, imprudent not to have a female officer immediately available that evening, particularly since the police knew that two females were going to be taken into custody more than ninety minutes prior to their arrival at the police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding our concern on this point, the evidence clearly supports the district court's conclusions with respect to the motivations of both the officers and the appellant.  The appellant has not directed our attention to any evidence suggesting that she was denied access to the bathroom in an effort to induce her to provide a statement.  As such, we conclude that the district court's determination with respect to the voluntariness of the written statement was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, we would proceed to inquire as to whether the appellant had been advised of, and waived, her constitutional rights.  In this case, however, the appellant does not challenge the district court's findings with respect to her knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole question that remains, then, is whether the written statement could possibly have been tainted by any coercion lingering from the roadside.  In order to resolve this issue, we must compare and contrast the circumstances surrounding each of the two statements.  In so doing, we look to several factors:  the change in the place of the interrogations;  the time that passed between the statements;  and the change in the identity of the interrogators.

First, several hours elapsed between the time the appellant made the roadside statements and the time she provided the written statement.  Second, the appellant dictated the written statement in a lunch room at the police station.  There is no suggestion that any of the \"possibly\" coercive elements from the roadside, in particular, the drug-detecting dog, were present at this location.  Moreover, the appellant provided the statement after she had been permitted to use a bathroom.  Finally, the impact of Scott Pelletier's presence at both locations is not appreciable:  neither the appellant nor the record suggest that he was personally responsible for any coercive behavior at the police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A thorough examination of the briefs and record in this case reveals nothing to support the appellant's contention that her written statement was coerced.  Instead, the evidence bolsters the district court's conclusion that the appellant voluntarily provided the statement to the authorities.  Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A detailed account of the investigation can be found in the July 17, 1995 Memorandum and Order of the district court.
