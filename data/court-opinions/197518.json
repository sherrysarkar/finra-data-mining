Upon  careful consideration of  the briefs\r                            \r\n\nand  record, we  conclude that  the  district court  properly\r\n\ngranted   summary   judgment  on   appellant's   federal  age\r\n\ndiscrimination claims.  \r\n\n     The district  court  applied  the  correct  standard  in\r\n\nreviewing the summary judgment motion and in determining that\r\n\nappellant  failed  to  make  a  prima  facie  showing  of  an\r\n\nessential  element of  his age  discrimination  claims.   The\r\n\nuncontested facts submitted by appellee showed that appellant\r\n\nwas  not fully qualified  for either of  the positions, while\r\n\nthe two individuals hired were so qualified.  Even were we to\r\n\ncredit appellant's additional assertions  about his education\r\n\nand  experience, he  still  has  not shown  that  he met  the\r\n\nobjective qualifications for the positions.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
