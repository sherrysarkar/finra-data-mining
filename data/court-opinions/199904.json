Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n          Torruella, Selya, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    John Ward-Llambias for appellant.\n\n    Raphael Peña-Ramón, for appellee Hospital.\n\n     Humberto R. Vázquez-Sandoval, with whom González Castañer,\nMorales & Guzmán, C.S.P. was on brief, for appellee Marmalejo.\n\n\n                         MARCH 26, 2002\n\f 1               PER CURIAM.       Emilio Alicea Martínez (\"Alicea\") appeals\n\n 2   from the district court's entry of judgment in favor of defendants\n\n 3   Hospital Menonita de Cayey et al. (collectively, the \"Hospital\").\n\n 4   In his complaint, Alicea alleged that the Hospital's emergency room\n\n 5   staff     failed    to    perform    an        \"appropriate      medical    screening\n\n 6   examination\" and to provide necessary stabilizing treatment, as\n\n 7   required by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act,\n\n 8   42 U.S.C. § 1395dd (\"EMTALA\").             He claimed that the same mistakes\n\n 9   also constituted medical malpractice under Puerto Rican law.\n\n10               Adopting the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate\n\n11   judge, the district court concluded that Alicea had no cause of\n12   action under       EMTALA    because      he    stated    only   a     garden   variety\n\n13   malpractice claim.          Alicea Martínez v. Hosp. Menonita de Cayey,\n\n14   2001 WL 1636798 (D.P.R. July 26, 2001).                    The court granted the\n15   Hospital's motion for summary judgment on the EMTALA claim and\n\n16   declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Puerto Rico\n\n17   malpractice claims, dismissing the latter without prejudice.                         We\n\n18   affirm.\n\n19               EMTALA       protects   against       differential       treatment,     not\n\n20   negligence.      It was enacted in response to concerns \"that hospital\n21   emergency rooms [were] refusing to accept or treat patients with\n\n22   emergency       conditions    if    the   patient       [did]    not    have    medical\n\n23   insurance.\" Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1189 (1st\n\n24   Cir.    1995)    (internal    quotation         marks    omitted).       The    statute\n\n25   mandates that \"all patients be treated fairly when they arrive in\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f1    the emergency department of a participating hospital and that all\n\n2    patients who need some treatment will get a first response at\n\n3    minimum and will not simply be turned away.\"          Reynolds v. Me. Gen.\n\n 4   Health, 218 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2000).          It does not create a\n\n5    federal cause of action for claims of medical malpractice.                Id.\n\n6    Thus, \"faulty screening, in a particular case, as opposed to\n 7   disparate   screening   or   refusing   to   screen    at   all,   does   not\n\n 8   contravene the statute.\"     Correa, 69 F.3d at 1192-93.\n\n 9               Here, Alicea's complaint set forth a charge of faulty\n\n10   screening; namely, that the Hospital's emergency room staff erred\n\n11   in concluding that he was not suffering from an emergency condition\n\n12   after he swallowed part of a pork chop.        Recognizing the limited\n\n13   purpose of EMTALA, the district court and the magistrate judge\n14   concluded that such a claim fell outside the scope of the statute.\n\n15   We agree, and affirm on the basis of their well-reasoned opinions.\n\n16               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f",
