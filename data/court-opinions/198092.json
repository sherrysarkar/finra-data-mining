Balliro, Sr., with whom Balliro &amp; Mondano and\r\nVictoria L. Nadel were on brief, for appellant.\r\nKevin J. Cloherty, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Geoffrey E. Hobart,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                               \r\n\n            August 13, 1998\r\n                                         TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  George Currier was arrested in\r\nconnection with a large undercover investigation and sting\r\noperation of cocaine and methamphetamine sales involving the Boston\r\narea Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club.  He was eventually indicted and\r\nconvicted of numerous drug trafficking crimes.  Currier appeals\r\nonly one of those counts.  The count at issue is Count Twenty,\r\ncarrying and using a firearm during and in relation to a drug\r\ntrafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1).  Unlike\r\nthe other charges, this Count did not arise out of the undercover\r\ninvestigation, but specifically out of an incident during the\r\nexecution of Currier's arrest warrant in which he drew his gun on\r\nan arresting officer.  The narrow issue on appeal is whether\r\nCurrier's use of his revolver was \"in relation to\" his drug\r\ntrafficking offenses.  We agree with the district court that it\r\nwas, and therefore affirm.\r\n                BACKGROUND\r\nOn September 5, 1996, the DEA concluded an investigation\r\ninto various drug trafficking activities of members of the Salem,\r\nMassachusetts Chapter of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club with the\r\narrest of sixteen people and the execution of ten search warrants. \r\nCurrier, who is not a member of the Hell's Angels, was arrested on\r\nthat day for his role in arranging cocaine and methamphetamine\r\nsales with the motorcycle club.  The  924(c) charge at issue in\r\nthis case is based on events that took place during Currier's\r\narrest in the early morning hours of September 5, 1996.\r\nAs the members of the Currier arrest team approached the\r\nbasement door of Currier's apartment, they loudly announced, \"State\r\nPolice, DEA, Police\" and knocked on the door.  When no one\r\nresponded, a Revere, Massachusetts police officer assigned to the\r\narrest and search team used a battering ram to make a forcible\r\nentry into the apartment.  On his first attempt to break in the\r\ndoor, the officer accidentally missed the wooden frame of the door\r\nand broke the door window.  On his second attempt, the door lock\r\ngave way and the door opened.  As the door opened and entry was\r\nmade, the members of the arrest team continued yelling, \"State\r\nPolice, DEA, Police!\"\r\nWhen Sergeant Martin Conley of the Massachusetts State\r\nPolice, a member of the arrest and search team, stepped into the\r\napartment he noticed a closed door just behind the open front door\r\nto the apartment.  Sgt. Conley tried to kick open the closed door. \r\nAlthough the door initially opened, the door met with resistance\r\nand shut.  Sgt. Conley kicked the door a second time and it opened.\r\nWhen the door opened, Sgt. Conley was staring down the\r\nbarrel of the suspect's silver revolver.  Currier, who was not\r\nclothed at the time, was standing about four feet from the entrance\r\nto the door in a \"shooter's stance,\" with the gun pointed directly\r\nat the officer.  Sgt. Conley, who also had his gun drawn, ordered\r\nCurrier to drop his weapon.  Currier remained in a shooter's\r\nstance.  Sgt. Conley again ordered Currier to drop his weapon. \r\nThis time, Currier took a step back and dropped his weapon.  He was\r\nthen placed under arrest.\r\nDuring the search of Currier's apartment, Sgt. Conley\r\ndiscovered approximately ten ounces of methamphetamine hidden in\r\nthe drop ceiling of the bedroom, close to where Currier was\r\nstanding when he confronted Sgt. Conley.  Officers also found piles\r\nof money in elastic bands on Currier's bed.  A total of $4,225 was\r\nrecovered from Currier's bedroom, as well as a triple beam scale. \r\nThe arresting officers took custody of Currier's weapon, a Smith &amp;\r\nWesson .357 magnum, six-shot revolver loaded with hollow-point\r\nammunition.\r\nCurrier elected a bench trial on the count at issue.  At\r\nthe conclusion of the evidence and after hearing argument from the\r\nparties, the district court found Currier guilty of violating 18\r\nU.S.C.  924(c).  After announcing the guilty verdict, the district\r\ncourt explained its verdict as follows:\r\n[T]he court finds beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that you were at all material times\r\nrelevant to Count 20 engaged in a drug\r\ntrafficking offense, that is, the\r\npossession of methamphetamine with the\r\nintent to distribute it.  The court\r\nlikewise finds beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat your conduct in grabbing the weapon\r\nand pointing it at the police officer\r\nconstitutes a use of the weapon. \r\n\nThe question, the closest question, is\r\nwhether your use of the weapon was \"in\r\nrelation to\" the drug trafficking offense. \r\nI do not see, despite Mr. Balliro's able\r\nargument, that Bailey intended to retreat\r\nfrom the language in Smith v. United\r\nStates that the gun must at least\r\nfacilitate or have the potential of\r\nfacilitating the drug trafficking offense. \r\nThe way I interpret it is -- and I believe\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that you had\r\nthat weapon there to facilitate drug\r\ntrafficking.  \r\n\nBut I recognize that Bailey requires more. \r\nThat if you had not reached for the\r\nweapon, you could not be convicted of this\r\noffense.  Here, you reached for the weapon\r\nwhich you had there to facilitate the drug\r\ntrafficking offense, and consistent with\r\nthe reasoning in United States v.\r\nTolliver, which is virtually on all fours\r\nwith this case, I think that a guilty\r\nfinding is . . . warranted.\r\n\nIn fairness to you, however, let me say\r\nthat I  have a reasonable doubt concerning\r\nwhether when you snatched that weapon up\r\nand pointed it at a police officer, you\r\nhad any thought at all at that instant\r\nabout drugs or about drug proceeds.  I do\r\nnot think that, at that time in the, in\r\nthat frenetic moment, the government has\r\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that one\r\nof your purposes was to get the drugs or\r\nthe drug paraphernalia or the proceeds out\r\nof that apartment with you.  The most that\r\nI think is proved is that, beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, is that you snatched up\r\nthat weapon to get yourself out of there.\r\n\nThe narrow issue on appeal is whether, in light of these\r\nfindings, the district court properly found that Currier's use of\r\nhis revolver was \"in relation to\" his underlying trafficking\r\noffenses.\r\n                 ANALYSIS\r\nSection 924(c)(1) of Title 18 imposes a five-year,\r\nconsecutive term of imprisonment upon any person who \"during and in\r\nrelation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . .\r\nuses or carries a firearm.\"  There are essentially three elements\r\nto a  924(c) offense: (1) that the defendant committed the\r\npredicate drug trafficking crime or crime of violence; (2) that the\r\ndefendant knowingly carried or used a firearm; and (3) that the\r\ndefendant did so during and in relation to the specified predicate\r\noffense.  See United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 216 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  Currier does not deny that he committed the predicate drug\r\ntrafficking crime or that his brandishing of his revolver on the\r\nmorning of September 5, 1996, constitutes a \"use\" under 18 U.S.C.\r\n924 (c)(1).  Cf. Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 148\r\n(1995) (weapon must be brandished, displayed, bartered, or fired in\r\norder to constitute \"use\").  He only disputes that the requisite\r\nnexus existed, i.e., that his gun was used \"during and in relation\r\nto\" his drug trafficking offenses.\r\nCurrier acknowledges that grabbing a gun in hopes of\r\npostponing or escaping an imminent arrest for an underlying drug\r\ntrafficking crime violates  924(c)(1).  See, e.g., United Statesv. Johnson, 87 F.3d 133, 138 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam).  He\r\nargues, however, that he was only using his gun in self-defense,\r\nand that he dropped the gun as soon as he recognized that the\r\npolice were involved.  If, indeed, Currier was using his gun only\r\nfor self-defense, and had formed no intent to evade or escape\r\narrest, or to facilitate his drug trafficking in any other way,\r\nthen his conviction under  924(c)(1) might well be improper.  \"The\r\nphrase 'in relation to' . . . at a minimum, clarifies that the\r\nfirearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug\r\ntrafficking crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result\r\nof accident or coincidence.\"  Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223,\r\n237-38 (1993).\r\nCurrier maintains that the district court's factual\r\nfindings recited above, which he does not find erroneous, support\r\nhis self-defense claim.  The question presented in this case, then,\r\nis whether those district court findings support Currier's self-\r\ndefense argument, or, at the very least, are ambiguous.  We\r\nconclude that, while the findings do not explicitly reject\r\nCurrier's version of the facts, they do so unambiguously.\r\nThe first indication that the district court rejected\r\nCurrier's self-defense argument is the statement that, \"consistent\r\nwith the reasoning in United States v. Tolliver, which is virtually\r\non all fours with this case, I think that a guilty finding is . . .\r\nwarranted.\"  In United States v. Tolliver, 116 F.3d 120 (5th Cir.),\r\ncert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 324 (1997) one of the appellants, Shane\r\nSterling, reached for his pistol when federal agents stormed into\r\nhis bedroom to arrest him.  See id. at 124.  Also in Sterling's\r\napartment at the time of the raid were drug records and a cache of\r\nweapons. See id. at 126.  Sterling maintained that his act of\r\nreaching for his gun was one of \"misguided self-defense,\" not one\r\n\"in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense.  In affirming\r\nSterling's  924(c) conviction, the Fifth Circuit noted that the\r\njury rejected Sterling's self-defense theory, and concluded that\r\nhis attempt to reach his gun could have facilitated the conspiracy\r\nby preventing the arrest of a co-conspirator and \"forestalling the\r\nseizure of various instrumentalities of the conspiracy.\"  Id. at\r\n125-26.  We can only conclude that the district court found\r\nTolliver to be \"virtually on all fours with this case\" because he\r\nrejected Currier's self-defense theory and determined that his\r\nsnatching of his gun could have facilitated the underlying drug\r\ntrafficking crimes.  The district court judge would not have found\r\nTolliver directly applicable to the present case if he had accepted\r\nCurrier's self-defense argument.\r\nThe second indication that the district court judge\r\nrejected Currier's self-defense argument is his statement that \"the\r\nmost that I think is proved is that, beyond a reasonable doubt, is\r\nthat you snatched up that weapon to get yourself out of there.\"  If\r\nthe judge had accepted Currier's version of the facts, he might\r\nhave said, \"you snatched up that weapon to defend yourself,\" or,\r\n\"to protect yourself,\" or even, \"because you were afraid for your\r\nsafety.\"  Instead, he used the language of escape when he said \"get\r\nyourself out of there.\"  This statement is clearly at odds with\r\nCurrier's version of the facts.\r\nYet another clue to the district court's implicit\r\nfindings can be gathered from what was not said during the\r\nannouncements following the delivery of the verdict.  At no time\r\ndid the district court mention self-defense, or anything related to\r\nself-defense.  If the district court judge had been moved to accept\r\nCurrier's argument, he would likely have so indicated in some\r\nmanner.  Instead, he reasonably assumed that he had made his\r\nrejection of that argument clear through his Tolliver analysis, his\r\n\"get yourself out of there\" comment, and, ultimately, his decision\r\nto convict Currier on the   924(c)(1) charge.  There is nothing to\r\nprevent this court from making the obvious inference in this case. \r\nThe district court concluded that Currier grabbed the gun with the\r\nintention of escaping or forestalling his arrest, and, however\r\nshort-lived that notion, his conviction under 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1)\r\nwas proper.\r\n                CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of\r\nthe district court.\n",

We can only conclude that the district court found Tolliver to be \"virtually on all fours with this case\" because he rejected Currier's self-defense theory and determined that his snatching of his gun could have facilitated the underlying drug trafficking crimes.  The district court judge would not have found Tolliver directly applicable to the present case if he had accepted Currier's self-defense argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second indication that the district court judge rejected Currier's self-defense argument is his statement that \"the most that I think is proved is that, beyond a reasonable doubt, is that you snatched up that weapon to get yourself out of there.\"   If the judge had accepted Currier's version of the facts, he might have said, \"you snatched up that weapon to defend yourself,\" or, \"to protect yourself,\" or even, \"because you were afraid for your safety.\"   Instead, he used the language of escape when he said \"get yourself out of there.\"   This statement is clearly at odds with Currier's version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet another clue to the district court's implicit findings can be gathered from what was not said during the announcements following the delivery of the verdict.  At no time did the district court mention self-defense, or anything related to self-defense.  If the district court judge had been moved to accept Currier's argument, he would likely have so indicated in some manner.  Instead, he reasonably assumed that he had made his rejection of that argument clear through his Tolliver analysis, his \"get yourself out of there\" comment, and, ultimately, his decision to convict Currier on the &#167; 924(c)(1) charge.  There is nothing to prevent this court from making the obvious inference in this case.  The district court concluded that Currier grabbed the gun with the intention of escaping or forestalling his arrest, and, however short-lived that notion, his conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

He was eventually indicted and convicted of numerous drug trafficking crimes.  Currier appeals only one of those counts.  The count at issue is Count Twenty, carrying and using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  Unlike the other charges, this Count did not arise out of the undercover investigation, but specifically out of an incident during the execution of Currier's arrest warrant in which he drew his gun on an arresting officer.  The narrow issue on appeal is whether Currier's use of his revolver was \"in relation to\" his drug trafficking offenses.  We agree with the district court that it was, and therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 5, 1996, the DEA concluded an investigation into various drug trafficking activities of members of the Salem, Massachusetts Chapter of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club with the arrest of sixteen people and the execution of ten search warrants.  Currier, who is not a member of the Hell's Angels, was arrested on that day for his role in arranging cocaine and methamphetamine sales with the motorcycle club.  The &#167; 924(c) charge at issue in this case is based on events that took place during Currier's arrest in the early morning hours of September 5, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the members of the Currier arrest team approached the basement door of Currier's apartment, they loudly announced, \"State Police, DEA, Police\" and knocked on the door.  When no one responded, a Revere, Massachusetts police officer assigned to the arrest and search team used a battering ram to make a forcible entry into the apartment.  On his first attempt to break in the door, the officer accidentally missed the wooden frame of the door and broke the door window.  On his second attempt, the door lock gave way and the door opened.  As the door opened and entry was made, the members of the arrest team continued yelling, \"State Police, DEA, Police!\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Sergeant Martin Conley of the Massachusetts State Police, a member of the arrest and search team, stepped into the apartment he noticed a closed door just behind the open front door to the apartment.  Sgt. Conley tried to kick open the closed door.  Although the door initially opened, the door met with resistance and shut.  Sgt. Conley kicked the door a second time and it opened.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the door opened, Sgt. Conley was staring down the barrel of the suspect's silver revolver.  Currier, who was not clothed at the time, was standing about four feet from the entrance to the door in a \"shooter's stance,\" with the gun pointed directly at the officer.  Sgt. Conley, who also had his gun drawn, ordered Currier to drop his weapon.  Currier remained in a shooter's stance.  Sgt. Conley again ordered Currier to drop his weapon.  This time, Currier took a step back and dropped his weapon.  He was then placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the search of Currier's apartment, Sgt. Conley discovered approximately ten ounces of methamphetamine hidden in the drop ceiling of the bedroom, close to where Currier was standing when he confronted Sgt. Conley.  Officers also found piles of money in elastic bands on Currier's bed.  A total of $4,225 was recovered from Currier's bedroom, as well as a triple beam scale.  The arresting officers took custody of Currier's weapon, a Smith &amp; Wesson .357 magnum, six-shot revolver loaded with hollow-point ammunition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Currier elected a bench trial on the count at issue.  At the conclusion of the evidence and after hearing argument from the parties, the district court found Currier guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).  After announcing the guilty verdict, the district court explained its verdict as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[T]he court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that you were at all material times relevant to Count 20 engaged in a drug trafficking offense, that is, the possession of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute it.  The court likewise finds beyond a reasonable doubt that your conduct in grabbing the weapon and pointing it at the police officer constitutes a use of the weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The question, the closest question, is whether your use of the weapon was \"in relation to\" the drug trafficking offense.  I do not see, despite Mr. Balliro's able argument, that Bailey intended to retreat from the language in Smith v. United States that the gun must at least facilitate or have the potential of facilitating the drug trafficking offense.  The way I interpret it is--and I believe beyond a reasonable doubt, that you had that weapon there to facilitate drug trafficking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>But I recognize that Bailey requires more.  That if you had not reached for the weapon, you could not be convicted of this offense.  Here, you reached for the weapon which you had there to facilitate the drug trafficking offense, and consistent with the reasoning in United States v. Tolliver, which is virtually on all fours with this case, I think that a guilty finding is ... warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>In fairness to you, however, let me say that I have a reasonable doubt concerning whether when you snatched that weapon up and pointed it at a police officer, you had any thought at all at that instant about drugs or about drug proceeds.  I do not think that, at that time in the, in that frenetic moment, the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that one of your purposes was to get the drugs or the drug paraphernalia or the proceeds out of that apartment with you.  The most that I think is proved is that, beyond a reasonable doubt, is that you snatched up that weapon to get yourself out of there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrow issue on appeal is whether, in light of these findings, the district court properly found that Currier's use of his revolver was \"in relation to\" his underlying trafficking offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 924(c)(1) of Title 18 imposes a five-year, consecutive term of imprisonment upon any person who \"during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm.\"   There are essentially three elements to a &#167; 924(c) offense:  (1) that the defendant committed the predicate drug trafficking crime or crime of violence;  (2) that the defendant knowingly carried or used a firearm;  and (3) that the defendant did so during and in relation to the specified predicate offense.  See United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196640\"><a href=\"/opinion/196640/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 216 (1st Cir.1996).  Currier does not deny that he committed the predicate drug trafficking crime or that his brandishing of his revolver on the morning of September 5, 1996, constitutes a \"use\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  Cf. Bailey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 148, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span> (1995) (weapon must be brandished, displayed, bartered, or fired in order to constitute \"use\").  He only disputes that the requisite nexus existed, i.e., that his gun was used \"during and in relation to\" his drug trafficking offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Currier acknowledges that grabbing a gun in hopes of postponing or escaping an imminent arrest for an underlying drug trafficking crime violates &#167; 924(c)(1).  See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720569\"><a href=\"/opinion/720569/united-states-v-terrance-lenair-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 138 (5th Cir.1996) (per curiam).  He argues, however, that he was only using his gun in self-defense, and that he dropped the gun as soon as he recognized that the police were involved.  If, indeed, Currier was using his gun only for self-defense, and had formed no intent to evade or escape arrest, or to facilitate his drug trafficking in any other way, then his conviction under &#167; 924(c)(1) might well be improper.  \"The phrase 'in relation to' ... at a minimum, clarifies that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime;  its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\"  Smith v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 237-38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112866\"><a href=\"/opinion/112866/smith-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The question presented in this case, then, is whether those district court findings support Currier's self-defense argument, or, at the very least, are ambiguous.  We conclude that, while the findings do not explicitly reject Currier's version of the facts, they do so unambiguously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first indication that the district court rejected Currier's self-defense argument is the statement that, \"consistent with the reasoning in United States v.
