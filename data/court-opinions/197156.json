At issue in this case are the\r                                           \r\n\nequitable  remedies  awarded to  the  plaintiff,  Mary Jane  Kerr\r\n\nSelgas (\"Kerr Selgas\"), in a sex discrimination suit  against her\r\n\nemployer, American  Airlines (\"American\").   A jury  awarded Kerr\r\n\nSelgas a lump sum award in that suit that included an unspecified\r\n\namount for front pay.  In an earlier appeal,  this court affirmed\r\n\nthe judgment.   See Kerr  Selgas v. American  Airlines, Inc.,  69\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  1205  (1st  Cir. 1995)  (\"Kerr  I\").

It\r\n\nfurther  claims  that  the   district  court  erred  in  ordering\r\n\nreinstatement  without conducting  a hearing,  without permitting\r\n\nAmerican  to conduct  additional  discovery,  and in  considering\r\n\nextra-record evidence submitted  by Kerr Selgas.   We affirm  the\r\n\ncourt's  legal judgment that both front pay and reinstatement are\r\n\npermissible, but we vacate the  district court's order and remand\r\n\nfor a  hearing on whether reinstatement is  an appropriate remedy\r\n\nhere.  \r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n     The  facts of the underlying suit are discussed in detail in\r\n\nour opinion in  Kerr I;  accordingly, we relate  here only  those\r                                \r\n\nfacts relevant to the instant appeal.\r\n\n     Mary Jane Kerr Selgas was fired by American Airlines in 1992\r\n\nafter 18 years with  the company; she brought suit  under federal\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nand Puerto Rico law, alleging sex discrimination, harassment, and\r\n\nviolation  of her local law right to  privacy.  At the conclusion\r\n\nof a  three week  trial, a  jury awarded her  over $1  million in\r\n\ndamages; under Puerto Rico law, this was doubled automatically to\r\n\nover  $2 million.   A  remittitur and  the rejection  of punitive\r\n\ndamages by this court in Kerr I resulted in a final damages award\r                                         \r\n\nof $1.2 million. \r\n\n     While Kerr Selgas had requested reinstatement in her initial\r\n\ncomplaint, and also in subsequent motions, the district court set\r\n\nthis issue aside  during the course of  the trial and  during the\r\n\npendency of the  Kerr I  appeal.   One month  after this  court's\r                                 \r\n\ndecision  in  Kerr I  on November  13,  1995, the  district court\r                              \r\n\nordered  American to  reinstate Kerr  Selgas.   The court  did so\r\n\nwithout holding a full hearing  on this issue, and its order  was\r\n\nbased  on the  evidence  received  at  trial  and  on  additional\r\n\nmaterials submitted with motions by Kerr Selgas.  American claims\r\n\nthat  this  reinstatement  order  is improper  for  two  reasons.\r\n\nFirst, it argues that reinstatement and front pay are alternative\r\n\nremedies and that Kerr  Selgas was fully compensated by  the jury\r\n\naward  including   front  pay.    Second,   if  reinstatement  is\r\n\npermissible,  it argues that it should not have been ordered here\r\n\nwithout  first  giving  American   additional  discovery  and  an\r\n\nopportunity  to be heard  on the issue,  particularly if evidence\r\n\nobtained after the trial was to be considered.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n     Our  review of the district court's decision that both front\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\npay  and reinstatement could be  awarded together as  part of the\r\n\nremedies available to  a Title  VII plaintiff is  de novo, as  we\r                                                                   \r\n\nreview for legal error.

Runyon,  50 F.3d  1103, 1111  (1st Cir.  1995).   Our\r                            \r\n\nreview is deferential, and we will not normally find an  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion absent strong evidence of a lapse in judgment.

In Title VII  cases, we must be mindful of  the\r\n\nstatute's  dual purposes of eliminating discrimination and making\r\n\nits victims whole.  Id.  \r                                \r\n\nA.   Equitable Remedies Under Title VII:  Front Pay and\r\n     Reinstatement.\r\n\n     The  remedial  scheme in  Title VII  is  designed to  make a\r\n\nplaintiff who has been the victim of discrimination whole through\r\n\nthe use of equitable remedies.  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.   405,  418   (1975).     These   remedies  (which   include\r\n\nreinstatement, back pay, and  front pay) are accordingly intended\r\n\nto  compensate a plaintiff for the effects of the discrimination,\r\n\nboth past and future, and to bring the plaintiff  to the position\r\n\nwhich s/he would have occupied  but for the illegal act(s).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nShore v. Federal  Express Corp.,  777 F.2d 1155,  1159 (6th  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1985).  Under  Title VII, the  first choice is  to reinstate  the\r\n\nplaintiff at  the original  employer; this accomplishes  the dual\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ngoals  of  providing  full  coverage  for  the  plaintiff  and of\r\n\ndeterring such conduct by employers in the future.  See Scarfo v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCabletron Systems, Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 954 (1st Cir. 1995).  \r                                 \r\n\n     Where  reinstatement  is  not  immediately  available  as  a\r\n\nremedy,  either  due  to  the plaintiff's  condition,  or  due to\r\n\nconditions at  the employer that preclude  the plaintiff's return\r\n\n(such  as  hostility  of other  employees,  or  the  need for  an\r\n\ninnocent  employee  to be  \"bumped\"  in  order  to reinstate  the\r\n\nplaintiff),  front   pay  is  available  as   an  alternative  to\r\n\ncompensate the plaintiff from the conclusion of trial through the\r\n\npoint at which the plaintiff can either return to the employer or\r\n\nobtain comparable employment elsewhere.  See id.; see also Powers\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Grinnell Corp., 915  F.2d 34, 42 (1st  Cir. 1990); Wildman  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nLerner Stores Corp., 771 F.2d 605, 616 (1st Cir. 1985) (front pay\r                             \r\n\nmay be awarded in ADEA suits where reinstatement is impracticable\r\n\nor  impossible; circumstances  of  each case  to be  considered);\r\n\nDillon v. Coles, 746 F.2d 998, 1006 (3rd  Cir. 1984).  It is this\r                         \r\n\ncontext,  where the overarching  preference is  for reinstatement\r\n\nand front pay is  an alternative for finite periods  during which\r\n\nreinstatement is unavailable,1 which  is the key to understanding\r\n\nthe construction of remedial  packages.  In this context,  it can\r\n\nbe  seen  that front  pay  and  reinstatement  are  not  mutually\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    See, e.g.,  Scarfo v. Cabletron Systems,  Inc., 54 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n931, 953 (1st Cir.  1995)(\"Front pay refers to damages  for wages\r\nfrom  the  date  of  judgment  to  some  specified  date  in  the\r\nfuture.\");  Thompson v.  Sawyer,  678 F.2d  257,  293 (D.C.  Cir.\r                                         \r\n1982)(\"[F]ront pay should persist, however, only until the wrongs\r\nfor which plaintiffs are owed backpay have been righted.\")    \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nexclusive.    Front  pay  takes  a  plaintiff  to  the  point  of\r\n\nemployability.   Reinstatement  at that  point would,  in effect,\r\n\n\"perfect\" the remedy because  the plaintiff would be back  in the\r\n\nvery job she lost unlawfully.\r\n\n     Trial courts have discretion to fashion the  awards in Title\r\n\nVII cases so as to fully  compensate a plaintiff in a manner that\r\n\nsuits the specific  facts of the  case; this discretion  includes\r\n\nthe  selection  of  the  elements  which  comprise  the  remedial\r\n\nrecovery.2   Albemarle, 422 U.S.  at 415-16.   Traditionally, the\r                                \r\n\ncourt determines the  whole remedial package  in one fell  swoop.\r\n\nHybrid awards combining front  pay with other equitable elements,\r\n\nwhile rare, are not novel.  The Court of Appeals for the District\r\n\nof  Columbia in Thompson v. Sawyer, 678  F.2d 257, 268 (D.C. Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1982),   commended  a   district  court's   award   (although  it\r\n\nreformulated certain of the elements) which included back pay and\r\n\nfront pay to be paid to  female bindery workers at the Government\r\n\nPrinting  Office through such time as women comprised half of the\r\n\nlitigated positions.  Reinstatement and front pay were explicitly\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    American claims that by  presenting her claim for front\r\npay to the  jury in the  form of jury  instructions, Kerr  Selgas\r\n\"elected\" front pay as  a remedy, rather than reinstatement.   It\r\nis  clear that in  a Title  VII case, it  is the court  which has\r\ndiscretion to fashion relief  comprised of the equitable remedies\r\nit sees as appropriate,  and not the parties which  may determine\r\nwhich  equitable remedies  are available.   See  James v.  Sears,\r                                                                           \r\nRoebuck  &amp; Co., 21  F.3d 989, 997  (10th Cir. 1994)  (decision to\r                        \r\naward  reinstatement  or  front  pay is  at  court's  discretion;\r\nplaintiffs who refused  reinstatement where not impracticable  or\r\nimpossible  may not elect front pay simply because they prefer it\r\nas  remedy).   Additionally, Kerr  Selgas' repeated  requests for\r\nreinstatement in her original complaint and in subsequent motions\r\nbely a  claim that  she elected  one  form of  recovery over  the\r\nother.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncobbled  together as part of the relief afforded the plaintiff in\r\n\nValdez  v. Church's Fried Chicken,  Inc., 683 F.  Supp. 596 (W.D.\r                                                  \r\n\nTx.  1988),  where reinstatement  to  a  managerial position  was\r\n\nordered  as soon as a position became available and front pay was\r\n\nordered  to  continue until  the  reinstatement  occurred.   This\r\n\ncourt,  while it  has  not previously  addressed this  particular\r\n\nissue,  has indicated a preference for a flexible approach in the\r\n\nconstruction  of remedial awards.   See Lussier, 50  F.3d at 1112\r                                                         \r\n\n(remedial tapestry  is made up  of multiple strands  of relief).3\r\n\nThe  district court therefore had the option here of combining an\r\n\naward of front pay  with reinstatement.  Its only  limitation was\r\n\nto avoid duplication.  See Scarfo, 54 F.3d at 955 (citing Dopp v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHTP Corp., 947 F.2d 506, 516 (1st Cir. 1991)(duplicative remedies\r                   \r\n\nare to  be  avoided)).   Because  courts typically  consider  all\r\n\nremedies  at the  same time,  duplication most commonly  would be\r\n\navoided by denying front  pay when an immediate  reinstatement is\r\n\nordered.  \r\n\n     Although the district  court was not explicit  about what it\r\n\nwas  doing  in this  instance  (allowing American  to  argue that\r\n\nreinstatement  had been  excluded  as a  prospective remedy),  it\r\n\nappears to  have bifurcated the traditional  remedies analysis on\r\n\nthe  assumption that, since Kerr  Selgas was unable  to return to\r\n\nwork at  the time of  trial, pay  for some future  time --  i.e.,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    We  note that  the cases  American has  cited from  our\r\ncircuit merely support the  proposition that reinstatement is the\r\npreferred first remedy, and that where this is unavailable, front\r\npay may  be awarded,  rather than precluding  a remedial  package\r\nwhich contains both elements. \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nfront  pay -- was necessary to compensate Kerr Selgas, whether or\r\n\nnot reinstatement would be an appropriate additional remedy.4  It\r\n\ntherefore reserved the reinstatement issue  for later resolution,\r\n\nand  sent the  compensatory elements  (back pay,  front  pay, and\r\n\ndamages) to the jury for determination.5   By including front pay\r\n\nin its lump sum award, the jury fully compensated Kerr Selgas for\r\n\nthe discrimination she had suffered from the point of the initial\r\n\nillegal  act to  the  point  at which  she  would  once again  be\r\n\nemployable at her prior level.  The court then took up post-trial\r\n\nwhether American was required to take her back.  \r\n\n     Due to the  amorphous nature  of the  jury award  -- it  was\r\n\nsimply a lump sum  with no distinctions made between  the amounts\r\n\nallocated  to  back  pay, front  pay,  or  damages,  and with  no\r\n\nstatement as to the time  period which the front pay portion  was\r\n\nintended to cover -- it cannot be stated with any certainty which\r\n\ndates or figures  the jurors  determined were  applicable to  the\r\n\nfront pay  issue.6  In  other words,  it is not  clear when  they\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4    In  its  June  23,   1994  Order,  the  district  court\r\nexplicitly  stated  that  the  issue  of  reinstatement  remained\r\npending resolution by the court.  \r\n\n     5     We would counsel district  courts in the future  to be\r\nexplicit about  the procedures  they are following,  whether they\r\nchoose to  reserve an equitable remedy  for future determination,\r\nor conclude that it is inapplicable in a particular instance.  \r\n\n     6    Additionally, an award of front pay, constituting as it\r\ndoes, an  estimate of what a plaintiff might have earned had s/he\r\nbeen  reinstated  at  the  conclusion of  trial,  is  necessarily\r\nspeculative.  See Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1023 (1st\r                                                 \r\nCir. 1979).   However, this speculative  aspect should not  deter\r\ncourts from  fashioning awards that accomplish  Title VII's goals\r\nof making a wronged plaintiff whole.  See Barbour v. Mitchell, 48\r                                                                       \r\nF.3d 1270,  1280  (D.C.  Cir. 1995)  (noting  courts  and  juries\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthought  she would  be ready  to  return to  work.   Testimony at\r\n\ntrial, however, put the longest date at 18 months after trial, or\r\n\nOctober  1995.7    Furthermore, in  its charge  to the  jury, the\r\n\ncourt specifically  limited any  damages to  those caused by  the\r\n\ndefendants'  wrongful conduct.8    Reinstatement was  ordered  in\r\n\nDecember 1995.  The  front pay and reinstatement awards thus seem\r\n\nmost reasonably to cover separate and  distinct periods of time.9\r\n\nBecause  there is no  duplication, the two  equitable remedies of\r\n\nfront pay and reinstatement  could be used in concert  to achieve\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nroutinely engage in some  speculation based on factual record  in\r\nother situations such as personal  injury cases when valuing lost\r\nearning capacity).  \r\n\n     7    American's expert testified that Kerr Selgas was fit to\r\nreturn to work  immediately after the  conclusion of trial;  Kerr\r\nSelgas' expert, on  the other  hand, testified that  it would  be\r\neight to  18 months before she  would be able to  return to work.\r\nThe  testimony  concerning  her  income  loss included  estimates\r\npresented by her expert  as to the losses she  would sustain were\r\nshe  to return to work  immediately, six months  after trial, and\r\none year after trial.  \r\n\n     8    In  its instructions to the jury, the court stated that\r\nthe jury could award damages only for injuries that the plaintiff\r\nproved were  caused by the defendants'  alleged wrongful conduct.\r\nThe court then instructed the jury to consider as elements of any\r\ndamages  award  back pay,  compensatory  damages  for any  future\r\npecuniary  losses, and  damages  for  emotional pain,  suffering,\r\ninconvenience and  mental anguish.  It  specifically required the\r\njury  to consider  two factors  relating to  damages for  loss of\r\nfuture earnings:  reduction of the  award by any amount that  the\r\nplaintiff  would  have expended  in  making  those earnings;  and\r\nsecondly, reduction of the award by considering the interest that\r\nthe plaintiff could earn on the amount of the award if she made a\r\nrelatively risk-free investment.  \r\n\n     9    Taken  at its  outside  possible limit,  the award  for\r\nfront pay would  seem to have extended from the  date of judgment\r\n(4/13/94) through October  1995.    Reinstatement was ordered  by\r\nthe district court on  December 13, 1995.  Accordingly,  there is\r\nno overlap between the time period covered by the front pay award\r\nand that covered by the reinstatement order.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nTitle  VII's  goal of  fully  compensating the  plaintiff.   This\r\n\nbrings  us to  American's  second point  on  appeal: whether  the\r\n\nprocess used to reach the reinstatement decision was proper.  \r\n\nB.   Admission of Evidence and Lack of Hearing on Restitution.\r\n\n     American  contends that  the trial  court erred  in ordering\r\n\nreinstatement  because it  impermissibly considered  evidence not\r\n\nadduced  at  trial,  and   because  American  was  not  permitted\r\n\nadditional discovery or a hearing on the reinstatement issue.  \r\n\n     In  considering   the  plaintiff's  post-trial   motion  for\r\n\nreinstatement, the court had before it both the evidence received\r\n\nat  trial, and  additional  evidence submitted  by the  plaintiff\r\n\npurporting to  demonstrate that some  of the  issues which  might\r\n\nhave  earlier precluded  reinstatement  (including  hostility  of\r\n\nother employees and the plaintiff's  own inability to work)  were\r\n\nno  longer bars to her  return.10  The  district court explicitly\r\n\nrelied  upon some  of  this evidence  in  its order,  citing  the\r\n\ninformation in a  newspaper article relating to the  departure of\r\n\ncertain   individuals    from   American,   and    her   treating\r\n\npsychologist's statement that  Kerr Selgas was  fit to return  to\r\n\nwork.    However,  the  court  also  noted  that  defendants  had\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10   Specifically, the plaintiff produced news  reports that\r\none of the chief offenders in her experience at American, Whadzen\r\nCarrasquillo,  had  left  the  company.    She  also  produced  a\r\nstatement by her treating psychologist, Carlos Velasquez, stating\r\nhe   believed  she  was  fit  to  return  to  work  at  American.\r\nVelasquez' affidavit,  however, speaks  only in the  most general\r\nterms: it states that on the basis of unspecified tests conducted\r\nat unspecified dates,  Kerr Selgas \"is  currently[...]functioning\r\nadequately\"  and that he therefore  believes she is  \"now able to\r\nreturn  and to carry out her duties as Account Sales Executive at\r\nAmerican Airlines.\" \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\npresented testimony at trial  that Kerr Selgas was fit  to return\r                                      \r\n\nto work in March 1994.11  \r\n\n     The adversarial system's search for truth and the assessment\r\n\nof  remedies are  predicated upon  an open  and fair  exchange of\r\n\nideas  and  information.   Lussier, 50  F.3d at  1113.   It  is a\r                                            \r\n\nfundamental principle of this  system that a fact finder  may not\r\n\nconsider extra-record evidence  concerning disputed  adjudicative\r\n\nfacts.   Id. at  1114.  While  we have suggested in  at least one\r                      \r\n\ncase  that parties  might  possibly waive  a  deprivation of  the\r\n\nevidentiary  and  procedural guarantees  embodied in  the managed\r\n\nadversarial  system  with  regard  to  extra-record evidence,  or\r\n\nconsent to a court's  consideration of it,  see id. at 1115,  the\r                                                             \r\n\nevidence  supporting such  a voluntary  and knowing  waiver would\r\n\nneed to be significant and unequivocal.\r\n\n     Such is not the  case here.  American repeatedly  stated its\r\n\nopposition to  Kerr Selgas'  reinstatement, and  more importantly\r\n\nrepeatedly requested a hearing and discovery on the reinstatement\r\n\nissue.12    Kerr Selgas  herself requested  a  jury trial  on the\r                                                             \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11   Kerr  Selgas  suggested  at   oral  argument  that  the\r\ndistrict court  could  have  reached  its  determination  without\r\nrelying  on  the new  evidence; however,  this  is belied  by the\r\nlanguage of the district court's order.\r\n\n     12   American  opposed Kerr Selgas' motion for reinstatement\r\nin  a 12-page opposition filed on December 23, 1994, citing among\r\nother reasons, the need for an evidentiary hearing and additional\r\ndiscovery  due to  the lack of  sufficient information  in either\r\nthe  evidence submitted  at trial  or the later  submissions with\r\nwhich to determine whether Kerr Selgas  was in fact fit to return\r\nto work.  In its July 27, 1995  Opposition to Plaintiff's Renewed\r\nRequest  for Reinstatement  and Related  Benefits, American  also\r\nopposed  Kerr Selgas' reinstatement.   Again, in  its December 8,\r\n1995  Opposition to  Plaintiff's  Request  for Reinstatement  and\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nreinstatement  issue  in  her  July 10,  1995  motion  requesting\r\n\nreinstatement.    Therefore,  there   is  no  indication  of  any\r\n\nintention  on either  party's  part to  waive  a hearing  on  the\r\n\nreinstatement issue.  \r\n\n     Where the  district court  based its determination  at least\r\n\npartially  on information not properly  before it in  the form of\r\n\nevidence admitted at trial,  and where the remedy to  be accorded\r\n\nthe plaintiff is as significant as reinstatement, we are hesitant\r\n\nto  applaud   anything  less  than  strict   adherence  to  those\r\n\nprocedures which  accord each party the opportunity  to be fairly\r\n\nheard  on   key  issues.     Accordingly,  while  we   hold  that\r\n\nreinstatement  may  properly  be  awarded  in  a  Title VII  case\r\n\ntogether  with front  pay  as long  as  there is  no  duplication\r\n\nbetween the two awards, in this case we  believe a hearing should\r\n\nhave   been  held   to   determine   whether  reinstatement   was\r\n\nappropriate.     Therefore,  we   vacate  the   district  court's\r\n\nreinstatement order and  remand for  proceedings consistent  with\r\n\nthis  opinion   to  determine  whether  Kerr   Selgas  should  be\r\n\nreinstated by American.13 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nRelated Benefits,  American raised its objection to reinstatement\r\nbeing ordered without an  evidentiary hearing and the opportunity\r\nfor further discovery.  \r\n\n     13   We anticipate  a limited  hearing on  the reinstatement\r\nissue.  See Uno  v. City of Holyoke,  72 F.3d 973, 992  (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n1995) (on  remand, lower court may conduct hearing without having\r\nnew trial  and permit parties  to supplement the  existing record\r\nwith  additional facts).  As Kerr Selgas has been compensated for\r\nthe time from the initial act to the point of  her employability,\r\nfurther  monetary  damages are  not  available  to  her, and  the\r\ndamages question is no longer open.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n     Courts may properly combine  the equitable remedies of front\r\n\npay  and reinstatement  in  order to  meet  Title VII's  goal  of\r\n\nproviding  full   compensation   to  the   victims   of   illegal\r\n\ndiscrimination, as long as there is no  economic or chronological\r\n\nduplication   between  the  awards.    However,  the  protections\r\n\ninherent in the adversarial system demand  that full and complete\r\n\nhearings  be   provided  on  contested  issues   affecting  these\r\n\nequitable remedies. \r\n\nVacated and remanded.  No costs to either party.\r                                                          \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n",

The district  court\r                                                 \r\n\nsubsequently   ordered  Kerr   Selgas  reinstated   by  American.\r\n\nAmerican   maintains  in   this   appeal  that   front  pay   and\r\n\nreinstatement are mutually exclusive equitable remedies, and that\r\n\nthe court therefore erred  in allowing both  to Kerr Selgas.   It\r\n\nfurther  claims  that  the   district  court  erred  in  ordering\r\n\nreinstatement  without conducting  a hearing,  without permitting\r\n\nAmerican  to conduct  additional  discovery,  and in  considering\r\n\nextra-record evidence submitted  by Kerr Selgas.   We affirm  the\r\n\ncourt's  legal judgment that both front pay and reinstatement are\r\n\npermissible, but we vacate the  district court's order and remand\r\n\nfor a  hearing on whether reinstatement is  an appropriate remedy\r\n\nhere.  \r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n     The  facts of the underlying suit are discussed in detail in\r\n\nour opinion in  Kerr I;  accordingly, we relate  here only  those\r                                \r\n\nfacts relevant to the instant appeal.\r\n\n     Mary Jane Kerr Selgas was fired by American Airlines in 1992\r\n\nafter 18 years with  the company; she brought suit  under federal\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nand Puerto Rico law, alleging sex discrimination, harassment, and\r\n\nviolation  of her local law right to  privacy.  At the conclusion\r\n\nof a  three week  trial, a  jury awarded her  over $1  million in\r\n\ndamages; under Puerto Rico law, this was doubled automatically to\r\n\nover  $2 million.   A  remittitur and  the rejection  of punitive\r\n\ndamages by this court in Kerr I resulted in a final damages award\r                                         \r\n\nof $1.2 million. \r\n\n     While Kerr Selgas had requested reinstatement in her initial\r\n\ncomplaint, and also in subsequent motions, the district court set\r\n\nthis issue aside  during the course of  the trial and  during the\r\n\npendency of the  Kerr I  appeal.   One month  after this  court's\r                                 \r\n\ndecision  in  Kerr I  on November  13,  1995, the  district court\r                              \r\n\nordered  American to  reinstate Kerr  Selgas.

Because  courts typically  consider  all\r\n\nremedies  at the  same time,  duplication most commonly  would be\r\n\navoided by denying front  pay when an immediate  reinstatement is\r\n\nordered.  \r\n\n     Although the district  court was not explicit  about what it\r\n\nwas  doing  in this  instance  (allowing American  to  argue that\r\n\nreinstatement  had been  excluded  as a  prospective remedy),  it\r\n\nappears to  have bifurcated the traditional  remedies analysis on\r\n\nthe  assumption that, since Kerr  Selgas was unable  to return to\r\n\nwork at  the time of  trial, pay  for some future  time --  i.e.,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    We  note that  the cases  American has  cited from  our\r\ncircuit merely support the  proposition that reinstatement is the\r\npreferred first remedy, and that where this is unavailable, front\r\npay may  be awarded,  rather than precluding  a remedial  package\r\nwhich contains both elements. \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nfront  pay -- was necessary to compensate Kerr Selgas, whether or\r\n\nnot reinstatement would be an appropriate additional remedy.4  It\r\n\ntherefore reserved the reinstatement issue  for later resolution,\r\n\nand  sent the  compensatory elements  (back pay,  front  pay, and\r\n\ndamages) to the jury for determination.5   By including front pay\r\n\nin its lump sum award, the jury fully compensated Kerr Selgas for\r\n\nthe discrimination she had suffered from the point of the initial\r\n\nillegal  act to  the  point  at which  she  would  once again  be\r\n\nemployable at her prior level.  The court then took up post-trial\r\n\nwhether American was required to take her back.  \r\n\n     Due to the  amorphous nature  of the  jury award  -- it  was\r\n\nsimply a lump sum  with no distinctions made between  the amounts\r\n\nallocated  to  back  pay, front  pay,  or  damages,  and with  no\r\n\nstatement as to the time  period which the front pay portion  was\r\n\nintended to cover -- it cannot be stated with any certainty which\r\n\ndates or figures  the jurors  determined were  applicable to  the\r\n\nfront pay  issue.6  In  other words,  it is not  clear when  they\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4    In  its  June  23,   1994  Order,  the  district  court\r\nexplicitly  stated  that  the  issue  of  reinstatement  remained\r\npending resolution by the court.  \r\n\n     5     We would counsel district  courts in the future  to be\r\nexplicit about  the procedures  they are following,  whether they\r\nchoose to  reserve an equitable remedy  for future determination,\r\nor conclude that it is inapplicable in a particular instance.  \r\n\n     6    Additionally, an award of front pay, constituting as it\r\ndoes, an  estimate of what a plaintiff might have earned had s/he\r\nbeen  reinstated  at  the  conclusion of  trial,  is  necessarily\r\nspeculative.

It  specifically required the\r\njury  to consider  two factors  relating to  damages for  loss of\r\nfuture earnings:  reduction of the  award by any amount that  the\r\nplaintiff  would  have expended  in  making  those earnings;  and\r\nsecondly, reduction of the award by considering the interest that\r\nthe plaintiff could earn on the amount of the award if she made a\r\nrelatively risk-free investment.  \r\n\n     9    Taken  at its  outside  possible limit,  the award  for\r\nfront pay would  seem to have extended from the  date of judgment\r\n(4/13/94) through October  1995.    Reinstatement was ordered  by\r\nthe district court on  December 13, 1995.  Accordingly,  there is\r\nno overlap between the time period covered by the front pay award\r\nand that covered by the reinstatement order.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nTitle  VII's  goal of  fully  compensating the  plaintiff.   This\r\n\nbrings  us to  American's  second point  on  appeal: whether  the\r\n\nprocess used to reach the reinstatement decision was proper.  \r\n\nB.   Admission of Evidence and Lack of Hearing on Restitution.\r\n\n     American  contends that  the trial  court erred  in ordering\r\n\nreinstatement  because it  impermissibly considered  evidence not\r\n\nadduced  at  trial,  and   because  American  was  not  permitted\r\n\nadditional discovery or a hearing on the reinstatement issue.  \r\n\n     In  considering   the  plaintiff's  post-trial   motion  for\r\n\nreinstatement, the court had before it both the evidence received\r\n\nat  trial, and  additional  evidence submitted  by the  plaintiff\r\n\npurporting to  demonstrate that some  of the  issues which  might\r\n\nhave  earlier precluded  reinstatement  (including  hostility  of\r\n\nother employees and the plaintiff's  own inability to work)  were\r\n\nno  longer bars to her  return.10  The  district court explicitly\r\n\nrelied  upon some  of  this evidence  in  its order,  citing  the\r\n\ninformation in a  newspaper article relating to the  departure of\r\n\ncertain   individuals    from   American,   and    her   treating\r\n\npsychologist's statement that  Kerr Selgas was  fit to return  to\r\n\nwork.    However,  the  court  also  noted  that  defendants  had\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10   Specifically, the plaintiff produced news  reports that\r\none of the chief offenders in her experience at American, Whadzen\r\nCarrasquillo,  had  left  the  company.    She  also  produced  a\r\nstatement by her treating psychologist, Carlos Velasquez, stating\r\nhe   believed  she  was  fit  to  return  to  work  at  American.\r\nVelasquez' affidavit,  however, speaks  only in the  most general\r\nterms: it states that on the basis of unspecified tests conducted\r\nat unspecified dates,  Kerr Selgas \"is  currently[...]functioning\r\nadequately\"  and that he therefore  believes she is  \"now able to\r\nreturn  and to carry out her duties as Account Sales Executive at\r\nAmerican Airlines.\" \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\npresented testimony at trial  that Kerr Selgas was fit  to return\r                                      \r\n\nto work in March 1994.11  \r\n\n     The adversarial system's search for truth and the assessment\r\n\nof  remedies are  predicated upon  an open  and fair  exchange of\r\n\nideas  and  information.   Lussier, 50  F.3d at  1113.   It  is a\r                                            \r\n\nfundamental principle of this  system that a fact finder  may not\r\n\nconsider extra-record evidence  concerning disputed  adjudicative\r\n\nfacts.   Id. at  1114.  While  we have suggested in  at least one\r                      \r\n\ncase  that parties  might  possibly waive  a  deprivation of  the\r\n\nevidentiary  and  procedural guarantees  embodied in  the managed\r\n\nadversarial  system  with  regard  to  extra-record evidence,  or\r\n\nconsent to a court's  consideration of it,  see id. at 1115,  the\r                                                             \r\n\nevidence  supporting such  a voluntary  and knowing  waiver would\r\n\nneed to be significant and unequivocal.\r\n\n     Such is not the  case here.  American repeatedly  stated its\r\n\nopposition to  Kerr Selgas'  reinstatement, and  more importantly\r\n\nrepeatedly requested a hearing and discovery on the reinstatement\r\n\nissue.12    Kerr Selgas  herself requested  a  jury trial  on the\r                                                             \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11   Kerr  Selgas  suggested  at   oral  argument  that  the\r\ndistrict court  could  have  reached  its  determination  without\r\nrelying  on  the new  evidence; however,  this  is belied  by the\r\nlanguage of the district court's order.\r\n\n     12   American  opposed Kerr Selgas' motion for reinstatement\r\nin  a 12-page opposition filed on December 23, 1994, citing among\r\nother reasons, the need for an evidentiary hearing and additional\r\ndiscovery  due to  the lack of  sufficient information  in either\r\nthe  evidence submitted  at trial  or the later  submissions with\r\nwhich to determine whether Kerr Selgas  was in fact fit to return\r\nto work.  In its July 27, 1995  Opposition to Plaintiff's Renewed\r\nRequest  for Reinstatement  and Related  Benefits, American  also\r\nopposed  Kerr Selgas' reinstatement.   Again, in  its December 8,\r\n1995  Opposition to  Plaintiff's  Request  for Reinstatement  and\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nreinstatement  issue  in  her  July 10,  1995  motion  requesting\r\n\nreinstatement.    Therefore,  there   is  no  indication  of  any\r\n\nintention  on either  party's  part to  waive  a hearing  on  the\r\n\nreinstatement issue.  \r\n\n     Where the  district court  based its determination  at least\r\n\npartially  on information not properly  before it in  the form of\r\n\nevidence admitted at trial,  and where the remedy to  be accorded\r\n\nthe plaintiff is as significant as reinstatement, we are hesitant\r\n\nto  applaud   anything  less  than  strict   adherence  to  those\r\n\nprocedures which  accord each party the opportunity  to be fairly\r\n\nheard  on   key  issues.     Accordingly,  while  we   hold  that\r\n\nreinstatement  may  properly  be  awarded  in  a  Title VII  case\r\n\ntogether  with front  pay  as long  as  there is  no  duplication\r\n\nbetween the two awards, in this case we  believe a hearing should\r\n\nhave   been  held   to   determine   whether  reinstatement   was\r\n\nappropriate.     Therefore,  we   vacate  the   district  court's\r\n\nreinstatement order and  remand for  proceedings consistent  with\r\n\nthis  opinion   to  determine  whether  Kerr   Selgas  should  be\r\n\nreinstated by American.13 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nRelated Benefits,  American raised its objection to reinstatement\r\nbeing ordered without an  evidentiary hearing and the opportunity\r\nfor further discovery.  \r\n\n     13   We anticipate  a limited  hearing on  the reinstatement\r\nissue.

As Kerr Selgas has been compensated for\r\nthe time from the initial act to the point of  her employability,\r\nfurther  monetary  damages are  not  available  to  her, and  the\r\ndamages question is no longer open.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n     Courts may properly combine  the equitable remedies of front\r\n\npay  and reinstatement  in  order to  meet  Title VII's  goal  of\r\n\nproviding  full   compensation   to  the   victims   of   illegal\r\n\ndiscrimination, as long as there is no  economic or chronological\r\n\nduplication   between  the  awards.
