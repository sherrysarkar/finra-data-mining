Kenneth Silva appeals from a\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\ndirected verdict  on his  claims alleging  violations of  the\r\n\nFirst  and Fourteenth Amendments.  The First Amendment claims\r\n\nare that Silva  was subjected to a  ban on parking cars  in a\r\n\ncity employee parking lot when the cars carry  political roof\r\n\nrack signs,  that the  ban was  selectively enforced  against\r\n\nhim, and that  the termination of his city  employment was in\r\n\nretaliation for his support of his wife's political candidacy\r\n\nfor city  office when  she ran against  a candidate  whom the\r\n\nmayor  supported.   The Fourteenth  Amendment  claim is  that\r\n\nSilva's liberty or  property interests under the  Due Process\r\n\nClause were violated  when he was  not given a  name-clearing\r\n\nhearing  before  his  employment was  terminated  for pushing\r\n\nanother city employee.\r\n\n          At the  close of  plaintiff's evidence,  defendants\r\n\nmoved for  a directed verdict.   The district court  took the\r\n\nmotion  under advisement  and  then,  at  the  close  of  all\r\n\nevidence, directed a verdict against the  plaintiff as to the\r\n\nroof rack ban, selective enforcement, and due process claims.\r\n\nThe  court let the retaliatory firing claim against defendant\r\n\nWorden go to  the jury, which held in favor of the defendant.\r\n\nThe retaliatory firing claim against  the City of New Bedford\r\n\nand  Mayor  were  dismissed.    Silva  appeals  the  directed\r\n\nverdict,  but  not  the  jury  finding  against  him  on  his\r\n\nretaliatory firing claim.  We  affirm.  In so doing, we  hold\r\n\n                              3\r\r\n\nthat the  roof rack ban was not a  custom or practice so well\r\n\nestablished as  to be  attributable to  the City  through its\r\n\npolicy-making  officials.    We  further  hold  that  Silva's\r\n\ntermination did  not occur under  circumstances entitling him\r\n\nto a hearing. \r\n\n                              I\r                                          I\r\n\n          Silva was hired  by the City as an  employee in the\r\n\nDepartment of  Public Works  on May  24, 1993.   Silva  was a\r\n\nprobationary employee; as such he could not obtain full civil\r\n\nservice status until six months after the date of his hiring.\r\n\nIn  June  1993,  Ramone Silva,  Silva's  wife,  announced her\r\n\nintention to run  for election as City Councilor  for Ward 4.\r\n\nMrs. Silva was one of  five candidates who sought election to\r\n\nthis vacant seat.  The leading candidate in this campaign was\r\n\nJoseph  Fortes,  a  political   ally  of  defendant  Rosemary\r\n\nTierney,  the Mayor  of  New  Bedford.    Defendant  Lawrence\r\n\nWorden,  the DPW  Commissioner,  and  Jose  Pontes,  the  DPW\r\n\nSuperintendent  and manager  of  the  city  yard,  were  also\r\n\nsupporters of Mayor Tierney.\r\n\n          Because she was a write-in candidate and not on the\r\n\nballot, Mrs.  Silva relied heavily on signs  to bring herself\r\n\nto  the attention  of voters.   Such  a write-in  campaign is\r\n\nunusual in New Bedford, so Mrs. Silva's efforts received much\r\n\npublicity.   Silva vigorously  supported his wife's candidacy\r\n\nand  worked on her  behalf.  Pictures  of Silva  and his wife\r\n\n                              4\r\r\n\nwere widely distributed in  campaign literature and published\r\n\nin area newspapers. \r\n\n          Silva worked  for  the DPW  without incident  until\r\n\nSeptember 23, 1993, when Silva went to the supply area to get\r\n\nwork  gloves and  was  ignored by  the supply  clerk, Timothy\r\n\nLobo.  Lobo, a supporter  of Mayor Tierney, knew that Silva's\r\n\nwife  was campaigning against  Fortes.  Lobo  refused to give\r\n\nany gloves  to Silva,  telling him  he  \"was not  important.\"\r\n\nWhen Silva later approached  Lobo to discuss the  incident, a\r\n\nphysical altercation  resulted  in which  Silva pushed  Lobo.\r\n\nWhile no one was injured and the incident was treated by both\r\n\nparties  as \"no  big deal,\"   Lobo  reported the  incident to\r\n\nPontes.\r\n\n          Pontes  called Silva  to his  office and  chastised\r\n\nSilva for the incident.  Pontes also told Silva to remove his\r\n\ncar from  the city yard,  where Silva  had parked.   The city\r\n\nyard is  a large area,  primarily containing the  DPW Highway\r\n\nDepartment, where DPW  employees commonly park.   Silva's car\r\n\nhad a  roof rack  advertising his wife's  candidacy for  City\r\n\nCouncilor.   Pontes told  Silva that  city policy  prohibited\r\n\nemployees from parking cars with political roof rack signs in\r\n\nthe city yard.   There was evidence that  other DPW employees\r\n\nhad  parked  their  personal  cars  in  the  city  yard  with\r\n\npolitical roof  rack  signs advocating  other candidates  for\r\n\npublic office.  Some DPW  employees also had bumper  stickers\r\n\n                              5\r\r\n\non  their cars.    But  no other  person,  except Silva,  has\r\n\nrecently  been instructed  to move  his  or her  car.   Silva\r\n\nrelocated his car and never parked in the city yard again. \r\n\n          Pontes, as  DPW Superintendent, was  second in  the\r\n\nDPW  heirachy  below   Worden.    Commissioner   Worden,  not\r\n\nSuperintendent Pontes, ran the agency.  Pontes supervised the\r\n\nday-to-day  operations of the  DPW.  While  Worden had formal\r\n\nauthority over the city yard, Pontes administered the yard on\r\n\na daily basis,  a responsibility  traditionally exercised  by\r\n\nthe DPW Supervisor.\r\n\n          On  September 24, 1993, Pontes gave Silva a written\r\n\nwarning   indicating  that   Silva  \"pushed  Tim   Lobo\"  and\r\n\nrecommending  that Silva's  probation  be  extended.    Silva\r\n\nrefused to  sign  the warning.   Pontes  sent a  copy of  the\r\n\nwarning to  the union  steward and placed  a copy  in Silva's\r\n\npersonnel file.   Although  Pontes instructed  Silva that  he\r\n\nwould be  given a  hearing before  Worden,  as was  customary\r\n\npractice  for   probationary  employees,   Silva  was   never\r\n\ncontacted by Worden for this purpose.\r\n\n          On  October 7, 1993, Silva received a letter signed\r\n\nby Worden  discharging him because of the  events giving rise\r\n\nto  the warning.    Worden  never spoke  to  Silva about  the\r\n\ndischarge  and declined  to  grant Silva  a hearing  at which\r\n\nSilva might defend  himself.  Silva was unable  to find other\r\n\n                              6\r\r\n\nwork  for two  years.    On election  day,  1993, Mrs.  Silva\r\n\ndefeated Fortes for the Ward 4 seat.  \r\n\n           In April 1994, Silva sued the City, Mayor Tierney,\r\n\nand  Worden under 42 U.S.C.   1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12\r\n\n  11H,I (the state civil rights acts), claiming that the roof\r\n\nrack   ban  violated  the   First  Amendment,  that   it  was\r\n\nselectively enforced against  him, that he was  discharged in\r\n\nretaliation for his support of his wife's candidacy, and that\r\n\nthe City's  failure to  provide him  a name-clearing  hearing\r\n\nprior to his  discharge violated his liberty  interests under\r\n\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \r\n\n          At trial, Commissioner Worden testified that Pontes\r\n\nhad informed him  there was a longstanding  city \"policy\" set\r\n\nby the  DPW Superintendents  prohibiting political  roof rack\r\n\nsigns  in the city yard,  although Worden also testified that\r\n\nhe had  no knowledge of  any such practice until  after Silva\r\n\nhad filed suit  against the City.  Pontes  testified that the\r\n\npolicy had been first  instituted by a DPW  Superintendent in\r\n\nthe  1970's  and  was  continued  by  later  Superintendents,\r\n\nincluding Pontes.   Pontes and Lobo both  testified that they\r\n\nremembered past incidents of people being asked to move their\r\n\ncars on account of political roof racks. \r\n\n          At  the close of Silva's case, defendants moved for\r\n\na directed verdict.  The  court reserved ruling on the motion\r\n\nand instructed  the defendants  to proceed  with their  case,\r\n\n                              7\r\r\n\n\"understanding that I'll  be judging the evidence as  of this\r\n\npoint, without considering  the evidence that you  introduce,\r\n\nrather  than keep  the jury waiting.\"   After  the defendants\r\n\ncompleted  presenting  their  evidence,  they  renewed  their\r\n\nmotion for  directed verdict, which  the court granted.   The\r\n\ncourt let the retaliatory firing  claim go to the jury, which\r\n\nfound in favor of Worden, the sole remaining defendant.\r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n          In  reviewing a directed verdict under Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP. 50(a), \"we take the  evidence most favorable to the losing\r\n\nparty  and  ask  de  novo   whether  a  reasonable  jury  had\r\n\ninevitably to  decide in  favor of the  victor.\"   Abraham v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nNagle, 116 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r                 \r\n\n          We consider  all  evidence  offered  during  trial,\r\n\nincluding evidence introduced  by the defendants.  We do this\r\n\nnotwithstanding the  defendants' motion for  directed verdict\r\n\nat the end of Silva's case and the court's  statement that it\r\n\nwould rule,  although at the  close of all evidence,  only on\r\n\nthe plaintiff's  evidence.   The court's  reservation on  the\r\n\ninitial motion  at the end of Silva's  case acted as a denial\r\n\nof the motion, upon which the  City had the choice of  either\r\n\nstanding on its motion or  proceeding with its evidence.  The\r\n\ndefendants chose  to proceed  with their  evidence, and  this\r\n\ncourt  must now  view all  of  the evidence  presented.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nGillentine v.

Moreover, the court held that directed\r\n\nverdict was proper  based both on Silva's  evidence alone and\r\n\non   all  evidence   presented  during  the   trial,  thereby\r\n\neffectively making two separate rulings.\r\n\n          In  reviewing  a  directed verdict,  the  appellate\r\n\ncourt \"may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve\r\n\nconflicts  in  testimony,  or  evaluate  the  weight  of  the\r\n\nevidence.\"  Wagenmann  v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196,  200 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1987).   \"Nevertheless, the  evidence to which  the nonmovant\r\n\npoints must comprise more than fragmentary tendrils:  a  mere\r\n\nscintilla of evidence  is not enough to  forestall a directed\r\n\nverdict,  especially on  a claim  or  issue as  to which  the\r\n\nburden of  proof belongs  to the  objecting party.\"   Fashion\r                                                                         \r\n\nHouse, Inc.  v.

A jury heard and\r\n\nrejected the retaliatory firing claim.   At issue here is the\r\n\npotential liability of the City  on the other First Amendment\r\n\nclaims and the due process claim.  With this in mind, we face\r\n\nthe central questions in this appeal: (1) whether Pontes is a\r\n\n\"policymaker\" under Monell v. Department  of Social Services,\r                                                                        \r\n\n436 U.S. 658 (1978) and its progeny, (2) whether the City had\r\n\na \"policy\" or \"custom\" of banning political  roof rack signs,\r\n\n                              9\r\r\n\nand  (3) whether  Silva was  deprived  of a  liberty interest\r\n\nunder the Due  Process clause of the  Fourteenth Amendment by\r\n\nthe method  of his termination.   We answer each  question in\r\n\nthe negative.\r\n\nA.  Municipal Liability\r                                   \r\n\n          In   Monell,  the   Supreme  Court   held   that  a\r                                 \r\n\nmunicipality may not be held vicariously liable  under   1983\r\n\nfor  the torts  of an  employee solely  on the  basis of  its\r\n\nemployer-employee relationship with  the tortfeasor.  Id.  at\r                                                                     \r\n\n691.  Instead,  a plaintiff seeking to impose  liability on a\r\n\nmunicipality  under   1983 must identify a municipal \"policy\"\r\n\nor a \"custom\" that caused  the plaintiff's injury.  See Board\r                                                                         \r\n\nof County Comm'rs   of Bryan County v.

The disputed  \"policy\" or\r                          \r\n\n\"custom\" must also  be the cause and moving  force behind the\r\n\ndeprivation  of  constitutional  rights.

In  such  cases,  \"[m]unicipal\r                                       \r\n\nliability  attaches only  where  the decisionmaker  possesses\r\n\nfinal authority to establish municipal policy with respect to\r                           \r\n\nthe  action ordered.\"   Pembauer, 475  U.S. at  481 (emphasis\r                                            \r\n\nadded). \r\n\n          Liability  may also be premised on a \"custom\" which\r\n\ncaused plaintiff's  injury.   In  particular, a  municipality\r\n\nmight be held liable when the plaintiff is injured by \"an act\r\n\nperformed pursuant  to a 'custom' that has  not been formally\r\n\napproved by  an appropriate decisionmaker [when] the relevant\r\n\npractice  is so  widespread as  to  have the  force of  law.\"\r\n\nBryan  County Comm'rs,  117 S.Ct.  at  1388.   As this  court\r                                 \r\n\nexplained  in Bordanaro v.  McLeod, 871  F.2d 1151  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1989), one  method of showing  custom is to  demonstrate that\r\n\nthe custom or practice is so \"wellsettled and widespread that\r\n\nthe policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to\r\n\nhave either  actual or constructive  knowledge of it  yet did\r\n\nnothing to end the practice.\"  Id. at 1156.\r                                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nact affirmatively at all,  so long as the need to control the\r\nagents of government is so obvious, and the inadequacy of the\r\nexisting  practice  so  likely  to  result  in  violation  of\r\nexisting  right,  that the  policymaker  can  be  said to  be\r\n\"deliberatively  indifferent\".    Bryan  County Comm'rs,  117\r                                                                   \r\nS.Ct. at 1395.   None of this trilogy can be  said to be true\r\nhere.\r\n\n                              11\r\r\n\n          The  evidence  presented  in  this  case  does  not\r\n\ndemonstrate  the existence  of either  a policy  or a  custom\r\n\nunder   1983.   First, Pontes, the individual  who told Silva\r\n\nhe could not park in the city yard, is clearly not the \"final\r\n\nauthority\" in  the city yard.   The City Code of  New Bedford\r\n\nspecifically  provides  that  \"[t]he  commissioner of  public\r\n\nworks under the  direction of the mayor and  the city council\r\n\nshall . . . [h]ave the charge of the city yard . .  . .\"  New\r\n\nBedford  City  Code     19-143;  see   also  Jett  v.  Dallas\r                                                                         \r\n\nIndependent School  Dist., 491  U.S. 701,  737 (\"[W]hether  a\r                                     \r\n\nparticular official  has 'final policymaking  authority' is a\r\n\nquestion of state law.\" (quoting St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 112,  123 (1988))).   Thus Worden, as  DPW Commissioner,\r\n\nwas Pontes's superior in matters concerning the city yard and\r\n\nultimately  responsible for the manner  in which the yard was\r\n\nrun.  That Worden acknowledged  at trial that Pontes was \"the\r\n\nhead  guy\" at  the  yard is  insufficient,  without more,  to\r\n\ndemonstrate  that   Worden  delegated   final  decisionmaking\r\n\nauthority regarding the  yard to Pontes.  This  is especially\r\n\ntrue in light of Worden's assertions at trial that Pontes, as\r\n\nDPW Superintendent,  was \"directly beneath my  position,\" and\r\n\nthat \"I am the department head.\"\r\n\n          We agree with the district  court's assessment that\r\n\nPontes's discretion to run the yard does not constitute final\r\n\ndecisionmaking authority which  might trigger liability under\r\n\n                              12\r\r\n\n  1983 as  interpreted by Bryan County Comm'rs  and Pembauer.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPontes's testimony that an unidentified DPW Superintendent in\r\n\nthe  1970's first came  up with  the roof  rack ban  does not\r\n\nsuffice.   Such  a decision  was  not made  by New  Bedford's\r\n\nlegislative body; nor are superintendents, who are second-in-\r\n\ncommand figures, the final authority to establish DPW policy.\r\n\n          Second, Silva has not met  the burden of showing  a\r\n\n\"custom\"  under Bordanaro.   The  roof  rack ban  was not  so\r                                     \r\n\n\"wellsettled and widespread\" as to  have force of law, nor is\r\n\nthere  sufficient  evidence   that  the  City's  policymaking\r\n\nofficials could  be said to  have had actual  or constructive\r\n\nknowledge of the practice.   See Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156-\r                                                      \r\n\n57.  At  the close  of evidence, witnesses  such as Lobo  and\r\n\nPontes  could only  remember  a few  instances over  the last\r\n\ntwenty years  when any  roof rack  policy had been  enforced.\r\n\nMore significantly, Commissioner Worden testified that he did\r\n\nnot  even know  of  the existence  of a  roof rack  ban until\r\n\nseveral months after  Silva had been  fired and, indeed,  not\r\n\nuntil after Silva had filed suit against the City.  Moreover,\r\n\nthere is no evidence that Mayor Tierney or other high ranking\r\n\ncity officials, or prior policymakers, were even aware of the\r\n\npractice, much  less that they did nothing to  end it.  We do\r\n\nnot suggest that, and need not reach the issue of whether,  a\r\n\nflat ban  on political  roof racks on  cars in  city employee\r\n\nparking lots is  unconstitutional.  Even if  Silva's \"custom\"\r\n\n                              13\r\r\n\nclaim   is  recast  as   involving  a  custom   of  selective\r\n\nenforcement of such a ban depending on which candidate's sign\r\n\nis displayed,  a far  more potent  constitutional claim,  the\r\n\nclaim still  fails for  want of evidence  that it  involves a\r\n\ncustom.   \r\n\n          Under  Bordanaro,   in  order  to  show  that  City\r                                      \r\n\nofficials  had constructive  knowledge of  the practice,  the\r\n\nplaintiff   must  show  that  \"the  practices  have  been  so\r\n\nwidespread or flagrant that  in the proper exercise  of their\r\n\nofficial responsibilities  the municipal  policymakers should\r\n\nhave known of them.\"  Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1157 (citations,\r                                           \r\n\ninternal quotation  marks,  and  alterations  omitted).    In\r\n\nBordanaro, the plaintiff  had presented considerable evidence\r                     \r\n\ndemonstrating a  comprehensive failure by the  defendant City\r\n\nof Everett  to train  and monitor the  actions of  its police\r\n\nofficers,  and the court found that the evidence demonstrated\r\n\nthe  existence  of   a  widespread  practice  of   which  the\r\n\ndefendant's policymaking  officials should  have been  aware.\r\n\nSee Id. at  1159-61.  In contrast, the evidence  in this case\r                   \r\n\nat best suggests a practice,  sporadic at most, of which only\r\n\nsome  lower-level  managerial  employees were  aware.    This\r\n\nevidence is insufficient to show that the City's policymaking\r\n\nofficials had constructive notice of the practice.\r\n\nB.  Due process considerations\r                                          \r\n\n                              14\r\r\n\n          Silva  claims he was deprived of a liberty interest\r\n\nunder the Due  Process clause of the  Fourteenth Amendment by\r\n\nthe termination  of his  employment in  that the  termination\r\n\nstigmatized  him  and  damaged his  ability  to  obtain other\r\n\nemployment.  Silva further argues that the City  violated his\r\n\nright to  due process by  refusing to grant him  a hearing at\r\n\nwhich he might clear his name.\r\n\n          The  Supreme Court has held that termination of at-\r\n\nwill employment, even  when accompanied  by statements  which\r\n\nmight be  characterized  as defamatory,  is  insufficient  by\r\n\nitself to  implicate a constitutionally  protected liberty or\r\n\nproperty interest.  See Bishop  v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 348-49\r                                                   \r\n\nn. 13 (1976);  Board of  Regents v.

Despite the \"drastic effect of the 'stigma' which may\r\n\nresult  from defamation  by the  government in  a  variety of\r\n\ncontexts,  .  .  .  reputation alone,  apart  from  some more\r\n\ntangible interests such as employment, is [n]either 'liberty'\r\n\n[n]or  'property'   by  itself  sufficient   to  invoke   the\r\n\nprocedural  protection of the  Due Process Clause.\"   Paul v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nDavis, 424  U.S. 693, 701  (1976).

See Id. at 710-12.\r                         \r\n\n          We interpreted  these requirements  in Beitzell  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nJeffrey, 643  F.2d  870 (1st  Cir. 1981),  stating that  \"the\r                   \r\n\n                              15\r\r\n\nFourteenth  Amendment procedurally  protects reputation  only\r\n\nwhere  (1) government action threatens it, (2) with unusually\r\n\nserious harm, (3)  as evidenced by  the fact that  employment\r\n\n(or some  other right or  status) is affected.\"   Id. at  878\r                                                                 \r\n\n(footnote and citations omitted).  Moreover, the municipality\r\n\nterminating the  employee must  also be  responsible for  the\r\n\ndissemination of defamatory charges, in a formal setting (and\r\n\nnot  merely as  the  result  of  unauthorized  \"leaks\"),  and\r\n\nthereby  significantly  have interfered  with  the employee's\r\n\nability to find future employment.

Commissioner  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nMental Retardation,  28 Mass.

But the right\r                                  \r\n\nto  a  hearing  still  only   attaches  when  the  damage  to\r\n\nplaintiff's character  is very serious.

Even assuming\r\n\nthe state standard  is different, there was  no dissemination\r\n\nto  the public or to  prospective employees.  The termination\r\n\nletter  that  passed through  the  City  personnel department\r\n\nremarked only  on  Silva's \"unsatisfactory  conduct  and  job\r\n\nperformance\".   The employee warning written by Pontes stated\r\n\nonly  that  Silva \"pushed  Tim  Lobo\"  and  was not  publicly\r\n\ndisseminated.   Silva's union representative was aware of the\r\n\nincident only  because Silva  requested the  representative's\r\n\npresence  when  Pontes  issued  his  warning.    That  Worden\r\n\ninterviewed  a witness  to the  incident  is insufficient  to\r\n\nconstitute dissemination.

Nor do we  find evidence that Silva's  subsequent\r\n\ndifficulty in  obtaining employment resulted from  the City's\r\n\ndischarge  of  Silva  for  unsatisfactory   conduct  and  job\r\n\nperformance.\r\n\n          Affirmed.

The First Amendment claims are that Silva was subjected to a ban on parking cars in a city employee parking lot when the cars carry political roof rack signs, that the ban was selectively enforced against him, and that the termination of his city employment was in retaliation for his support of his wife's political candidacy for city office when she ran against a candidate whom the mayor supported.  The Fourteenth Amendment claim is that Silva's liberty or property interests under the Due Process Clause were violated when he was not given a name-clearing hearing before his employment was terminated for pushing another city employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of plaintiff's evidence, defendants moved for a directed verdict.  The district court took the motion under advisement and then, at the close of all evidence, directed a verdict against the plaintiff as to the roof rack ban, selective enforcement, and due process claims.  The court let the retaliatory firing claim against defendant Worden go to the jury, which held in favor of the defendant.  The retaliatory firing claim against the City of New Bedford and Mayor were dismissed.  Silva appeals the directed verdict, but not the jury finding against him on his retaliatory firing claim.  We affirm.  In so doing, we hold that the roof rack ban was not a custom or practice so well established as to be attributable to the City through its policy-making officials.  We further hold that Silva's termination did not occur under circumstances entitling him to a hearing.I</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silva was hired by the City as an employee in the Department of Public Works on May 24, 1993.  Silva was a probationary employee;  as such he could not obtain full civil service status until six months after the date of his hiring.  In June 1993, Ramone Silva, Silva's wife, announced her intention to run for election as City Councilor for Ward 4. Mrs. Silva was one of five candidates who sought election to this vacant seat.  The leading candidate in this campaign was Joseph Fortes, a political ally of defendant Rosemary Tierney, the Mayor of New Bedford.  Defendant Lawrence Worden, the DPW Commissioner, and Jose Pontes, the DPW Superintendent and manager of the city yard, were also supporters of Mayor Tierney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because she was a write-in candidate and not on the ballot, Mrs. Silva relied heavily on signs to bring herself to the attention of voters.  Such a write-in campaign is unusual in New Bedford, so Mrs. Silva's efforts received much publicity.  Silva vigorously supported his wife's candidacy and worked on her behalf.  Pictures of Silva and his wife were widely distributed in campaign literature and published in area newspapers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silva worked for the DPW without incident until September 23, 1993, when Silva went to the supply area to get work gloves and was ignored by the supply clerk, Timothy Lobo.  Lobo, a supporter of Mayor Tierney, knew that Silva's wife was campaigning against Fortes.  Lobo refused to give any gloves to Silva, telling him he \"was not important.\"   When Silva later approached Lobo to discuss the incident, a physical altercation resulted in which Silva pushed Lobo.  While no one was injured and the incident was treated by both parties as \"no big deal,\" Lobo reported the incident to Pontes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pontes called Silva to his office and chastised Silva for the incident.  Pontes also told Silva to remove his car from the city yard, where Silva had parked.  The city yard is a large area, primarily containing the DPW Highway Department, where DPW employees commonly park.  Silva's car had a roof rack advertising his wife's candidacy for City Councilor.  Pontes told Silva that city policy prohibited employees from parking cars with political roof rack signs in the city yard.  There was evidence that other DPW employees had parked their personal cars in the city yard with political roof rack signs advocating other candidates for public office.  Some DPW employees also had bumper stickers on their cars.  But no other person, except Silva, has recently been instructed to move his or her car.  Silva relocated his car and never parked in the city yard again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pontes, as DPW Superintendent, was second in the DPW heirachy below Worden.  Commissioner Worden, not Superintendent Pontes, ran the agency.  Pontes supervised the day-to-day operations of the DPW. While Worden had formal authority over the city yard, Pontes administered the yard on a daily basis, a responsibility traditionally exercised by the DPW Supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1993, Pontes gave Silva a written warning indicating that Silva \"pushed Tim Lobo\" and recommending that Silva's probation be extended.  Silva refused to sign the warning.  Pontes sent a copy of the warning to the union steward and placed a copy in Silva's personnel file.  Although Pontes instructed Silva that he would be given a hearing before Worden, as was customary practice for probationary employees, Silva was never contacted by Worden for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 7, 1993, Silva received a letter signed by Worden discharging him because of the events giving rise to the warning.  Worden never spoke to Silva about the discharge and declined to grant Silva a hearing at which Silva might defend himself.  Silva was unable to find other work for two years.  On election day, 1993, Mrs. Silva defeated Fortes for the Ward 4 seat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1994, Silva sued the City, Mayor Tierney, and Worden under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12 &#167; 11H, I (the state civil rights acts), claiming that the roof rack ban violated the First Amendment, that it was selectively enforced against him, that he was discharged in retaliation for his support of his wife's candidacy, and that the City's failure to provide him a name-clearing hearing prior to his discharge violated his liberty interests under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Commissioner Worden testified that Pontes had informed him there was a longstanding city \"policy\" set by the DPW Superintendents prohibiting political roof rack signs in the city yard, although Worden also testified that he had no knowledge of any such practice until after Silva had filed suit against the City.  Pontes testified that the policy had been first instituted by a DPW Superintendent in the 1970's and was continued by later Superintendents, including Pontes.  Pontes and Lobo both testified that they remembered past incidents of people being asked to move their cars on account of political roof racks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of Silva's case, defendants moved for a directed verdict.  The court reserved ruling on the motion and instructed the defendants to proceed with their case, \"understanding that I'll be judging the evidence as of this point, without considering the evidence that you introduce, rather than keep the jury waiting.\"   After the defendants completed presenting their evidence, they renewed their motion for directed verdict, which the court granted.  The court let the retaliatory firing claim go to the jury, which found in favor of Worden, the sole remaining defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a directed verdict under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a), \"we take the evidence most favorable to the losing party and ask de novo whether a reasonable jury had inevitably to decide in favor of the victor.\"  Abraham v. Nagle, 116 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider all evidence offered during trial, including evidence introduced by the defendants.  We do this notwithstanding the defendants' motion for directed verdict at the end of Silva's case and the court's statement that it would rule, although at the close of all evidence, only on the plaintiff's evidence.  The court's reservation on the initial motion at the end of Silva's case acted as a denial of the motion, upon which the City had the choice of either standing on its motion or proceeding with its evidence.  The defendants chose to proceed with their evidence, and this court must now view all of the evidence presented.  See Gillentine v. McKeand, 426 F.2d 717, 722-23 (1st Cir.1970);  A &amp; N. Club v. Great American Ins. Co., 404 F.2d 100, 103-104 (6th Cir.1968) (citing O'Malley v. Cover, 221 F.2d 156, 158-59 (8th Cir.1955)).  Moreover, the court held that directed verdict was proper based both on Silva's evidence alone and on all evidence presented during the trial, thereby effectively making two separate rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a directed verdict, the appellate court \"may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987).  \"Nevertheless, the evidence to which the nonmovant points must comprise more than fragmentary tendrils:  a mere scintilla of evidence is not enough to forestall a directed verdict, especially on a claim or issue as to which the burden of proof belongs to the objecting party.\"  Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1088 (1st Cir.1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repeat the procedural context.  A jury heard and rejected the retaliatory firing claim.  At issue here is the potential liability of the City on the other First Amendment claims and the due process claim.  With this in mind, we face the central questions in this appeal:  (1) whether Pontes is a \"policymaker\" under Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) and its progeny, (2) whether the City had a \"policy\" or \"custom\" of banning political roof rack signs, and (3) whether Silva was deprived of a liberty interest under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by the method of his termination.  We answer each question in the negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Municipal Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Monell, the Supreme Court held that a municipality may not be held vicariously liable under &#167; 1983 for the torts of an employee solely on the basis of its employer-employee relationship with the tortfeasor.  Id. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036.   Instead, a plaintiff seeking to impose liability on a municipality under &#167; 1983 must identify a municipal \"policy\" or a \"custom\" that caused the plaintiff's injury.  See Board of County Comm'rs of Bryan County v. Brown, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 1388, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997);  Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 479-81, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 1298-99, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986);  Monell, 436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037-38.   The disputed \"policy\" or \"custom\" must also be the cause and moving force behind the deprivation of constitutional rights.  See Bryan County Comm'rs, --- U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1388.   Because neither policy nor custom is shown here, we do not reach the causation issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A municipality may be held liable for acts taken pursuant to a \"policy\" by at least two methods:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  when the deprivation resulted (1) \"from the decisions of its duly constituted legislative body\", or (2) from the decisions \"of those officials whose acts may fairly be said to be those of the municipality.\"  Id. In such cases, \"[m]unicipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered.\"  Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 481, 106 S.Ct. at 1299 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liability may also be premised on a \"custom\" which caused plaintiff's injury.  In particular, a municipality might be held liable when the plaintiff is injured by \"an act performed pursuant to a 'custom' that has not been formally approved by an appropriate decisionmaker [when] the relevant practice is so widespread as to have the force of law.\"  Bryan County Comm'rs, --- U.S. at ----, 117 S.Ct. at 1388.   As this court explained in Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151 (1st Cir.1989), one method of showing custom is to demonstrate that the custom or practice is so \"wellsettled and widespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.\"  Id. at 1156.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented in this case does not demonstrate the existence of either a policy or a custom under &#167; 1983.  First, Pontes, the individual who told Silva he could not park in the city yard, is clearly not the \"final authority\" in the city yard.  The City Code of New Bedford specifically provides that \"[t]he commissioner of public works under the direction of the mayor and the city council shall ... [h]ave the charge of the city yard....\"  New Bedford City Code &#167; 19-143;  see also Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 737, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 2723-24, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (\"[W]hether a particular official has 'final policymaking authority' is a question of state law.\"  (quoting St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 123, 108 S.Ct. 915, 924, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988))).  Thus Worden, as DPW Commissioner, was Pontes's superior in matters concerning the city yard and ultimately responsible for the manner in which the yard was run.  That Worden acknowledged at trial that Pontes was \"the head guy\" at the yard is insufficient, without more, to demonstrate that Worden delegated final decisionmaking authority regarding the yard to Pontes.  This is especially true in light of Worden's assertions at trial that Pontes, as DPW Superintendent, was \"directly beneath my position,\" and that \"I am the department head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's assessment that Pontes's discretion to run the yard does not constitute final decisionmaking authority which might trigger liability under &#167; 1983 as interpreted by Bryan County Comm'rs and Pembaur.   Pontes's testimony that an unidentified DPW Superintendent in the 1970's first came up with the roof rack ban does not suffice.  Such a decision was not made by New Bedford's legislative body;  nor are superintendents, who are second-in-command figures, the final authority to establish DPW policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Silva has not met the burden of showing a \"custom\" under Bordanaro.   The roof rack ban was not so \"wellsettled and widespread\" as to have force of law, nor is there sufficient evidence that the City's policymaking officials could be said to have had actual or constructive knowledge of the practice.  See Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156-57.   At the close of evidence, witnesses such as Lobo and Pontes could only remember a few instances over the last twenty years when any roof rack policy had been enforced.  More significantly, Commissioner Worden testified that he did not even know of the existence of a roof rack ban until several months after Silva had been fired and, indeed, not until after Silva had filed suit against the City.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Mayor Tierney or other high ranking city officials, or prior policymakers, were even aware of the practice, much less that they did nothing to end it.  We do not suggest that, and need not reach the issue of whether, a flat ban on political roof racks on cars in city employee parking lots is unconstitutional.  Even if Silva's \"custom\" claim is recast as involving a custom of selective enforcement of such a ban depending on which candidate's sign is displayed, a far more potent constitutional claim, the claim still fails for want of evidence that it involves a custom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Bordanaro, in order to show that City officials had constructive knowledge of the practice, the plaintiff must show that \"the practices have been so widespread or flagrant that in the proper exercise of their official responsibilities the municipal policymakers should have known of them.\"  Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1157 (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted).  In Bordanaro, the plaintiff had presented considerable evidence demonstrating a comprehensive failure by the defendant City of Everett to train and monitor the actions of its police officers, and the court found that the evidence demonstrated the existence of a widespread practice of which the defendant's policymaking officials should have been aware.  See Id. at 1159-61.   In contrast, the evidence in this case at best suggests a practice, sporadic at most, of which only some lower-level managerial employees were aware.  This evidence is insufficient to show that the City's policymaking officials had constructive notice of the practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Due process considerations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silva claims he was deprived of a liberty interest under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by the termination of his employment in that the termination stigmatized him and damaged his ability to obtain other employment.  Silva further argues that the City violated his right to due process by refusing to grant him a hearing at which he might clear his name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that termination of at-will employment, even when accompanied by statements which might be characterized as defamatory, is insufficient by itself to implicate a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.  See Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 348-49 n. 13, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2079-80 n. 13, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976);  Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 572, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2706-07, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).  Despite the \"drastic effect of the 'stigma' which may result from defamation by the government in a variety of contexts, ... reputation alone, apart from some more tangible interests such as employment, is [n]either 'liberty' [n]or 'property' by itself sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause.\"  Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1161, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).  Rather, the reputational injury must be accompanied by a change in the injured person's status or rights under substantive state or federal law.  See Id. at 710-12, 96 S.Ct. at 1164-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We interpreted these requirements in Beitzell v. Jeffrey, 643 F.2d 870 (1st Cir.1981), stating that \"the Fourteenth Amendment procedurally protects reputation only where (1) government action threatens it, (2) with unusually serious harm, (3) as evidenced by the fact that employment (or some other right or status) is affected.\"  Id. at 878 (footnote and citations omitted).  Moreover, the municipality terminating the employee must also be responsible for the dissemination of defamatory charges, in a formal setting (and not merely as the result of unauthorized \"leaks\"), and thereby significantly have interfered with the employee's ability to find future employment.  Id. at 879.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law, under the State Constitution, may have a slightly broader conception of the liberty interests protected by due process in this sort of case.  Such liberty interests have been found in the absence of formal charges where the allegedly defamatory statements are \"likely to be disseminated either to members of the public or to prospective employers.\"   See Smith v. Commissioner of Mental Retardation, 28 Mass.App.Ct. 628, 636-37, 554 N.E.2d 1215 (1990), rev'd on other grounds, 409 Mass. 545, 567 N.E.2d 924 (1991).  But the right to a hearing still only attaches when the damage to plaintiff's character is very serious.  As the court stated in Smith,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>The type of damage to reputation and character ... must be beyond whatever obloquy stems from the loss of a job, demotion, adverse evaluations (e.g., inefficiency and incompetence), of judgments of job performance.  Similarly, demotions or transfers with overtones of disciplinary action and consequent adverse effect on reputation do not, without more, give rise to a liberty interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 635, 554 N.E.2d 1215 (citations omitted);  see also, Stetson v. Board of Selectmen, 369 Mass. 755, 761, 343 N.E.2d 382 (1976) (To \"constitute a deprivation of liberty based on serious damage to one's standing in the community, more must be shown than mere allegations of incompetence or inefficiency at a particular job.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence does not meet these requirements.  There is no evidence that the basis for Silva's termination, that Silva \"pushed Tim Lobo\", was ever disseminated in a formal setting, as required under federal law.  Even assuming the state standard is different, there was no dissemination to the public or to prospective employers.  The termination letter that passed through the City personnel department remarked only on Silva's \"unsatisfactory conduct and job performance\".  The employee warning written by Pontes stated only that Silva \"pushed Tim Lobo\" and was not publicly disseminated.  Silva's union representative was aware of the incident only because Silva requested the representative's presence when Pontes issued his warning.  That Worden interviewed a witness to the incident is insufficient to constitute dissemination.  Finally, that the incident was discussed by other employees in the city yard is not evidence that the incident was published by Worden or any other city official or was the basis for a formal charge requiring due process protections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no evidence supporting the claim that Silva's termination was accompanied by defamatory formal charges or statements that were disseminated by city officials.  Nor do we find evidence that Silva's subsequent difficulty in obtaining employment resulted from the City's discharge of Silva for unsatisfactory conduct and job performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

The First Amendment claims are that Silva was subjected to a ban on parking cars in a city employee parking lot when the cars carry political roof rack signs, that the ban was selectively enforced against him, and that the termination of his city employment was in retaliation for his support of his wife's political candidacy for city office when she ran against a candidate whom the mayor supported.  The Fourteenth Amendment claim is that Silva's liberty or property interests under the Due Process Clause were violated when he was not given a name-clearing hearing before his employment was terminated for pushing another city employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of plaintiff's evidence, defendants moved for a directed verdict.  The district court took the motion under advisement and then, at the close of all evidence, directed a verdict against the plaintiff as to the roof rack ban, selective enforcement, and due process claims.  The court let the retaliatory firing claim against defendant Worden go to the jury, which held in favor of the defendant.  The retaliatory firing claim against the City of New Bedford and Mayor were dismissed.  Silva appeals the directed verdict, but not the jury finding against him on his retaliatory firing claim.  We affirm.  In so doing, we hold that the roof rack ban was not a custom or practice so well established as to be attributable to the City through its policy-making officials.  We further hold that Silva's termination did not occur under circumstances entitling him to a hearing.I</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silva was hired by the City as an employee in the Department of Public Works on May 24, 1993.  Silva was a probationary employee;  as such he could not obtain full civil service status until six months after the date of his hiring.  In June 1993, Ramone Silva, Silva's wife, announced her intention to run for election as City Councilor for Ward 4. Mrs. Silva was one of five candidates who sought election to this vacant seat.  The leading candidate in this campaign was Joseph Fortes, a political ally of defendant Rosemary Tierney, the Mayor of New Bedford.  Defendant Lawrence Worden, the DPW Commissioner, and Jose Pontes, the DPW Superintendent and manager of the city yard, were also supporters of Mayor Tierney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because she was a write-in candidate and not on the ballot, Mrs. Silva relied heavily on signs to bring herself to the attention of voters.  Such a write-in campaign is unusual in New Bedford, so Mrs. Silva's efforts received much publicity.  Silva vigorously supported his wife's candidacy and worked on her behalf.  Pictures of Silva and his wife were widely distributed in campaign literature and published in area newspapers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silva worked for the DPW without incident until September 23, 1993, when Silva went to the supply area to get work gloves and was ignored by the supply clerk, Timothy Lobo.  Lobo, a supporter of Mayor Tierney, knew that Silva's wife was campaigning against Fortes.  Lobo refused to give any gloves to Silva, telling him he \"was not important.\"   When Silva later approached Lobo to discuss the incident, a physical altercation resulted in which Silva pushed Lobo.

Pontes also told Silva to remove his car from the city yard, where Silva had parked.  The city yard is a large area, primarily containing the DPW Highway Department, where DPW employees commonly park.  Silva's car had a roof rack advertising his wife's candidacy for City Councilor.  Pontes told Silva that city policy prohibited employees from parking cars with political roof rack signs in the city yard.  There was evidence that other DPW employees had parked their personal cars in the city yard with political roof rack signs advocating other candidates for public office.  Some DPW employees also had bumper stickers on their cars.  But no other person, except Silva, has recently been instructed to move his or her car.  Silva relocated his car and never parked in the city yard again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pontes, as DPW Superintendent, was second in the DPW heirachy below Worden.

Silva refused to sign the warning.  Pontes sent a copy of the warning to the union steward and placed a copy in Silva's personnel file.  Although Pontes instructed Silva that he would be given a hearing before Worden, as was customary practice for probationary employees, Silva was never contacted by Worden for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 7, 1993, Silva received a letter signed by Worden discharging him because of the events giving rise to the warning.

Pontes testified that the policy had been first instituted by a DPW Superintendent in the 1970's and was continued by later Superintendents, including Pontes.

First, Pontes, the individual who told Silva he could not park in the city yard, is clearly not the \"final authority\" in the city yard.

Thus Worden, as DPW Commissioner, was Pontes's superior in matters concerning the city yard and ultimately responsible for the manner in which the yard was run.  That Worden acknowledged at trial that Pontes was \"the head guy\" at the yard is insufficient, without more, to demonstrate that Worden delegated final decisionmaking authority regarding the yard to Pontes.  This is especially true in light of Worden's assertions at trial that Pontes, as DPW Superintendent, was \"directly beneath my position,\" and that \"I am the department head.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's assessment that Pontes's discretion to run the yard does not constitute final decisionmaking authority which might trigger liability under &#167; 1983 as interpreted by Bryan County Comm'rs and Pembaur.   Pontes's testimony that an unidentified DPW Superintendent in the 1970's first came up with the roof rack ban does not suffice.  Such a decision was not made by New Bedford's legislative body;  nor are superintendents, who are second-in-command figures, the final authority to establish DPW policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Silva has not met the burden of showing a \"custom\" under Bordanaro.   The roof rack ban was not so \"wellsettled and widespread\" as to have force of law, nor is there sufficient evidence that the City's policymaking officials could be said to have had actual or constructive knowledge of the practice.  See Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156-57.   At the close of evidence, witnesses such as Lobo and Pontes could only remember a few instances over the last twenty years when any roof rack policy had been enforced.  More significantly, Commissioner Worden testified that he did not even know of the existence of a roof rack ban until several months after Silva had been fired and, indeed, not until after Silva had filed suit against the City.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Mayor Tierney or other high ranking city officials, or prior policymakers, were even aware of the practice, much less that they did nothing to end it.  We do not suggest that, and need not reach the issue of whether, a flat ban on political roof racks on cars in city employee parking lots is unconstitutional.  Even if Silva's \"custom\" claim is recast as involving a custom of selective enforcement of such a ban depending on which candidate's sign is displayed, a far more potent constitutional claim, the claim still fails for want of evidence that it involves a custom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Bordanaro, in order to show that City officials had constructive knowledge of the practice, the plaintiff must show that \"the practices have been so widespread or flagrant that in the proper exercise of their official responsibilities the municipal policymakers should have known of them.\"  Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1157 (citations, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted).  In Bordanaro, the plaintiff had presented considerable evidence demonstrating a comprehensive failure by the defendant City of Everett to train and monitor the actions of its police officers, and the court found that the evidence demonstrated the existence of a widespread practice of which the defendant's policymaking officials should have been aware.  See Id. at 1159-61.   In contrast, the evidence in this case at best suggests a practice, sporadic at most, of which only some lower-level managerial employees were aware.  This evidence is insufficient to show that the City's policymaking officials had constructive notice of the practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Due process considerations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silva claims he was deprived of a liberty interest under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by the termination of his employment in that the termination stigmatized him and damaged his ability to obtain other employment.  Silva further argues that the City violated his right to due process by refusing to grant him a hearing at which he might clear his name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that termination of at-will employment, even when accompanied by statements which might be characterized as defamatory, is insufficient by itself to implicate a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.

As the court stated in Smith,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>The type of damage to reputation and character ... must be beyond whatever obloquy stems from the loss of a job, demotion, adverse evaluations (e.g., inefficiency and incompetence), of judgments of job performance.  Similarly, demotions or transfers with overtones of disciplinary action and consequent adverse effect on reputation do not, without more, give rise to a liberty interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 635, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2196251\"><a href=\"/opinion/2196251/smith-v-commissioner-of-mental-retardation/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span> (citations omitted);  see also, Stetson v.

There is no evidence that the basis for Silva's termination, that Silva \"pushed Tim Lobo\", was ever disseminated in a formal setting, as required under federal law.  Even assuming the state standard is different, there was no dissemination to the public or to prospective employers.  The termination letter that passed through the City personnel department remarked only on Silva's \"unsatisfactory conduct and job performance\".  The employee warning written by Pontes stated only that Silva \"pushed Tim Lobo\" and was not publicly disseminated.  Silva's union representative was aware of the incident only because Silva requested the representative's presence when Pontes issued his warning.  That Worden interviewed a witness to the incident is insufficient to constitute dissemination.  Finally, that the incident was discussed by other employees in the city yard is not evidence that the incident was published by Worden or any other city official or was the basis for a formal charge requiring due process protections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we find no evidence supporting the claim that Silva's termination was accompanied by defamatory formal charges or statements that were disseminated by city officials.  Nor do we find evidence that Silva's subsequent difficulty in obtaining employment resulted from the City's discharge of Silva for unsatisfactory conduct and job performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
