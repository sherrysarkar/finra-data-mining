Vega-Figueroa, along with eight other defendants, was tried\n\npursuant to a three-count indictment in the District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico for drug related activities.                               The\n\nindictment charged as follows:               Count I, 21 U.S.C. § 848(a) and\n\n(b), continuing criminal enterprise, and 18 U.S.C. § 2, aiding\n\nand    abetting;        Count   II,   21     U.S.C.       §    846,       conspiracy    to\n\ndistribute in excess of five kilograms of heroin, in excess of\n\nfive       kilograms    of   cocaine,   in       excess       of   five    kilograms    of\n\ncocaine base and in excess of 100 kilograms of marijuana; and\n\nCount III, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) & (2), unlawful use of firearms\n\nduring and in relation to a drug trafficking offense and aiding\n\nand abetting.\n\n               All nine of the defendants who stood trial were found\n\nguilty on all or some of the counts.                           We consolidated the\n\nappeals.       Seven of the defendants argued orally on September 14,\n\n2000.        The other two defendants' appeals were submitted on\n\nbriefs to the same panel.\n\n               The defendant in this case, Vega-Figueroa, was found\n\nguilty       on   all   three   counts.           He   was         sentenced    to   life\n\nimprisonment on Counts I and II of the indictment1 and a term of\n\nfive years on Count III, to be served consecutively.                           Defendant\n\n\n       1Count II was subsequently dismissed.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fhas raised ten issues on appeal, which we will discuss in the\n\norder followed in his brief.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f                              I.    FACTS\n\n           We state the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.    See United States v. Duclos, 214 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).     This rehearsal of the evidence does not, of course,\n\ncover the facts that are applicable only to other defendants.\n\nNor do we recite, at this juncture, all of the facts involving\n\ndefendant.    Many of the facts pertaining to particular issues\n\nwill be set forth in our discussion of the issues.         All we do\n\nnow is state those facts that will give the reader the necessary\n\nbackground information to understand the different issues raised\n\nby defendant.     Defendant   and    Carlos Hernandez-Vega were in\n\ncharge of an extensive criminal enterprise involving the sale\n\nand   distribution   of   heroin,    cocaine,   crack   cocaine,   and\n\nmarijuana.    Cooperating witnesses for the government included\n\nfive former members of the enterprise who sold narcotics for the\n\norganization.    Their testimony can be summarized as follows.\n\n           Defendant and/or Hernandez-Vega delivered the drugs to\n\nthe various cooperating witnesses at the drug point, located in\n\na public housing project.     Members of the enterprise carjacked\n\nautomobiles on a regular basis.          The carjacked vehicles were\n\nthen used for drive-by shootings targeted against other drug\n\ndealers who operated drug points in other public housing units\n\nin competition with defendant and Hernandez-Vega.           The drug\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdistribution      point       of    the    enterprise       was     guarded         by   armed\n\nmembers of the organization.                    There was also testimony that\n\ndefendant    and       Hernandez-Vega           operated     a     heroin      drug      point\n\nlocated within the Hogar Crea detention and drug rehabilitation\n\nfacility in Saint Just at Trujuillo Alto, Puerto Rico.                               Another\n\ndrug gang ousted two members of defendant’s organization from\n\nthe Hogar Crea drug point.                Defendant and Hernandez-Vega ordered\n\nthat the two men who had taken over the Hogar Crea drug point be\n\nmurdered.        The    men     were      ambushed    and    killed       by   defendant,\n\nHernandez-Vega, and other members of defendant’s enterprise.\n\n            The indictment charged that the continuing criminal\n\nenterprise and conspiracy started on or about August 1, 1990,\n\nand continued until on or about April 10, 1997.\n\n                                   II.     DISCUSSION\n\n            The    issues       are       essentially       stated       as    phrased       by\n\ndefendant.\n\n            1.         Whether a statement made by defendant\n                       while in custody should have been\n                       suppressed.\n\n            After      being       arrested,      defendant,        along      with       other\n\ncodefendants,       was       taken      into    custody      to    be    interrogated,\n\nphotographed,          and      finger-printed.               Before          any        police\n\ninterrogation started, another arrestee, Medina-Sanchez, asked\n\ndefendant    if    he     had      been    arrested     for      running       a    criminal\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fenterprise and supervising a drug point.                Defendant replied\n\n“that was before . . . about the drug point . . . now I only\n\nsupervise the kitchen. . . .”        In the parlance of the drug trade\n\na “kitchen” is that part of a drug operation in which the drugs\n\nare prepared for sale.    Unfortunately for defendant, two federal\n\nagents overheard the conversation and included it in their\n\nreport.     The statement was used against defendant at trial.\n\nDefendant    contends   “that      the    statement     should   have      been\n\nsuppressed    because   (1)   he   should    have     been   warned   of    his\n\nconstitutional rights under Miranda and (2) the statement was\n\nnot voluntarily made.”\n\n            In denying defendant's motion to suppress, the district\n\ncourt examined the totality of the circumstances and found:\n\n            [I]t is clear that the statements which\n            defendant made while waiting to be booked at\n            the Federal Building were indeed voluntary.\n            Defendant merely responded to questioning\n            from another arrestee.     Although he was\n            being closely supervised by various agents\n            who were present to ensure that things were\n            under control, those agents did not address\n            him directly, except to allegedly ask him\n            routine  questions,   such   as  his   name,\n            nickname, prior employment, and whether he\n            had any addiction problems.\n\n            Our prior case law establishes the standard of review.\n\nWe held in United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 7 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n1993), that \"[n]ormally, 'clear error' is the standard employed\n\nin reviewing findings of fact.            In the present case, however,\n\n                                    -7-\n\fnone of the relevant facts are in dispute . . . .                   Thus, the\n\ndetermination as to whether police 'interrogation' occurred\n\ndepends    on   the   totality   of    the   circumstances,     a     balancing\n\nanalysis    commonly      considered    amenable       to   plenary    review\"\n\n(citations omitted).         We held in United States v. Sealey, 30\n\nF.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1994), that \"[i]n scrutinizing a district\n\ncourt's denial of a suppression motion, the court of appeals\n\nwill review findings of fact for clear error, while at the same\n\ntime   subjecting      the   trial    court's    ultimate     constitutional\n\nconclusions to plenary oversight.\"\n\n            Neither      party   here       disputes    the    circumstances\n\nsurrounding defendant's statement. The only questions presented\n\nfor review are whether the district court erred in holding that\n\ndefendant's statements were voluntary and that the custodial\n\nsituation did not amount to the functional equivalent of an\n\ninterrogation.        Because these issues involve questions of law,\n\nwe apply plenary review.\n\n            First, we reject defendant's argument that he was\n\nentitled to Miranda warnings.          In order for Miranda rights to be\n\ninvoked, there must be (1) custody and (2) interrogation.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Ventura, 85 F.3d 708, 709-10 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nIt is undisputed that defendant was in custody at the time of\n\nhis statement.        Because he does not allege that there was ever\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fan   actual    interrogation,      the    crux   of    his    appeal   hinges    on\n\nwhether     the     environment     within     which    defendant      made     the\n\nstatement      amounted       to   the    functional         equivalent   of     an\n\ninterrogation.\n\n              The   Supreme    Court     discussed     the     concept    of    the\n\nfunctional equivalent of an interrogation in Rhode Island v.\n\nInnis, 446 U.S. 291 (1980), holding:\n\n              . . . Miranda safeguards come into play\n              whenever a person in custody is subjected to\n              either express questioning or its functional\n              equivalent. That is to say, the term\n              \"interrogation\" under Miranda refers not\n              only to express questioning, but also to any\n              words or actions on the part of the police\n              (other than those normally attendant to\n              arrest and custody) that the police should\n              know are reasonably likely to elicit an\n              incriminating response from the suspect . .\n              . . A practice that the police should know\n              is   reasonably    likely   to    evoke   an\n              incriminating response from a suspect thus\n              amounts to interrogation.    But, since the\n              police surely cannot be held accountable for\n              the unforeseeable results of their words or\n              actions, the definition of interrogation can\n              extend only to words or actions on the part\n              of police officers that they should have\n              known were reasonably likely to elicit an\n              incriminating response.\n\nId. at 300-01 (citations omitted).\n\n              Here, defendant alleges only that the police performed\n\ntheir routine activities of fingerprinting and photographing him\n\nand other defendants.          He points to no words or actions on the\n\npart of the federal agents that were likely to elicit his\n\n                                         -9-\n\fincriminating words about \"supervising the kitchen.\"              Hence,\n\nthere is nothing to support his contention that he experienced\n\nthe functional equivalent of interrogation such that             Miranda\n\nwarnings were warranted.\n\n         Nor     did   the   district    court   err   in   holding   that\n\ndefendant's statements were voluntary.           The Supreme Court has\n\nheld that \"[t]he admissibility of the respondent's statement as\n\na constitutional matter [is] governed . . . by the contemporary\n\ncase law elaborating the due process standard of voluntariness.\n\nThe question [is] whether the will of the defendant had been\n\noverborne so that the statement was not his free and voluntary\n\nact, and that question [is] to be resolved in light of the\n\ntotality of the circumstances.\"         Procunier v. Atchley, 400 U.S.\n\n446, 453 (1971); see also United States v. Melendez, 228 F.3d\n\n19, 22 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that Miranda has no force\n\noutside of interrogations where interrogators do not have the\n\n\"capacity to dominate the scene to such an extent that the risks\n\nof coercion and intimidation are unreasonably high\").\n\n         Applying the applicable case law to the undisputed\n\nfacts of the circumstances surrounding defendant's statement, we\n\nhave no difficulty finding that the statement was his free and\n\nvoluntary act.     Defendant's statement was not the result of\n\nintimidation, coercion resulting from the setting in which the\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fstatement was made, or a deliberate plan by the agents to place\n\ndefendant in an environment that would induce a confession.\n\n           2.     Whether defendant was denied a\n                  fair trial by the failure of\n                  the government to disclose\n                  information in its possession.\n\n\n           Defendant asserts that the government was untimely in\n\nits disclosure of two pieces of evidence - rough notes taken by\n\nF.B.I. agents for use in preparing a report, and photographs\n\nused to question a key witness - and that he was therefore\n\nimpaired in his ability to defend.       The district court permitted\n\nthe introduction of both of these pieces of evidence.\n\n           Defendant presents extensive case law discussing the\n\ngovernment's    obligation,   under   Fed.   R.    Crim.   P.   16(c),   to\n\ndisclose documents \"which are material to the preparation of the\n\ndefendant's defense or are intended for use by the government as\n\nevidence in chief at the trial. . ..\"             He does not specify,\n\nhowever, how his ability to defend the case was impaired, or how\n\nhe would have altered his defense had the allegedly untimely\n\ninformation been disclosed earlier.\n\n           As to the notes, defendant seems to argue that he hoped\n\nthat by viewing copies of the notes used in writing the F.B.I.\n\nreport, he would be able to show inconsistencies between the\n\nagents'   testimony   and   the   report.    The   district     court    was\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\funconvinced that defendant even needed to survey the notes at\n\nall, noting that defendant had access to the actual report, as\n\nwell as an opportunity to cross-examine the agents who had\n\nprepared the report, during which defendant could have attempted\n\nto unearth all of the same alleged inconsistencies that he hoped\n\nto bring to light in viewing the notes.\n\n          As to the photographs, defendant contends that his\n\ndefense was impaired by the government's failure to timely\n\ndisclose the photos.      The district court allowed the photos to\n\nbe used at trial even though they had not previously been\n\ndisclosed to defendant, on the ground that the photos were used\n\nexclusively     for   identification       purposes.     The   photos    were\n\npresented to a witness whose description of a third party had\n\nbeen called into question by the defense, in order to verify\n\nthat he was able to identify the correct person.               Implicit in\n\nthe district court's decision is a finding that because the\n\nphotos   were    only   used   to   clarify     an     identification,     an\n\nidentification that defendant was well aware would take place,\n\nthe delayed disclosure did not impair defendant's case.\n\n          We held in United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280 (1st\n\nCir. 1990):\n\n          When the issue is one of delayed disclosure\n          rather than total nondisclosure . . . the\n          applicable test is whether defense counsel\n          was prevented by the delay from using the\n\n                                    -12-\n\f             disclosed material effectively in preparing\n             and presenting the defendant's case . . . .\n             Although our opinions have not been explicit\n             on the point, we believe that, absent a\n             mistake of law, a court of appeals should\n             review a district court's finding that\n             delayed disclosure was harmless . . . under\n             an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n\nId.    at   289   (citations     and        internal    quotations    omitted).\n\n\"Generally, [the court has] viewed the failure to ask for a\n\ncontinuance as an indication that defense counsel was himself\n\nsatisfied he had sufficient opportunity to use the evidence\n\nadvantageously.\"       United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 758\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).       We also held that \"[a defendant's] claim that\n\nhe    was   unfairly   surprised       is    severely    undermined,    if    not\n\nentirely undone, by his neglect to ask the district court for a\n\ncontinuance to meet the claimed exigency.\"                  United States v.\n\nDiaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n             Here, defendant never moved for a continuance as a\n\nresult of the allegedly delayed disclosure.                 In light of this\n\nfailure, combined with his failure to substantiate his assertion\n\nof impairment in defending his case with even a single concrete\n\nexample,     we   cannot   say   that   the     district   court     abused   its\n\ndiscretion in allowing the evidence in question to be admitted.\n\n             3.      Whether defendant was denied\n                     due     process     by     the\n                     interference of the government\n                     with a key defense witness.\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f            The essential facts are as follows. Defendant intended\n\nto call as a defense witness Isabelle Cesareo, the aunt of Ramon\n\nCesareo, a prosecution witness who had made an agreement with\n\nthe federal government in exchange for his testimony.         Isabelle\n\nwas to    testify adversely on the credibility of her nephew.       The\n\nprosecution sent three F.B.I. agents to Isabelle's home to speak\n\nwith her.    She was not home at the time, and the agents were\n\nonly able to speak with her daughter.         The daughter testified\n\nthat the agents questioned her about whether defense counsel had\n\nbeen in contact with her mother; told her that unless served\n\nwith a subpoena, her mother was under no obligation to testify;\n\nand said that her mother's testimony could adversely affect\n\nRamon's    agreement   with   the    government.     Isabelle,   though\n\nseemingly reluctant to testify after the visit, ultimately did\n\nso.\n\n            The district court asked the prosecutor why F.B.I.\n\nagents had been sent to the home of a defense witness.             She\n\nresponded that the visit followed a report that the defense had\n\nbeen in contact with a witness.        Ramon told the F.B.I. that, in\n\nan attempt to keep him from testifying,            defense counsel had\n\nvisited members of his family and told them that he, Ramon,\n\nwould be the only government witness to take the stand against\n\ndefendant at trial.     The prosecutor claimed that the visit to\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fIsabelle's home was simply an attempt to corroborate Ramon's\n\nstatement.\n\n            The district court was presented with three issues:\n\n(1) the reason that the prosecution sent agents to the witness's\n\nhome; (2) whether the visit was improper; and (3) whether the\n\nvisit affected the testimony given by the witness.        The district\n\ncourt held:\n\n            [W]e do find after hearing Mrs. Cesareo and\n            her daughter that this witness is not\n            hostile to the defendant. She is willing to\n            testified [sic].    Her testimony in court\n            this morning was frank, honest and the Court\n            has no reason to be concerned about it, as\n            far as what the defendant wishes her to\n            testify about . . . . [W]e do find that in\n            substance   the  visit   by  these   agents,\n            although, in the Court's opinion not the\n            best practice without notifying counsel . .\n            . we do find that it has not in any way\n            affected the right of the defendant to bring\n            this witness via a subpoena to have her\n            testify candidly like she is prepared to do\n            and the Court corroborated that this morning\n            and, therefore, the defendant's rights have\n            not been affected in any way. Mrs. Cesareo\n            is here in court. She will be a witness.\n\n            Defendant asserts that the prosecution sent the agents\n\nto Isabelle's home in order to encourage her not to testify, and\n\nthat, even though she ultimately did testify, she had been\n\n\"changed from a willing participant in the court proceeding to\n\na highly reluctant and scared participant.\"         This interference,\n\ndefendant     argues,   constitutes    a   denial   of   due   process.\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fDefendant does not specify what parts of Isabelle's testimony\n\nwould have been different had the prosecution not contacted her.\n\nThe government points out that the agents never actually spoke\n\nwith Isabelle or entered into a discussion as to whether she\n\nshould testify.    Finally, the government argues that, even were\n\nthe   prosecutor's   visit   found    to   have   been    improper,   the\n\ndefendant was not prejudiced since, in the end, Isabelle did\n\ntake the stand.\n\n          If any improprieties surrounding the prosecution's\n\ncontact with the witness are found, we must determine whether\n\nthat interference constituted reversible error.           See Lisenba v.\n\nCalifornia, 314 U.S. 219, 236 (1941) (holding that \"[a]s applied\n\nto a criminal trial, denial of due process is the failure to\n\nobserve that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept\n\nof justice.     In order to declare a denial of it we must find\n\nthat the absence of that fairness fatally infected the trial;\n\nthe acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily\n\nprevents a fair trial.\"); see also United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 733 (1993) (holding that an appeals court's authority\n\nto reverse a district court decision is contingent upon the\n\nerror   being   prejudicial).        Regardless   of     whether   actual\n\nprejudice is required, defendant has failed to prove a due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f           We take a dim view of government agents gratuitously\n\nconfronting a defense witness out of court before the witness\n\ntestifies.      See Kines v. Butterworth, 669 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1981) (holding that \"when the free choice of a potential witness\n\nto talk to defense counsel is constrained by the prosecution\n\nwithout justification, this constitutes improper interference\n\nwith   a     defendant's      right     of   access   to   the   witness.\n\nJustification on the part of the prosecution to interfere with\n\nthat right can be shown only by the clearest and most compelling\n\nconsiderations.\").         In the present case, however, there is\n\nnothing in the record indicating that the testimony would have\n\nbeen different or more exonerating if the agents had not talked\n\nto the witness's daughter.        We are, therefore, bound to uphold\n\nthe district court's ruling.\n\n           4.       Whether the government proved\n                    a continuing conspiracy or\n                    only multiple conspiracies.\n\n           Part    of   the   conspiracy     for   which   defendant   was\n\nconvicted involved the operation of a drug point after 1995.\n\nDefendant was incarcerated from January, 1995, through April,\n\n1997, and denies having participated in any conspiracy during\n\nthat time.      He argues that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nprove the existence of only a single conspiracy and that he thus\n\nshould not be held liable for any of the transactions that took\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fplace after the start of his incarceration.          Defendant further\n\nasserts that, because there is no evidence connecting him with\n\nany conspiracy after the start of his incarceration, no evidence\n\nhaving to do with the operation of the drug point subsequent to\n\nhis incarceration should have been admitted.         In support of this\n\ncontention, he points to evidence suggesting that, while he was\n\nin jail, the drug point in question came to be controlled by\n\nanother organization of which he was not a member, and that\n\ncertain members of his conspiracy were also members of another\n\nconspiracy.    This, he argues, shows the existence of multiple\n\nconspiracies rather than just a single conspiracy.                 If, as\n\ndefendant contends, multiple conspiracies existed, the criminal\n\nactivities for which he could be held responsible would be\n\ngreatly reduced.\n\n            Whether   a   series   of   events   constitutes   a   single\n\nconspiracy is a question of fact, reviewed for sufficiency of\n\nevidence.     We held in United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d\n\n664, 667 (1st Cir. 1996), that \"[w]hether the evidence adduced\n\nat trial established one or more conspiracies [is] a question of\n\nfact for the jury.\"       \"It is a recurring question in conspiracy\n\ncases whether related illegal agreements comprise one conspiracy\n\nor several.    Because the agreements are often not explicit and\n\nare regularly inferred from conduct, the courts ordinarily treat\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthe issue as one of fact and offer various criteria that might\n\nhelp the factfinder distinguish . . . .\"                           United States v.\n\nRandazzo,       80   F.3d   623,    629      (1st    Cir.     1992).      \"[A]    single\n\nconspiracy may exist where there has been no direct contact\n\namong some of the participants . . . .                        Moreover, [t]he fact\n\nthat every defendant did not participate in every transaction\n\nnecessary       to   fulfill    the    aim     of    their     agreement     does    not\n\ntransform a continuing plan into multiple conspiracies.\"                          United\n\nStates    v.    Mena-Robles,       4   F.3d        1026,    1033   (1st    Cir.   1993)\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).                         In reviewing\n\na jury's finding concerning the number of conspiracies, \"where\n\n. . .    there is no challenge to the jury instructions, we review\n\nthe jury's conclusion as to whether one or more conspiracies\n\nexisted only for evidentiary sufficiency.\"                      Id.\n\n            The evidence suggesting multiple conspiracies to which\n\ndefendant refers in his appeal is only tangentially related to\n\nthe issue presented to this court: whether there is sufficient\n\nevidence in the record upon which a reasonable jury could have\n\nfound that the conspiracy to distribute drugs continued after\n\ndefendant was incarcerated.                  That there may be some evidence\n\nsuggesting      the     existence      of    multiple       conspiracies     does    not\n\nchange    the    fact    that   this        court    cannot    reverse     the    jury's\n\nverdict (which rested upon a finding of a single conspiracy)\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fabsent a determination that no reasonable jury could have come\n\nto this conclusion.\n\n          The record is replete with evidence allowing for a\n\nfinding of a single conspiracy that continued beyond the start\n\nof defendant's incarceration.          During the three months of trial,\n\nwitness   after    witness      provided     testimony       demonstrating    the\n\nimpeccable organization of the conspiracy – everything from the\n\ncolor of the packaging used for the drugs, to the preferred car\n\nmodels stolen for use in drive-by shootings, to the particular\n\nkinds of firearms members were permitted to carry in various\n\nsituations – all of which was under defendant's control.                   There\n\nwas even a reference made to a designation of which specific\n\nmembers of the conspiracy would be allowed to make decisions at\n\na meeting that took place during a period in which defendant was\n\nbriefly   incarcerated.           Based      on   all    of    this    testimony\n\ndemonstrating        the        rock-solid,        intricately          designed\n\norganizational structure of the conspiracy, there is no basis to\n\nfind that the jury was unreasonable in coming to the conclusion\n\nthat the conspiracy continued after defendant was imprisoned and\n\nthat he continued to play a major role in its operation.\n\n          5.        Whether the proof at trial\n                    varied from the indictment.\n\n          Defendant claims to have had inadequate notice of the\n\nconduct   for     which    he   was   charged.          He    argues   that   the\n\n                                      -20-\n\fprosecution, without indicating in the indictment that it was\n\ngoing    to    do    so,    introduced     evidence   that,    as   part    of   the\n\nconspiracy, he (1) was involved in the murder of Maria Magdalena\n\nGotay, the sister of one of the prosecution's key witnesses; and\n\n(2) supervised the drug point at the housing project while he\n\nwas   incarcerated.            Defendant    asserts   that    these    unforeseen\n\naccusations represent a variance between the indictment and the\n\nproof adduced at trial.           The prosecution asserts that it is not\n\nrequired to prove the commission of any overt act in furtherance\n\nof a 21 U.S.C. § 846 drug conspiracy and that therefore it was\n\nnot required to list any overt acts in the indictment.\n\n              Defendant raised a nearly identical argument before the\n\ndistrict court in a motion to suppress.                    The district court\n\ndenied        the     motion,      rejecting       defendant’s        claims       of\n\nunconstitutional variance and insufficient notice. With respect\n\nto the variance assertion, the district court held that \"what\n\ndefendants fail to recognize is that the indictment charged\n\ndefendants      with       conspiracy,     not   murder.      The   use    of    this\n\ntestimony regarding the murder is merely another overt act in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy, and not an additional charge for\n\nthe   murder        itself.\"     The   district    court     then   rejected      the\n\ninsufficient notice claim, pointing out that \"the Government was\n\nnot even required to supply the defendants with the name of the\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fwitness who [would] testify about this murder prior to the\n\ntrial.\"     In his appeal to this court, defendant reasserts the\n\nargument he made to the district court.\n\n            21   U.S.C.    §    846   provides     that    \"[a]ny    person      who\n\nattempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this\n\nsubchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those\n\nprescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the\n\nobject of the attempt or conspiracy.\"                 In    United States v.\n\nShabani, 513 U.S. 10, 13 (1994), the Supreme Court stated that\n\n\"[t]he language of neither [the original conspiracy statute of\n\nthe Comprehensive Drug Act of 1970 nor the version amended by\n\nthe    Anti-Drug   Act    of   1988]    requires    that    an   overt     act    be\n\ncommitted to further the conspiracy, and we have not inferred\n\nsuch    a   requirement        from    congressional       silence    in    other\n\nconspiracy statutes.\"          We held in Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d at 669,\n\nthat \"[t]he government is not required to plead or prove any\n\novert act in furtherance of a section 846 conspiracy.                    Although\n\novert acts are gratuitously set forth in the indictment, the\n\ngovernment is not limited at trial to proof of the alleged overt\n\nacts; nor is the indictment rendered insufficient for failure to\n\nplead other overt acts.\" (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\f             Under     the   applicable    case   law,   it   is    clear   that\n\ndefendant has no basis for asserting that there was a fatal\n\nvariance between the indictment and the proof at trial.\n\n             6.        The government made promises\n                       of value to witnesses for\n                       their testimony in violation\n                       of  18  U.S.C.  §   201(c)(2)\n                       (2000).\n\n             18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2) (2000) provides that \"[w]hoever\n\n.   .   .   directly    or   indirectly,    gives,   offers,       or   promises\n\nanything of value to any person, for or because of the testimony\n\nunder oath or affirmation given or to be given by such person as\n\na witness upon a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, before any\n\ncourt . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for\n\nnot more than two years, or both.\"           Defendant contends that the\n\ngovernment violated this statute by agreeing, in return for the\n\nwitnesses' testimony, not to prosecute one witness, and to\n\nsupport a reduction in a sentence for another.                     We heard and\n\nunequivocally rejected this argument in United States v. Lara,\n\n181 F.3d 183, 197-98 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S.Ct.\n\n432 (1999):\n\n             [W]e   make  our   position   explicit   and\n             unqualified. There are several reasons why\n             section 201(c)(2) cannot be invoked as a\n             bright-line barrier to the government's use\n             of witnesses whose cooperation has been\n             secured by agreements not to prosecute or by\n             promises of recommended leniency. The most\n             basic reason is that section 201(c)(2) does\n\n                                     -23-\n\f             not apply at all to the federal sovereign\n             qua prosecutor.     After all, statutes of\n             general purport do not apply to the United\n             States unless Congress makes the application\n             clear and indisputable, and Congress has\n             taken no such steps in respect to this\n             statute.   Reliance    on  this   tenet   is\n             particularly apt where, as here, the failure\n             to honor it would divest the government of a\n             long-established prerogative and, in the\n             bargain, lead to an eccentric result.\n\n(citations        and   internal    quotation        marks   omitted)   (emphasis\n\nadded).   Under this holding, defendant's assertion is meritless.\n\n\n\n             7.         Whether defendant was denied a\n                        fair trial because a witness\n                        was  permitted   to  give   an\n                        opinion on an ultimate issue\n                        in the case.\n\n             Fed. R. Evid. 701, Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses,\n\nprovides:\n\n             If the witness is not testifying as an\n             expert, the witness's testimony in the form\n             of opinions or inferences is limited to\n             those opinions or inferences which are\n             (a) rationally based on the perception of\n             the witness and (b) helpful to a clear\n             understanding of the witness' testimony or\n             the determination of a fact in issue.\n\nDefendant     asserts      that    the   district      court   should   not   have\n\npermitted testimony by Aleida Gotay Saez in which Gotay stated\n\nher opinion that the reason her sister was killed was that\n\nGotay's drug point, where her sister worked, sold more drugs\n\nthan   the    drug      point     operated      by    defendant   and   his    co-\n\n                                         -24-\n\fconspirators.   Defendant argues that this testimony was based on\n\nhearsay, that it was an opinion concerning an ultimate issue\n\nthat had to be determined by the jury, that it was not \"helpful\"\n\nas required by section (b) of the rule, and that it seriously\n\nprejudiced his case.\n\n          The government argues that because of Gotay's heavy\n\ninvolvement   with    the   competing    drug   point   at    the    housing\n\nproject, her participation in a meeting in which defendant\n\nmentioned the benefits of joining his operation, her first-hand\n\nknowledge of how drug trafficking organizations operated, and\n\nher witnessing of her sister's murder, she was in a position to\n\ngive an opinion as to why her sister was killed.          The government\n\ncontends that her testimony was helpful because it helped the\n\njury understand the motive behind the murder and how the act\n\nfurthered the interests of the conspiracy.\n\n          In United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 156 (1st Cir.\n\n1989), we reiterated the generally accepted rule:\n\n          The admissibility of lay opinion testimony\n          pursuant to Rule 701 is committed to the\n          sound discretion of the trial judge, and the\n          trial judge’s admission of such testimony\n          will not be overturned unless it constitutes\n          a clear abuse of discretion.\n\nWe pointed out that “[t]he modern trend favors the admission of\n\nopinion   testimony   provided   it     is   well   founded   on    personal\n\nknowledge and susceptible to cross-examination.”              Id. at 157;\n\n                                 -25-\n\fsee also United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 107 F.3d 960, 968\n\n(1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Jackman, 48 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n          The record shows that Gotay was subject to intensive\n\ncross-examination.       Under the applicable law and the facts to\n\nwhich she testified, we find that the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in allowing Gotay to state her opinion as\n\nto why her sister was killed.      In all events, given the strength\n\nof the government's case against defendant, any error in the\n\nadmission of this evidence was harmless.\n\n          8.       Whether the search warrant for\n                   defendant’s   apartment    was\n                   invalid because it failed to\n                   correctly     identify     the\n                   apartment to be searched.\n\n          Defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized on the\n\nground that an erroneous address on the warrant invalidated it.\n\nHe further argued that even if the warrant was valid, it should\n\nnot have issued because it was not supported by probable cause.\n\nThe   district   court   did   reach   the   merits   of   the   motion   to\n\nsuppress but dismissed it on the ground that it was untimely.\n\nAlthough we do not entirely disagree with the district court as\n\nto the timeliness of the motion, we prefer to decide the issue\n\non the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\f            We held in United States v. Vigeant, 176 F.3d 565, 569\n\n(1st Cir. 1999), that \"[w]e review the question of probable\n\ncause de novo, assessing the information provided in the four\n\ncorners of the affidavit supporting the warrant application\" and\n\nthat \"probable cause exists when the affidavit upon which a\n\nwarrant is founded demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the\n\nlikelihood that an offense has been committed . . . .\" (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted).            Probable cause, in the\n\ncontext of granting a search warrant, requires no more than the\n\nexistence of a \"fair probability\" that evidence of a crime will\n\nbe found.      United States v. Grant, 218 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n            The facts leading to the warrant are as follows.             Edwin\n\nNunez Cotto, an officer in the drugs and narcotics division of\n\nthe   Puerto    Rico   Police    Department,      testified      that    while\n\nconducting     surveillance     of   the    building    in   which   defendant\n\nlived, he had seen individuals who appeared to be transporting\n\nweapons and other individuals positioned on the roof, apparently\n\nas lookouts.      These observations led Nunez to conclude that\n\n“they were protecting something in defendant’s apartment.\"\n\n            Defendant argues in his brief that the warrant was not\n\nsupported by probable cause.         He states:        “Where information is\n\nsupplied by a confidential informant to a police officer, the\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\finformant, in general, must be shown to have an adequate basis\n\nof knowledge and a background demonstrating reliability.”    This\n\nis a substantially correct statement of the law but there is\n\nnothing in the record about information from a confidential\n\ninformant.   Rather, it seems clear that the warrant was issued\n\nbased on the observations and conclusion of Officer Nunez.\n\nThere can be little doubt that there was at least a “fair\n\nprobability,” based on Nunez’s observations, that evidence of a\n\ncrime could be found.   We rule that there was probable cause for\n\nissuing the search warrant.\n\n          Defendant’s final argument on this issue focuses on an\n\nincorrect address given in the warrant.    The warrant mistakenly\n\ndescribed the apartment to be searched as building 44, apartment\n\n446.   Defendant's address was in fact building 45, apartment\n\n446, and that was the only premises searched.     Officer Nunez,\n\nwho made the observations that were the basis for issuing the\n\nwarrant and was its executing officer, was also a member of the\n\nsearch team.   He correctly directed the team to defendant’s\n\napartment.\n\n          Defendant argues that, because of the address mistake,\n\nhis apartment was not \"particularly described\" in the warrant as\n\nrequired by the Fourth Amendment.     He contends that the search\n\nof his apartment was thus improper, and that any evidence found\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fas a result of the search should be suppressed.                 Defendant\n\nasserts that the warrant allowed the police to undertake wide-\n\nranging general searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment,\n\nand that there was a great probability that the wrong apartment\n\nwould be searched.\n\n            We held in United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 866-\n\n67   (1st   Cir.   1986),   that   \"[t]he    manifest   purpose     of   the\n\nparticularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is to prevent\n\nwide-ranging general searches by the police\" and that \"[t]he\n\ntest for determining the adequacy of the description of the\n\nlocation to be searched is whether the description is sufficient\n\nto enable the executing officer to locate and identify the\n\npremises    with   reasonable   effort,     and   whether   there   is   any\n\nreasonable probability that another premise might be mistakenly\n\nsearched.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nThe warrant in Bonner was held to be valid despite its omission\n\nof the house number, because it included an adequate description\n\nof the premises to be searched and because, as in the present\n\ncase, an agent who had been involved with surveillance of the\n\nhouse had accompanied the search team.            The incorrect address\n\ndid not invalidate the warrant where \"[t]here was no risk that\n\nfederal agents would be confused and stumble into the wrong\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fhouse, or would take advantage of their unforeseeable windfall\n\nand search houses indiscriminately, . . . .\"                Id. at 866.\n\n            We   rule    that    the    warrant    was   properly     issued   and\n\nexecuted.\n\n            9.      Whether the district court\n                    omitted key instructions from\n                    the    instruction    on    a\n                    continuing         criminal\n                    enterprise.\n\n            Defendant asserts that the district court’s charge to\n\nthe jury was deficient in that it failed to (1) define the\n\nmeaning of the terms “organizer,” “supervisor” and “manager,”\n\n(2) instruct the jury on what was meant by acting “in concert or\n\ntogether with” five or more other persons,” (3) instruct as to\n\nwhich individuals were countable in the “five or more other\n\npersons,” and (4) sufficiently communicate the need of the jury\n\nto unanimously identify each underlying violation.                   He argues in\n\nthe   alternative       that    the    failure    to   object   on   this   issue\n\nconstituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n            Because defendant did not raise any of these objections\n\nafter the charge and before the jury started deliberations, we\n\nreview the district court’s instructions for plain error.                      In\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993), the Supreme\n\nCourt defined this standard of review as requiring \"an 'error'\n\nthat is 'plain' and that 'affect[s] substantial rights.' . . .\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\fMoreover,    Rule   52(b)   leaves   the   decision   to   correct   the\n\nforfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of\n\nappeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion\n\nunless the error 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.'”\n\n            The prosecution argues that a district court has no\n\nobligation to define terms generally understood by the average\n\nperson and that therefore defendant’s first two claims are\n\nmeritless.     We agree with the government's argument in this\n\nregard.     See United States v. De LaCruz, 902 F.2d 121, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).     Regarding the third claim, the prosecution notes\n\nthat there were nine defendants at trial (the tenth having pled\n\nguilty) and that it thus went without saying who could be\n\ncounted.     As to the final claim, the prosecution asserts that\n\nthe district court was clear in indicating that the jury had to\n\nunanimously agree on which three violations constituted the\n\nseries of three or more violations.\n\n            The district court's charge to the jury on Count 1 of\n\nthe indictment, the continuing criminal enterprise charge, was\n\nas follows:\n\n                   In Count 1 of the indictment two of\n            the defendants are charged, Jose Vega\n            Figueroa and Carlos Hernandez Vega. The law\n            makes it a federal crime or offense for\n            anyone to engage in what is called a\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fcontinuing criminal enterprise     involving\ncontrolled substances.\n\n       A defendant can be found guilty of\nthat offense only if all of the following\nfacts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n       First, that the defendants violated\nSection   841(a)(1)  as  charged  in   the\nindictment.   This is the drug trafficking\ncase.\n\n       Second, that such violations were part\nof a continuing series of violations as\nherein after defined.\n\n       Third, that such continuing series of\nviolations were undertaken by the defendants\nin concert or together with at least five or\nmore other persons.\n\n       Fourth, that the defendant occupied\nthe position of an organizer, supervisor or\nmanager.\n\n       Fifth, that the defendant obtained\nsubstantial income or resources in the\ncontinuing series of violations.\n\n       A continuing series of violations\nmeans proof of at least three violations\nunder the Federal controlled substances law,\nas charged in Count 1 of the indictment, and\nalso   requires   a   finding   that   those\nviolations were connected together as a\nseries of related or ongoing activities as\ndistinguished from isolated and disconnected\nacts.   You must unanimously agree on which\nthree violations constitute the series of\nthree or more violations in order to find\nthe essential element of No. 2 of this\noffense has been proven.\n\n       It must also be proved that the\ndefendants engaged in the continuing series\nof violations with at least five or more\n\n                    -32-\n\f               persons, whether or not those persons are\n               named in the indictment and whether or not\n               the same five or more persons participated\n               in each of the violations, or participated\n               at different times. And, it must be proved\n               that the defendant's relationship with the\n               other five or more persons was that of\n               organizers, supervisors or managers – that\n               the defendant's relationship with the other\n               five or more persons was that of organizer,\n               supervisor   or   manager,  and   that   the\n               defendant was more than a fellow worker and\n               either organized or directed the activities\n               of the others, whether the defendant was the\n               only organizer or supervisor or not.\n\n                      Finally, it must be proved that the\n               defendant obtained substantial income or\n               resources from the continuing series of\n               violations.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n               Given the language of the charge, we cannot conclude\n\nthat     the instructions on this issue were defective, much less\n\nplainly erroneous.\n\n               Defendant's alternative claim – that the failure to\n\nobject    on    this    issue    constitutes     ineffective     assistance     of\n\ncounsel – depends on whether we find any merit in his argument\n\nthat the jury instructions were flawed.                   Because we find that\n\nthe    jury    instructions      were    not    flawed,    we   do   not   discuss\n\ndefendant's          alternate   claim    of    ineffective      assistance     of\n\ncounsel.\n\n               10.      Whether the jury engaged in\n                        improper deliberations prior\n                        to the closing of the case.\n\n                                         -33-\n\f                During the trial, the jury requested to see the scene\n\nof    the       two   murders    at    Hogar     Crea,   a     drug   detention     and\n\nrehabilitation facility where members of the conspiracy had set\n\nup    a    second     drug    point.     In    response,       the    district    court\n\ninstructed the jury to wait until the government had presented\n\nits case-in-chief and that if, at that time, it still wished to\n\nsee       the   scene,   it     should   renew     its   request      at   that   time.\n\nDefendant asserts that this request demonstrates that the jury\n\nhad been deliberating and weighing the evidence before all of\n\nthe evidence had been presented, and that the court erred in\n\nfailing to remind the jury that it was not within its province\n\nto    determine        what     evidence    it     should      consider.      Because\n\ndefendant did not raise this objection during trial, we review\n\nthe district court's failure to so instruct for plain error. See\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 732.\n\n                The   record     shows   the      jury   was    instructed    at    the\n\nbeginning of the trial that they should not discuss the case\n\nuntil instructed to do so, and that the court concluded every\n\nsession by warning the jury:                   \"Do not discuss the case with\n\nanyone,\" or \"Do not discuss it among yourselves or with anyone.\"\n\nWe do not think that the desire of the jury to view a drug point\n\nis any indication that it disregarded the court’s repeated and\n\nexplicit instructions and engaged in improper deliberations.\n\n\n                                           -34-\n\f            For   the   foregoing   reasons,   the   judgment   below   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\f",

Vega-Figueroa, along with eight other defendants, was tried pursuant to a three-count indictment in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico for drug related activities. The indictment charged as follows: Count I, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848(a) and (b), continuing criminal enterprise, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, aiding and abetting; Count II, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of heroin, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine base and in excess of 100 kilograms of marijuana; and Count III, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) &amp; (2), unlawful use of firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense and aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All nine of the defendants who stood trial were found guilty on all or some of the counts. We consolidated the appeals. Seven of the defendants argued orally on September 14, 2000. The other two defendants' appeals were submitted on briefs to the same panel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant in this case, Vega-Figueroa, was found guilty on all three counts. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on Counts I and II of the indictment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and a term of five years on Count III, to be served consecutively. Defendant has raised ten issues on appeal, which we will discuss in the order followed in his brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. See United States v. Duclos, 214 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2000). This rehearsal of the evidence does not, of course, cover the facts that are applicable only to other defendants. Nor do we recite, at this juncture, all of the facts involving defendant. Many of the facts pertaining to particular issues will be set forth in our discussion of the issues. All we do now is state those facts that will give the reader the necessary background information to understand the different issues raised by defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and Carlos Hernandez-Vega were in charge of an extensive criminal enterprise involving the sale and distribution of heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana. Cooperating witnesses for the government included five former members of the enterprise who sold narcotics for the organization. Their testimony can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and/or Hernandez-Vega delivered the drugs to the various cooperating witnesses at the drug point, located in a public housing project. Members of the enterprise carjacked automobiles on a regular basis. The carjacked vehicles were then used for drive-by shootings targeted against other drug dealers who operated drug points in other public housing units in competition with defendant and Hernandez-Vega. The drug distribution point of the enterprise was guarded by armed members of the organization. There was also testimony that defendant and Hernandez-Vega operated a heroin drug point located within the Hogar Crea detention and drug rehabilitation facility in Saint Just at Trujuillo Alto, Puerto Rico. Another drug gang ousted two members of defendant's organization from the Hogar Crea drug point. Defendant and Hernandez-Vega ordered that the two men who had taken over the Hogar Crea drug point be murdered. The men were ambushed and killed by defendant, Hernandez-Vega, and other members of defendant's enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged that the continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy started on or about August 1, 1990, and continued until on or about April 10, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues are essentially stated as phrased by defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Whether a statement made by defendant while in custody should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being arrested, defendant, along with other codefendants, was taken into custody to be interrogated, photographed, and finger-printed. Before any police interrogation started, another arrestee, Medina-Sanchez, asked defendant if he had been arrested for running a criminal enterprise and supervising a drug point. Defendant replied \"that was before . . . about the drug point . . . now I only supervise the kitchen. . . .\" In the parlance of the drug trade a \"kitchen\" is that part of a drug operation in which the drugs are prepared for sale. Unfortunately for defendant, two federal agents overheard the conversation and included it in their report. The statement was used against defendant at trial. Defendant contends \"that the statement should have been suppressed because (1) he should have been warned of his constitutional rights under Miranda and (2) the statement was not voluntarily made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying defendant's motion to suppress, the district court examined the totality of the circumstances and found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t is clear that the statements which defendant made while waiting to be booked at the Federal Building were indeed voluntary. Defendant merely responded to questioning from another arrestee. Although he was being closely supervised by various agents who were present to ensure that things were under control, those agents did not address him directly, except to allegedly ask him routine questions, such as his name, nickname, prior employment, and whether he had any addiction problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our prior case law establishes the standard of review. We held in United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 7 n.5 (1stCir. 1993), that \"[n]ormally, 'clear error' is the standard employed in reviewing findings of fact. In the present case, however, none of the relevant facts are in dispute . . . . Thus, the determination as to whether police 'interrogation' occurred depends on the totality of the circumstances, a balancing analysis commonly considered amenable to plenary review\" (citations omitted). We held in United States v. Sealey, 30 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1994), that \"[i]n scrutinizing a district court's denial of a suppression motion, the court of appeals will review findings of fact for clear error, while at the same time subjecting the trial court's ultimate constitutional conclusions to plenary oversight.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party here disputes the circumstances surrounding defendant's statement. The only questions presented for review are whether the district court erred in holding that defendant's statements were voluntary and that the custodial situation did not amount to the functional equivalent of an interrogation. Because these issues involve questions of law, we apply plenary review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we reject defendant's argument that he was entitled to Miranda warnings. In order for Miranda rights to be invoked, there must be (1) custody and (2) interrogation. SeeUnited States v. Ventura, 85 F.3d 708, 709-10 (1st Cir. 1996). It is undisputed that defendant was in custody at the time of his statement. Because he does not allege that there was ever an actual interrogation, the crux of his appeal hinges on whether the environment within which defendant made the statement amounted to the functional equivalent of an interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court discussed the concept of the functional equivalent of an interrogation in Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291 (1980), holding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term \"interrogation\" under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect . . . . A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 300-01 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, defendant alleges only that the police performed their routine activities of fingerprinting and photographing him and other defendants. He points to no words or actions on the part of the federal agents that were likely to elicit his incriminating words about \"supervising the kitchen.\" Hence, there is nothing to support his contention that he experienced the functional equivalent of interrogation such that Miranda warnings were warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the district court err in holding that defendant's statements were voluntary. The Supreme Court has held that \"[t]he admissibility of the respondent's statement as a constitutional matter [is] governed . . . by the contemporary case law elaborating the due process standard of voluntariness. The question [is] whether the will of the defendant had been overborne so that the statement was not his free and voluntary act, and that question [is] to be resolved in light of the totality of the circumstances.\" Procunier v. Atchley, 400 U.S. 446, 453 (1971); see also United States v. Melendez, 228 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that Miranda has no force outside of interrogations where interrogators do not have the \"capacity to dominate the scene to such an extent that the risks of coercion and intimidation are unreasonably high\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the applicable case law to the undisputed facts of the circumstances surrounding defendant's statement, we have no difficulty finding that the statement was his free and voluntary act. Defendant's statement was not the result of intimidation, coercion resulting from the setting in which the statement was made, or a deliberate plan by the agents to place defendant in an environment that would induce a confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether defendant was denied a fair trial by the failure of the government to disclose information in its possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant asserts that the government was untimely in its disclosure of two pieces of evidence - rough notes taken by F.B.I. agents for use in preparing a report, and photographs used to question a key witness - and that he was therefore impaired in his ability to defend. The district court permitted the introduction of both of these pieces of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant presents extensive case law discussing the government's obligation, under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(c), to disclose documents \"which are material to the preparation of the defendant's defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial. . ..\" He does not specify, however, how his ability to defend the case was impaired, or how he would have altered his defense had the allegedly untimely information been disclosed earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the notes, defendant seems to argue that he hoped that by viewing copies of the notes used in writing the F.B.I. report, he would be able to show inconsistencies between the agents' testimony and the report. The district court was unconvinced that defendant even needed to survey the notes at all, noting that defendant had access to the actual report, as well as an opportunity to cross-examine the agents who had prepared the report, during which defendant could have attempted to unearth all of the same alleged inconsistencies that he hoped to bring to light in viewing the notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the photographs, defendant contends that his defense was impaired by the government's failure to timely disclose the photos. The district court allowed the photos to be used at trial even though they had not previously been disclosed to defendant, on the ground that the photos were used exclusively for identification purposes. The photos were presented to a witness whose description of a third party had been called into question by the defense, in order to verify that he was able to identify the correct person. Implicit in the district court's decision is a finding that because the photos were only used to clarify an identification, an identification that defendant was well aware would take place, the delayed disclosure did not impair defendant's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We held in United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280 (1st Cir. 1990):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the issue is one of delayed disclosure rather than total nondisclosure . . . the applicable test is whether defense counsel was prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant's case . . . . Although our opinions have not been explicit on the point, we believe that, absent a mistake of law, a court of appeals should review a district court's finding that delayed disclosure was harmless . . . under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 289 (citations and internal quotations omitted). \"Generally, [the court has] viewed the failure to ask for a continuance as an indication that defense counsel was himself satisfied he had sufficient opportunity to use the evidence advantageously.\" United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir. 1991). We also held that \"[a defendant's] claim that he was unfairly surprised is severely undermined, if not entirely undone, by his neglect to ask the district court for a continuance to meet the claimed exigency.\" United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, defendant never moved for a continuance as a result of the allegedly delayed disclosure. In light of this failure, combined with his failure to substantiate his assertion of impairment in defending his case with even a single concrete example, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the evidence in question to be admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Whether defendant was denied due process by the interference of the government with a key defense witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts are as follows. Defendant intended to call as a defense witness Isabelle Cesareo, the aunt of Ramon Cesareo, a prosecution witness who had made an agreement with the federal government in exchange for his testimony. Isabelle was to testify adversely on the credibility of her nephew. The prosecution sent three F.B.I. agents to Isabelle's home to speak with her. She was not home at the time, and the agents were only able to speak with her daughter. The daughter testified that the agents questioned her about whether defense counsel had been in contact with her mother; told her that unless served with a subpoena, her mother was under no obligation to testify; and said that her mother's testimony could adversely affect Ramon's agreement with the government. Isabelle, though seemingly reluctant to testify after the visit, ultimately did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court asked the prosecutor why F.B.I. agents had been sent to the home of a defense witness. She responded that the visit followed a report that the defense had been in contact with a witness. Ramon told the F.B.I. that, in an attempt to keep him from testifying, defense counsel had visited members of his family and told them that he, Ramon, would be the only government witness to take the stand against defendant at trial. The prosecutor claimed that the visit to Isabelle's home was simply an attempt to corroborate Ramon's statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was presented with three issues: (1) the reason that the prosecution sent agents to the witness's home; (2) whether the visit was improper; and (3) whether the visit affected the testimony given by the witness. The district court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e do find after hearing Mrs. Cesareo and her daughter that this witness is not hostile to the defendant. She is willing to testified [sic]. Her testimony in court this morning was frank, honest and the Court has no reason to be concerned about it, as far as what the defendant wishes her to testify about . . . . [W]e do find that in substance the visit by these agents, although, in the Court's opinion not the best practice without notifying counsel . . . we do find that it has not in any way affected the right of the defendant to bring this witness via a subpoena to have her testify candidly like she is prepared to do and the Court corroborated that this morning and, therefore, the defendant's rights have not been affected in any way. Mrs. Cesareo is here in court. She will be a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant asserts that the prosecution sent the agents to Isabelle's home in order to encourage her not to testify, and that, even though she ultimately did testify, she had been \"changed from a willing participant in the court proceeding to a highly reluctant and scared participant.\" This interference, defendant argues, constitutes a denial of due process. Defendant does not specify what parts of Isabelle's testimony would have been different had the prosecution not contacted her. The government points out that the agents never actually spoke with Isabelle or entered into a discussion as to whether she should testify. Finally, the government argues that, even were the prosecutor's visit found to have been improper, the defendant was not prejudiced since, in the end, Isabelle did take the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If any improprieties surrounding the prosecution's contact with the witness are found, we must determine whether that interference constituted reversible error. See Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 236 (1941) (holding that \"[a]s applied to a criminal trial, denial of due process is the failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice. In order to declare a denial of it we must find that the absence of that fairness fatally infected the trial; the acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial.\"); see also United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993) (holding that an appeals court's authority to reverse a district court decision is contingent upon the error being prejudicial). Regardless of whether actual prejudice is required, defendant has failed to prove a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take a dim view of government agents gratuitously confronting a defense witness out of court before the witness testifies. See Kines v. Butterworth, 669 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1981) (holding that \"when the free choice of a potential witness to talk to defense counsel is constrained by the prosecution without justification, this constitutes improper interference with a defendant's right of access to the witness. Justification on the part of the prosecution to interfere with that right can be shown only by the clearest and most compelling considerations.\"). In the present case, however, there is nothing in the record indicating that the testimony would have been different or more exonerating if the agents had not talked to the witness's daughter. We are, therefore, bound to uphold the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Whether the government proved a continuing conspiracy or only multiple conspiracies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part of the conspiracy for which defendant was convicted involved the operation of a drug point after 1995. Defendant was incarcerated from January, 1995, through April, 1997, and denies having participated in any conspiracy during that time. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove the existence of only a single conspiracy and that he thus should not be held liable for any of the transactions that took place after the start of his incarceration. Defendant further asserts that, because there is no evidence connecting him with any conspiracy after the start of his incarceration, no evidence having to do with the operation of the drug point subsequent to his incarceration should have been admitted. In support of this contention, he points to evidence suggesting that, while he was in jail, the drug point in question came to be controlled by another organization of which he was not a member, and that certain members of his conspiracy were also members of another conspiracy. This, he argues, shows the existence of multiple conspiracies rather than just a single conspiracy. If, as defendant contends, multiple conspiracies existed, the criminal activities for which he could be held responsible would be greatly reduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a series of events constitutes a single conspiracy is a question of fact, reviewed for sufficiency of evidence. We held in United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d 664, 667 (1st Cir. 1996), that \"[w]hether the evidence adduced at trial established one or more conspiracies [is] a question of fact for the jury.\" \"It is a recurring question in conspiracy cases whether related illegal agreements comprise one conspiracy or several. Because the agreements are often not explicit and are regularly inferred from conduct, the courts ordinarily treat the issue as one of fact and offer various criteria that might help the factfinder distinguish . . . .\" United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 629 (1st Cir. 1992). \"[A] single conspiracy may exist where there has been no direct contact among some of the participants . . . . Moreover, [t]he fact that every defendant did not participate in every transaction necessary to fulfill the aim of their agreement does not transform a continuing plan into multiple conspiracies.\" United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1033 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing a jury's finding concerning the number of conspiracies, \"where . . . there is no challenge to the jury instructions, we review the jury's conclusion as to whether one or more conspiracies existed only for evidentiary sufficiency.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence suggesting multiple conspiracies to which defendant refers in his appeal is only tangentially related to the issue presented to this court: whether there is sufficient evidence in the record upon which a reasonable jury could have found that the conspiracy to distribute drugs continued after defendant was incarcerated. That there may be some evidence suggesting the existence of multiple conspiracies does not change the fact that this court cannot reverse the jury's verdict (which rested upon a finding of a single conspiracy) absent a determination that no reasonable jury could have come to this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is replete with evidence allowing for a finding of a single conspiracy that continued beyond the start of defendant's incarceration. During the three months of trial, witness after witness provided testimony demonstrating the impeccable organization of the conspiracy - everything from the color of the packaging used for the drugs, to the preferred car models stolen for use in drive-by shootings, to the particular kinds of firearms members were permitted to carry in various situations - all of which was under defendant's control. There was even a reference made to a designation of which specific members of the conspiracy would be allowed to make decisions at a meeting that took place during a period in which defendant was briefly incarcerated. Based on all of this testimony demonstrating the rock-solid, intricately designed organizational structure of the conspiracy, there is no basis to find that the jury was unreasonable in coming to the conclusion that the conspiracy continued after defendant was imprisoned and that he continued to play a major role in its operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Whether the proof at trial varied from the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant claims to have had inadequate notice of the conduct for which he was charged. He argues that the prosecution, without indicating in the indictment that it was going to do so, introduced evidence that, as part of the conspiracy, he (1) was involved in the murder of Maria Magdalena Gotay, the sister of one of the prosecution's key witnesses; and (2) supervised the drug point at the housing project while he was incarcerated. Defendant asserts that these unforeseen accusations represent a variance between the indictment and the proof adduced at trial. The prosecution asserts that it is not required to prove the commission of any overt act in furtherance of a 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 drug conspiracy and that therefore it was not required to list any overt acts in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant raised a nearly identical argument before the district court in a motion to suppress. The district court denied the motion, rejecting defendant's claims of unconstitutional variance and insufficient notice. With respect to the variance assertion, the district court held that \"what defendants fail to recognize is that the indictment charged defendants with conspiracy, not murder. The use of this testimony regarding the murder is merely another overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and not an additional charge for the murder itself.\" The district court then rejected the insufficient notice claim, pointing out that \"the Government was not even required to supply the defendants with the name of the witness who [would] testify about this murder prior to the trial.\" In his appeal to this court, defendant reasserts the argument he made to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 provides that \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\" In United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 13 (1994), the Supreme Court stated that \"[t]he language of neither [the original conspiracy statute of the Comprehensive Drug Act of 1970 nor the version amended by the Anti-Drug Act of 1988] requires that an overt act be committed to further the conspiracy, and we have not inferred such a requirement from congressional silence in other conspiracy statutes.\" We held in Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d at 669, that \"[t]he government is not required to plead or prove any overt act in furtherance of a section 846 conspiracy. Although overt acts are gratuitously set forth in the indictment, the government is not limited at trial to proof of the alleged overt acts; nor is the indictment rendered insufficient for failure to plead other overt acts.\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the applicable case law, it is clear that defendant has no basis for asserting that there was a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The government made promises of value to witnesses for their testimony in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c)(2) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 201(c)(2) (2000) provides that \"[w]hoever . . . directly or indirectly, gives, offers, or promises anything of value to any person, for or because of the testimony under oath or affirmation given or to be given by such person as a witness upon a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, before any court . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.\" Defendant contends that the government violated this statute by agreeing, in return for the witnesses' testimony, not to prosecute one witness, and to support a reduction in a sentence for another. We heard and unequivocally rejected this argument in United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 197-98 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 432 (1999):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e make our position explicit and unqualified. There are several reasons why section 201(c)(2) cannot be invoked as a bright-line barrier to the government's use of witnesses whose cooperation has been secured by agreements not to prosecute or by promises of recommended leniency. The most basic reason is that section 201(c)(2) does not apply at all to the federal sovereign qua prosecutor. After all, statutes of general purport do not apply to the United States unless Congress makes the application clear and indisputable, and Congress has taken no such steps in respect to this statute. Reliance on this tenet is particularly apt where, as here, the failure to honor it would divest the government of a long-established prerogative and, in the bargain, lead to an eccentric result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).

Defendant argues that this testimony was based on hearsay, that it was an opinion concerning an ultimate issue that had to be determined by the jury, that it was not \"helpful\" as required by section (b) of the rule, and that it seriously prejudiced his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that because of Gotay's heavy involvement with the competing drug point at the housing project, her participation in a meeting in which defendant mentioned the benefits of joining his operation, her first-hand knowledge of how drug trafficking organizations operated, and her witnessing of her sister's murder, she was in a position to give an opinion as to why her sister was killed. The government contends that her testimony was helpful because it helped the jury understand the motive behind the murder and how the act furthered the interests of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 156 (1st Cir. 1989), we reiterated the generally accepted rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The admissibility of lay opinion testimony pursuant to Rule 701 is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the trial judge's admission of such testimony will not be overturned unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pointed out that \"[t]he modern trend favors the admission of opinion testimony provided it is well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible to cross-examination.\" Id. at 157; see also United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 107 F.3d 960, 968 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v.

Under the applicable law and the facts to which she testified, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Gotay to state her opinion as to why her sister was killed. In all events, given the strength of the government's case against defendant, any error in the admission of this evidence was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. Whether the search warrant for defendant's apartment was invalid because it failed to correctly identify the apartment to be searched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that an erroneous address on the warrant invalidated it. He further argued that even if the warrant was valid, it should not have issued because it was not supported by probable cause. The district court did reach the merits of the motion to suppress but dismissed it on the ground that it was untimely. Although we do not entirely disagree with the district court as to the timeliness of the motion, we prefer to decide the issue on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We held in United States v. Vigeant, 176 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999), that \"[w]e review the question of probable cause de novo, assessing the information provided in the four corners of the affidavit supporting the warrant application\" and that \"probable cause exists when the affidavit upon which a warrant is founded demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been committed . . . .\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Probable cause, in the context of granting a search warrant, requires no more than the existence of a \"fair probability\" that evidence of a crime will be found. United States v. Grant, 218 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts leading to the warrant are as follows. Edwin Nunez Cotto, an officer in the drugs and narcotics division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified that while conducting surveillance of the building in which defendant lived, he had seen individuals who appeared to be transporting weapons and other individuals positioned on the roof, apparently as lookouts. These observations led Nunez to conclude that \"they were protecting something in defendant's apartment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues in his brief that the warrant was not supported by probable cause. He states: \"Where information is supplied by a confidential informant to a police officer, the informant, in general, must be shown to have an adequate basis of knowledge and a background demonstrating reliability.\" This is a substantially correct statement of the law but there is nothing in the record about information from a confidential informant. Rather, it seems clear that the warrant was issued based on the observations and conclusion of Officer Nunez. There can be little doubt that there was at least a \"fair probability,\" based on Nunez's observations, that evidence of a crime could be found. We rule that there was probable cause for issuing the search warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's final argument on this issue focuses on an incorrect address given in the warrant. The warrant mistakenly described the apartment to be searched as building 44, apartment 446. Defendant's address was in fact building 45, apartment 446, and that was the only premises searched. Officer Nunez, who made the observations that were the basis for issuing the warrant and was its executing officer, was also a member of the search team.

He contends that the search of his apartment was thus improper, and that any evidence found as a result of the search should be suppressed. Defendant asserts that the warrant allowed the police to undertake wide-ranging general searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that there was a great probability that the wrong apartment would be searched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We held in United States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 866-67 (1st Cir. 1986), that \"[t]he manifest purpose of the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is to prevent wide-ranging general searches by the police\" and that \"[t]he test for determining the adequacy of the description of the location to be searched is whether the description is sufficient to enable the executing officer to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort, and whether there is any reasonable probability that another premise might be mistakenly searched.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The warrant in Bonner was held to be valid despite its omission of the house number, because it included an adequate description of the premises to be searched and because, as in the present case, an agent who had been involved with surveillance of the house had accompanied the search team. The incorrect address did not invalidate the warrant where \"[t]here was no risk that federal agents would be confused and stumble into the wrong house, or would take advantage of their unforeseeable windfall and search houses indiscriminately, . . . .\" Id. at 866.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that the warrant was properly issued and executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. Whether the district court omitted key instructions from the instruction on a continuing criminal enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant asserts that the district court's charge to the jury was deficient in that it failed to (1) define the meaning of the terms \"organizer,\" \"supervisor\" and \"manager,\" (2) instruct the jury on what was meant by acting \"in concert or together with\" five or more other persons,\" (3) instruct as to which individuals were countable in the \"five or more other persons,\" and (4) sufficiently communicate the need of the jury to unanimously identify each underlying violation. He argues in the alternative that the failure to object on this issue constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendant did not raise any of these objections after the charge and before the jury started deliberations, we review the district court's instructions for plain error. In United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993), the Supreme Court defined this standard of review as requiring \"an 'error' that is 'plain' and that 'affect[s] substantial rights.' . . . Moreover, Rule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution argues that a district court has no obligation to define terms generally understood by the average person and that therefore defendant's first two claims are meritless. We agree with the government's argument in this regard. See United States v. De LaCruz, 902 F.2d 121, 123 (1st Cir. 1990). Regarding the third claim, the prosecution notes that there were nine defendants at trial (the tenth having pled guilty) and that it thus went without saying who could be counted. As to the final claim, the prosecution asserts that the district court was clear in indicating that the jury had to unanimously agree on which three violations constituted the series of three or more violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's charge to the jury on Count 1 of the indictment, the continuing criminal enterprise charge, was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count 1 of the indictment two of the defendants are charged, Jose Vega Figueroa and Carlos Hernandez Vega. The law makes it a federal crime or offense for anyone to engage in what is called a continuing criminal enterprise involving controlled substances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that the defendants violated Section 841(a)(1) as charged in the indictment. This is the drug trafficking case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that such violations were part of a continuing series of violations as herein after defined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, that such continuing series of violations were undertaken by the defendants in concert or together with at least five or more other persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, that the defendant occupied the position of an organizer, supervisor or manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, that the defendant obtained substantial income or resources in the continuing series of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A continuing series of violations means proof of at least three violations under the Federal controlled substances law, as charged in Count 1 of the indictment, and also requires a finding that those violations were connected together as a series of related or ongoing activities as distinguished from isolated and disconnected acts. You must unanimously agree on which three violations constitute the series of three or more violations in order to find the essential element of No. 2 of this offense has been proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must also be proved that the defendants engaged in the continuing series of violations with at least five or more persons, whether or not those persons are named in the indictment and whether or not the same five or more persons participated in each of the violations, or participated at different times. And, it must be proved that the defendant's relationship with the other five or more persons was that of organizers, supervisors or managers - that the defendant's relationship with the other five or more persons was that of organizer, supervisor or manager, and that the defendant was more than a fellow worker and either organized or directed the activities of the others, whether the defendant was the only organizer or supervisor or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it must be proved that the defendant obtained substantial income or resources from the continuing series of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the language of the charge, we cannot conclude that the instructions on this issue were defective, much less plainly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's alternative claim - that the failure to object on this issue constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel - depends on whether we find any merit in his argument that the jury instructions were flawed. Because we find that the jury instructions were not flawed, we do not discuss defendant's alternate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10.

In response, the district court instructed the jury to wait until the government had presented its case-in-chief and that if, at that time, it still wished to see the scene, it should renew its request at that time. Defendant asserts that this request demonstrates that the jury had been deliberating and weighing the evidence before all of the evidence had been presented, and that the court erred in failing to remind the jury that it was not within its province to determine what evidence it should consider. Because defendant did not raise this objection during trial, we review the district court's failure to so instruct for plain error. SeeOlano, 507 U.S. at 732.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows the jury was instructed at the beginning of the trial that they should not discuss the case until instructed to do so, and that the court concluded every session by warning the jury: \"Do not discuss the case with anyone,\" or \"Do not discuss it among yourselves or with anyone.\" We do not think that the desire of the jury to view a drug point is any indication that it disregarded the court's repeated and explicit instructions and engaged in improper deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count II was subsequently dismissed.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Vega-Figueroa, along with eight other defendants, was tried pursuant to a three-count indictment in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico for drug related activities. The indictment charged as follows: Count I, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848(a) and (b), continuing criminal enterprise, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, aiding and abetting; Count II, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of heroin, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine, in excess of five kilograms of cocaine base and in excess of 100 kilograms of marijuana; and Count III, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) &amp; (2), unlawful use of firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense and aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All nine of the defendants who stood trial were found guilty on all or some of the counts.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment on Counts I and II of the indictment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and a term of five years on Count III, to be served consecutively. Defendant has raised ten issues on appeal, which we will discuss in the order followed in his brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. See United States v.

This rehearsal of the evidence does not, of course, cover the facts that are applicable only to other defendants. Nor do we recite, at this juncture, all of the facts involving defendant. Many of the facts pertaining to particular issues will be set forth in our discussion of the issues. All we do now is state those facts that will give the reader the necessary background information to understand the different issues raised by defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and Carlos Hernandez-Vega were in charge of an extensive criminal enterprise involving the sale and distribution of heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana. Cooperating witnesses for the government included five former members of the enterprise who sold narcotics for the organization. Their testimony can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and/or Hernandez-Vega delivered the drugs to the various cooperating witnesses at the drug point, located in a public housing project. Members of the enterprise carjacked automobiles on a regular basis. The carjacked vehicles were then used for drive-by shootings targeted against other drug dealers who operated drug points in other public housing units in competition with defendant and Hernandez-Vega. The drug distribution point of the enterprise was guarded by armed members of the organization. There was also testimony that defendant and Hernandez-Vega operated a heroin drug point located within the Hogar Crea detention and drug rehabilitation facility in Saint Just at Trujuillo Alto, Puerto Rico. Another drug gang ousted two members of defendant's organization from the Hogar Crea drug point. Defendant and Hernandez-Vega ordered that the two men who had taken over the Hogar Crea drug point be murdered. The men were ambushed and killed by defendant, Hernandez-Vega, and other members of defendant's enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged that the continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy started on or about August 1, 1990, and continued until on or about April 10, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issues are essentially stated as phrased by defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Whether a statement made by defendant while in custody should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being arrested, defendant, along with other codefendants, was taken into custody to be interrogated, photographed, and finger-printed. Before any police interrogation started, another arrestee, Medina-Sanchez, asked defendant if he had been arrested for running a criminal enterprise and supervising a drug point. Defendant replied \"that was before . . . about the drug point . . . now I only supervise the kitchen. . . .\" In the parlance of the drug trade a \"kitchen\" is that part of a drug operation in which the drugs are prepared for sale. Unfortunately for defendant, two federal agents overheard the conversation and included it in their report. The statement was used against defendant at trial. Defendant contends \"that the statement should have been suppressed because (1) he should have been warned of his constitutional rights under Miranda and (2) the statement was not voluntarily made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying defendant's motion to suppress, the district court examined the totality of the circumstances and found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t is clear that the statements which defendant made while waiting to be booked at the Federal Building were indeed voluntary. Defendant merely responded to questioning from another arrestee. Although he was being closely supervised by various agents who were present to ensure that things were under control, those agents did not address him directly, except to allegedly ask him routine questions, such as his name, nickname, prior employment, and whether he had any addiction problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our prior case law establishes the standard of review. We held in United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599284\"><a href=\"/opinion/599284/united-states-v-jean-m-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 n.5 (1stCir. 1993), that \"[n]ormally, 'clear error' is the standard employed in reviewing findings of fact. In the present case, however, none of the relevant facts are in dispute . . . . Thus, the determination as to whether police 'interrogation' occurred depends on the totality of the circumstances, a balancing analysis commonly considered amenable to plenary review\" (citations omitted). We held in United States v. Sealey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195505\"><a href=\"/opinion/195505/united-states-v-sealey/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 1994), that \"[i]n scrutinizing a district court's denial of a suppression motion, the court of appeals will review findings of fact for clear error, while at the same time subjecting the trial court's ultimate constitutional conclusions to plenary oversight.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party here disputes the circumstances surrounding defendant's statement. The only questions presented for review are whether the district court erred in holding that defendant's statements were voluntary and that the custodial situation did not amount to the functional equivalent of an interrogation. Because these issues involve questions of law, we apply plenary review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we reject defendant's argument that he was entitled to Miranda warnings. In order for Miranda rights to be invoked, there must be (1) custody and (2) interrogation. SeeUnited States v. Ventura, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196786\"><a href=\"/opinion/196786/united-states-v-fernandez-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 709-10 (1st Cir. 1996). It is undisputed that defendant was in custody at the time of his statement. Because he does not allege that there was ever an actual interrogation, the crux of his appeal hinges on whether the environment within which defendant made the statement amounted to the functional equivalent of an interrogation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court discussed the concept of the functional equivalent of an interrogation in Rhode Island v. Innis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span> (1980), holding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term \"interrogation\" under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect . . . . A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 300-01 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, defendant alleges only that the police performed their routine activities of fingerprinting and photographing him and other defendants. He points to no words or actions on the part of the federal agents that were likely to elicit his incriminating words about \"supervising the kitchen.\" Hence, there is nothing to support his contention that he experienced the functional equivalent of interrogation such that Miranda warnings were warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the district court err in holding that defendant's statements were voluntary. The Supreme Court has held that \"[t]he admissibility of the respondent's statement as a constitutional matter [is] governed . . . by the contemporary case law elaborating the due process standard of voluntariness. The question [is] whether the will of the defendant had been overborne so that the statement was not his free and voluntary act, and that question [is] to be resolved in light of the totality of the circumstances.\" Procunier v. Atchley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108231\"><a href=\"/opinion/108231/procunier-v-atchley/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, 453 (1971); see also United States v. Melendez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199106\"><a href=\"/opinion/199106/united-states-v-melendez-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that Miranda has no force outside of interrogations where interrogators do not have the \"capacity to dominate the scene to such an extent that the risks of coercion and intimidation are unreasonably high\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the applicable case law to the undisputed facts of the circumstances surrounding defendant's statement, we have no difficulty finding that the statement was his free and voluntary act. Defendant's statement was not the result of intimidation, coercion resulting from the setting in which the statement was made, or a deliberate plan by the agents to place defendant in an environment that would induce a confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether defendant was denied a fair trial by the failure of the government to disclose information in its possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant asserts that the government was untimely in its disclosure of two pieces of evidence - rough notes taken by F.B.I. agents for use in preparing a report, and photographs used to question a key witness - and that he was therefore impaired in his ability to defend. The district court permitted the introduction of both of these pieces of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant presents extensive case law discussing the government's obligation, under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(c), to disclose documents \"which are material to the preparation of the defendant's defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial. . ..\" He does not specify, however, how his ability to defend the case was impaired, or how he would have altered his defense had the allegedly untimely information been disclosed earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the notes, defendant seems to argue that he hoped that by viewing copies of the notes used in writing the F.B.I. report, he would be able to show inconsistencies between the agents' testimony and the report. The district court was unconvinced that defendant even needed to survey the notes at all, noting that defendant had access to the actual report, as well as an opportunity to cross-examine the agents who had prepared the report, during which defendant could have attempted to unearth all of the same alleged inconsistencies that he hoped to bring to light in viewing the notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the photographs, defendant contends that his defense was impaired by the government's failure to timely disclose the photos. The district court allowed the photos to be used at trial even though they had not previously been disclosed to defendant, on the ground that the photos were used exclusively for identification purposes. The photos were presented to a witness whose description of a third party had been called into question by the defense, in order to verify that he was able to identify the correct person. Implicit in the district court's decision is a finding that because the photos were only used to clarify an identification, an identification that defendant was well aware would take place, the delayed disclosure did not impair defendant's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We held in United States v.

Whether defendant was denied due process by the interference of the government with a key defense witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential facts are as follows. Defendant intended to call as a defense witness Isabelle Cesareo, the aunt of Ramon Cesareo, a prosecution witness who had made an agreement with the federal government in exchange for his testimony. Isabelle was to testify adversely on the credibility of her nephew. The prosecution sent three F.B.I. agents to Isabelle's home to speak with her. She was not home at the time, and the agents were only able to speak with her daughter. The daughter testified that the agents questioned her about whether defense counsel had been in contact with her mother; told her that unless served with a subpoena, her mother was under no obligation to testify; and said that her mother's testimony could adversely affect Ramon's agreement with the government. Isabelle, though seemingly reluctant to testify after the visit, ultimately did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court asked the prosecutor why F.B.I. agents had been sent to the home of a defense witness. She responded that the visit followed a report that the defense had been in contact with a witness. Ramon told the F.B.I. that, in an attempt to keep him from testifying, defense counsel had visited members of his family and told them that he, Ramon, would be the only government witness to take the stand against defendant at trial. The prosecutor claimed that the visit to Isabelle's home was simply an attempt to corroborate Ramon's statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was presented with three issues: (1) the reason that the prosecution sent agents to the witness's home; (2) whether the visit was improper; and (3) whether the visit affected the testimony given by the witness. The district court held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e do find after hearing Mrs. Cesareo and her daughter that this witness is not hostile to the defendant. She is willing to testified [sic]. Her testimony in court this morning was frank, honest and the Court has no reason to be concerned about it, as far as what the defendant wishes her to testify about . . . . [W]e do find that in substance the visit by these agents, although, in the Court's opinion not the best practice without notifying counsel . . . we do find that it has not in any way affected the right of the defendant to bring this witness via a subpoena to have her testify candidly like she is prepared to do and the Court corroborated that this morning and, therefore, the defendant's rights have not been affected in any way. Mrs. Cesareo is here in court. She will be a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant asserts that the prosecution sent the agents to Isabelle's home in order to encourage her not to testify, and that, even though she ultimately did testify, she had been \"changed from a willing participant in the court proceeding to a highly reluctant and scared participant.\" This interference, defendant argues, constitutes a denial of due process. Defendant does not specify what parts of Isabelle's testimony would have been different had the prosecution not contacted her. The government points out that the agents never actually spoke with Isabelle or entered into a discussion as to whether she should testify. Finally, the government argues that, even were the prosecutor's visit found to have been improper, the defendant was not prejudiced since, in the end, Isabelle did take the stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If any improprieties surrounding the prosecution's contact with the witness are found, we must determine whether that interference constituted reversible error. See Lisenba v. California, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></span>, 236 (1941) (holding that \"[a]s applied to a criminal trial, denial of due process is the failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice. In order to declare a denial of it we must find that the absence of that fairness fatally infected the trial; the acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial.\"); see also United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 733 (1993) (holding that an appeals court's authority to reverse a district court decision is contingent upon the error being prejudicial). Regardless of whether actual prejudice is required, defendant has failed to prove a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take a dim view of government agents gratuitously confronting a defense witness out of court before the witness testifies. See Kines v. Butterworth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398894\"><a href=\"/opinion/398894/bobby-ray-kines-v-fred-butterworth-ronald-st-pierre-v-fred-butterworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir. 1981) (holding that \"when the free choice of a potential witness to talk to defense counsel is constrained by the prosecution without justification, this constitutes improper interference with a defendant's right of access to the witness. Justification on the part of the prosecution to interfere with that right can be shown only by the clearest and most compelling considerations.\"). In the present case, however, there is nothing in the record indicating that the testimony would have been different or more exonerating if the agents had not talked to the witness's daughter. We are, therefore, bound to uphold the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

Defendant was incarcerated from January, 1995, through April, 1997, and denies having participated in any conspiracy during that time. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove the existence of only a single conspiracy and that he thus should not be held liable for any of the transactions that took place after the start of his incarceration. Defendant further asserts that, because there is no evidence connecting him with any conspiracy after the start of his incarceration, no evidence having to do with the operation of the drug point subsequent to his incarceration should have been admitted. In support of this contention, he points to evidence suggesting that, while he was in jail, the drug point in question came to be controlled by another organization of which he was not a member, and that certain members of his conspiracy were also members of another conspiracy. This, he argues, shows the existence of multiple conspiracies rather than just a single conspiracy. If, as defendant contends, multiple conspiracies existed, the criminal activities for which he could be held responsible would be greatly reduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a series of events constitutes a single conspiracy is a question of fact, reviewed for sufficiency of evidence.

Randazzo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></span>, 629 (1st Cir. 1992). \"[A] single conspiracy may exist where there has been no direct contact among some of the participants . . . . Moreover, [t]he fact that every defendant did not participate in every transaction necessary to fulfill the aim of their agreement does not transform a continuing plan into multiple conspiracies.\" United States v. Mena-Robles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194956\"><a href=\"/opinion/194956/united-states-v-mena-robles/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1033 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing a jury's finding concerning the number of conspiracies, \"where . . . there is no challenge to the jury instructions, we review the jury's conclusion as to whether one or more conspiracies existed only for evidentiary sufficiency.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence suggesting multiple conspiracies to which defendant refers in his appeal is only tangentially related to the issue presented to this court: whether there is sufficient evidence in the record upon which a reasonable jury could have found that the conspiracy to distribute drugs continued after defendant was incarcerated. That there may be some evidence suggesting the existence of multiple conspiracies does not change the fact that this court cannot reverse the jury's verdict (which rested upon a finding of a single conspiracy) absent a determination that no reasonable jury could have come to this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is replete with evidence allowing for a finding of a single conspiracy that continued beyond the start of defendant's incarceration. During the three months of trial, witness after witness provided testimony demonstrating the impeccable organization of the conspiracy - everything from the color of the packaging used for the drugs, to the preferred car models stolen for use in drive-by shootings, to the particular kinds of firearms members were permitted to carry in various situations - all of which was under defendant's control. There was even a reference made to a designation of which specific members of the conspiracy would be allowed to make decisions at a meeting that took place during a period in which defendant was briefly incarcerated. Based on all of this testimony demonstrating the rock-solid, intricately designed organizational structure of the conspiracy, there is no basis to find that the jury was unreasonable in coming to the conclusion that the conspiracy continued after defendant was imprisoned and that he continued to play a major role in its operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.

He argues that the prosecution, without indicating in the indictment that it was going to do so, introduced evidence that, as part of the conspiracy, he (1) was involved in the murder of Maria Magdalena Gotay, the sister of one of the prosecution's key witnesses; and (2) supervised the drug point at the housing project while he was incarcerated. Defendant asserts that these unforeseen accusations represent a variance between the indictment and the proof adduced at trial. The prosecution asserts that it is not required to prove the commission of any overt act in furtherance of a 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 drug conspiracy and that therefore it was not required to list any overt acts in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant raised a nearly identical argument before the district court in a motion to suppress. The district court denied the motion, rejecting defendant's claims of unconstitutional variance and insufficient notice. With respect to the variance assertion, the district court held that \"what defendants fail to recognize is that the indictment charged defendants with conspiracy, not murder. The use of this testimony regarding the murder is merely another overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and not an additional charge for the murder itself.\" The district court then rejected the insufficient notice claim, pointing out that \"the Government was not even required to supply the defendants with the name of the witness who [would] testify about this murder prior to the trial.\" In his appeal to this court, defendant reasserts the argument he made to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 provides that \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\" In United States v.

The most basic reason is that section 201(c)(2) does not apply at all to the federal sovereign qua prosecutor. After all, statutes of general purport do not apply to the United States unless Congress makes the application clear and indisputable, and Congress has taken no such steps in respect to this statute. Reliance on this tenet is particularly apt where, as here, the failure to honor it would divest the government of a long-established prerogative and, in the bargain, lead to an eccentric result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).

The warrant mistakenly described the apartment to be searched as building 44, apartment 446. Defendant's address was in fact building 45, apartment 446, and that was the only premises searched. Officer Nunez, who made the observations that were the basis for issuing the warrant and was its executing officer, was also a member of the search team. He correctly directed the team to defendant's apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that, because of the address mistake, his apartment was not \"particularly described\" in the warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. He contends that the search of his apartment was thus improper, and that any evidence found as a result of the search should be suppressed. Defendant asserts that the warrant allowed the police to undertake wide-ranging general searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that there was a great probability that the wrong apartment would be searched.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We held in United States v. Bonner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481318\"><a href=\"/opinion/481318/united-states-v-russell-bonner-united-states-of-america-v-wayne-bonner/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 866-67 (1st Cir. 1986), that \"[t]he manifest purpose of the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is to prevent wide-ranging general searches by the police\" and that \"[t]he test for determining the adequacy of the description of the location to be searched is whether the description is sufficient to enable the executing officer to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort, and whether there is any reasonable probability that another premise might be mistakenly searched.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The warrant in Bonner was held to be valid despite its omission of the house number, because it included an adequate description of the premises to be searched and because, as in the present case, an agent who had been involved with surveillance of the house had accompanied the search team. The incorrect address did not invalidate the warrant where \"[t]here was no risk that federal agents would be confused and stumble into the wrong house, or would take advantage of their unforeseeable windfall and search houses indiscriminately, . . . .\" Id. at 866.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that the warrant was properly issued and executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. Whether the district court omitted key instructions from the instruction on a continuing criminal enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant asserts that the district court's charge to the jury was deficient in that it failed to (1) define the meaning of the terms \"organizer,\" \"supervisor\" and \"manager,\" (2) instruct the jury on what was meant by acting \"in concert or together with\" five or more other persons,\" (3) instruct as to which individuals were countable in the \"five or more other persons,\" and (4) sufficiently communicate the need of the jury to unanimously identify each underlying violation. He argues in the alternative that the failure to object on this issue constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendant did not raise any of these objections after the charge and before the jury started deliberations, we review the district court's instructions for plain error. In United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732 (1993), the Supreme Court defined this standard of review as requiring \"an 'error' that is 'plain' and that 'affect[s] substantial rights.' . . . Moreover, Rule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution argues that a district court has no obligation to define terms generally understood by the average person and that therefore defendant's first two claims are meritless. We agree with the government's argument in this regard. See United States v. De LaCruz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540778\"><a href=\"/opinion/540778/united-states-v-jose-manuel-de-la-cruz-aka-jose-manuel-linares-de-la/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir. 1990). Regarding the third claim, the prosecution notes that there were nine defendants at trial (the tenth having pled guilty) and that it thus went without saying who could be counted. As to the final claim, the prosecution asserts that the district court was clear in indicating that the jury had to unanimously agree on which three violations constituted the series of three or more violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's charge to the jury on Count 1 of the indictment, the continuing criminal enterprise charge, was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Count 1 of the indictment two of the defendants are charged, Jose Vega Figueroa and Carlos Hernandez Vega. The law makes it a federal crime or offense for anyone to engage in what is called a continuing criminal enterprise involving controlled substances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that the defendants violated Section 841(a)(1) as charged in the indictment. This is the drug trafficking case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that such violations were part of a continuing series of violations as herein after defined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, that such continuing series of violations were undertaken by the defendants in concert or together with at least five or more other persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, that the defendant occupied the position of an organizer, supervisor or manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, that the defendant obtained substantial income or resources in the continuing series of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A continuing series of violations means proof of at least three violations under the Federal controlled substances law, as charged in Count 1 of the indictment, and also requires a finding that those violations were connected together as a series of related or ongoing activities as distinguished from isolated and disconnected acts. You must unanimously agree on which three violations constitute the series of three or more violations in order to find the essential element of No. 2 of this offense has been proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must also be proved that the defendants engaged in the continuing series of violations with at least five or more persons, whether or not those persons are named in the indictment and whether or not the same five or more persons participated in each of the violations, or participated at different times. And, it must be proved that the defendant's relationship with the other five or more persons was that of organizers, supervisors or managers - that the defendant's relationship with the other five or more persons was that of organizer, supervisor or manager, and that the defendant was more than a fellow worker and either organized or directed the activities of the others, whether the defendant was the only organizer or supervisor or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it must be proved that the defendant obtained substantial income or resources from the continuing series of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the language of the charge, we cannot conclude that the instructions on this issue were defective, much less plainly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's alternative claim - that the failure to object on this issue constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel - depends on whether we find any merit in his argument that the jury instructions were flawed. Because we find that the jury instructions were not flawed, we do not discuss defendant's alternate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. Whether the jury engaged in improper deliberations prior to the closing of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, the jury requested to see the scene of the two murders at Hogar Crea, a drug detention and rehabilitation facility where members of the conspiracy had set up a second drug point. In response, the district court instructed the jury to wait until the government had presented its case-in-chief and that if, at that time, it still wished to see the scene, it should renew its request at that time. Defendant asserts that this request demonstrates that the jury had been deliberating and weighing the evidence before all of the evidence had been presented, and that the court erred in failing to remind the jury that it was not within its province to determine what evidence it should consider. Because defendant did not raise this objection during trial, we review the district court's failure to so instruct for plain error. SeeOlano, 507 U.S. at 732.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows the jury was instructed at the beginning of the trial that they should not discuss the case until instructed to do so, and that the court concluded every session by warning the jury: \"Do not discuss the case with anyone,\" or \"Do not discuss it among yourselves or with anyone.\" We do not think that the desire of the jury to view a drug point is any indication that it disregarded the court's repeated and explicit instructions and engaged in improper deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count II was subsequently dismissed.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
