Defendants-appellants challenge\n\nthe district court's finding of guilt against them in one-count\n\ninformations for trespassing on a military installation in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1382. We reverse their convictions because the government\n\ndid not prove an essential element of its case.\n\n                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n          Appellants were arrested by Navy officials on April 27, 2001,\n\non Cayo Yayí, also known as Fisherman's Island, a small island about 75\n\nfeet off the shore of the live impact area1 of the Camp García Naval\n\nInstallation, which is located on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico.\n\nOn April 30, 2001, the government filed a one-count information against\n\neach of the appellants, charging them with entering, \"knowingly and\n\nunlawfully,\" upon Camp García, \"for any purpose prohibited by law or\n\nlawful regulation, that is, 32 C.F.R. Section 770.35 through 770.40,2\n\nwithout first having obtained permission from the Commanding Officer as\n\nrequired by the aforesaid regulations,\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n     1\n     The live impact area is a part of Camp García that receives\nbombs and ordnance in the course of military target practice.\n     2\n     Sections 770.35 through 770.40 of Title 32 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations set up entry restrictions and entry\nprocedures for enumerated naval installations and properties in\nPuerto Rico, including Camp García.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f1382. Section 1382 reads in relevant part as follows: \"Whoever, within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any military, naval,\n\nor Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or\n\ninstallation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation .\n\n. . [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six\n\nmonths, or both.\"       18 U.S.C. § 1382.\n\n              A bench trial was held on June 5, 2001. During the trial\n\ntestimony -- and at oral argument before us -- the government conceded\n\nthat Fisherman's Island was not United States property, despite its\n\nproximity to Camp García. At trial, however, the government introduced\n\nas evidence maps reflecting a \"danger zone,\" established by 33 C.F.R.\n\n§ 334.1470, which included the island within its boundaries. A danger\n\nzone is \"[a] defined water area         . . . used for target practice,\n\nbombing, rocket firing or other especially hazardous operations,\n\nnormally for the armed forces,\" and \"may be closed to the public on a\n\nfull-time or intermittent basis, as stated in the regulations.\" Id. §\n\n334.2(a).      The regulation creating the danger zone that includes\n\nFisherman's Island specifies that \"[i]t will be open to navigation at\n\nall   times    except   when   firing   is   being   conducted.\"   Id.   §\n\n334.1470(b)(1).\n\n              The government also introduced evidence that, on the day of\n\nthe arrests, Fisherman's Island was in a temporary \"security zone,\"\n\nestablished by 66 F.R. 22,121 (published May 3, 2001), effective from\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f3 p.m., April 26, 2001 until 11:59 p.m., April 30, 2001. \"A security\n\nzone is an area of land, water, or land and water which is so\n\ndesignated by the Captain of the Port or District Commander for such\n\ntime as necessary to prevent damage or injury to any vessel or\n\nwaterfront facility, to safeguard ports, harbors, territories, or\n\nwaters of the United States or to secure the observance of the rights\n\nand obligations of the United States.\" 33 C.F.R. § 165.30(a). The\n\nregulations provide that \"[n]o person or vessel may enter or remain in\n\na security zone without permission of the Captain of the Port.\" Id. §\n\n165.33(a). At trial appellants noted that 66 F.R. 22,121, although\n\ndated April 26, 2001, a day before their arrests, was published on May\n\n3, 2001.\n\n           At the close of the prosecution's case, appellants raised a\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure, stating that the government had failed to present\n\nevidence of certain necessary elements of the offense as charged in the\n\ninformations filed against them. Appellants argued in particular that\n\nthe informations charged them with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1382, for\n\nentering Camp García without authorization, but that the evidence\n\npresented only proved that they were on Fisherman's Island, not Camp\n\nGarcía, at the time of their arrests. The court denied the Rule 29\n\nmotion and, after the defense rested without presenting any evidence,\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fproceeded to find the appellants guilty of trespass in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382.    Thereafter, timely appeals were filed.\n\n          Before us, appellants essentially raise three arguments. The\n\nfirst is that Fisherman's Island was not part of a danger zone and/or\n\nsecurity zone that was duly activated and in effect on April 27, 2001\n\nand that the government therefore did not prove that it exerted control\n\nover Fisherman's Island sufficient to convict appellants of entering a\n\nnaval installation, as section 1382 requires. Second, appellants argue\n\nthat they did not have notice of the offense charged and therefore\n\nsimilarly could not be convicted under section 1382.      Their third\n\nargument posits that, to the extent that the government has not been\n\nable to show that the United States exerted control over Fisherman's\n\nIsland, the district court erred in denying appellants' Rule 29 motion,\n\nwhere the prosecution failed to prove any of the elements of the\n\noffense charged in the informations.\n\n          \"We review the district court's construction of a federal\n\nstatute de novo.\" United States v. Maxwell, 254 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2001). On the record before us, we find that the government failed to\n\nprove that appellants had actual or constructive notice that\n\nFisherman's Island was closed to public use on April 27, 2001, and that\n\nthe district court therefore erred in holding that their presence\n\nviolated section 1382. We accordingly reverse. Because we find that\n\nlack of notice in this case is sufficient to reverse appellants'\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fconvictions, we reach the other issues raised by appellants only to the\n\nextent they are necessary to set the groundwork for our holding on\n\nnotice.\n\n                            II. ANALYSIS\n\n          A conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1382 \"requires only that the\n\ngovernment demonstrate either a possessory interest in, or occupation\n\nor control of, the area reserved by the military,\" and not actual\n\ngovernment ownership of the area in question.        United States v.\n\nVentura-Meléndez, 275 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          It is now well-established under our case law that the\n\nexistence of a duly promulgated danger zone, encompassing the area in\n\nquestion, is sufficient to show occupation and control of the area by\n\nthe government. See United States v. Ayala Ayala, Nos. 01-2148, 01-\n\n2150, 01-2151, 01-2152, 2002 WL 723876, at *3-4 (1st Cir. Apr. 29,\n\n2002); United States v. Zenón-Rodríguez, Nos. 02-1207, 02-1208, 2002 WL\n\n729216, at *2-3 (1st Cir. Apr. 29, 2002); Ventura-Meléndez, 275 F.3d at\n\n17. It is uncontested here that Fisherman's Island was included in the\n\ndanger zone defined in 33 C.F.R. § 334.1470, and we therefore find\n\nthat, on April 27, 2001, appellants \"within the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States, [went] upon [a] . . . naval . . . installation,\" within\n\nthe meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1382.\n\n          The government further argues that 33 F.R. 22,121, the\n\npreviously mentioned regulation establishing a temporary security zone\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat incorporated Fisherman's Island and was in effect from 3 p.m.,\n\nApril 26, 2001 until 11:59 p.m., April 30, 2001, provided an additional\n\nand independent ground for finding that the government exerted control\n\nover the island during the dates in question.    See United States v.\n\nAllen, 924 F.2d 29, 31 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding that the designation of\n\na security zone is sufficient evidence that the Navy \"occupied and\n\ncontrolled\" the waters in question). In making this argument, the\n\ngovernment concedes that 33 F.R. 22,121 was published on May 3, 2001,\n\nafter the date on which appellants allegedly trespassed on Fisherman's\n\nIsland, but contends that the regulation was nevertheless duly\n\npromulgated because it was exempt\n\nfrom notice and comment rulemaking and advance publication, see 5\n\nU.S.C. § 553, under the military and/or good cause exceptions of 5\n\nU.S.C. § 553 (a)(1), (b)(B) and (d)(3).3 Without resolving the question\n\n\n     3Section 553 reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n     (a) This section applies, according to the provisions\n     thereof, except to the extent that there is involved\n     --\n          (1)a military or foreign affairs function of\n          the United States\n     . . . .\n     (b) General notice of proposed rule making shall be\n     published in the Federal Register . . .\n     Except when notice or hearing is required by statute,\n     this subsection does not apply --\n     . . .\n          (B) when the agency for good cause finds . .\n          . that notice and public procedure thereon\n          are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary\n          to the public interest.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fof whether the security zone in this case was properly promulgated --\n\nor the question of whether it was sufficient here to prove occupation\n\nand control by the Navy of Fisherman's Island -- we assume, arguendo,\n\nthat the security zone provided an additional way in which appellants\n\n\"within the jurisdiction of the United States, [went] upon [a] . . .\n\nnaval . . . installation,\" on April 27, 2001, within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382.   We move on to the question of notice.4\n\n\n     (c) After notice required by this section, the agency\n     shall give interested persons an opportunity to\n     participate in the rule making through submission of\n     written data, views, or arguments with or without\n     opportunity for oral presentation. . . .\n     (d) The required publication or service of a\n     substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days\n     before its effective date, except --\n     . . .\n          (3) as otherwise provided by the agency for\n          good cause found and published with the\n          rule.\n     . . .\n     4The government has additionally argued that Fisherman's\nIsland was closed to the public continuously, regardless of\nwhether there was live firing or a temporary security zone. At\ntrial, three Navy personnel testified variously that the Navy\nregularly patrolled and observed Fisherman's Island, that all\nthe offshore islands in close proximity to Camp García were\nconsidered under the control of the U.S. Navy, and that the only\nauthorized access to Fisherman's Island was through Camp García.\n(Appellants have argued in response that Fisherman's Island was\nused by the public for fishing and recreation, although we do\nnot see evidence of this use in the record.)         We find that,\nregardless of what the Navy's usual practice as to patrolling\nFisherman's Island or authorizing entry to the island may be,\nthe government cannot claim that the island was closed to the\npublic continuously, when it was undeniably within a danger zone\nthat is \"open to navigation at all times except when firing is being\nconducted.\" 33 C.F.R. § 334.1470 (discussed further in section A ,\n\n                                 -8-\n\fA. Constructive Notice\n\n          In order to establish a violation of section 1382, we must\n\nalso find that appellants entered the naval installation \"for any\n\npurpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1382.\n\n\"The requisite prohibited 'purpose' under section 1382 can consist of\n\nunauthorized entry itself. . . . On the other hand, when a section\n\n1382 prosecution proceeds on the basis that the defendant has entered\n\na restricted military reservation 'for the purpose of' unauthorized\n\nentry, we think it must be shown that the defendant had knowledge or\n\nnotice that such entry was, in fact, prohibited.\" United States v.\n\nParrilla Bonilla, 648 F.2d 1373, 1377 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          In this case, the regulation establishing the danger zone\n\nstates that the zone \"will be open to navigation at all times except\n\nwhen firing is being conducted.\" 33 C.F.R. § 334.1470. As we held in\n\nAyala Ayala -- which dealt with the same danger zone regulation we\n\nanalyze here -- \"[t]o prove a violation of § 1382, then, the government\n\nwas required to demonstrate that notice was given that the danger zone\n\nwas closed to the public at the time of the arrests.\" Ayala Ayala, 2002\n\nWL 723876, at *4.\n\n          Alternatively, assuming again arguendo that the security zone\n\nwas duly promulgated and sufficient to establish control and\n\noccupation, the government needed to establish that appellants had\n\n\ninfra).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fnotice that a security zone was in effect on April 27, 2001, in order\n\nfor us to conclude that appellants were on Fisherman's Island \"for the\n\npurpose of unauthorized entry\" in violation of section 1382.\n\n          The government here has not met the burden of showing that\n\nthe defendants had actual or constructive notice that entry was\n\nprohibited, notice that could have been provided by prior notice of the\n\nlive firing or of the designation of the security zone.       In Ayala\n\nAyala, the record contained references to a \"fishermen's notice,\"\n\nwarning of upcoming military exercises within the danger zone and\n\ndistributed around Vieques a week in advance, and to radio broadcasts\n\nover marine band radio alerting to the establishment of a temporary\n\nsecurity zone (and thus also to firing within the danger zone). Ayala\n\nAyala, 2002 WL 723876, at *5.    In contrast, we find nothing in the\n\nrecord of the case before us that establishes notice that live firing\n\nwould be conducted in the danger zone on April 27, 2001.5 See also\n\nZenón-Rodríguez, 2002 WL 729216, at *4 (pointing to the existence of a\n\nroutine weekly fishermen's notice, in evidence, as proof of\n\nconstructive notice).        The government responds by contending that\n\n\n     5We are aware that the date in question in Ayala Ayala,\nApril 28, 2001, is only one day after the day on which\nappellants in this case allegedly trespassed on Fisherman's\nIsland.   Although we thus acknowledge that the fishermen's\nnotice and radio broadcasts discussed in Ayala Ayala more than\nlikely cover the date on which appellants were arrested, this\ndoes not change the fact that the government, on the record in\nthis case, failed to show that appellants had notice that their\nentry upon Fisherman's Island was prohibited.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f33 F.R. 22,121, which established the temporary security zone, was\n\nsufficient to establish constructive notice, both as to live firing in\n\nthe danger zone and as to the designation of the temporary security\n\nzone. The government's position is flawed. Even assuming again, as we\n\nhave supra, that the regulation was legally promulgated, we cannot find\n\nthat it provided notice as to the fact that Fisherman's Island was\n\nclosed to the public on April 27. The regulation itself, published\n\nonly on May 3, could have alerted the appellants neither to the fact\n\nthat the danger zone was closed due to live firing on April 27 nor to\n\nthe fact that a temporary security zone was in effect on April 27.\n\nEven if advance publication was not required to legally designate the\n\nsecurity zone, we cannot accept that a post-dated regulation can\n\nprovide constructive notice of its existence, particularly when other\n\noptions for providing notice exist. See e.g., Ayala Ayala, 2002 WL\n\n723876, at *5 (discussing radio broadcasts over marine band radio\n\nannouncing the designation of a security zone). The government has the\n\nburden here of showing that, at the time of their entry on to\n\nFisherman's Island, appellants understood or should have understood\n\nthat their presence on Fisherman's Island was prohibited. It defies\n\ncommon sense to say that the government can prove such notice by\n\npointing to a regulation published after the fact.6\n\n\n     6\n     In so holding, we are fully aware of our precedent stating\nthat \"section 1382's knowledge or notice requirement may be\nsatisfied by the publication of a regulation specifically\n\n                                 -11-\n\fB. Actual Notice\n\n          Having failed to establish constructive notice, in a last-\n\nditch effort, the government asks us to find that certain behavior and\n\nlanguage by the appellants at the time of their arrest proves that they\n\nhad actual knowledge that Fisherman's Island was closed to the public\n\non April 27. In particular, the government points to the fact that the\n\nappellants chanted \"Vieques, si, marina, no\"7 when they were picked up\n\nby Navy personnel. Whatever appellants' words may convey as to their\n\npurpose for being on Fisherman's Island, we cannot take their chant as\n\nproving that appellants had notice or knowledge that the island was\n\nclosed to the public on April 27, 2001.\n\n          We hence hold that the government has not met its burden of\n\nshowing, on the record in this case, that appellants had actual or\n\nconstructive notice that their presence on Fisherman's Island was\n\nprohibited by law on the date of their arrests.\n\n\n\n\nforbidding unauthorized entry.\"     Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 25\n(internal quotations omitted).   In Maxwell, the regulations\nfound to provide notice, 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.35-770.40, were duly\npromulgated, published, and in effect indefinitely at the time\nof the trespass.    Maxwell thus did not anticipate the due\nprocess questions that arise if a post-dated rule establishing\na temporary restriction on entry is held forth as providing\nnotice of the prohibited act.\n     7This is translated as \"Vieques, yes, Navy, no.\"\n\n                                 -12-\n\f                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the district court erred in\n\nconvicting appellants under 18 U.S.C. § 1382.\n\n         Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -13-\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n          Appellants were arrested by Navy officials on April 27, 2001,\n\non Cayo Yayí, also known as Fisherman's Island, a small island about 75\n\nfeet off the shore of the live impact area1 of the Camp García Naval\n\nInstallation, which is located on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico.\n\nOn April 30, 2001, the government filed a one-count information against\n\neach of the appellants, charging them with entering, \"knowingly and\n\nunlawfully,\" upon Camp García, \"for any purpose prohibited by law or\n\nlawful regulation, that is, 32 C.F.R. Section 770.35 through 770.40,2\n\nwithout first having obtained permission from the Commanding Officer as\n\nrequired by the aforesaid regulations,\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n     1\n     The live impact area is a part of Camp García that receives\nbombs and ordnance in the course of military target practice.\n     2\n     Sections 770.35 through 770.40 of Title 32 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations set up entry restrictions and entry\nprocedures for enumerated naval installations and properties in\nPuerto Rico, including Camp García.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f1382. Section 1382 reads in relevant part as follows: \"Whoever, within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any military, naval,\n\nor Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or\n\ninstallation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation .\n\n. . [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six\n\nmonths, or both.\"       18 U.S.C. § 1382.\n\n              A bench trial was held on June 5, 2001. During the trial\n\ntestimony -- and at oral argument before us -- the government conceded\n\nthat Fisherman's Island was not United States property, despite its\n\nproximity to Camp García. At trial, however, the government introduced\n\nas evidence maps reflecting a \"danger zone,\" established by 33 C.F.R.\n\n§ 334.1470, which included the island within its boundaries. A danger\n\nzone is \"[a] defined water area         . . . used for target practice,\n\nbombing, rocket firing or other especially hazardous operations,\n\nnormally for the armed forces,\" and \"may be closed to the public on a\n\nfull-time or intermittent basis, as stated in the regulations.\" Id. §\n\n334.2(a).      The regulation creating the danger zone that includes\n\nFisherman's Island specifies that \"[i]t will be open to navigation at\n\nall   times    except   when   firing   is   being   conducted.\"   Id.   §\n\n334.1470(b)(1).\n\n              The government also introduced evidence that, on the day of\n\nthe arrests, Fisherman's Island was in a temporary \"security zone,\"\n\nestablished by 66 F.R. 22,121 (published May 3, 2001), effective from\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f3 p.m., April 26, 2001 until 11:59 p.m., April 30, 2001. \"A security\n\nzone is an area of land, water, or land and water which is so\n\ndesignated by the Captain of the Port or District Commander for such\n\ntime as necessary to prevent damage or injury to any vessel or\n\nwaterfront facility, to safeguard ports, harbors, territories, or\n\nwaters of the United States or to secure the observance of the rights\n\nand obligations of the United States.\" 33 C.F.R. § 165.30(a). The\n\nregulations provide that \"[n]o person or vessel may enter or remain in\n\na security zone without permission of the Captain of the Port.\" Id. §\n\n165.33(a). At trial appellants noted that 66 F.R. 22,121, although\n\ndated April 26, 2001, a day before their arrests, was published on May\n\n3, 2001.\n\n           At the close of the prosecution's case, appellants raised a\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure, stating that the government had failed to present\n\nevidence of certain necessary elements of the offense as charged in the\n\ninformations filed against them. Appellants argued in particular that\n\nthe informations charged them with violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1382, for\n\nentering Camp García without authorization, but that the evidence\n\npresented only proved that they were on Fisherman's Island, not Camp\n\nGarcía, at the time of their arrests. The court denied the Rule 29\n\nmotion and, after the defense rested without presenting any evidence,\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fproceeded to find the appellants guilty of trespass in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382.    Thereafter, timely appeals were filed.\n\n          Before us, appellants essentially raise three arguments. The\n\nfirst is that Fisherman's Island was not part of a danger zone and/or\n\nsecurity zone that was duly activated and in effect on April 27, 2001\n\nand that the government therefore did not prove that it exerted control\n\nover Fisherman's Island sufficient to convict appellants of entering a\n\nnaval installation, as section 1382 requires. Second, appellants argue\n\nthat they did not have notice of the offense charged and therefore\n\nsimilarly could not be convicted under section 1382.      Their third\n\nargument posits that, to the extent that the government has not been\n\nable to show that the United States exerted control over Fisherman's\n\nIsland, the district court erred in denying appellants' Rule 29 motion,\n\nwhere the prosecution failed to prove any of the elements of the\n\noffense charged in the informations.\n\n          \"We review the district court's construction of a federal\n\nstatute de novo.\" United States v. Maxwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199478\"><a href=\"/opinion/199478/united-states-v-maxwell-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2001). On the record before us, we find that the government failed to\n\nprove that appellants had actual or constructive notice that\n\nFisherman's Island was closed to public use on April 27, 2001, and that\n\nthe district court therefore erred in holding that their presence\n\nviolated section 1382. We accordingly reverse. Because we find that\n\nlack of notice in this case is sufficient to reverse appellants'\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fconvictions, we reach the other issues raised by appellants only to the\n\nextent they are necessary to set the groundwork for our holding on\n\nnotice.\n\n                            II. ANALYSIS\n\n          A conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1382 \"requires only that the\n\ngovernment demonstrate either a possessory interest in, or occupation\n\nor control of, the area reserved by the military,\" and not actual\n\ngovernment ownership of the area in question.

Apr. 29, 2002); Ventura-Meléndez, 275 F.3d at\n\n17. It is uncontested here that Fisherman's Island was included in the\n\ndanger zone defined in 33 C.F.R. § 334.1470, and we therefore find\n\nthat, on April 27, 2001, appellants \"within the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States, [went] upon [a] . . . naval . . . installation,\" within\n\nthe meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1382.\n\n          The government further argues that 33 F.R. 22,121, the\n\npreviously mentioned regulation establishing a temporary security zone\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat incorporated Fisherman's Island and was in effect from 3 p.m.,\n\nApril 26, 2001 until 11:59 p.m., April 30, 2001, provided an additional\n\nand independent ground for finding that the government exerted control\n\nover the island during the dates in question.    See United States v.\n\nAllen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554975\"><a href=\"/opinion/554975/united-states-v-jacqueline-allen-arthur-laffin-james-patrick-reale/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding that the designation of\n\na security zone is sufficient evidence that the Navy \"occupied and\n\ncontrolled\" the waters in question). In making this argument, the\n\ngovernment concedes that 33 F.R. 22,121 was published on May 3, 2001,\n\nafter the date on which appellants allegedly trespassed on Fisherman's\n\nIsland, but contends that the regulation was nevertheless duly\n\npromulgated because it was exempt\n\nfrom notice and comment rulemaking and advance publication, see 5\n\nU.S.C. § 553, under the military and/or good cause exceptions of 5\n\nU.S.C. § 553 (a)(1), (b)(B) and (d)(3).3 Without resolving the question\n\n\n     3Section 553 reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n     (a) This section applies, according to the provisions\n     thereof, except to the extent that there is involved\n     --\n          (1)a military or foreign affairs function of\n          the United States\n     . . . .\n     (b) General notice of proposed rule making shall be\n     published in the Federal Register . . .\n     Except when notice or hearing is required by statute,\n     this subsection does not apply --\n     . . .\n          (B) when the agency for good cause finds . .\n          . that notice and public procedure thereon\n          are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary\n          to the public interest.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fof whether the security zone in this case was properly promulgated --\n\nor the question of whether it was sufficient here to prove occupation\n\nand control by the Navy of Fisherman's Island -- we assume, arguendo,\n\nthat the security zone provided an additional way in which appellants\n\n\"within the jurisdiction of the United States, [went] upon [a] . . .\n\nnaval . . . installation,\" on April 27, 2001, within the meaning of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382.   We move on to the question of notice.4\n\n\n     (c) After notice required by this section, the agency\n     shall give interested persons an opportunity to\n     participate in the rule making through submission of\n     written data, views, or arguments with or without\n     opportunity for oral presentation. . . .\n     (d) The required publication or service of a\n     substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days\n     before its effective date, except --\n     . . .\n          (3) as otherwise provided by the agency for\n          good cause found and published with the\n          rule.\n     . . .\n     4The government has additionally argued that Fisherman's\nIsland was closed to the public continuously, regardless of\nwhether there was live firing or a temporary security zone. At\ntrial, three Navy personnel testified variously that the Navy\nregularly patrolled and observed Fisherman's Island, that all\nthe offshore islands in close proximity to Camp García were\nconsidered under the control of the U.S. Navy, and that the only\nauthorized access to Fisherman's Island was through Camp García.\n(Appellants have argued in response that Fisherman's Island was\nused by the public for fishing and recreation, although we do\nnot see evidence of this use in the record.)         We find that,\nregardless of what the Navy's usual practice as to patrolling\nFisherman's Island or authorizing entry to the island may be,\nthe government cannot claim that the island was closed to the\npublic continuously, when it was undeniably within a danger zone\nthat is \"open to navigation at all times except when firing is being\nconducted.\" 33 C.F.R. § 334.1470 (discussed further in section A ,\n\n                                 -8-\n\fA. Constructive Notice\n\n          In order to establish a violation of section 1382, we must\n\nalso find that appellants entered the naval installation \"for any\n\npurpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1382.\n\n\"The requisite prohibited 'purpose' under section 1382 can consist of\n\nunauthorized entry itself. . . . On the other hand, when a section\n\n1382 prosecution proceeds on the basis that the defendant has entered\n\na restricted military reservation 'for the purpose of' unauthorized\n\nentry, we think it must be shown that the defendant had knowledge or\n\nnotice that such entry was, in fact, prohibited.\" United States v.\n\nParrilla Bonilla, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390416\"><a href=\"/opinion/390416/united-states-v-antulio-parrilla-bonilla-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n          In this case, the regulation establishing the danger zone\n\nstates that the zone \"will be open to navigation at all times except\n\nwhen firing is being conducted.\" 33 C.F.R. § 334.1470. As we held in\n\nAyala Ayala -- which dealt with the same danger zone regulation we\n\nanalyze here -- \"[t]o prove a violation of § 1382, then, the government\n\nwas required to demonstrate that notice was given that the danger zone\n\nwas closed to the public at the time of the arrests.\" Ayala Ayala, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">723876</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.\n\n          Alternatively, assuming again arguendo that the security zone\n\nwas duly promulgated and sufficient to establish control and\n\noccupation, the government needed to establish that appellants had\n\n\ninfra).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fnotice that a security zone was in effect on April 27, 2001, in order\n\nfor us to conclude that appellants were on Fisherman's Island \"for the\n\npurpose of unauthorized entry\" in violation of section 1382.\n\n          The government here has not met the burden of showing that\n\nthe defendants had actual or constructive notice that entry was\n\nprohibited, notice that could have been provided by prior notice of the\n\nlive firing or of the designation of the security zone.       In Ayala\n\nAyala, the record contained references to a \"fishermen's notice,\"\n\nwarning of upcoming military exercises within the danger zone and\n\ndistributed around Vieques a week in advance, and to radio broadcasts\n\nover marine band radio alerting to the establishment of a temporary\n\nsecurity zone (and thus also to firing within the danger zone).

In contrast, we find nothing in the\n\nrecord of the case before us that establishes notice that live firing\n\nwould be conducted in the danger zone on April 27, 2001.5 See also\n\nZenón-Rodríguez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">729216</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (pointing to the existence of a\n\nroutine weekly fishermen's notice, in evidence, as proof of\n\nconstructive notice).        The government responds by contending that\n\n\n     5We are aware that the date in question in Ayala Ayala,\nApril 28, 2001, is only one day after the day on which\nappellants in this case allegedly trespassed on Fisherman's\nIsland.   Although we thus acknowledge that the fishermen's\nnotice and radio broadcasts discussed in Ayala Ayala more than\nlikely cover the date on which appellants were arrested, this\ndoes not change the fact that the government, on the record in\nthis case, failed to show that appellants had notice that their\nentry upon Fisherman's Island was prohibited.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f33 F.R. 22,121, which established the temporary security zone, was\n\nsufficient to establish constructive notice, both as to live firing in\n\nthe danger zone and as to the designation of the temporary security\n\nzone. The government's position is flawed. Even assuming again, as we\n\nhave supra, that the regulation was legally promulgated, we cannot find\n\nthat it provided notice as to the fact that Fisherman's Island was\n\nclosed to the public on April 27. The regulation itself, published\n\nonly on May 3, could have alerted the appellants neither to the fact\n\nthat the danger zone was closed due to live firing on April 27 nor to\n\nthe fact that a temporary security zone was in effect on April 27.\n\nEven if advance publication was not required to legally designate the\n\nsecurity zone, we cannot accept that a post-dated regulation can\n\nprovide constructive notice of its existence, particularly when other\n\noptions for providing notice exist. See e.g., Ayala Ayala, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">723876</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (discussing radio broadcasts over marine band radio\n\nannouncing the designation of a security zone). The government has the\n\nburden here of showing that, at the time of their entry on to\n\nFisherman's Island, appellants understood or should have understood\n\nthat their presence on Fisherman's Island was prohibited. It defies\n\ncommon sense to say that the government can prove such notice by\n\npointing to a regulation published after the fact.6\n\n\n     6\n     In so holding, we are fully aware of our precedent stating\nthat \"section 1382's knowledge or notice requirement may be\nsatisfied by the publication of a regulation specifically\n\n                                 -11-\n\fB. Actual Notice\n\n          Having failed to establish constructive notice, in a last-\n\nditch effort, the government asks us to find that certain behavior and\n\nlanguage by the appellants at the time of their arrest proves that they\n\nhad actual knowledge that Fisherman's Island was closed to the public\n\non April 27. In particular, the government points to the fact that the\n\nappellants chanted \"Vieques, si, marina, no\"7 when they were picked up\n\nby Navy personnel. Whatever appellants' words may convey as to their\n\npurpose for being on Fisherman's Island, we cannot take their chant as\n\nproving that appellants had notice or knowledge that the island was\n\nclosed to the public on April 27, 2001.\n\n          We hence hold that the government has not met its burden of\n\nshowing, on the record in this case, that appellants had actual or\n\nconstructive notice that their presence on Fisherman's Island was\n\nprohibited by law on the date of their arrests.\n\n\n\n\nforbidding unauthorized entry.\"     Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 25\n(internal quotations omitted).   In Maxwell, the regulations\nfound to provide notice, 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.35-770.40, were duly\npromulgated, published, and in effect indefinitely at the time\nof the trespass.    Maxwell thus did not anticipate the due\nprocess questions that arise if a post-dated rule establishing\na temporary restriction on entry is held forth as providing\nnotice of the prohibited act.\n     7This is translated as \"Vieques, yes, Navy, no.\"\n\n                                 -12-\n\f                       III.
