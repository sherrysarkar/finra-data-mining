Raymond J. Pettine, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                    \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                      \r\n              Boudin and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r                                                          \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nThomas O. Banks on brief pro se.\r                           \r\nMarc DeSisto, Kathleen M. Powers and  DeSisto Law Offices on brief\r                                                                     \r\nfor appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        November 8, 1996\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   Upon  careful  review of  the  briefs and\r                            \r\n\nlimited  record   in  this   appeal,  we  conclude   that  no\r\n\nsubstantial question  is presented and that  the judgment for\r\n\ndefendants should be affirmed.  We add only these comments.\r\n\n     1.   The district court did  not abuse its discretion in\r\n\nconcluding that evidence of  an unrelated disciplinary action\r\n\nshould  be excluded under Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b), because that\r\n\nevidence  was highly  prejudicial  and would  only show  \"bad\r\n\ncharacter from  which to  infer a  propensity  to commit  the\r\n\npresent  act.\"  See Tigges v. Cataldo, 611 F.2d 936, 938 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.  1979).  Plaintiff's reliance on Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) is\r\n\nsimilarly unavailing.   See id. at 939. \r                                           \r\n\n     2.   Plaintiff never brought  his claim regarding  newly\r\n\ndiscovered evidence  to the attention of  the district court.\r\n\nTherefore, we will not consider that claim for the first time\r\n\nin this appeal.  See Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1987).\r\n\n     3.   Plaintiff waived  his arguments regarding  the jury\r\n\ninstructions by failing to object below.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\r                                                         \r\n\n51.  Therefore, we do not consider his contentions concerning\r\n\nthe lack  of instructions on  state law negligence  claims or\r\n\nthe content of the instruction on the deliberate indifference\r\n\nstandard.  Further, upon review  for plain error, we conclude\r\n\nthat  the  record  here  exhibits no  error  that  \"seriously\r\n\naffected the  fairness, integrity,  or  public reputation  of\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\njudicial proceedings.\"   See  Toscano v. Chandris,  S.A., 934\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 383, 384-85 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n     4.   We  reject  plaintiff's  contention  regarding  the\r\n\njury's request  to read  trial  transcripts.   The trial  was\r\n\nrelatively  brief, and  so the  district court's  decision to\r\n\nwithhold the transcripts was well within its broad discretion\r\n\nin such matters.   See United States v.  Hyson, 721 F.2d 856,\r                                                          \r\n\n865 (1st Cir. 1983).    \r\n\n     5.   Our usual plenary review of the directed verdict is\r\n\nstymied  here because  plaintiff  has provided  an incomplete\r\n\ntrial  transcript.  See  Fed. R. App.  P. 10(b)(1) (appellant\r                                   \r\n\nhas the duty to  \"order from the court reporter  a transcript\r\n\nof such  parts of the proceedings not already on file as [he]\r\n\ndeems necessary\"); Valedon Martinez v. Hospital Presbiteriano\r                                                                         \r\n\nde  la Comunidad, Inc., 806  F.2d 1128, 1135  (1st Cir. 1986)\r                                  \r\n\n(we will not  review a claim of error if appellant has failed\r\n\nto include a transcript of  the pertinent proceedings in  the\r\n\nrecord on appeal).   In any case,  our review of the  limited\r\n\nrecord available does  not lead  us to conclude  that a  jury\r\n\nquestion  remained as to the  city's liability.   See id. (we\r                                                                     \r\n\nnevertheless  may consider  appellant's claim  to the  extent\r\n\npossible).\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc.
