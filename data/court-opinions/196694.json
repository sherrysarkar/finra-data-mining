Mirick with  whom Mirick,  O'Connell, De  Mallie &amp; Lougee\r                                                                              \r\nwas on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n                        April 9, 1996\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   In March  1993, Chuang  Investments, Inc.\r                            \r\n\nfiled  suit   in   state  court   against   Marriott   Family\r\n\nRestaurants,  Inc., alleging  that  Marriott had  violated  a\r\n\nlease agreement.   Marriott removed the case  to the district\r\n\ncourt  and counterclaimed  against Chuang  Investments, Inc.,\r\n\nY.C. Hospitality, Inc., and  Dr. Ying C. Chuang.   It appears\r\n\nthat Dr.  Chuang controls  Chuang Investments, Inc.  and that\r\n\nY.C.  Hospitality, Inc. is  now dissolved.   Dr.  Chuang then\r\n\nasserted his own claim against Marriott.\r\n\n     In October 1993, the  district court entered a discovery\r\n\norder  requiring that  discovery be  completed by  July 1994.\r\n\nMarriott filed deposition notices  in February 1994  directed\r\n\nto Dr.  Chuang and  the  Chuang companies,  which Dr.  Chuang\r\n\nignored.   In April 1994, Marriott  filed interrogatories and\r\n\ndocument requests,  which also went unanswered,  and a motion\r\n\nto compel discovery based on the deposition notices.\r\n\n     Dr.  Chuang then wrote a letter dated April 17, 1994, to\r\n\nthe court saying that he had suffered a gunshot wound and, on\r\n\nhis doctor's advice, needed a year's postponement.  The court\r\n\nimmediately directed Dr. Chuang to file an affidavit from his\r\n\ndoctor  and  scheduled  a  hearing.   In  the  meantime,  the\r\n\nattorneys for Dr. Chuang and his companies moved to  withdraw\r\n\nbecause they  had not been  paid.  Dr. Chuang  did not submit\r\n\nthe requested affidavit.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     At the June  1994 hearing  the district  court told  Dr.\r\n\nChuang that  he would  be  given 14  days  more to  file  the\r\n\naffidavit from  his doctor that  had been requested  in April\r\n\n1994 and, absent  the affidavit, he  had 30 days  to get  new\r\n\ncounsel.  The  court specifically advised Dr.  Chuang that he\r\n\nrisked default  if  he  did  not secure  counsel,  since  the\r\n\ncorporations had to  be represented by counsel and Dr. Chuang\r\n\ndid not propose to represent himself.  \r\n\n     Thereafter, in June 1994, Dr. Chuang  filed letters--not\r\n\naffidavits--from  two doctors  saying, respectively,  that he\r\n\nneeded a month's  postponement and six  months' postponement.\r\n\nHe did not obtain new counsel.  In July  1994, Marriott moved\r\n\nto  dismiss  the claims  against it  and  for defaults  as to\r\n\nliability on its claims against Dr. Chuang and his companies.\r\n\nThe  grounds stated were the repeated  failures of the Chuang\r\n\nparties to respond to discovery requests.  Dr. Chuang and his\r\n\ncompanies opposed the motions; but for the  next eight months\r\n\nthey took no other action on the case.\r\n\n     Finally, on May  12, 1995, the  district court filed  an\r\n\neight-page memorandum  and order  describing the  sequence of\r\n\nevents  and  granting  Marriott's motion.    Thereafter,  the\r\n\nChuang parties, now with new  counsel, sought reconsideration\r\n\nwhich was denied.  A hearing was held, damages  were fixed on\r\n\nthe Marriott  claims, and  judgment was entered  disposing of\r\n\nthe  case.  The Chuang  parties now appeal,  raising as their\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nsole issue  whether the district court  abused its discretion\r\n\nin granting Marriott's motion.\r\n\n     On appeal,  the Chuang  parties argue that  Dr. Chuang's\r\n\ngunshot wound--apparently a knee  injury that was the subject\r\n\nof surgery in January  1994--prevented him from attending his\r\n\ndeposition.   They say that his  delay in securing affidavits\r\n\nand new counsel and in responding to discovery was the result\r\n\nof  mental  and  physical  trauma,  and  some  difficulty  in\r\n\nspeaking English.  We are also told that  the delays were not\r\n\negregious and that Marriott was not prejudiced by the delay.\r\n\n     We think it is clear that Dr. Chuang has not excused his\r\n\nfailure  to comply  with the  court orders  or his  discovery\r\n\nobligations (the  Chuang brief  does not seek  to distinguish\r\n\nbetween   his   position  and   that   of   the  two   Chuang\r\n\ncorporations).  It  may be that  he had a medical  excuse for\r\n\nnot attending the depositions, cf. United States v. DeFrantz,\r                                                                        \r\n\n708 F.2d 310, 312  (7th Cir. 1983); but nothing in  the later\r\n\nletters from the doctors--or two medical affidavits belatedly\r\n\nsubmitted on reconsideration--even begins  to explain why  he\r\n\ndid nothing for almost 18 months.\r\n\n     Nor is there anything to the claim of lack of prejudice.\r\n\nThere  may be no showing  of special prejudice  (e.g., a lost\r                                                                 \r\n\nwitness); but,  in a period of  overloaded dockets, prejudice\r\n\nto   the   court  is   inherent   in   needless  delays   and\r\n\npostponements.   As  for  Marriott, it  has  been  left  with\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nlitigation  needlessly hanging  over  its head  and has  been\r\n\nforced to  litigate  about discovery  compliance that  should\r\n\nhave been automatic or  only briefly delayed.  See  Robson v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHallenbeck,  No. 95-1595, slip op.  at 8-9 (1st  Cir. Apr. 3,\r                      \r\n\n1996).\r\n\n     It is true  that default  is a severe  sanction but  the\r\n\nfacts already  cited reveal  a pattern of  non-compliance and\r\n\ninattention by  Dr.  Chuang.   See  Damiani v.  Rhode  Island\r                                                                         \r\n\nHosp., 704 F.2d 12, 15-16  (1st Cir. 1983).  For months,  Dr.\r                 \r\n\nChuang failed to comply  with the twice-issued direction that\r\n\nhe provide  an  affidavit, and  he  failed either  to  secure\r\n\ncounsel as  directed or,  if additional  time was  needed, to\r\n\nrequest and justify a postponement.   Nor did Dr. Chuang make\r\n\na  serious  effort  to  comply  with  the  discovery  demands\r\n\noutstanding  against  him  for  almost  18  months  prior  to\r\n\ndefault.  \r\n\n     The district court showed considerable patience in  this\r\n\ncase.  It provided a warning and a second chance, and it then\r\n\nwaited for a substantial  period.  In ordering  the dismissal\r\n\nand  default, the court  wrote a careful  explanation of what\r\n\nhad  happened and why the  court was entering  its order.  We\r\n\nthink that the remedy  was well within the discretion  of the\r\n\ndistrict  court, Damiani, 704 F.2d at 13, and that nothing in\r                                    \r\n\nthe submissions filed on reconsideration required it to alter\r\n\nits position.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n",

There may be no showing of special prejudice (e.g., a lost witness);  but, in a period of overloaded dockets, prejudice to the court is inherent in needless delays and postponements.   As for Marriott, it has been left with litigation needlessly hanging over its head and has been forced to litigate about discovery compliance that should have been automatic or only briefly delayed.

In April 1994, Marriott filed interrogatories and document requests, which also went unanswered, and a motion to compel discovery based on the deposition notices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Chuang then wrote a letter dated April 17, 1994, to the court saying that he had suffered a gunshot wound and, on his doctor's advice, needed a year's postponement.   The court immediately directed Dr. Chuang to file an affidavit from his doctor and scheduled a hearing.   In the meantime, the attorneys for Dr. Chuang and his companies moved to withdraw because they had not been paid.   Dr. Chuang did not submit the requested affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the June 1994 hearing the district court told Dr. Chuang that he would be given 14 days more to file the affidavit from his doctor that had been requested in April 1994 and, absent the affidavit, he had 30 days to get new counsel.   The court specifically advised Dr. Chuang that he risked default if he did not secure counsel, since the corporations had to be represented by counsel and Dr. Chuang did not propose to represent himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in June 1994, Dr. Chuang filed letters--not affidavits--from two doctors saying, respectively, that he needed a month's postponement and six months' postponement.   He did not obtain new counsel.   In July 1994, Marriott moved to dismiss the claims against it and for defaults as to liability on its claims against Dr. Chuang and his companies.   The grounds stated were the repeated failures of the Chuang parties to respond to discovery requests.   Dr. Chuang and his companies opposed the motions;  but for the next eight months they took no other action on the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on May 12, 1995, the district court filed an eight-page memorandum and order describing the sequence of events and granting Marriott's motion.   Thereafter, the Chuang parties, now with new counsel, sought reconsideration which was denied.   A hearing was held, damages were fixed on the Marriott claims, and judgment was entered disposing of the case.   The Chuang parties now appeal, raising as their sole issue whether the district court abused its discretion in granting Marriott's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Chuang parties argue that Dr. Chuang's gunshot wound--apparently a knee injury that was the subject of surgery in January 1994--prevented him from attending his deposition.   They say that his delay in securing affidavits and new counsel and in responding to discovery was the result of mental and physical trauma, and some difficulty in speaking English.   We are also told that the delays were not egregious and that Marriott was not prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is clear that Dr. Chuang has not excused his failure to comply with the court orders or his discovery obligations (the Chuang brief does not seek to distinguish between his position and that of the two Chuang corporations).   It may be that he had a medical excuse for not attending the depositions, cf. United States v. DeFrantz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419185\"><a href=\"/opinion/419185/united-states-of-america-community-action-against-poverty-of-greater/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span>, 312 (7th Cir.1983);  but nothing in the later letters from the doctors--or two medical affidavits belatedly submitted on reconsideration--even begins to explain why he did nothing for almost 18 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there anything to the claim of lack of prejudice.   There may be no showing of special prejudice (e.g., a lost witness);  but, in a period of overloaded dockets, prejudice to the court is inherent in needless delays and postponements.   As for Marriott, it has been left with litigation needlessly hanging over its head and has been forced to litigate about discovery compliance that should have been automatic or only briefly delayed.   See Robson v. Hallenbeck, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196677\"><a href=\"/opinion/196677/robson-v-hallenbeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that default is a severe sanction but the facts already cited reveal a pattern of non-compliance and inattention by Dr. Chuang.   See Damiani v. Rhode Island Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416550\"><a href=\"/opinion/416550/louis-m-damiani-md-v-rhode-island-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15-16 (1st Cir.1983).   For months, Dr. Chuang failed to comply with the twice-issued direction that he provide an affidavit, and he failed either to secure counsel as directed or, if additional time was needed, to request and justify a postponement.   Nor did Dr. Chuang make a serious effort to comply with the discovery demands outstanding against him for almost 18 months prior to default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court showed considerable patience in this case.   It provided a warning and a second chance, and it then waited for a substantial period.   In ordering the dismissal and default, the court wrote a careful explanation of what had happened and why the court was entering its order.   We think that the remedy was well within the discretion of the district court, Damiani, 704 F.2d at 13, and that nothing in the submissions filed on reconsideration required it to alter its position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
