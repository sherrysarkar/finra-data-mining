KEAVENY,\r\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n     [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge,\r\nCoffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Mark L. Sisti and Twomey &amp; Sisti Law Offices on brief for appellant.\r\n   Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, and Peter E. Papps, First Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition.\r\n\nMARCH 4, 1999\r\n\n    Per Curiam.    Defendant was convicted by a jury and\r\nsentenced to 96 months' imprisonment for a violation of the\r\nfederal firearms statute.  He alleges that the selection of the\r\njury in his case was closed to the public by a court security\r\nofficer in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a public\r\ntrial.  See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1,\r\n7 (1986) (holding that the guarantee of an open public trial \r\nincludes the voir dire examination of jurors).\r\n     Below, defendant's first objection to the alleged closure\r\nof the voir dire came in a post-trial motion to set aside the\r\njury's verdict.  The motion was denied by the trial judge\r\nwithout an evidentiary hearing on the ground that the objection\r\nwas untimely.  On appeal, defendant argues that the trial judge\r\nerred in (1) failing to grant a defense request for an\r\nevidentiary hearing on the alleged closure, and (2) failing to\r\ngrant a new trial.  \r\n     In opposition, the government has twice moved for a\r\nsummary affirmance.  We denied the government's first motion\r\nwithout prejudice to a renewal of the motion with \"appropriate\r\nand relevant record citations for each of the factual\r\nassertions therein.\"  The renewed motion includes record\r\ncitations but the cited exhibits do not provide undisputed\r\nsupport for the government's factual contentions that the\r\ncourtroom was never closed to the public during the jury\r\nselection process,  and that the defense allegation was \r\n\"concocted.\"   These are not the sort of matters of which this\r\ncourt can possibly take judicial notice.\r\n     We also do not agree with the government's reading of the\r\ntrial judge's decision as incorporating \"factual findings\" on\r\nthe alleged courtroom closing.   The decision confirms that\r\nthere was no judicial order excluding the public, and reflects\r\nthe court's skepticism of the defendant's claim.  However, the\r\ncourt did not determine whether members of the public were in\r\nfact excluded nor whether the defendant's bypass of the\r\nobjection constituted a knowing waiver.  In the absence of a\r\nknowing waiver, constitutional concerns may be raised even by\r\na court officer's unauthorized partial exclusion of the public. \r\nSee, e.g., United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 29-35 (1st \r\nCir.) (disapproving of the marshals' unauthorized initiation of\r\nsecurity measures which effected a partial closure, but\r\nupholding a court order ratifying the measures on the second\r\nday of the trial in light of a balancing of the interests),\r\ncert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 174, 268 (1998); see also Martineau v.\r\nPerrin, 601 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir. 1979) (finding that a knowing\r\nand deliberate waiver of the right to a public trial was\r\nsufficient to overcome the constitutional presumption of\r\nprejudice arising from a bailiff's mistaken locking of the\r\ncourtroom doors for several days of the trial).       \r\n     We do not reach defendant's second contention that the\r\navailability of reasonable alternatives to a closure renders\r\nconstitutionally impermissible any retrospective ratification\r\nhypothetically explained by space limitations or the like.  A\r\ndecision by us on that issue would be purely advisory without\r\na determination of the predicate facts.\r\n     We are reluctant to extend further the proceedings in this\r\ncase.  We can understand the skepticism that arises from the\r\ndelay in raising this issue.  But not only is a very\r\nsubstantial period of imprisonment involved but also the basic\r\nrespect owed to the Sixth Amendment.  If we err, we prefer to\r\nerr in the direction of ascertaining with assuredness that\r\nbasic rights have either been waived or observed.  We therefore\r\nvacate the order denying the motion for a new trial and remand\r\nto enable the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing\r\nor otherwise determine the crucial facts.\r\n     The government's motions to dispense with oral argument\r\nand to file a motion memorandum in lieu of a brief are granted. \r\nThe district court's order denying defendant's motion for a new\r\ntrial is vacated and the case is remanded for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this decision.
