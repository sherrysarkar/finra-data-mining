The  union,  representing the\r                                        \r\n\nemployees of  Caribe  General Electric  (\"Caribe\"), sued  the\r\n\ncompany in the district court  for damages and related relief\r\n\nfor a  refusal to arbitrate, or for  an order requiring it to\r\n\narbitrate,  five  specific  grievances  under   a  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement.  The district court ordered arbitration\r\n\nas  to  all of  the  grievances, ruling  that  the arbitrator\r\n\nshould determine whether the  grievances were arbitrable.  We\r\n\nhold that  this  was a  matter for  the court  to decide  and\r\n\nremand as to four of the grievances for further proceedings.\r\n\n     The facts  of importance to this  appeal are undisputed.\r\n\nCaribe and  its union  had a collective  bargaining agreement\r\n\nwhich, as  most do, contained many  substantive provisions, a\r\n\ngrievance  procedure, and an  arbitration provision providing\r\n\nfor   mandatory  arbitration   of  specified   categories  of\r\n\ndisputes.   During the  term of  this agreement, Caribe  took\r\n\nfive  different actions that  caused the union  to invoke the\r\n\ngrievance procedure  and, when that did  not resolve matters,\r\n\nto demand arbitration.   Three  of the grievances grew out of\r\n\none episode:   Ibrahim  Rosario, Herminio L pez,  and Esteban\r\n\nCalder n were  group leaders  of three  separate departments.\r\n\nThe company eliminated  one of  the departments,  integrating\r\n\nits functions into  the other two; it  then re-assigned L pez\r\n\nand Calder n  as group  leaders of the  enlarged departments,\r\n\nand  retained Rosario  but without  a leadership  post.   The\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nfourth grievance  concerned Antonio  V zquez, who had  been a\r\n\ndispatcher; Caribe eliminated that position, reallocated some\r\n\nof the  duties to  a shipping  clerk, and  left V zquez  in a\r\n\nlower job  classification.  The fifth  grievance involved the\r\n\ntemporary assignment of Narciso Torr ns for more than 30 days\r\n\nto  perform  the  tasks  of  two  assembly  workers who  were\r\n\nconsecutively on vacation.  \r\n\n     When the grievance  procedure failed to resolve  matters\r\n\nand Caribe refused arbitration, the union brought suit in the\r\n\ndistrict court under  29 U.S.C.    185,  claiming inter  alia\r                                                                         \r\n\nthat the grievances were subject to mandatory arbitration and\r\n\nthat  the   company  should  be  required   to  proceed  with\r\n\narbitration.   On  cross-motions  for  summary judgment,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  ruled that the five  grievances were arguably\r\n\nsubject  to  mandatory arbitration  and  that  the arbitrator\r\n\nshould resolve this issue.\r\n\n     Caribe has  appealed  the judgment  as  to four  of  the\r\n\ngrievances,  agreeing  that  the  Torr ns  matter  should  be\r\n\narbitrated.   Conversely,  the  union now  concedes that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  was  mistaken  in  referring  the  issue  of\r\n\narbitrability to  the arbitrator; but  it says that  all five\r\n\ngrievances are subject to  mandatory arbitration and that the\r\n\norder  to  arbitrate  should  be affirmed  outright  on  this\r\n\nalternative ground.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     Labor   arbitration   depends   upon    contract,   AT&amp;T\r                                                                         \r\n\nTechnologies,  Inc. v. Communications  Workers, 475 U.S. 643,\r                                                          \r\n\n648 (1986);  Tejidos de Coamo, Inc.  v. ILGWU, 22 F.3d  8, 12\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1994), and  the  collective bargaining  agreement\r\n\n(\"CBA\") in this case  provides for mandatory arbitration only\r\n\nin  certain categories  of  cases,  including \"[t]he  claimed\r\n\nviolation  of  a specific  provision  or  provisions\" of  the\r\n\nagreement.   CBA art. XXXIV,   6(a).  But even if a grievance\r\n\nfalls  within this  category, it  is excluded  from mandatory\r\n\narbitration by section  7 of the  same article under  certain\r\n\nconditions, such as where the grievance\r\n\n     (f) Would require an  arbitrator to consider,  rule\r\n     on or decide any of the following: \r\n\n          (1)  The elements  of  an employee's  job\r\n          assignment;\r\n\n          (2) The title or other designations of an\r\n          employee's job classification;\r\n\n          (3) The right of  management to assign or\r\n          reassign work or elements of work.\r\n\n     The Supreme  Court has  held that \"[u]nless  the parties\r\n\nclearly and unmistakably provide  otherwise, the question  of\r\n\nwhether the parties agreed  to arbitrate is to be  decided by\r\n\nthe court, not the arbitrator.\"   AT&amp;T Technologies, 475 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 649.  Here,  far from agreeing to leave  the arbitrability\r\n\nissue  to  the  arbitrator,  the parties  provided  in  their\r\n\nagreement  that  in the  event of  a  dispute on  this issue,\r\n\narbitration  may proceed \"only after  a final [judgment] of a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nCourt  has  determined  that  the  grievance  .  .  .  raises\r\n\narbitrable issues.\"  CBA art. XXXIV,   4(a).\r\n\n     Thus, we agree with both parties that the district court\r\n\nwent  astray in  ordering arbitration without  first deciding\r\n\nitself  that   each  grievance   was  subject  to   mandatory\r\n\narbitration.  To  do so,  the court  had to  decide that  the\r\n\ngrievance fell  within a provision for  mandatory arbitration\r\n\n(e.g.,  section 6) and was not excluded by any other limiting\r                 \r\n\nprovision (e.g.,  section 7).   We  turn,  therefore, to  the\r                           \r\n\nunion's  request that  we decide  the issue  of arbitrability\r\n\nourselves and affirm the district court's arbitration order.\r\n\n     Since the union has not supplied us with the grievances,\r\n\nit is very hard to tell whether each one rests on a colorable\r\n\nclaim that  a specific  provision of  the agreement  has been\r\n\nviolated,  as  required by  section 6.    But even  with that\r\n\ninformation, we could not determine without  more information\r\n\nwhether  arbitration  of  each  grievance  would  \"require an\r\n\narbitrator  to consider,  rule  on  or  decide\"  one  of  the\r\n\nenumerated subjects that section 7(f) excludes from mandatory\r\n\narbitration.    For  the same  reason,  Caribe's  alternative\r\n\nrequest  that we  direct  summary judgment  in  its favor  is\r\n\nwithout merit.\r\n\n     While a  remand for further proceedings  is necessary, a\r\n\nfurther word  or two may be  helpful to the  court on remand.\r\n\nCaribe  has not  limited  its claim  of non-arbitrability  to\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nsection 7(f) but has also invoked other grounds of objection;\r\n\nsection 7(e) of the  same article, which Caribe has  cited on\r\n\nappeal, is a close  companion to section 7(f) and  might need\r\n\nattention.   But  we  are concerned  about Caribe's  repeated\r\n\ninvocation of two \"management  rights\" provisions as  shields\r\n\nagainst mandatory arbitration.\r\n\n      One is  the basic \"management rights\"  provision, in an\r\n\narticle unrelated  to arbitration,  which seems to  us wholly\r\n\nbeside  the point.   CBA  art. IV.   That  provision reserves\r\n\nmanagement  rights  broadly  over  a  range  of   potentially\r\n\npertinent subjects--such  as  reallocation of  work--but  the\r\n\nmanagement  rights   are  retained  \"subject  only  to  those\r\n\nprovisions  of this  Agreement which  expressly qualify  this\r\n\nright.\"   Given  this  \"subject .  . .  to\"  proviso, we  are\r\n\nbaffled  as  to  why  Caribe thinks  this  management  rights\r\n\nprovision has any relevance.   \r\n\n     The union's  grievance claims  may seem obscure;  but to\r\n\nthe  extent   they  rest  upon  the   violation  of  specific\r\n\nprovisions,   we  seriously   doubt  that   the   article  IV\r\n\n\"management  rights\" clause  could be  read either  to negate\r\n\nthose provisions  or to restrict  arbitration.  See  CBA art.\r                                                               \r\n\nXXXIV,    4(b)(4);  United  Steelworkers  v. Warrior  &amp;  Gulf\r                                                                         \r\n\nNavigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 584-85 (1960).  The parties are\r                          \r\n\nwelcome to argue this  issue on remand, if Caribe  chooses to\r\n\npress it,  but we do not  think the company should  be unduly\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nencouraged by its earlier  success in International Assoc. of\r                                                                         \r\n\nMachinists  &amp; Aerospace Workers v.

XXXIV,   4(b)(4), but it too appears to permit mandatory\r\n\narbitration--if  otherwise provided--so long as the grievance\r\n\nis based on an express limitation in the agreement and is not\r\n\nsubject to  section 7's exclusions.   See id. (\"[T]he parties\r                                                         \r\n\nhave not  agreed to arbitrate demands  which challenge action\r\n\ntaken  by the  company in  the  exercise of  any [management]\r\n\nrights, except where such challenge is based upon a violation\r                                                                         \r\n\nof any  such expressed limitations (other than  those set out\r                                                                         \r\n\nin Section 7 of this Article XXXIV).\") (emphasis added).\r                                               \r\n\n     On remand,  we suggest that the  district court consider\r\n\non a grievance-by-grievance basis  whether--as to each of the\r\n\nfour remaining grievances--the grievance  (1) is based upon a\r\n\ncolorable  claim that  the company's  action violated  one or\r\n\nmore  specific  provisions of  the agreement  and (2)  is not\r\n\nexcluded from  mandatory arbitration  by one or  more of  the\r\n\nexclusions  of  section  7.     Unless  both  conditions  are\r\n\nsatisfied, it appears  that mandatory  arbitration cannot  be\r\n\nordered,  so the district court may  not need to rule on both\r\n\nconditions.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     There  may  be  other  bases  for,  or  limitations  on,\r\n\nmandatory  arbitration  that  we  have  overlooked;   but  we\r\n\nencourage the  parties to help  the district court  focus the\r\n\nissues.   As already  noted,  we doubt  that the  management-\r\n\nrights reservations are pertinent.  And it certainly does not\r\n\nhelp  for the  union  to invoke  the Supreme  Court's default\r\n\npresumption  in  favor of  arbitration  where,  as here,  the\r\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreement   explicitly  negates   the\r\n\npresumption.  CBA Art.  XXXIV,   4(b)(5);  AT&amp;T Technologies,\r                                                                        \r\n\n475 U.S. at 650.\r\n\n     Finally, it  is worth emphasizing that  the issue before\r\n\nthe  district court on remand in  this case is not the merits\r\n\nof the grievances; it  is simply whether they are  subject to\r\n\nmandatory arbitration.   All that the union  complained of in\r\n\nthis case  was the  failure to afford  mandatory arbitration,\r\n\nand that is the only issue  before us or the district  court.\r\n\nAT&amp;T Technologies, 475 U.S. at 649-50.  Needless to say, even\r                             \r\n\nif a  grievance is  excluded from mandatory  arbitration, the\r\n\nunion is not necessarily  without contractual remedies for an\r\n\nalleged violation of  the agreement.

The  union,  representing the\r                                        \r\n\nemployees of  Caribe  General Electric  (\"Caribe\"), sued  the\r\n\ncompany in the district court  for damages and related relief\r\n\nfor a  refusal to arbitrate, or for  an order requiring it to\r\n\narbitrate,  five  specific  grievances  under   a  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement.  The district court ordered arbitration\r\n\nas  to  all of  the  grievances, ruling  that  the arbitrator\r\n\nshould determine whether the  grievances were arbitrable.  We\r\n\nhold that  this  was a  matter for  the court  to decide  and\r\n\nremand as to four of the grievances for further proceedings.\r\n\n     The facts  of importance to this  appeal are undisputed.\r\n\nCaribe and  its union  had a collective  bargaining agreement\r\n\nwhich, as  most do, contained many  substantive provisions, a\r\n\ngrievance  procedure, and an  arbitration provision providing\r\n\nfor   mandatory  arbitration   of  specified   categories  of\r\n\ndisputes.   During the  term of  this agreement, Caribe  took\r\n\nfive  different actions that  caused the union  to invoke the\r\n\ngrievance procedure  and, when that did  not resolve matters,\r\n\nto demand arbitration.   Three  of the grievances grew out of\r\n\none episode:   Ibrahim  Rosario, Herminio L pez,  and Esteban\r\n\nCalder n were  group leaders  of three  separate departments.\r\n\nThe company eliminated  one of  the departments,  integrating\r\n\nits functions into  the other two; it  then re-assigned L pez\r\n\nand Calder n  as group  leaders of the  enlarged departments,\r\n\nand  retained Rosario  but without  a leadership  post.   The\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nfourth grievance  concerned Antonio  V zquez, who had  been a\r\n\ndispatcher; Caribe eliminated that position, reallocated some\r\n\nof the  duties to  a shipping  clerk, and  left V zquez  in a\r\n\nlower job  classification.  The fifth  grievance involved the\r\n\ntemporary assignment of Narciso Torr ns for more than 30 days\r\n\nto  perform  the  tasks  of  two  assembly  workers who  were\r\n\nconsecutively on vacation.  \r\n\n     When the grievance  procedure failed to resolve  matters\r\n\nand Caribe refused arbitration, the union brought suit in the\r\n\ndistrict court under  29 U.S.C.    185,  claiming inter  alia\r                                                                         \r\n\nthat the grievances were subject to mandatory arbitration and\r\n\nthat  the   company  should  be  required   to  proceed  with\r\n\narbitration.   On  cross-motions  for  summary judgment,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  ruled that the five  grievances were arguably\r\n\nsubject  to  mandatory arbitration  and  that  the arbitrator\r\n\nshould resolve this issue.\r\n\n     Caribe has  appealed  the judgment  as  to four  of  the\r\n\ngrievances,  agreeing  that  the  Torr ns  matter  should  be\r\n\narbitrated.   Conversely,  the  union now  concedes that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  was  mistaken  in  referring  the  issue  of\r\n\narbitrability to  the arbitrator; but  it says that  all five\r\n\ngrievances are subject to  mandatory arbitration and that the\r\n\norder  to  arbitrate  should  be affirmed  outright  on  this\r\n\nalternative ground.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     Labor   arbitration   depends   upon    contract,   AT&amp;T\r                                                                         \r\n\nTechnologies,  Inc. v.

CBA art. XXXIV,   6(a).  But even if a grievance\r\n\nfalls  within this  category, it  is excluded  from mandatory\r\n\narbitration by section  7 of the  same article under  certain\r\n\nconditions, such as where the grievance\r\n\n     (f) Would require an  arbitrator to consider,  rule\r\n     on or decide any of the following: \r\n\n          (1)  The elements  of  an employee's  job\r\n          assignment;\r\n\n          (2) The title or other designations of an\r\n          employee's job classification;\r\n\n          (3) The right of  management to assign or\r\n          reassign work or elements of work.\r\n\n     The Supreme  Court has  held that \"[u]nless  the parties\r\n\nclearly and unmistakably provide  otherwise, the question  of\r\n\nwhether the parties agreed  to arbitrate is to be  decided by\r\n\nthe court, not the arbitrator.\"   AT&amp;T Technologies, 475 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 649.  Here,  far from agreeing to leave  the arbitrability\r\n\nissue  to  the  arbitrator,  the parties  provided  in  their\r\n\nagreement  that  in the  event of  a  dispute on  this issue,\r\n\narbitration  may proceed \"only after  a final [judgment] of a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nCourt  has  determined  that  the  grievance  .  .  .  raises\r\n\narbitrable issues.\"  CBA art. XXXIV,   4(a).\r\n\n     Thus, we agree with both parties that the district court\r\n\nwent  astray in  ordering arbitration without  first deciding\r\n\nitself  that   each  grievance   was  subject  to   mandatory\r\n\narbitration.  To  do so,  the court  had to  decide that  the\r\n\ngrievance fell  within a provision for  mandatory arbitration\r\n\n(e.g.,  section 6) and was not excluded by any other limiting\r                 \r\n\nprovision (e.g.,  section 7).   We  turn,  therefore, to  the\r                           \r\n\nunion's  request that  we decide  the issue  of arbitrability\r\n\nourselves and affirm the district court's arbitration order.\r\n\n     Since the union has not supplied us with the grievances,\r\n\nit is very hard to tell whether each one rests on a colorable\r\n\nclaim that  a specific  provision of  the agreement  has been\r\n\nviolated,  as  required by  section 6.    But even  with that\r\n\ninformation, we could not determine without  more information\r\n\nwhether  arbitration  of  each  grievance  would  \"require an\r\n\narbitrator  to consider,  rule  on  or  decide\"  one  of  the\r\n\nenumerated subjects that section 7(f) excludes from mandatory\r\n\narbitration.    For  the same  reason,  Caribe's  alternative\r\n\nrequest  that we  direct  summary judgment  in  its favor  is\r\n\nwithout merit.\r\n\n     While a  remand for further proceedings  is necessary, a\r\n\nfurther word  or two may be  helpful to the  court on remand.\r\n\nCaribe  has not  limited  its claim  of non-arbitrability  to\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nsection 7(f) but has also invoked other grounds of objection;\r\n\nsection 7(e) of the  same article, which Caribe has  cited on\r\n\nappeal, is a close  companion to section 7(f) and  might need\r\n\nattention.   But  we  are concerned  about Caribe's  repeated\r\n\ninvocation of two \"management  rights\" provisions as  shields\r\n\nagainst mandatory arbitration.\r\n\n      One is  the basic \"management rights\"  provision, in an\r\n\narticle unrelated  to arbitration,  which seems to  us wholly\r\n\nbeside  the point.   CBA  art. IV.   That  provision reserves\r\n\nmanagement  rights  broadly  over  a  range  of   potentially\r\n\npertinent subjects--such  as  reallocation of  work--but  the\r\n\nmanagement  rights   are  retained  \"subject  only  to  those\r\n\nprovisions  of this  Agreement which  expressly qualify  this\r\n\nright.\"   Given  this  \"subject .  . .  to\"  proviso, we  are\r\n\nbaffled  as  to  why  Caribe thinks  this  management  rights\r\n\nprovision has any relevance.   \r\n\n     The union's  grievance claims  may seem obscure;  but to\r\n\nthe  extent   they  rest  upon  the   violation  of  specific\r\n\nprovisions,   we  seriously   doubt  that   the   article  IV\r\n\n\"management  rights\" clause  could be  read either  to negate\r\n\nthose provisions  or to restrict  arbitration.  See  CBA art.\r                                                               \r\n\nXXXIV,    4(b)(4);  United  Steelworkers  v.

XXXIV,   4(b)(4), but it too appears to permit mandatory\r\n\narbitration--if  otherwise provided--so long as the grievance\r\n\nis based on an express limitation in the agreement and is not\r\n\nsubject to  section 7's exclusions.   See id.

Unless  both  conditions  are\r\n\nsatisfied, it appears  that mandatory  arbitration cannot  be\r\n\nordered,  so the district court may  not need to rule on both\r\n\nconditions.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     There  may  be  other  bases  for,  or  limitations  on,\r\n\nmandatory  arbitration  that  we  have  overlooked;   but  we\r\n\nencourage the  parties to help  the district court  focus the\r\n\nissues.   As already  noted,  we doubt  that the  management-\r\n\nrights reservations are pertinent.  And it certainly does not\r\n\nhelp  for the  union  to invoke  the Supreme  Court's default\r\n\npresumption  in  favor of  arbitration  where,  as here,  the\r\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreement   explicitly  negates   the\r\n\npresumption.

XXXIV,   4(b)(5);  AT&amp;T Technologies,\r                                                                        \r\n\n475 U.S. at 650.\r\n\n     Finally, it  is worth emphasizing that  the issue before\r\n\nthe  district court on remand in  this case is not the merits\r\n\nof the grievances; it  is simply whether they are  subject to\r\n\nmandatory arbitration.   All that the union  complained of in\r\n\nthis case  was the  failure to afford  mandatory arbitration,\r\n\nand that is the only issue  before us or the district  court.\r\n\nAT&amp;T Technologies, 475 U.S. at 649-50.  Needless to say, even\r                             \r\n\nif a  grievance is  excluded from mandatory  arbitration, the\r\n\nunion is not necessarily  without contractual remedies for an\r\n\nalleged violation of  the agreement.
