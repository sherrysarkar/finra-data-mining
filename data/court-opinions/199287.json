William G. Young, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Arthur J. Broadhurst, with whom John F. Lakin and Broadhurst,\nLakin & Lakin, were on brief, for appellant.\n\n     Christopher A. Duggan, with whom Kristen M. DeAngelo and Smith &\nDuggan, LLP, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 27, 2001\n\f-2-\n\f          Per Curiam. Plaintiff appeals from the denial of his motion\n\nto reconsider an order issued on August 11, 1998, by the federal\n\ndistrict court, remanding the case to the state court. Plaintiff's\n\nreal argument on appeal is with that portion of the order which\n\npurported to hold that the plaintiff was \"judicially stopped,\" when the\n\ncase was on remand to the state trial court, from recovering more than\n\n$75,000 in damages. We conclude we have jurisdiction to review that\n\nportion of the order and hold that once the district court concluded it\n\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, it did not retain\n\njurisdiction to make such an estoppel determination. We order the\n\nestoppel language only stricken from the August 11, 1998, remand order.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          This is a case that was originally filed in Massachusetts\n\nstate court, Essex County, on June 15, 1998.      Plaintiff Benjamin\n\nChristopher alleged that injuries suffered to his ankle as a result of\n\nan accident with a nail gun were attributable to Stanley-Bostitch,\n\nInc., the manufacturer of the gun. Specifically, Christopher charged\n\nStanley-Bostitch with failing to exercise reasonable care in the design\n\nof the nail gun, in breach of implied and/or express warranties of\n\nfitness and merchantability. While claiming \"severe and permanent\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdamages\" in the complaint, Christopher did not quantify his damages\n\nwith a dollar amount.1\n\n          On June 23, 1998, the Essex County Superior Court remanded\n\nthe action to the district court of Lawrence, Massachusetts, because\n\nChristopher had failed to allege special damages in excess of $25,000.\n\nChristopher promptly moved to re-transfer the case to superior court,\n\na motion that was again denied for failure to allege special damages.\n\nChristopher filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of the\n\nmotion to re-transfer, this time attaching a photograph and x-ray of\n\nthe injured ankle and a report from a treating physician. The report\n\nstated that permanent damage had been done to the ankle which caused\n\nchronic pain and rendered Christopher permanently disabled from the\n\ntype of work that he had performed prior to his injury. On July 23,\n\n1998, the court granted the motion for reconsideration, and the case\n\nwas transferred back to superior court.\n\n          While these events unfolded in the state courts, on July 20,\n\n1998, Stanley-Bostitch filed a notice of removal to federal court\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). Stanley-Bostitch claimed federal\n\njurisdiction under diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, alleging\n\n\n\n1 Christopher did not allege specific monetary damages in accordance\nwith Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 231, § 13B (West 2000): \"No complaint in\nany civil action shall contain an ad damnum or monetary amount claimed\nagainst any defendant, unless such ad damnum or monetary amount claimed\nindicates damages which are liquidated or ascertainable by calculation\n. . . .\"\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthat Christopher was a citizen of Massachusetts and that Stanley-\n\nBostitch was a citizen of Delaware (incorporation) and Rhode Island\n\n(principal place of business).      As evidence that the amount in\n\ncontroversy exceeded $75,000, Stanley-Bostitch offered that Christopher\n\nhad received workers' compensation benefits in excess of $85,000 for\n\nhis ankle injury.\n\n          In response to Stanley-Bostitch's removal action, Christopher\n\nfiled an \"opposition to defendant's request for removal\" (effectively\n\na motion to remand, 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)). Christopher's motion claimed\n\nthat Stanley-Bostitch had not met its burden of proof that the amount\n\nin controversy exceeded $75,000. Christopher made several assertions\n\ndesigned to imply that the value of the case did not exceed $75,000.\n\nFirst, he attached the superior court notice remanding the case to\n\nLawrence District Court, characterizing that action as based on a\n\n\"factual determination [by the superior court judge] that the\n\nplaintiff's damages could not exceed $25,000.\"       Christopher also\n\npointed out that the information regarding the workers' compensation\n\nsettlement that had been cited by Stanley-Bostitch was not attributed\n\nto any source, reliable or otherwise. Finally, Christopher made the\n\nlegal assertion that recovery of any lost wages that may have been part\n\nof the workers' compensation claim was barred by Mass. Gen. Laws Ann.\n\nch. 152, § 15 (West 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Stanley-Bostitch opposed Christopher's motion to remand.\n\nFirst, Stanley-Bostitch revealed the omissions and misstatements made\n\nby Christopher regarding the superior court's remand of the case to\n\nLawrence District Court. For example, despite Christopher's citation\n\nto the superior court's \"factual determination,\" the only factor\n\nmotivating the court's remand was Christopher's failure to provide a\n\nstatement regarding special damages. Christopher neglected to mention\n\nthat, following remand, Christopher had twice petitioned the superior\n\ncourt to re-transfer the case to superior court on the grounds that\n\n\"damages have greatly exceeded $25,000.00.\"        Most importantly,\n\nChristopher did not reveal to the federal district court that the case\n\nhad been re-transferred to the superior court from the state district\n\ncourt five days before Christopher filed his motion to remand. Put in\n\nthis context, Christopher's statement that the superior court had made\n\na \"factual determination\" that the case was not worth more than $25,000\n\nwas, at best, misleading and demonstrated a questionable lack of\n\nforthrightness to the federal court.\n\n          Stanley-Bostitch also provided an affidavit and a letter from\n\nCIGNA Property & Casualty attesting to the $85,000 in workers'\n\ncompensation that was paid out for Christopher's injury. Stanley-\n\nBostitch argued that, despite Christopher's assertion to the contrary,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152, § 15 (West 2000), does not prevent\n\nrecovery of Christopher's lost wages. If Christopher recovered lost\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fwages from Stanley-Bostitch, CIGNA, the insurer, would be entitled to\n\nreimbursement under § 15. Reimbursement, Stanley-Bostitch asserted,\n\nwould not affect the calculation of the amount in controversy for\n\npurposes of determining diversity jurisdiction.\n\n          The day after Stanley-Bostitch filed its opposition, August\n\n11, 1998, the district court issued the following order:\n\n          This case is ordered remanded to the\n          Massachusetts Superior Court sitting in and for\n          the County of Essex. The plaintiff due to the\n          position he has asserted herein, is judicially\n          stopped from recovering more than $75,000 in this\n          action.\n\nOn August 13, 1998, the notice of transfer of the records to Essex\n\nSuperior Courthouse was filed, and the parties found themselves back in\n\nstate superior court.\n\n          On November 23, 1999, more than one year after remand to\n\nstate court,2 Christopher filed a \"Motion for Clarification\" with the\n\nsuperior court. The motion requested that the superior court disregard\n\nthe portion of the district court's remand order that stopped\n\nChristopher from seeking more than $75,000 in recovery. As grounds for\n\nthis request, Christopher asserted that once the district court\n\n\n2 Christopher has offered no explanation for the delay in requesting\nreview of the district court's remand order. Stanley-Bostitch has\npointed out that by waiting more than one year from the filing of the\ncomplaint, Christopher has blocked Stanley-Bostitch from removing the\ncase again in the event that the \"estoppel\" portion of the order is\nvacated. 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b) (\"[A] case may not be removed on the\nbasis of jurisdiction conferred by section 1332 of this title more than\n1 year after commencement of the action.\").\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdetermined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, it\n\nlacked the authority to prevent Christopher from seeking more than\n\n$75,000. Stanley-Bostitch opposed the motion for clarification,\n\ncharacterizing the district court's action as an estoppel order, and\n\narguing that the elements for judicial estoppel were present. After a\n\nhearing, the superior court denied Christopher's motion for\n\nclarification on February 29, 2000.\n\n          It was at this point, March 8, 2000, more than a year and a\n\nhalf after the federal district court remanded the case to superior\n\ncourt, that Christopher filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\nremand order with the federal district court. Christopher asked the\n\ndistrict court either to vacate the portion of the order limiting\n\ndamages or, in the alternative, to revoke the remand and allow the case\n\nto proceed in federal court. In support of this motion, Christopher\n\nstated that he had never argued that the case was worth less than\n\n$75,000, but only that Stanley-Bostitch had failed to meet its burden\n\nregarding the amount in controversy.         In fact, according to\n\nChristopher, \"the Plaintiff has always contended that the value of this\n\ncase was over $75,000.00.\" As proof of this, Christopher attached his\n\nmotion filed in the superior court to re-transfer the case from the\n\nLawrence District Court, the very motion that Christopher had declined\n\nto reveal to the federal court in his original motion to remand. The\n\nnext day, the district court denied Christopher's motion for\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\freconsideration without elaboration. Christopher appeals the denial of\n\nreconsideration to this Court.\n\n                                II.\n\nA.   Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n          We start with the question about this court's jurisdiction\n\nover such an appeal. The district court remanded the case to state\n\ncourt. At the time that the court issued its order remanding the case,\n\nthe only ground pending for such a remand was lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction, either because the amount in controversy was not met, or\n\nbecause there was not a sufficient showing that it was met.3\n\n          Congress has expressly limited the jurisdiction of the courts\n\nof appeal over remand orders, providing that \"[a]n order remanding a\n\ncase to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on\n\nappeal or otherwise [excepting certain civil rights cases].\" 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1447(d). This limitation is intended to prevent prolonged litigation\n\nof the remand issue, see United States v. Rice, 327 U.S. 742, 751\n\n(1946), and to minimize interference in state court proceedings by the\n\nfederal courts, for reasons of comity, see In re La Providencia Dev.\n\nCorp., 406 F.2d 251, 252 (1st Cir. 1969). This limitation on review\n\nencompasses remands under § 1447(c) for lack of federal subject matter\n\njurisdiction, though appellate review may be available where the\n\n3    Appellate review has been hampered by the lack of any explanation\nof the district court's original remand order or of the denial of the\nmotion for reconsideration.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdistrict court remands on certain other grounds. See Thermtron Prods.,\n\nInc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 343-46 (1976). Because the remand\n\norder in this case is based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\n\nunder § 1447(d) there is no appellate jurisdiction to review the remand\n\ndetermination.\n\n          However, that leaves the interpretation of the second\n\nsentence of the order, in which the court stated that the plaintiff was\n\n\"judicially stopped\" from seeking more than $75,000 in damages. We\n\nunderstand this sentence to purport to determine the estoppel question\n\nin the state court proceeding. Section 1447(d) does not allow district\n\ncourts to insulate separate and severable concurrent orders from review\n\nmerely by attaching those orders to a remand order.         Where the\n\nconcurrent order of the court is severable from the remand order \"in\n\nlogic and in fact,\" that order may be reviewable. See City of Waco v.\n\nUnited States Fidelity & Guarantee Co., 293 U.S. 140 (1934); Carr v.\n\nAmerican Red Cross, 17 F.3d 671, 674-75 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"[W]e have\n\nembraced the principle that a district court cannot prevent appellate\n\nreview of a final collateral order by contemporaneously remanding a\n\ncase to state court.\").\n\n          Since the order issued by the district court not only\n\nremanded the case to state court but also purported to preclude the\n\nplaintiff from seeking damages in excess of $75,000, that latter\n\nportion of the order seeks to conclusively resolve estoppel issues\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\findependent from (and unnecessary to) the remand determination. Unlike\n\ndismissal on preemption grounds, where the preemption determination is\n\ninextricably intertwined with the remand decision, here the\n\ndetermination that the plaintiff should be estopped is not essential to\n\nthe decision to remand. Cf. Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d\n\n319 (1993) (no review of district court's decision to remand on grounds\n\nthat plaintiff's state law claim was not preempted by federal law). As\n\nsuch, the estoppel portion of the district court's order is subject to\n\nappellate review under the logic of City of Waco.\n\n          Alternatively, this court has previously treated attempted\n\nappeals from (possibly) unappealable orders as a petition for a writ of\n\nmandamus. See United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 769 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nsee also Phinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp., 199 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Collamore, 868 F.2d 24, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nMandamus can be appropriate in those rare cases in which the issuance\n\nof an order presents a question about the limits of judicial power,\n\nposes a risk of irreparable harm to the appellant, and is plainly\n\nerroneous, and the case for mandamus is particularly compelling where\n\nthe order poses an elemental question of judicial authority. See Horn,\n\n29 F.3d at 769-70.   Were this court lacking appellate jurisdiction\n\nover the estoppel portion of the order on direct appeal, we would find\n\nthis an appropriate instance for such mandamus jurisdiction and relief\n\nbecause the order, as discussed below, did two impermissible things:\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fit was entered when there was no federal jurisdiction and it purported\n\nto tell the state courts what to do.\n\nB.   District Court Jurisdiction\n\n          We conclude that, having determined that it lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over the case, the court lacked authority to make\n\nthe estoppel determination. Indeed, it impermissibly intruded into a\n\nmatter properly left to the state courts.4\n\n          The decision to remand the case to state court reflected the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover the case. When a federal court concludes that it lacks subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over a case, it is precluded from rendering any\n\njudgments on the merits of the case. See Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503\n\nU.S. 131, 137 (1992) (\"A final determination of lack of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction of a case in a federal court, of course, precludes further\n\nadjudication of it.\"); In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\" Prods. Liab.\n\nLitig., 132 F.3d 152, 155 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"If a court [ ] determines\n\nthat it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot decide the case on\n\nthe merits.\"); Wages v. I.R.S., 915 F.2d 1230, 1234 (9th Cir. 1990)\n\n(\"[W]e have held that a judge ordering a dismissal based upon lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction retains no power to make judgments relating\n\nto the merits of the case.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n4    While the scope of review of denials of motions for\nreconsideration is narrow, we consider the estoppel order to be plain\nerror.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          A court without subject matter jurisdiction may retain some\n\nlimited authority to protect its own independent interests in its\n\nprocedures. Compare Willy, 503 U.S. at 137-39 (allowing imposition of\n\nRule 11 sanctions for discovery violations to stand where court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over underlying matter), with United States\n\nCatholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U.S. 72,\n\n76-80 (1988) (refusing to enforce civil contempt order against nonparty\n\nfor violating discovery order where subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nthe underlying matter was found lacking on appeal). However, whatever\n\nincidental power the court retains cannot go to the merits of the\n\nunderlying action.    Rather, orders relating to the merits of the\n\nunderlying action are void if issued without subject matter\n\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Shirley v. Maxicare Texas, Inc., 921 F.2d 565\n\n(5th Cir. 1991) (\"Unless a federal court possesses subject matter\n\njurisdiction over a dispute, [ ] any order it makes (other than an\n\norder of dismissal or remand) is void.\"); see also Hernandez v. Conriv\n\nRealty Assoc., 182 F.3d 121, 123 (2d Cir. 1999) (district court lacking\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction cannot, as sanction, dismiss case with\n\nprejudice); In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\", 132 F.3d at 155-56 (same).\n\n          Having determined that the portion of the order requiring\n\nthat the plaintiff be \"judicially stopped\" from recovering more than\n\n$75,000 is not inextricably intertwined with the remand determination,\n\nwe find that the district court was without authority to issue the\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fjudicial estoppel order.5 We also note that the order violated basic\n\nprecepts of comity. Therefore, we vacate that portion of the order.\n\n          Subject matter jurisdiction is not a \"nicety of legal\n\nmetaphysics\" but rests instead on \"the central principle of a free\n\nsociety that courts have finite bounds of authority.\" See United\n\nStates Catholic Conference, 487 U.S. at 77. Courts must be careful to\n\nrespect these limits on their authority.\n\n                                III.\n\n          For these reasons, we remand with instructions to the\n\ndistrict court to vacate the second sentence of the August 11, 1998\n\norder of remand to the state court.     Otherwise, the remand order\n\nremains intact. Given concerns of comity, nothing in this opinion\n\nought to be construed to preclude the normal application of equitable\n\nprinciples or collateral estoppel rules by the state court. While the\n\nstate court may (or may not) decide that estoppel principles apply, it\n\n\n\n5    Apart from its jurisdictional infirmities and its infringement of\ncomity concerns, it is not clear that the estoppel order would have\nbeen appropriate for other reasons. As a matter of federal law,\nunappealable decisions generally do not have preclusive weight. See\nGonzález-García v. Williamson Dickie Mfg. Co., 99 F.3d 490, 492 (1st\nCir. 1996) (\"Because the district court's preemption finding is\nunreviewable, principles of collateral estoppel would not apply to\npreclude relitigation of the issue in state court.\"); Nutter, 4 F.3d at\n322 (\"[W]e do not believe the district court's jurisdictional findings\nincident to remand should preclude relitigation of the same issues in\nstate court.\"); see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 28(1)\n(stating that there is an exception to preclusion generally when \"[t]he\nparty against whom preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of law,\nhave obtained review of the judgment in the initial action\").\n\n                                -14-\n\fwas not the province of the federal district court to dictate that\n\nresult to the state court.   So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f",

The report stated that permanent damage had been done to the ankle which caused chronic pain and rendered Christopher permanently disabled from the type of work that he had performed prior to his injury. On July 23, 1998, the court granted the motion for reconsideration, and the case was transferred back to superior court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these events unfolded in the state courts, on July 20, 1998, Stanley-Bostitch filed a notice of removal to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;a1441(a). Stanley-Bostitch claimed federal jurisdiction under diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. &#167;a1332, alleging that Christopher was a citizen of Massachusetts and that Stanley-Bostitch was a citizen of Delaware (incorporation) and Rhode Island (principal place of business). As evidence that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, Stanley-Bostitch offered that Christopher had received workers' compensation benefits in excess of $85,000 for his ankle injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Stanley-Bostitch's removal action, Christopher filed an \"opposition to defendant's request for removal\" (effectively a motion to remand, 28 U.S.C. &#167;a1447(c)). Christopher's motion claimed that Stanley-Bostitch had not met its burden of proof that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. Christopher made several assertions designed to imply that the value of the case did not exceed $75,000. First, he attached the superior court notice remanding the case to Lawrence District Court, characterizing that action as based on a \"factual determination [by the superior court judge] that the plaintiff's damages could not exceed $25,000.\" Christopher also pointed out that the information regarding the workers' compensation settlement that had been cited by Stanley-Bostitch was not attributed to any source, reliable or otherwise. Finally, Christopher made the legal assertion that recovery of any lost wages that may have been part of the workers' compensation claim was barred by Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152, &#167;a15 (West 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanley-Bostitch opposed Christopher's motion to remand. First, Stanley-Bostitch revealed the omissions and misstatements made by Christopher regarding the superior court's remand of the case to Lawrence District Court. For example, despite Christopher's citation to the superior court's \"factual determination,\" the only factor motivating the court's remand was Christopher's failure to provide a statement regarding special damages. Christopher neglected to mention that, following remand, Christopher had twice petitioned the superior court to re-transfer the case to superior court on the grounds that \"damages have greatly exceeded $25,000.00.\" Most importantly, Christopher did not reveal to the federal district court that the case had been re-transferred to the superior court from the state district court five days before Christopher filed his motion to remand. Put in this context, Christopher's statement that the superior court had made a \"factual determination\" that the case was not worth more than $25,000 was, at best, misleading and demonstrated a questionable lack of forthrightness to the federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanley-Bostitch also provided an affidavit and a letter from CIGNA Property &amp; Casualty attesting to the $85,000 in workers' compensation that was paid out for Christopher's injury. Stanley-Bostitch argued that, despite Christopher's assertion to the contrary, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152, &#167;a15 (West 2000), does not prevent recovery of Christopher's lost wages. If Christopher recovered lost wages from Stanley-Bostitch, CIGNA, the insurer, would be entitled to reimbursement under &#167;a15. Reimbursement, Stanley-Bostitch asserted, would not affect the calculation of the amount in controversy for purposes of determining diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day after Stanley-Bostitch filed its opposition, August 11, 1998, the district court issued the following order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is ordered remanded to the Massachusetts Superior Court sitting in and for the County of Essex. The plaintiff due to the position he has asserted herein, is judicially stopped from recovering more than $75,000 in this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1998, the notice of transfer of the records to Essex Superior Courthouse was filed, and the parties found themselves back in state superior court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 23, 1999, more than one year after remand to state court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Christopher filed a \"Motion for Clarification\" with the superior court. The motion requested that the superior court disregard the portion of the district court's remand order that stopped Christopher from seeking more than $75,000 in recovery. As grounds for this request, Christopher asserted that once the district court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, it lacked the authority to prevent Christopher from seeking more than $75,000. Stanley-Bostitch opposed the motion for clarification, characterizing the district court's action as an estoppel order, and arguing that the elements for judicial estoppel were present. After a hearing, the superior court denied Christopher's motion for clarification on Februarya29, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was at this point, March 8, 2000, more than a year and a half after the federal district court remanded the case to superior court, that Christopher filed a motion for reconsideration of the remand order with the federal district court. Christopher asked the district court either to vacate the portion of the order limiting damages or, in the alternative, to revoke the remand and allow the case to proceed in federal court. In support of this motion, Christopher stated that he had never argued that the case was worth less than $75,000, but only that Stanley-Bostitch had failed to meet its burden regarding the amount in controversy. In fact, according to Christopher, \"the Plaintiff has always contended that the value of this case was over $75,000.00.\" As proof of this, Christopher attached his motion filed in the superior court to re-transfer the case from the Lawrence District Court, the very motion that Christopher had declined to reveal to the federal court in his original motion to remand. The next day, the district court denied Christopher's motion for reconsideration without elaboration. Christopher appeals the denial of reconsideration to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the question about this court's jurisdiction over such an appeal. The district court remanded the case to state court. At the time that the court issued its order remanding the case, the only ground pending for such a remand was lack of subject matter jurisdiction, either because the amount in controversy was not met, or because there was not a sufficient showing that it was met.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has expressly limited the jurisdiction of the courts of appeal over remand orders, providing that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise [excepting certain civil rights cases].\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(d). This limitation is intended to prevent prolonged litigation of the remand issue, see United States v. Rice, 327 U.S. 742, 751 (1946), and to minimize interference in state court proceedings by the federal courts, for reasons of comity, see In re La Providencia Dev. Corp., 406 F.2d 251, 252 (1st Cir. 1969). This limitation on review encompasses remands under &#167; 1447(c) for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction, though appellate review may be available where the district court remands on certain other grounds. See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 343-46 (1976). Because the remand order in this case is based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under &#167; 1447(d) there is no appellate jurisdiction to review the remand determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, that leaves the interpretation of the second sentence of the order, in which the court stated that the plaintiff was \"judicially stopped\" from seeking more than $75,000 in damages. We understand this sentence to purport to determine the estoppel question in the state court proceeding. Section 1447(d) does not allow district courts to insulate separate and severable concurrent orders from review merely by attaching those orders to a remand order. Where the concurrent order of the court is severable from the remand order \"in logic and in fact,\" that order may be reviewable. See City of Waco v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Co., 293 U.S. 140 (1934); Carr v. American Red Cross, 17 F.3d 671, 674-75 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"[W]e have embraced the principle that a district court cannot prevent appellate review of a final collateral order by contemporaneously remanding a case to state court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the order issued by the district court not only remanded the case to state court but also purported to preclude the plaintiff from seeking damages in excess of $75,000, that latter portion of the order seeks to conclusively resolve estoppel issues independent from (and unnecessary to) the remand determination. Unlike dismissal on preemption grounds, where the preemption determination is inextricably intertwined with the remand decision, here the determination that the plaintiff should be estopped is not essential to the decision to remand. Cf. Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., 4 F.3d 319 (1993) (no review of district court's decision to remand on grounds that plaintiff's state law claim was not preempted by federal law). As such, the estoppel portion of the district court's order is subject to appellate review under the logic of City of Waco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, this court has previously treated attempted appeals from (possibly) unappealable orders as a petition for a writ of mandamus. See United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 769 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Phinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp., 199 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Collamore, 868 F.2d 24, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1989). Mandamus can be appropriate in those rare cases in which the issuance of an order presents a question about the limits of judicial power, poses a risk of irreparable harm to the appellant, and is plainly erroneous, and the case for mandamus is particularly compelling where the order poses an elemental question of judicial authority. See Horn, 29 F.3d at 769-70. Were this court lacking appellate jurisdiction over the estoppel portion of the order on direct appeal, we would find this an appropriate instance for such mandamus jurisdiction and relief because the order, as discussed below, did two impermissible things: it was entered when there was no federal jurisdiction and it purported to tell the state courts what to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. District Court Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, having determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, the court lacked authority to make the estoppel determination. Indeed, it impermissibly intruded into a matter properly left to the state courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to remand the case to state court reflected the district court's conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. When a federal court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case, it is precluded from rendering any judgments on the merits of the case. See Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503 U.S. 131, 137 (1992) (\"A final determination of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction of a case in a federal court, of course, precludes further adjudication of it.\"); In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\" Prods. Liab. Litig., 132 F.3d 152, 155 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"If a court [ ] determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot decide the case on the merits.\"); Wages v. I.R.S., 915 F.2d 1230, 1234 (9th Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e have held that a judge ordering a dismissal based upon lack of subject matter jurisdiction retains no power to make judgments relating to the merits of the case.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court without subject matter jurisdiction may retain some limited authority to protect its own independent interests in its procedures. Compare Willy, 503 U.S. at 137-39 (allowing imposition of Rule 11 sanctions for discovery violations to stand where court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over underlying matter), with United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U.S. 72, 76-80 (1988) (refusing to enforce civil contempt order against nonparty for violating discovery order where subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying matter was found lacking on appeal). However, whatever incidental power the court retains cannot go to the merits of the underlying action. Rather, orders relating to the merits of the underlying action are void if issued without subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Shirley v. Maxicare Texas, Inc., 921 F.2d 565 (5th Cir. 1991) (\"Unless a federal court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute, [ ] any order it makes (other than an order of dismissal or remand) is void.\"); see also Hernandez v. Conriv Realty Assoc., 182 F.3d 121, 123 (2d Cir. 1999) (district court lacking subject matter jurisdiction cannot, as sanction, dismiss case with prejudice); In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\", 132 F.3d at 155-56 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the portion of the order requiring that the plaintiff be \"judicially stopped\" from recovering more than $75,000 is not inextricably intertwined with the remand determination, we find that the district court was without authority to issue the judicial estoppel order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We also note that the order violated basic precepts of comity. Therefore, we vacate that portion of the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject matter jurisdiction is not a \"nicety of legal metaphysics\" but rests instead on \"the central principle of a free society that courts have finite bounds of authority.\" See United States Catholic Conference, 487 U.S. at 77. Courts must be careful to respect these limits on their authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we remand with instructions to the district court to vacate the second sentence of the August 11, 1998 order of remand to the state court. Otherwise, the remand order remains intact. Given concerns of comity, nothing in this opinion ought to be construed to preclude the normal application of equitable principles or collateral estoppel rules by the state court. While the state court may (or may not) decide that estoppel principles apply, it was not the province of the federal district court to dictate that result to the state court. So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Christopher did not allege specific monetary damages in accordance with Mass.

Plaintiff's real argument on appeal is with that portion of the order which purported to hold that the plaintiff was \"judicially stopped,\" when the case was on remand to the state trial court, from recovering more than $75,000 in damages. We conclude we have jurisdiction to review that portion of the order and hold that once the district court concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, it did not retain jurisdiction to make such an estoppel determination.

Plaintiff Benjamin Christopher alleged that injuries suffered to his ankle as a result of an accident with a nail gun were attributable to Stanley-Bostitch, Inc., the manufacturer of the gun. Specifically, Christopher charged Stanley-Bostitch with failing to exercise reasonable care in the design of the nail gun, in breach of implied and/or express warranties of fitness and merchantability. While claiming \"severe and permanent damages\" in the complaint, Christopher did not quantify his damages with a dollar amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1998, the Essex County Superior Court remanded the action to the district court of Lawrence, Massachusetts, because Christopher had failed to allege special damages in excess of $25,000. Christopher promptly moved to re-transfer the case to superior court, a motion that was again denied for failure to allege special damages. Christopher filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to re-transfer, this time attaching a photograph and x-ray of the injured ankle and a report from a treating physician. The report stated that permanent damage had been done to the ankle which caused chronic pain and rendered Christopher permanently disabled from the type of work that he had performed prior to his injury. On July 23, 1998, the court granted the motion for reconsideration, and the case was transferred back to superior court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these events unfolded in the state courts, on July 20, 1998, Stanley-Bostitch filed a notice of removal to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;a1441(a). Stanley-Bostitch claimed federal jurisdiction under diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. &#167;a1332, alleging that Christopher was a citizen of Massachusetts and that Stanley-Bostitch was a citizen of Delaware (incorporation) and Rhode Island (principal place of business). As evidence that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, Stanley-Bostitch offered that Christopher had received workers' compensation benefits in excess of $85,000 for his ankle injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Stanley-Bostitch's removal action, Christopher filed an \"opposition to defendant's request for removal\" (effectively a motion to remand, 28 U.S.C. &#167;a1447(c)). Christopher's motion claimed that Stanley-Bostitch had not met its burden of proof that the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. Christopher made several assertions designed to imply that the value of the case did not exceed $75,000. First, he attached the superior court notice remanding the case to Lawrence District Court, characterizing that action as based on a \"factual determination [by the superior court judge] that the plaintiff's damages could not exceed $25,000.\" Christopher also pointed out that the information regarding the workers' compensation settlement that had been cited by Stanley-Bostitch was not attributed to any source, reliable or otherwise. Finally, Christopher made the legal assertion that recovery of any lost wages that may have been part of the workers' compensation claim was barred by Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152, &#167;a15 (West 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanley-Bostitch opposed Christopher's motion to remand. First, Stanley-Bostitch revealed the omissions and misstatements made by Christopher regarding the superior court's remand of the case to Lawrence District Court. For example, despite Christopher's citation to the superior court's \"factual determination,\" the only factor motivating the court's remand was Christopher's failure to provide a statement regarding special damages. Christopher neglected to mention that, following remand, Christopher had twice petitioned the superior court to re-transfer the case to superior court on the grounds that \"damages have greatly exceeded $25,000.00.\" Most importantly, Christopher did not reveal to the federal district court that the case had been re-transferred to the superior court from the state district court five days before Christopher filed his motion to remand. Put in this context, Christopher's statement that the superior court had made a \"factual determination\" that the case was not worth more than $25,000 was, at best, misleading and demonstrated a questionable lack of forthrightness to the federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stanley-Bostitch also provided an affidavit and a letter from CIGNA Property &amp; Casualty attesting to the $85,000 in workers' compensation that was paid out for Christopher's injury. Stanley-Bostitch argued that, despite Christopher's assertion to the contrary, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152, &#167;a15 (West 2000), does not prevent recovery of Christopher's lost wages. If Christopher recovered lost wages from Stanley-Bostitch, CIGNA, the insurer, would be entitled to reimbursement under &#167;a15.

The plaintiff due to the position he has asserted herein, is judicially stopped from recovering more than $75,000 in this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1998, the notice of transfer of the records to Essex Superior Courthouse was filed, and the parties found themselves back in state superior court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 23, 1999, more than one year after remand to state court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Christopher filed a \"Motion for Clarification\" with the superior court. The motion requested that the superior court disregard the portion of the district court's remand order that stopped Christopher from seeking more than $75,000 in recovery. As grounds for this request, Christopher asserted that once the district court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, it lacked the authority to prevent Christopher from seeking more than $75,000. Stanley-Bostitch opposed the motion for clarification, characterizing the district court's action as an estoppel order, and arguing that the elements for judicial estoppel were present. After a hearing, the superior court denied Christopher's motion for clarification on Februarya29, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was at this point, March 8, 2000, more than a year and a half after the federal district court remanded the case to superior court, that Christopher filed a motion for reconsideration of the remand order with the federal district court. Christopher asked the district court either to vacate the portion of the order limiting damages or, in the alternative, to revoke the remand and allow the case to proceed in federal court. In support of this motion, Christopher stated that he had never argued that the case was worth less than $75,000, but only that Stanley-Bostitch had failed to meet its burden regarding the amount in controversy. In fact, according to Christopher, \"the Plaintiff has always contended that the value of this case was over $75,000.00.\" As proof of this, Christopher attached his motion filed in the superior court to re-transfer the case from the Lawrence District Court, the very motion that Christopher had declined to reveal to the federal court in his original motion to remand. The next day, the district court denied Christopher's motion for reconsideration without elaboration. Christopher appeals the denial of reconsideration to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the question about this court's jurisdiction over such an appeal. The district court remanded the case to state court. At the time that the court issued its order remanding the case, the only ground pending for such a remand was lack of subject matter jurisdiction, either because the amount in controversy was not met, or because there was not a sufficient showing that it was met.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has expressly limited the jurisdiction of the courts of appeal over remand orders, providing that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise [excepting certain civil rights cases].\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(d). This limitation is intended to prevent prolonged litigation of the remand issue, see United States v. Rice, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104276\"><a href=\"/opinion/104276/united-states-v-rice/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 751 (1946), and to minimize interference in state court proceedings by the federal courts, for reasons of comity, see In re La Providencia Dev. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"283226\"><a href=\"/opinion/283226/in-re-la-providencia-development-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 252 (1st Cir. 1969). This limitation on review encompasses remands under &#167; 1447(c) for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction, though appellate review may be available where the district court remands on certain other grounds. See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109348\"><a href=\"/opinion/109348/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 343-46 (1976). Because the remand order in this case is based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under &#167; 1447(d) there is no appellate jurisdiction to review the remand determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, that leaves the interpretation of the second sentence of the order, in which the court stated that the plaintiff was \"judicially stopped\" from seeking more than $75,000 in damages. We understand this sentence to purport to determine the estoppel question in the state court proceeding. Section 1447(d) does not allow district courts to insulate separate and severable concurrent orders from review merely by attaching those orders to a remand order. Where the concurrent order of the court is severable from the remand order \"in logic and in fact,\" that order may be reviewable. See City of Waco v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102318\"><a href=\"/opinion/102318/waco-v-united-states-fidelity-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span> (1934); Carr v. American Red Cross, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664066\"><a href=\"/opinion/664066/patrick-carr-v-american-red-cross-osteopathic-medical-center-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 674-75 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"[W]e have embraced the principle that a district court cannot prevent appellate review of a final collateral order by contemporaneously remanding a case to state court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the order issued by the district court not only remanded the case to state court but also purported to preclude the plaintiff from seeking damages in excess of $75,000, that latter portion of the order seeks to conclusively resolve estoppel issues independent from (and unnecessary to) the remand determination. Unlike dismissal on preemption grounds, where the preemption determination is inextricably intertwined with the remand decision, here the determination that the plaintiff should be estopped is not essential to the decision to remand. Cf. Nutter v. Monongahela Power Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629146\"><a href=\"/opinion/629146/bruce-nutter-v-monongahela-power-company-in-re-monongahela-power-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span> (1993) (no review of district court's decision to remand on grounds that plaintiff's state law claim was not preempted by federal law). As such, the estoppel portion of the district court's order is subject to appellate review under the logic of City of Waco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, this court has previously treated attempted appeals from (possibly) unappealable orders as a petition for a writ of mandamus. See United States v. Horn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674595\"><a href=\"/opinion/674595/united-states-v-richard-a-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Phinney v. Wentworth Douglas Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198735\"><a href=\"/opinion/198735/phinney-v-paulshock/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Collamore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518739\"><a href=\"/opinion/518739/united-states-v-wayne-n-collamore-in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1989). Mandamus can be appropriate in those rare cases in which the issuance of an order presents a question about the limits of judicial power, poses a risk of irreparable harm to the appellant, and is plainly erroneous, and the case for mandamus is particularly compelling where the order poses an elemental question of judicial authority. See Horn, 29 F.3d at 769-70. Were this court lacking appellate jurisdiction over the estoppel portion of the order on direct appeal, we would find this an appropriate instance for such mandamus jurisdiction and relief because the order, as discussed below, did two impermissible things: it was entered when there was no federal jurisdiction and it purported to tell the state courts what to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. District Court Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, having determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case, the court lacked authority to make the estoppel determination. Indeed, it impermissibly intruded into a matter properly left to the state courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to remand the case to state court reflected the district court's conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. When a federal court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case, it is precluded from rendering any judgments on the merits of the case. See Willy v. Coastal Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112700\"><a href=\"/opinion/112700/willy-v-coastal-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span>, 137 (1992) (\"A final determination of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction of a case in a federal court, of course, precludes further adjudication of it.\"); In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\" Prods. Liab. Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749803\"><a href=\"/opinion/749803/in-re-orthopedic-bone-screw-products-liability-litigation-mdl-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 155 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"If a court [ ] determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it cannot decide the case on the merits.\"); Wages v. I.R.S., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></span>, 1234 (9th Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e have held that a judge ordering a dismissal based upon lack of subject matter jurisdiction retains no power to make judgments relating to the merits of the case.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court without subject matter jurisdiction may retain some limited authority to protect its own independent interests in its procedures. Compare Willy, 503 U.S. at 137-39 (allowing imposition of Rule 11 sanctions for discovery violations to stand where court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over underlying matter), with United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112118\"><a href=\"/opinion/112118/united-statescatholic-conference-v-abortion-rights-mobilization-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 76-80 (1988) (refusing to enforce civil contempt order against nonparty for violating discovery order where subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying matter was found lacking on appeal). However, whatever incidental power the court retains cannot go to the merits of the underlying action. Rather, orders relating to the merits of the underlying action are void if issued without subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Shirley v. Maxicare Texas, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553199\"><a href=\"/opinion/553199/kathleen-denise-shirley-v-maxicare-texas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1991) (\"Unless a federal court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute, [ ] any order it makes (other than an order of dismissal or remand) is void.\"); see also Hernandez v. Conriv Realty Assoc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764991\"><a href=\"/opinion/764991/angel-hernandez-v-conriv-realty-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, 123 (2d Cir. 1999) (district court lacking subject matter jurisdiction cannot, as sanction, dismiss case with prejudice); In re Orthopedic \"Bone Screw\", 132 F.3d at 155-56 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the portion of the order requiring that the plaintiff be \"judicially stopped\" from recovering more than $75,000 is not inextricably intertwined with the remand determination, we find that the district court was without authority to issue the judicial estoppel order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We also note that the order violated basic precepts of comity. Therefore, we vacate that portion of the order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subject matter jurisdiction is not a \"nicety of legal metaphysics\" but rests instead on \"the central principle of a free society that courts have finite bounds of authority.\" See United States Catholic Conference, 487 U.S. at 77. Courts must be careful to respect these limits on their authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we remand with instructions to the district court to vacate the second sentence of the August 11, 1998 order of remand to the state court. Otherwise, the remand order remains intact. Given concerns of comity, nothing in this opinion ought to be construed to preclude the normal application of equitable principles or collateral estoppel rules by the state court. While the state court may (or may not) decide that estoppel principles apply, it was not the province of the federal district court to dictate that result to the state court. So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Christopher did not allege specific monetary damages in accordance with Mass.
