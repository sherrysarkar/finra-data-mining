The  plaintiff,  George\r                      LYNCH,   Circuit  Judge.\r                                             \r\n\nHiggins, and the defendants,  Eric Eichler and Peter DiLullo,\r\n\nare general partners in a number of real estate partnerships.\r\n\nHiggins, a  \"national\" partner who had been  involved in over\r\n\nninety partnerships,  retired from  active management of  the\r\n\npartnerships  in  1988  but  continues to  own  interests  in\r\n\nseveral of the partnerships.   After his retirement, Higgins'\r\n\nrelationship with Eichler and  DiLullo apparently soured.  In\r\n\nAugust  of 1995,  Higgins  sued his  partners  in the  United\r\n\nStates District  Court for  the District of  Massachusetts on\r\n\nthe theory that  they had breached their fiduciary  duties to\r\n\nhim  by  implementing  a   scheme  to  prevent  Higgins  from\r\n\nreceiving his  share of the partnerships'  proceeds.  Higgins\r\n\nalso   sued  Eichler   and  L.P.   Corporation  (\"L.P.\"),   a\r\n\nPennsylvania close corporation formed by the partners for the\r\n\npurpose of  performing  accounting functions  and  cash  flow\r\n\nmanagement for the various partnerships, in the United States\r\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\r\n\n          Defendants  moved  to  dismiss   the  Massachusetts\r\n\naction,  and asked, in the alternative, for this action to be\r\n\ntransferred to  the Pennsylvania court pursuant  to 28 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1404(a).   Defendants argued  that the complaint  should be\r\n\ndismissed because, among other defects,  it failed to state a\r\n\nclaim  upon which  relief  could be  granted.   According  to\r\n\ndefendants,  the gravamen  of plaintiff's complaint  was that\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthe value  of his Individual Partnership  Account (\"IPA\") was\r\n\nless  than it should  be.  However,  defendants asserted, the\r\n\nflow  of funds to Higgins'  IPA was regulated  by a contract,\r\n\nthe Netting Out Agreement (\"NOA\"), to which Higgins and  L.P.\r\n\nwere  the   only  parties.    Therefore,  defendants  argued,\r\n\nHiggins' claim could not run against Eichler and  DiLullo, as\r\n\nthey were not parties to Higgins' NOA.\r\n\n          The  Massachusetts court  dismissed the  action for\r\n\nfailure  to state a  claim.1  See  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\r                                             \r\n\nThe court found that  the alleged injury was not  \"within the\r\n\nscope of any particular real estate partnership,\" and instead\r\n\nwas caused by the corporation, L.P.  The court opined that no\r\n\nclaim  for  breach of  fiduciary duty  owed  to Higgins  as a\r\n\npartner was stated.  The court indicated that plaintiff might\r\n\nhave  a breach of contract  action against L.P.,  which was a\r\n\nnecessary party to such a claim, but noted that plaintiff had\r\n\nnot offered any evidence that the Massachusetts federal court\r\n\nwould   have   jurisdiction   over   L.P.,   a   Pennsylvania\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The district court  declined to treat  the motion as  one\r\nfor   summary  judgment   although   the  parties   submitted\r\nadditional materials  and  affidavits.   Plaintiff  complains\r\nthat  the  district  court selectively  chose  certain  facts\r\nsubmitted  by  defendants  to  support  the  dismissal, while\r\nignoring other  facts in  the supplemental  submissions which\r\nwere favorable to his  claim.  Because we resolve  the issues\r\npresented on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to resolve\r\nthis claim of procedural error.  Plaintiff does not object to\r\nthis court's consideration of the NOA, which is referenced in\r\nthe complaint  and is central to it.   See Fudge v. Penthouse\r                                                                         \r\nInt'l,  Ltd., 840 F.2d  1012, 1015 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n488 U.S. 821 (1988).\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ncorporation.  We  reverse and  remand to  the district  court\r\n\nwith  instructions  to  transfer  the  case  to  the  Eastern\r\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\r\n\n          Our review of the allowance of a motion to  dismiss\r\n\nfor  failure to  state  a claim  is  plenary.   See  Barrios-\r                                                                         \r\n\nVelasquez  v. Asociacion  de Empleados,  84 F.3d  487, 489-90\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1996).  The allegations of the complaint are taken\r\n\nas true and all  reasonable inferences are drawn in  favor of\r\n\nHiggins.   See id.  We  will affirm the dismissal  only if it\r                              \r\n\nappears, to a certainty,  that there is no set  of facts upon\r\n\nwhich plaintiff may recover.  See Roma Constr. Co. v. aRusso,\r                                                                        \r\n\n96 F.3d 566, 569 (1st Cir. 1996).   \r\n\n          The  parties have largely argued Massachusetts law,\r\n\nwithout  a  full  briefing  as to  whether  Massachusetts  or\r\n\nPennsylvania law  applies.  Because the parties  have pointed\r\n\nto no  material differences between the  law of Massachusetts\r\n\nand  the  law  of  Pennsylvania  as  to  partners'  fiduciary\r\n\nobligations, we look primarily to Massachusetts law.  \r\n\n          It is abundantly clear that partners owe each other\r\n\na fiduciary duty.  See Wartski v. Bedford, 926 F.2d 11, 13-14\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (surveying  Massachusetts law).  The question\r\n\nhere goes to  the extent of that duty.   \"[P]artners owe each\r\n\nother  a  fiduciary  duty  of  'the  utmost  good  faith  and\r\n\nloyalty.'\"   Id. at 13  (quoting Meehan  v. Shaughnessy,  535\r                                                                   \r\n\nN.E.2d 1255, 1263 (Mass. 1989)).  \"'As a fiduciary, a partner\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nmust consider his or her partners'  welfare, and refrain from\r\n\nacting  for purely  private gain.'\"    Id. at  13-14 (quoting\r                                                      \r\n\nMeehan, 535 N.E.2d at 1263).\r                  \r\n\n          Provisions of the Uniform Partnership Act have been\r\n\nadopted by Massachusetts, notably that:\r\n\n          Every   partner   must  account   to  the\r\n          partnership for any benefit, and  hold as\r\n          trustee for it any profits derived by him\r\n          without the consent of the other partners\r\n          from any transaction  connected with  the\r\n          formation, conduct or liquidation  of the\r\n          partnership or from any use by him of its\r\n          property.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 108A,   21(1).2\r\n\n          Against   these  standards,  we  review  the  facts\r\n\nalleged, drawing all reasonable inferences for the plaintiff.\r\n\nWe discuss only those facts alleged necessary to test whether\r\n\na claim  has  been stated.     From  the allegations  of  the\r\n\ncomplaint, it would be reasonable to infer that the myriad of\r\n\nvarious  real  estate  partnerships   in  which  the  parties\r\n\ninvested were treated, for some purposes, as a single  entity\r\n\nand that  the participants  regarded each other  as partners.\r\n\nHiggins alleges  that Eichler,  as chairman of  the partners'\r\n\n\"Executive Committee,\" and assisted by DiLullo, exercised  de\r\n\nfacto  control  over   the  partnerships.     The  accounting\r\n\nfunctions of  the partnerships in toto were performed by L.P,\r                                                  \r\n\na corporation created for  that purpose under the NOA.   Each\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Pennsylvania law contains an identical provision.  See 15\r                                                                      \r\nPa. Cons. Stat. Ann.   8334(a).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\npartner  entered into a separate  NOA with L.P.   Pursuant to\r\n\nthe NOA, partnership proceeds  were paid into partners' IPAs.\r\n\n          In  1993, Eichler  and DiLullo,  as members  of the\r\n\nExecutive Committee,  implemented a  program called the  \"IPA\r\n\nCleanup Program.\"  The Cleanup Program generally operated for\r\n\nthe benefit of active  -- as opposed to retired  -- partners.\r\n\nUnder  the  program, uncollectible  debts  owed  by insolvent\r\n\npartners to the partnerships were forgiven, and the resulting\r\n\nlosses were allocated to  the IPAs of solvent  partners, thus\r\n\nallowing the active solvent  partners to take tax deductions.\r\n\nAdditional  debt  forgiveness  adjustments were  made  to the\r\n\npartners' IPAs in 1994.\r\n\n          Higgins  did not  consent  to these  changes.   The\r\n\nCleanup Program  was implemented  anyway and $1.8  million in\r\n\nlosses  was  allocated to  Higgins'  account.   As  a result,\r\n\nHiggins, rather than having a positive balance in his IPA and\r\n\nreceiving  income  from  his  investments, was  left  with  a\r\n\nnegative balance and did not receive any partnership draws.\r\n\n          Higgins' complaint  alleges  that the  IPA  Cleanup\r\n\nProgram was a self-dealing scheme  by Eichler and DiLullo and\r\n\nconstitutes  a breach  of their  fiduciary duty  as partners.\r\n\nDefendants contend that their fiduciary duties ended when the\r\n\npartnership income  was transferred  to L.P. and  that, while\r\n\nplaintiff may have a cause of  action against L.P., he has no\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nclaim of breach of fiduciary duty against them.  The district\r\n\ncourt  agreed   with   the  defendants,   holding  that   the\r\n\ndefendants' actions were outside the scope of the partnership\r\n\nbecause  the  relevant  acts,  even if  attributable  to  the\r\n\ndefendants, were performed in their role as officers of L.P.,\r\n\nan entity  separate, in the  district court's view,  from the\r\n\npartnerships.\r\n\n          This  is, in our  estimation, too narrow  a view of\r\n\nthe  allegations,  as the  record  now  stands unfocussed  by\r\n\nfactual  development, and the law.  It is reasonable to infer\r\n\nthat  the  functions   performed  by  L.P.   were  accounting\r\n\nfunctions   previously   performed   by    the   partnerships\r\n\nthemselves; that L.P. was established for the sole purpose of\r\n\nadministering those  functions; that L.P. simply  received in\r\n\npartnership income and then distributed it out; and that L.P.\r\n\nwas merely an  agent of the  partnerships.  These  inferences\r\n\nare supported by the NOA  itself, which states that  \"Partner\r\n\nand Participants have selected  [L.P.] as the business entity\r\n\nto  conduct  day  to   day  operations,  perform   accounting\r\n\nfunctions  and  to assist  in  cash  planning  and cash  flow\r\n\nmanagement  for  the  Enterprises.\"  Higgins'  NOA,  although\r\n\nexecuted  only  by  Higgins   and  L.P.,  is  also  expressly\r\n\nconditioned  on  all  of  the  participants  in  the  various\r\n\npartnerships  signing identical  agreements, and  states that\r\n\nthese agreements  \"shall be  for the  mutual benefit of  such\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nexecuting Participants, Agent, Partner and  the other parties\r\n\nto  such agreements.\"   Plaintiff also alleges  that L.P. was\r\n\nunder the control of the defendants and did what they wanted.\r\n\nThe NOA  itself can be read  to suggest that L.P.  on its own\r\n\nhad no authority  to execute a scheme such as the IPA Cleanup\r\n\nProgram.   It was pursuant to that scheme that plaintiff was,\r\n\nhe alleges, deprived of  partnership income owed to him.   It\r\n\nthus  may  be inferred  that L.P.,  rather  than acting  as a\r\n\nseparate entity with regard to the alleged scheme, was merely\r\n\nan arm or instrumentality of the partnerships.\r\n\n          The   Supreme   Judicial  Court   of  Massachusetts\r\n\nrecently  upheld a jury verdict  in a case  involving a claim\r\n\nthat two  law partners had deprived the  plaintiff partner of\r\n\nhis  fair share  of partnership  proceeds by  choosing unfair\r\n\nmethods  of accounting  for  partnership profits.   Starr  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFordham, 648 N.E.2d  1261 (Mass. 1995).  The court recognized\r                   \r\n\nthe  potential for  self-dealing  where certain  partners  in\r\n\nessence control the distributions to another partner:\r\n\n          The  founding  partners were  responsible\r\n          for  dividing  the partnership's  profits\r\n          and   assigning   to  each   partner  his\r\n          respective share of  the profits.   Thus,\r\n          the  founding  partners  had  some  self-\r\n          interest  in  designating each  partner's\r\n          respective share of  the profits  because\r\n          the percentage of profits which they were\r\n          assigning to  the  other partners  had  a\r\n          direct  effect on their own percentage of\r\n          the profits.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nId. at 1265.   Accordingly,  the court placed  the burden  of\r               \r\n\nproving  that the  distribution of  profits  was fair  on the\r\n\ndefendants.  Id.\r                            \r\n\n          We  are  unprepared to  say,  in the  context  of a\r\n\nmotion  to   dismiss,  that  Massachusetts  law  would  never\r\n\nrecognize  a claim  for  breach of  fiduciary duty  where, as\r\n\ndescribed above, the  instrument used to deprive a partner of\r\n\nhis partnership income was simply an arm  of the partnership,\r\n\nand was under the control of the defendant partners.\r\n\n          We think it better that the  questions in this case\r\n\nbe resolved  in the  context of further  factual development.\r\n\nAs Justice  Frankfurter stated in  SEC v. Chenery  Corp., 318\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 80 (1943):\r\n\n               [To] say  that a man is  a fiduciary only\r\n               begins the analysis;  it gives  direction\r\n               to  further inquiry.

Higgins, a \"national\" partner who had been involved in over ninety partnerships, retired from active management of the partnerships in 1988 but continues to own interests in several of the partnerships.  After his retirement, Higgins' relationship with Eichler and DiLullo apparently soured.  In August of 1995, Higgins sued his partners in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on the theory that they had breached their fiduciary duties to him by implementing a scheme to prevent Higgins from receiving his share of the partnerships' proceeds.  Higgins also sued Eichler and L.P. Corporation (\"L.P.\"), a Pennsylvania close corporation formed by the partners for the purpose of performing accounting functions and cash flow management for the various partnerships, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved to dismiss the Massachusetts action, and asked, in the alternative, for this action to be transferred to the Pennsylvania court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a).  Defendants argued that the complaint should be dismissed because, among other defects, it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  According to defendants, the gravamen of plaintiff's complaint was that the value of his Individual Partnership Account (\"IPA\") was less than it should be.  However, defendants asserted, the flow of funds to Higgins' IPA was regulated by a contract, the Netting Out Agreement (\"NOA\"), to which Higgins and L.P. were the only parties.  Therefore, defendants argued, Higgins' claim could not run against Eichler and DiLullo, as they were not parties to Higgins' NOA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  The court found that the alleged injury was not \"within the scope of any particular real estate partnership,\" and instead was caused by the corporation, L.P. The court opined that no claim for breach of fiduciary duty owed to Higgins as a partner was stated.  The court indicated that plaintiff might have a breach of contract action against L.P., which was a necessary party to such a claim, but noted that plaintiff had not offered any evidence that the Massachusetts federal court would have jurisdiction over L.P., a Pennsylvania corporation.  We reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the allowance of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is plenary.

See Wartski v. Bedford, 926 F.2d 11, 13-14 (1st Cir.1991) (surveying Massachusetts law).  The question here goes to the extent of that duty.  \"[P]artners owe each other a fiduciary duty of 'the utmost good faith and loyalty.' \"  Id. at 13 (quoting Meehan v. Shaughnessy, 535 N.E.2d 1255, 1263 (Mass.1989)).  \" 'As a fiduciary, a partner must consider his or her partners' welfare, and refrain from acting for purely private gain.' \"  Id. at 13-14 (quoting Meehan, 535 N.E.2d at 1263).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provisions of the Uniform Partnership Act have been adopted by Massachusetts, notably that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Mass.

We discuss only those facts alleged necessary to test whether a claim has been stated.  From the allegations of the complaint, it would be reasonable to infer that the myriad of various real estate partnerships in which the parties invested were treated, for some purposes, as a single entity and that the participants regarded each other as partners.  Higgins alleges that Eichler, as chairman of the partners' \"Executive Committee,\" and assisted by DiLullo, exercised de facto control over the partnerships.  The accounting functions of the partnerships in toto were performed by L.P, a corporation created for that purpose under the NOA.  Each partner entered into a separate NOA with L.P. Pursuant to the NOA, partnership proceeds were paid into partners' IPAs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Eichler and DiLullo, as members of the Executive Committee, implemented a program called the \"IPA Cleanup Program.\"   The Cleanup Program generally operated for the benefit of active--as opposed to retired--partners.  Under the program, uncollectible debts owed by insolvent partners to the partnerships were forgiven, and the resulting losses were allocated to the IPAs of solvent partners, thus allowing the active solvent partners to take tax deductions.  Additional debt forgiveness adjustments were made to the partners' IPAs in 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Higgins did not consent to these changes.  The Cleanup Program was implemented anyway and $1.8 million in losses was allocated to Higgins' account.  As a result, Higgins, rather than having a positive balance in his IPA and receiving income from his investments, was left with a negative balance and did not receive any partnership draws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Higgins' complaint alleges that the IPA Cleanup Program was a self-dealing scheme by Eichler and DiLullo and constitutes a breach of their fiduciary duty as partners.  Defendants contend that their fiduciary duties ended when the partnership income was transferred to L.P. and that, while plaintiff may have a cause of action against L.P., he has no claim of breach of fiduciary duty against them.  The district court agreed with the defendants, holding that the defendants' actions were outside the scope of the partnership because the relevant acts, even if attributable to the defendants, were performed in their role as officers of L.P., an entity separate, in the district court's view, from the partnerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is, in our estimation, too narrow a view of the allegations, as the record now stands unfocussed by factual development, and the law.  It is reasonable to infer that the functions performed by L.P. were accounting functions previously performed by the partnerships themselves;  that L.P. was established for the sole purpose of administering those functions;  that L.P. simply received in partnership income and then distributed it out;  and that L.P. was merely an agent of the partnerships.  These inferences are supported by the NOA itself, which states that \"Partner and Participants have selected [L.P.] as the business entity to conduct day to day operations, perform accounting functions and to assist in cash planning and cash flow management for the Enterprises.\"   Higgins' NOA, although executed only by Higgins and L.P., is also expressly conditioned on all of the participants in the various partnerships signing identical agreements, and states that these agreements \"shall be for the mutual benefit of such executing Participants, Agent, Partner and the other parties to such agreements.\"   Plaintiff also alleges that L.P. was under the control of the defendants and did what they wanted.  The NOA itself can be read to suggest that L.P. on its own had no authority to execute a scheme such as the IPA Cleanup Program.  It was pursuant to that scheme that plaintiff was, he alleges, deprived of partnership income owed to him.  It thus may be inferred that L.P., rather than acting as a separate entity with regard to the alleged scheme, was merely an arm or instrumentality of the partnerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts recently upheld a jury verdict in a case involving a claim that two law partners had deprived the plaintiff partner of his fair share of partnership proceeds by choosing unfair methods of accounting for partnership profits.  Starr v. Fordham, 648 N.E.2d 1261 (Mass.1995).  The court recognized the potential for self-dealing where certain partners in essence control the distributions to another partner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The founding partners were responsible for dividing the partnership's profits and assigning to each partner his respective share of the profits.  Thus, the founding partners had some self-interest in designating each partner's respective share of the profits because the percentage of profits which they were assigning to the other partners had a direct effect on their own percentage of the profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1265.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court placed the burden of proving that the distribution of profits was fair on the defendants.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unprepared to say, in the context of a motion to dismiss, that Massachusetts law would never recognize a claim for breach of fiduciary duty where, as described above, the instrument used to deprive a partner of his partnership income was simply an arm of the partnership, and was under the control of the defendant partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it better that the questions in this case be resolved in the context of further factual development.  As Justice Frankfurter stated in SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80 (1943):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[To] say that a man is a fiduciary only begins the analysis;  it gives direction to further inquiry.  To whom is he a fiduciary?   What obligations does he owe as a fiduciary?   In what respect has he failed to discharge these obligations?   And what are the consequences of his deviation from duty?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 85-86.  Therefore, we reverse the district court's grant of defendants' motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff now joins defendants in asking that this case be transferred to the Pennsylvania district court.  The action filed by Higgins in that court against Eichler and L.P. is substantially related to the present action.  \"The pendency of related litigation in another forum is a proper factor to be considered in resolving choice of venue questions,\" Codex Corp. v. Milgo Electronic Corp., 553 F.2d 735, 739 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 860 (1977), and may be decisive where, as here, neither party raises convenience objections.  See id.   Additionally, transfer will resolve the various jurisdictional issues raised by defendants in their motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, on remand, the district court should transfer this action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as a companion case to the suit Higgins has already filed there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court declined to treat the motion as one for summary judgment although the parties submitted additional materials and affidavits.  Plaintiff complains that the district court selectively chose certain facts submitted by defendants to support the dismissal, while ignoring other facts in the supplemental submissions which were favorable to his claim.  Because we resolve the issues presented on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to resolve this claim of procedural error.  Plaintiff does not object to this court's consideration of the NOA, which is referenced in the complaint and is central to it.  See Fudge v.

We discuss only those facts alleged necessary to test whether a claim has been stated.  From the allegations of the complaint, it would be reasonable to infer that the myriad of various real estate partnerships in which the parties invested were treated, for some purposes, as a single entity and that the participants regarded each other as partners.  Higgins alleges that Eichler, as chairman of the partners' \"Executive Committee,\" and assisted by DiLullo, exercised de facto control over the partnerships.  The accounting functions of the partnerships in toto were performed by L.P, a corporation created for that purpose under the NOA.  Each partner entered into a separate NOA with L.P. Pursuant to the NOA, partnership proceeds were paid into partners' IPAs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Eichler and DiLullo, as members of the Executive Committee, implemented a program called the \"IPA Cleanup Program.\"   The Cleanup Program generally operated for the benefit of active--as opposed to retired--partners.  Under the program, uncollectible debts owed by insolvent partners to the partnerships were forgiven, and the resulting losses were allocated to the IPAs of solvent partners, thus allowing the active solvent partners to take tax deductions.  Additional debt forgiveness adjustments were made to the partners' IPAs in 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Higgins did not consent to these changes.  The Cleanup Program was implemented anyway and $1.8 million in losses was allocated to Higgins' account.  As a result, Higgins, rather than having a positive balance in his IPA and receiving income from his investments, was left with a negative balance and did not receive any partnership draws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Higgins' complaint alleges that the IPA Cleanup Program was a self-dealing scheme by Eichler and DiLullo and constitutes a breach of their fiduciary duty as partners.  Defendants contend that their fiduciary duties ended when the partnership income was transferred to L.P. and that, while plaintiff may have a cause of action against L.P., he has no claim of breach of fiduciary duty against them.  The district court agreed with the defendants, holding that the defendants' actions were outside the scope of the partnership because the relevant acts, even if attributable to the defendants, were performed in their role as officers of L.P., an entity separate, in the district court's view, from the partnerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is, in our estimation, too narrow a view of the allegations, as the record now stands unfocussed by factual development, and the law.  It is reasonable to infer that the functions performed by L.P. were accounting functions previously performed by the partnerships themselves;  that L.P. was established for the sole purpose of administering those functions;  that L.P. simply received in partnership income and then distributed it out;  and that L.P. was merely an agent of the partnerships.  These inferences are supported by the NOA itself, which states that \"Partner and Participants have selected [L.P.] as the business entity to conduct day to day operations, perform accounting functions and to assist in cash planning and cash flow management for the Enterprises.\"   Higgins' NOA, although executed only by Higgins and L.P., is also expressly conditioned on all of the participants in the various partnerships signing identical agreements, and states that these agreements \"shall be for the mutual benefit of such executing Participants, Agent, Partner and the other parties to such agreements.\"   Plaintiff also alleges that L.P. was under the control of the defendants and did what they wanted.  The NOA itself can be read to suggest that L.P. on its own had no authority to execute a scheme such as the IPA Cleanup Program.  It was pursuant to that scheme that plaintiff was, he alleges, deprived of partnership income owed to him.  It thus may be inferred that L.P., rather than acting as a separate entity with regard to the alleged scheme, was merely an arm or instrumentality of the partnerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts recently upheld a jury verdict in a case involving a claim that two law partners had deprived the plaintiff partner of his fair share of partnership proceeds by choosing unfair methods of accounting for partnership profits.  Starr v. Fordham, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></span> (Mass.1995).  The court recognized the potential for self-dealing where certain partners in essence control the distributions to another partner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The founding partners were responsible for dividing the partnership's profits and assigning to each partner his respective share of the profits.  Thus, the founding partners had some self-interest in designating each partner's respective share of the profits because the percentage of profits which they were assigning to the other partners had a direct effect on their own percentage of the profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1265.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the court placed the burden of proving that the distribution of profits was fair on the defendants.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unprepared to say, in the context of a motion to dismiss, that Massachusetts law would never recognize a claim for breach of fiduciary duty where, as described above, the instrument used to deprive a partner of his partnership income was simply an arm of the partnership, and was under the control of the defendant partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it better that the questions in this case be resolved in the context of further factual development.  As Justice Frankfurter stated in SEC v. Chenery Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span> (1943):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>[To] say that a man is a fiduciary only begins the analysis;  it gives direction to further inquiry.  To whom is he a fiduciary?   What obligations does he owe as a fiduciary?   In what respect has he failed to discharge these obligations?   And what are the consequences of his deviation from duty?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 85-86.  Therefore, we reverse the district court's grant of defendants' motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff now joins defendants in asking that this case be transferred to the Pennsylvania district court.  The action filed by Higgins in that court against Eichler and L.P. is substantially related to the present action.  \"The pendency of related litigation in another forum is a proper factor to be considered in resolving choice of venue questions,\" Codex Corp. v. Milgo Electronic Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344862\"><a href=\"/opinion/344862/codex-corporation-and-yellow-freight-system-inc-v-milgo-electronic/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, 739 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109779\"><a href=\"/opinion/109779/amperex-electronic-corp-v-new-york-racing-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span> (1977), and may be decisive where, as here, neither party raises convenience objections.  See id.   Additionally, transfer will resolve the various jurisdictional issues raised by defendants in their motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, on remand, the district court should transfer this action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as a companion case to the suit Higgins has already filed there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court declined to treat the motion as one for summary judgment although the parties submitted additional materials and affidavits.  Plaintiff complains that the district court selectively chose certain facts submitted by defendants to support the dismissal, while ignoring other facts in the supplemental submissions which were favorable to his claim.  Because we resolve the issues presented on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to resolve this claim of procedural error.  Plaintiff does not object to this court's consideration of the NOA, which is referenced in the complaint and is central to it.  See Fudge v.
