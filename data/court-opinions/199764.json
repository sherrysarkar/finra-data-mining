Deborah Scott appeals from the judgment\n\nof the district court granting summary judgment in favor of her\n\nformer employer, Sulzer Carbomedics, Inc.              Scott claims that\n\nSulzer Carbomedics, which terminated her employment in June of\n\n1997, discriminated against her on the basis of her gender in\n\nviolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e; the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. § 206(d); and the\n\nMassachusetts anti-discrimination statute, Mass Gen. Laws ch.\n\n151B.   She also seeks to recover against two of her supervisors\n\nat   Sulzer   Carbomedics        for    intentional    interference      with\n\ncontractual relations, and against all defendants for libel and\n\nslander.      On    May   15,   2001,    the   district   court   issued     a\n\nMemorandum    and    Order      granting     summary   judgment    for     the\n\ndefendants on all counts.          Scott v. Sulzer Carbomedics, Inc.,\n\n141 F. Supp. 2d 154 (D. Mass 2001).\n\n           After a detailed review of the evidence, the district\n\ncourt found that Scott had failed to meet \"her initial burden of\n\npresenting    circumstantial      evidence     sufficient   to    create    an\n\ninference that the basis for [the] adverse employment decisions\"\n\nwas her gender.      Id. at 173.       The district court concluded that\n\n\"[t]he story that emerges from the documents is not one of\n\ndiscrimination, but one of performance,\" id. at 161, and that\n\nScott had \"failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fto whether she performed her job at an acceptable level,\" id. at\n\n172.   The district court also found Scott's tort claims to be\n\nwithout merit.    Id. at 177-80.\n\n            We have said that \"when a trial court accurately takes\n\nthe measure of a case and articulates its rationale clearly and\n\nconvincingly, 'an appellate court should refrain from writing at\n\nlength to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.'\"\n\nCruz-Ramos v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (quoting Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co., 101\n\nF.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996)).             This is such a case.        We\n\ntherefore    affirm     the   judgment    below   for   substantially   the\n\nreasons given in the district court's comprehensive and well-\n\nreasoned opinion, upon which we cannot improve.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
