Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                   Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David J.

Litman, Richard F. Miller, John A.\nNorris, Richard M. Traskos, and Summit Technology, Inc.\n     Timothy W. Mungovan, with whom Deborah L. Thaxter, John\nPagliario, and Nixon Peabody LLP were on brief, for appellee David\nMuller.\n\n                            March 19, 2002\n\f           PER CURIAM.     Appellant Jerry West filed a derivative\n\naction on behalf of appellee Summit Technologies, Inc. (\"Summit\")\n\nin   December,    1996,   alleging    misconduct   by   several   of   the\n\ncorporations's officers and directors.       Roughly four years later,\n\nSummit merged with Alcon Holdings, Inc., making Alcon the sole\n\nholder of Summit stock.    Summit then moved to dismiss the action on\n\nthe ground that West was no longer a shareholder, and therefore\n\nlacked standing to pursue his derivative claims.        West conceded as\n\nmuch, but sought leave to file an amended complaint recasting his\n\nderivative claims as direct ones, and adding several new claims\naddressing the merger itself. The district court denied the motion\n\nwithout explanation and dismissed the suit.\n           West appealed, arguing that the district court erred in\nrefusing to permit amendment.        We entered an Order directing the\n\ndistrict court to state its reasons for denying West's motion.          In\nresponse, the district court explained that, given the history of\nthe litigation, the amended complaint \"was untimely and sought to\n\nengraft a totally new suit on the skeleton of a suit brought years\npreviously.\"     We review that decision for an abuse of discretion,\nGrant v. News Group Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995), and\n\naffirm.\n           This is not a case where the newly-asserted claims were\nin the case from the beginning but were not presented in a timely\n\nfashion.   In such circumstances, the party seeking to amend its\ncomplaint may be barred from raising the new claims in subsequent\n\nlitigation. See Johnson v. SCA Disposal Servs., Inc., 931 F.2d 970\n\n                                     -2-\n\f(1st   Cir.    1991)    (holding      that    plaintiff   was   precluded   from\n\nasserting in a second suit claims that were part of the same cause\n\nof action as claims adjudicated in an earlier action).                Thus, the\ndistrict court must weigh the possible res judicata effect of its\n\nruling when deciding whether to permit amendment.                See id. at 976\n\n& n.19 (suggesting that district court may abuse its discretion in\ndenying a motion to amend when the newly-asserted claims should\n\nhave been raised in the original complaint, and so would be barred\n\nin any subsequent litigation); Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (stating that\n\nleave to amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires\").\n\n              Here,    the   claims    set    out   in   the   proposed   amended\n\ncomplaint were prompted by an event -- the merger -- that occurred\n\nlong after West filed his original complaint.                     Following the\nmerger, West requested permission to amend his complaint and\n\nsubstitute the new claims for the old. The district court rejected\n\nhis entreaty, concluding that the new claims were too far removed\nfrom the original derivative claims to justify bringing them into\n\nthe case so late in the day.          That decision will not preclude West\n\nfrom asserting the merger-related claims in a new action.                  See N.\n\nAssurance Co. v. Square D Co., 201 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to permit amendment.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f",
