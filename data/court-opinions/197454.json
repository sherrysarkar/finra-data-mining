This appeal brings to the  court\r\n\nthe \r               most \r                    recent chapter in a 20-year quarrel between a federal\r\n\ndepartment \r                      and \r                         its \r                             former employee, Jean Randlett.  It presents\r\n\nan \r              important \r                        legal \r                             issue \r                                   concerning the reach of the protection\r\n\nafforded by  Title VII of  the Civil Rights  Act of 1964,  42\r\n\nU.S.C. S 2000e  et seq.   We hold  that Title  VII can  offer\r\n\nprotection  against a  retaliatory  refusal  to  transfer  an\r\n\nemployee,  but  that  no   evidence  existed  here  to   show\r\n\nretaliation.\r\n\n                             I.\r\n\n     Because Randlett's claims  were resolved against her  on\r\n\nsummary  judgment, we  state  the  facts in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable \r                     to \r                        her. \r                             \r                             Sargen\r                                   t v. Tenaska, Inc., 108 F.3d 5, 6 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1997).  In 1975, Randlett worked in Denver in the Office\r\n\nof Civil Rights  of the Department  of Health, Education  and\r\n\nWelfare \r                   as \r                      an \r                        equal \r                              opportunity specialist with a civil service\r\n\ngrade  of GS-12.   She  applied for  a promotion  to a  GS-13\r\n\nposition \r                    in \r                       Denver \r                             but \r                                 was denied promotion in favor of another\r\n\ncandidate.   A few  months  later, in  August 1975,  she  was\r\n\nterminated.  \r\n\n     Randlett  filed a  complaint with  the Equal  Employment\r\n\nOpportunity \r                       Commission, \r                                  alleging discrimination based on gender\r\n\nand national origin  (she is white and of European  descent).\r\n\nSix \r               years \r                     later, the EEOC ruled in her favor, finding that the\r\n\nrecord  showed  \"[n]o   other  credible   reason  for   [her]\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nnonselection  . . .  other than the  fact that the  selecting\r\n\nofficial wanted to insure that the Hispanic male was  awarded\r\n\nthe GS-13 position.\"  It found that Randlett's discharge  was\r\n\nsimilarly motivated by discriminatory animus.  In particular,\r\n\nthe EEOC  found that the  official who considered  Randlett's\r\n\npromotion \r                     had applied pressure on the selecting panel to alter\r\n\nits \r               rankings, which favored Randlett, so that the job could go\r\n\ninstead to a friend of the selecting official.\r\n\n     The  EEOC's 1981  order  directed  the  Department,  now\r\n\nmetamorphosed \r                         into \r                             Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), to cancel\r\n\nRandlett's 1975  discharge  and  to  \"immediately  reinstate\"\r\n\nRandlett  in  the  Denver  office  as  an  equal  opportunity\r\n\nspecialist, \r                       grade GS-13.  The order also awarded Randlett back\r\n\npay  and  other  entitlements   for  the  period  since   her\r\n\ntermination, \r                        and \r                           it \r                              required HHS to report within 30 days as to\r\n\nthe \r               steps \r                     it \r                        planned to take to implement the required action.\r\n\n     In late  June  1981, Randlett  began  what would  be  an\r\n\nextensive exchange  of  telephone calls  and  correspondence,\r\n\nprimarily with  Thomas Jefferson,  an HHS  official based  in\r\n\nWashington, \r                       D.C., who was apparently charged with coordinating\r\n\nRandlett's  reinstatement.   She  also talked  with  Patricia\r\n\nTaphorn,  a personnel  official in  the Denver  office.   The\r\n\nupshot, \r                   according to Randlett, was an agreement that she would\r\n\nreturn \r                  to \r                     the payroll of the HHS Denver office as of August 9,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n1981, but by using four weeks of accumulated leave, would not\r\n\nactually report for work until early September 1981.\r\n\n     According \r                          to \r                            both \r                                 Randlett and Taphorn, Jefferson was very\r\n\ndifficult to reach over the course of the summer and did  not\r\n\nact quickly enough to  confirm this understanding, nor  would\r\n\nanyone else in the Washington office take responsibility  for\r\n\ndoing \r                 so. \r                      \r                      We \r                        pass \r                             over \r                                  the details, but there is no indication\r\n\nthat \r                anything other than bureaucratic sloth was the cause.  In\r\n\nany \r               event, \r                      in August 1981, Randlett signed a contract with her\r\n\nthen-current employer, the Barnstable, Massachusetts,  school\r\n\nsystem, \r                   extending her employment there for an additional year.\r\n\n     Not  long afterwards,  Randlett received  a letter  from\r\n\nJefferson, confirming that she  was reinstated in the  Denver\r\n\noffice  as  of  September  1981;  he  also  referred  to  the\r\n\npossibility \r                       of a transfer to another regional office, but said\r\n\nthat  this was  not certain.   Further  telephone calls  were\r\n\nexchanged, \r                      and \r                         the \r                             matter was still unresolved in October 1981,\r\n\nwhen Randlett's father became  seriously ill.  Randlett  then\r\n\ntold \r                Jefferson that she would need to stay in Massachusetts to\r\n\ncare for her father.\r\n\n     After \r                      further \r                             confusion, \r                                        Randlett in February 1982 secured\r\n\nfrom \r                another \r                       HHS \r                           official in Washington a temporary \"detail\" to\r\n\na Boston HHS office, effective March 1, 1982, for a period of\r\n\nnot  more than  120 days.   The  official--Betty Lou  Dotson,\r\n\ndirector of the Office for Civil Rights--wrote Randlett  that\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nthe \r               detail \r                      was \r                         \"granted \r                                  to accommodate your personal situation\"\r\n\nand \r               concluded \r                         by \r                           saying \r                                  that \"I trust this detail will give you\r\n\nthe opportunity to attend to your personal responsibilities.\"\r\n\n     Randlett resigned from  her schoolteaching position  and\r\n\nbegan \r                 working \r                         in \r                           the \r                               Boston HHS office in March 1982.  By then,\r\n\nher \r               father \r                      had \r                         died, \r                               but \r                                   her aging mother's health was failing.\r\n\nRandlett also claims that,  almost immediately, she began  to\r\n\nexperience problems  in  the  Boston HHS  office  because  of\r\n\ninadequate training on work assignments, that she received  a\r\n\n\"low satisfactory\" ranking in an evaluation, and that she was\r\n\nlisted \r                  at \r                     a \r                      GS-12 \r                            level \r                                  in Boston (even though she continued to\r\n\nreceive a GS-13 salary).  \r\n\n     According to Randlett, Jefferson called her in May  1982\r\n\nand asked her when she planned to return to Denver.  Randlett\r\n\nreplied \r                   that \r                        she thought her position in Boston was permanent,\r\n\nbut in  June 1982, she  sent a letter  to HHS in  Washington,\r\n\nrequesting \r                      a \r                        permanent assignment to the Boston office, saying\r\n\n\"this \r                 is \r                    an \r                       unusual request, but probably no more unusual than\r\n\nthe six and a half years of injustices\" that she had endured.\r\n\nIt appears that Randlett also had a telephone conversation on\r\n\nthe subject with Bart Crivella, Jefferson's supervisor.\r\n\n     In \r                   early \r                         July \r                             1982, \r                                   the \r                                       request was answered in writing by\r\n\nNathan  Dick, the  deputy director  of the  Office for  Civil\r\n\nRights.  Dick's  letter denied the transfer request but  said\r\n\nthat HHS was willing to extend the temporary detail in Boston\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nuntil \r                 September \r                          30, \r                              1982, with Randlett returning on October 1,\r\n\n1982, to her \"permanent duty station in Denver.\"  The  letter\r\n\nexplained:\r\n\n     [I]t \r                     is \r                        not \r                            possible for the Office for Civil Rights\r\n     to \r                   offer \r                         you \r                             a permanent assignment in Boston.

However, the recent RIF actions  in\r\n     the \r                    regions \r                            and the continuing ceiling and budgetary\r\n     constraints   have   eliminated   practically   any\r\n     potential \r                          options for this office [in Washington] to\r\n     assign you  to  the Boston  office on  a  permanent\r\n     basis.\r\n\n     In September, Randlett received another letter from Dick\r\n\nrequesting \r                      her \r                          to \r                            report \r                                   for work in Denver on October 1, 1982.\r\n\nRandlett \r                    then \r                         filed \r                              a \r                                complaint with the EEO officer in Boston,\r\n\nalleging \r                    that \r                        Washington \r                                   officials were retaliating against her\r\n\n\"for having filed a previous complaint in Denver . . .  which\r\n\nwas resolved in my favor.\"  Randlett's new complaint named as\r\n\nthe \r               persons \r                       who had retaliated against her Jefferson, Dick and\r\n\nCrivella.\r\n\n     Instead \r                        of \r                           reporting \r                                    to \r                                       work in Denver on October 1, 1982,\r\n\nRandlett arranged  to use accrued  leave credits  to stay  in\r\n\nBoston for  the remainder  of the  year.   In November  1982,\r\n\nRandlett's prospective  supervisor in  Denver, Alex  Aguilar,\r\n\nconfirmed \r                     the request for leave from October 1 to December 31,\r\n\n1982; but the letter also said that Aguilar expected Randlett\r\n\nto report  for work  on January 3,  1983, and  that he  would\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nconsider \r                    any \r                        request for further leave to be \"unreasonable and\r\n\nnot in the best interests of our organization.\"   \r\n\n     Randlett then asked Aguilar for leave-without-pay status\r\n\nafter December 1982.  Aguilar refused, saying that Randlett's\r\n\n\"prolonged\" absence was detrimental to his office.   Randlett\r\n\nthen \r                asked \r                      for \r                         sick \r                              leave.  Aguilar wrote that the agency might\r\n\nbe \r              able \r                   to \r                     make \r                          health-related accommodations for her in Denver\r\n\nso long  as she documented her  ailments; but some two  weeks\r\n\nlater Aguilar told Randlett that the documents she  submitted\r\n\nwere not adequate.  In March 1983, Randlett resigned,  saying\r\n\nthat it  was done  involuntarily to  prevent any  \"additional\r\n\nharassment\" from Aguilar  or \"any  other further  retaliatory\r\n\nacts.\"\r\n\n     Randlett's \r                           September 1982 complaint--directed against the\r\n\nthree named Washington officials--was originally rejected  by\r\n\nHHS on the ground that  it was untimely, but this ruling  was\r\n\nreversed by  the EEOC in 1985.   Incredibly, the ensuing  HHS\r\n\ninternal investigation  lasted over seven  years.  In  August\r\n\n1992, an HHS administrative law judge denied Randlett's claim\r\n\nof retaliation.   His  denial was  sustained by  the EEOC  in\r\n\nNovember 1993.\r\n\n     In \r                   December \r                            1993, Randlett filed her present complaint in\r\n\nthe federal district court under Title VII.  The core of  the\r\n\ncomplaint \r                     was \r                        that \r                             \"[a]lthough HHS had full power and authority\r\n\nto \r              assign \r                     plaintiff a permanent position in the Boston office,\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nit unreasonably refused to do so in order ultimately to force\r\n\nplaintiff \r                     to \r                        resign.\" \r                                 \r                                 The complaint attributed this refusal to\r\n\nretaliation for Randlett's successful 1975 complaint  against\r\n\nthe department, saying that hardship transfers were routinely\r\n\ngranted to individuals with  hardship requests similar to  or\r\n\nless serious than Randlett's.\r\n\n     Randlett \r                         also charged that she had been given an improper\r\n\n\"low satisfactory\" performance rating and inadequate training\r\n\nin Boston.  She asked for \"[r]einstatement to her position in\r\n\nBoston\" with back pay and benefits and reimbursement for some\r\n\nhealth insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses.\r\n\nShe \r               also \r                   sought \r                          compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million\r\n\neach.\r\n\n     After a  period  of  discovery, HHS  moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment. \r                      \r                      It argued that the denial of permanent transfer was\r\n\nnot \r               an \r                  adverse employment action under Title VII, and that the\r\n\nagency \r                  had \r                      made \r                          an \r                             effort to accommodate Randlett's requests by\r\n\ngranting  a temporary detail  to Boston but  that it was  not\r\n\nrequired  to go further.   HHS also  supplied the court  with\r\n\ncorrespondenc\r                        e and a transcript of Randlett's testimony in the\r\n\nEEOC's recent investigation.\r\n\n     Randlett \r                         responded \r                                  with \r                                       her own version of events and also\r\n\nsubmitted \r                     affidavits from HHS employees attesting that HHS did\r\n\napprove \r                   hardship \r                           transfers with some regularity, and suggesting\r\n\nthat she could  have been accommodated in the Boston  office.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nThe most dramatic affidavit was submitted by an EEOC employee\r\n\nwho \r               had \r                   previously worked in the Denver HHS office.  According\r\n\nto \r              the \r                  affiant, in the spring of 1982 he had been talking with\r\n\nAguilar about a GS-13 position in the Denver office and asked\r\n\nif it was going to be filled permanently and if so, by  whom.\r\n\nThe affidavit continued:\r\n\n     Alex  Aguilar told  me \"That  position [cannot]  be\r\n     filled \r                       permanently until the matter of Jean Randlett\r\n     is resolved, but I  am going to make sure that  she\r\n     does not come to Denver.  We are going to put a lot\r\n     of  pressure on  her  so  she will  not  return  to\r\n     Denver.\"\r\n\n     On June  5, 1996, the  district judge  issued a  29-page\r\n\nmemorandum \r                      and \r                         order \r                               granting HHS' motion for summary judgment.\r\n\nThe decision dealt in different ways with Randlett's  various\r\n\nclaims, as will appear from our own discussion.  The decision\r\n\nwent some distance in the direction that HHS had urged in its\r\n\noriginal \r                    motion, holding that \"rejection of Randlett's request\r\n\nto \r              continue \r                       to stay in Boston for personal reasons is not a[n]\r\n\nadverse action cognizable by federal law.\"\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     A grant of summary judgment is subject to de novo review\r\n\non appeal, and this includes any claim that the evidence made\r\n\nout a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment.\r\n\nSargent\r                  , \r                    108 \r                        F.3d at 6.  Before addressing the central issue--\r\n\nthe denial of Randlett's request for a transfer to Boston--we\r\n\nconsider \r                    briefly, and then put to one side, certain rulings by\r\n\nthe district court that require no extended treatment.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     In the district court, Randlett urged that she had  been\r\n\n\"promised\"  a permanent  transfer  to  Boston  by  Jefferson.\r\n\nAssuming arguendo  that such a  \"promise\" might receive  some\r\n\nspecial protection, the district court carefully reviewed the\r\n\npertinent proffers  of  evidence,  especially  the  documents\r\n\nexchanged  between Randlett  and the  Washington office,  and\r\n\nconcluded  that no  reasonable jury  could find  that such  a\r\n\npromise had been made.  Without repeating the details,  which\r\n\nare set forth in the district court's decision, we agree with\r\n\nthis ruling.\r\n\n     The district  court also made  short work of  Randlett's\r\n\nclaim that  she had received  inadequate training in  Boston,\r\n\nsaying \r                  that \r                       even if this were true, there was no evidence that\r\n\nit was based upon a  motive to retaliate against her for  her\r\n\nearlier complaint.  \"At most,\" the district judge ruled, \"the\r\n\nevidence shows that the  Boston assignment was an  awkwardly-\r\n\ndesigned and  temporary  expedient  to  accommodate  Randlett\r\n\npending \r                   her \r                       return \r                             to \r                                the duty station [Denver] directed by the\r\n\n1981 EEOC decision.\"  This ruling also is well supported.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court \r                                  also \r                                       rejected Randlett's claim that she\r\n\nwas improperly listed  as a GS-12 employee in Boston,  saying\r\n\nthat this was not an adverse employment action since Randlett\r\n\ncontinued \r                     to \r                        be \r                          paid \r                               at \r                                  the GS-13 level.  We affirm this ruling\r\n\non a narrower ground:   no evidence exists that this  alleged\r\n\nBoston-office \"error\" was motivated by a desire to  retaliate\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                        -10-\r\r\n\nagainst Randlett  for filing a  complaint seven years  before\r\n\nagainst \r                   a \r                     different HHS office.  Whether in some other case an\r\n\ninaccurate listing could be an adverse action under Title VII\r\n\nneed not be pursued here.  \r\n\n     The \r                    central \r                            issue is HHS' refusal to transfer Randlett to\r\n\nthe \r               Boston \r                      office.  The district court said that this was \"not\r\n\na[n] adverse action  cognizable by federal law,\" but it  also\r\n\nsaid that not  even a \"scintilla  of evidence\" supported  the\r\n\nclaim \r                 \"that \r                       the agency retaliated against Randlett by refusing\r\n\nto \r              provide \r                      a \r                        permanent transfer to Boston for hardship reasons\r\n\nor to extend her temporary detail.\"  These are two  different\r\n\nreasons, one relating to law and the other to fact.\r\n\n     The \r                    more \r                         difficult \r                                  of \r                                     the two is the legal question:  what\r\n\ntypes of employer actions adverse to the employee can,  where\r\n\nimproperly \r                      motivated, give rise to a Title VII complaint.  The\r\n\ndistrict  judge, arguably  supported  by  references  in  the\r\n\ndecisions of a few other courts, accepted HHS' argument  that\r\n\nthe refusal  of a lateral transfer  to another office of  the\r\n\nagency does  not rise to the  level of an adverse  employment\r\n\naction compensable  under  Title  VII--even if  done  for  an\r\n\nimproper motive.\r\n\n     The  statute  itself  says  that  an  employer  may  not\r\n\n\"discriminate\" against an employee or applicant \"because [the\r\n\nemployee \r                    or \r                       applicant] has made a charge . . . or participated\r\n\nin \r              any \r                  manner\" in a Title VII investigation or proceeding.  42\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r\n\nU.S.C. \r                  S \r                    2000e-3(a). \r                                \r                                Elsewhere, the statute lists actions that\r\n\ncan \r               constitute discrimination, specifying a refusal to hire, a\r\n\ndischarge, or any  discriminatory treatment  with respect  to\r\n\n\"compensation, \r                          terms, \r                                conditions, or privileges of employment.\"\r\n\nId. S 2000e-2(a).  Arguably, the two sections should be  read\r\n\ntogether.\r\n\n     Even so, \"terms,  conditions, or  privileges\" is  pretty\r\n\nopen-ended \r                      language.  It obviously includes opportunities that\r\n\nare not strictly entitlements, Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467\r\n\nU.S. 69, 75-76 (1984) (promotion to partner); and a number of\r\n\ncases have extended coverage  to slights or indignities  that\r\n\nmight seem  evanescent, e.g., McKenzie  v. Illinois Dep't  of\r\n\nTransp., 92  F.3d 473, 484  (7th Cir.  1996) (employee  given\r\n\ntedious \r                   minor duties); Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963 F.2d 2,\r\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1992) (daily ridicule in clients' presence).\r\n\n     On occasion, disadvantageous transfers have been treated\r\n\nas \r              potentially \r                         within \r                                the scope of Title VII.  E.g., Collins v.\r\n\nIllinois\r                   , \r                     830 F.2d 692, 702-04 (7th Cir. 1987) (citing cases).\r\n\nThe main authority cited by the district court, Haimovitz  v.\r\n\nUnited States  Dep't of Justice, 720  F. Supp. 516 (W.D.  Pa.\r\n\n1989), \r                  aff'd\r                       ,\r                         902 F.2d 1560 (3d Cir. 1990), did reject a claim\r\n\nwhere the employee had been transferred to another  location;\r\n\nbut \r               while \r                     the \r                        opinion \r                                is \r                                   not crystal clear, the main reason was\r\n\napparently \r                      a \r                        failure to show an illegal motive. Id. at 525-27.\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r\n\n     Here, the claim concerns a refusal to transfer, arguably\r\n\nless intrusive than  involuntary relocation.  But  Randlett's\r\n\naffidavits make clear  that at HHS  a permanent transfer  for\r\n\nhardship \r                    reasons is a common enough practice and so arguably a\r\n\n\"privilege\" \r                       of \r                         employment.  For Randlett, the transfer here was\r\n\ndoubtless as important as a promotion.  Assuming an  improper\r\n\nmotive, \r                   it \r                      is hard to see why denial of a hardship transfer in\r\n\nthis case could not  be discrimination under Title VII.   See\r\n\nBauman\r                  \r                  v. \r                     Blo\r                        ck, 940 F.2d 1211, 1229 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,\r\n\n502 U.S. 1005 (1991).\r\n\n     No doubt construing the statute in this manner opens the\r\n\nway  to  whimsical claims  by  employees  who  earlier  filed\r\n\ncomplaints and are now aggrieved by slights.  Possibly, there\r\n\nis room for a de minimis threshold, Williams v. Bristol-Myers\r\n\nSquibb Co., 85 F.3d  270, 274 (7th Cir. 1996), and  certainly\r\n\ngood reason to insist on firm evidence of improper motive  by\r\n\nthe employer.   But  given the  impact on  Randlett, and  her\r\n\naffidavits about customary practice, we cannot accept the HHS\r\n\nview \r                that \r                     a \r                       refusal to transfer is automatically outside Title\r\n\nVII.\r\n\n     We turn, therefore, to the district court's  alternative\r\n\nground, namely, the lack of a \"scintilla of evidence\" to show\r\n\nretaliation. \r                         \r                         To \r                           make \r                                out a retaliation claim requires not only\r\n\nan \r              adverse \r                      employment action and previously protected conduct,\r\n\nbut \r               also \r                    a \r                      colorable showing that \"a causal connection existed\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r\n\nbetween \r                   the \r                      protected \r                                conduct and the adverse action.\"  Fennell\r\n\nv. \r              First \r                    Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\nIn \r              other \r                    words, \r                          the \r                              adverse action must have been taken for the\r\n\npurpose of retaliating.

Randlett's request was made to the\r\n\nWashington  office  and  denied  by  the  Washington  office.\r\n\nRandlett herself wrote to  the Boston EEO officer a few  days\r\n\nafter filing her complaint to say that the concern was  \"with\r\n\nthe \r               actions \r                       of OCR [Office of Civil Rights] in Washington, not\r\n\nDenver.\" \r                     \r                     See\r                         generally Long v. Eastfield College, 88 F.3d 300\r\n\n(5th Cir. 1996).\r\n\n     It was thus  incumbent on Randlett, to justify trial  on\r\n\nthis \r                issue, \r                       to \r                         point \r                               to \r                                  some evidence to show that officials in\r\n\nthe Washington establishment had refused a permanent transfer\r\n\nto retaliate against  Randlett for her  1975 complaint.   See\r\n\nMesnick  v. General Elec.  Co., 950 F.2d  816, 822 (1st  Cir.\r\n\n1991), \r                  cert. \r                        denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992).  This need to show a\r\n\nconnection exists whether Randlett was seeking to make out  a\r\n\nprima \r                 facie \r                       case \r                           or \r                              by \r                                 independent evidence challenging the HHS\r\n\nexplanation  as pretext  and urging  independent evidence  of\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                        -14-\r\r\n\ndiscrimination.  Fennell, 83 F.3d at 535.  The latter is  the\r\n\nbetter \r                  perspective \r                             since \r                                   (even before the lawsuit began) Dick's\r\n\nletter did  explain  HHS'  reasons for  denying  a  permanent\r\n\ntransfer.\r\n\n     The \r                    difficulty for Randlett is that there is virtually no\r\n\nevidence  that HHS  officials in  Washington acted  out of  a\r\n\nretaliatory \r                       motive \r                             in \r                                denying the permanent transfer to Boston.\r\n\nRandlett's \r                      main \r                          argument \r                                   for inferring an improper motive--that\r\n\nis, a connection  to her previous complaint--is based on  her\r\n\naffidavits about HHS practice in granting hardship transfers.\r\n\nIf HHS handed out transfers as a matter of course whenever an\r\n\nemployee showed a hardship need, it might well be  suspicious\r\n\nwere Randlett alone singled out for a denial.\r\n\n     But \r                    in \r                       fact \r                            there \r                                 is \r                                    no \r                                       showing that in denying Randlett's\r\n\nrequest, \r                    HHS \r                        was departing from its usual practice.  Carefully\r\n\nread, all that the  affidavits say is that HHS often  granted\r\n\nhardship transfers in similar  cases; there is no  indication\r\n\nthat HHS granted  them invariably and  without regard to  the\r\n\nconvenience of  the agency.   And  in this  instance HHS,  in\r\n\ndenying \r                   Randlett's request, explained that reductions in force\r\n\n(\"RIFs\") \r                    and \r                        budget \r                              cuts \r                                   had reduced its flexibility and it was\r\n\nnot convenient to the agency to transfer Randlett permanently\r\n\nto Boston.\r\n\n     Randlett's only  other  evidence is  several  affidavits\r\n\ndescribing \r                      reassignments and hires within the Boston office in\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                        -15-\r\r\n\nor  around  1982.    This  confirms  that  there  were   some\r\n\nreassignments\r                         (due, at least in part, to the RIFs mentioned in\r\n\nDick's letter) and at least one new hire for a GS-12 position\r\n\nafter Randlett's resignation.  But nothing in the  affidavits\r\n\nshows retaliation  against  Randlett.   At  most,  one  might\r\n\nconclude that  some  other mix  of reassignments  might  have\r\n\nproduced a  GS-13  position for  Randlett, doubtless  to  the\r\n\ndisadvantage of some other employee.\r\n\n     Whatever  inference  might be  drawn  from  any  of  the\r\n\naffidavits \r                      has \r                          to \r                            be \r                               set \r                                   against other facts.  However careless\r\n\nJefferson  may  have  been  in  arranging  Randlett's  timely\r\n\nreassignment to Denver,  higher officials in  Washington--who\r\n\nwere responsible  for  refusing the  permanent  transfer--had\r\n\nhelped Randlett from the start, both by securing a  temporary\r\n\nposition in Boston and by deferring her start date in Denver.\r\n\nTaking everything  together, no basis  exists for  a jury  to\r\n\nconclude that the  permanent transfer was denied in order  to\r\n\nretaliate.\r\n\n     Our  causation analysis  would  be  quite  different  if\r\n\nRandlett's claim related to  Aguilar's action in refusing  to\r\n\ngrant an additional temporary delay to Randlett to permit her\r\n\nto delay reporting to duty in Denver in early 1983.  The tone\r\n\nof \r              Aguilar's \r                       alleged \r                               remarks, quoted above, might create a jury\r\n\nissue as  to  Aguilar's  own motive  in  refusing  Randlett's\r\n\nrequests to him.  This is so even though, absent the remarks,\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                        -16-\r\r\n\nthe Denver  office had good  reason for  wanting Randlett  to\r\n\nreport \r                  to \r                    duty \r                         (apparently, it was paying for Randlett's detail\r\n\nto Boston and had to leave her permanent position unfilled).\r\n\n     We need not  decide this issue because Randlett has  not\r\n\ncomplained of the Denver office's denial of further temporary\r\n\ndeferrals  in   her  reporting  date.     Rather,  her   1982\r\n\nadministrativ\r                        e complaint, which was the condition precedent to\r\n\nthis lawsuit, see 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-5(f), is directed at  the\r\n\nWashington \r                      officials' denial of a permanent transfer.  That is\r\n\nthe \r               relief \r                      she seeks in the district court.  No claim was made\r\n\nconcerning \r                      Aguilar's denial of a further temporary deferral of\r\n\nher return to Denver.\r\n\n     The   statutory    regime   requiring   exhaustion    of\r\n\nadministrative \r                          remedies \r                                  itself precludes any effort by Randlett\r\n\nat this late date to develop and pursue a new charge directed\r\n\nagainst Aguilar's own conduct in refusing further  deferrals.\r\n\nLattimore\r                     \r                     v. \r                        Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456, 464 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\nNor is this some slip  of the pen:  everything in  Randlett's\r\n\nsituation makes clear that  the central grievance relates  to\r\n\nWashington's  denial  of  a  permanent  transfer  to  Boston.\r\n\nAccordingly, Aguilar's  actions  in  Denver,  whatever  their\r\n\nmotive,  would not support  a trial of  the only claims  that\r\n\nRandlett has made and preserved.\r\n\n     No one  can view  with  pride HHS'  record of  delay  in\r\n\ninvestigating this case or fail to sympathize with Randlett's\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                        -17-\r\r\n\npredicament--\r                        a job in one city and an aging parent in another.\r\n\nAt oral argument, we  forcefully urged the parties to seek  a\r\n\nsettlement and  asked  them  to use  our  court's  settlement\r\n\nprogram, delaying  this decision until  we were advised  that\r\n\nefforts \r                   at \r                      settlement had failed.  It will now be obvious that\r\n\nboth sides would have gained through a settlement.  \r\n\n     In sum, we affirm the decision of the district judge  on\r\n\nthe grant of summary judgment, although our reasoning differs\r\n\nin certain respects, and we decline to order costs for either\r\n\nside.  It  appears from the briefs  and oral argument that  a\r\n\nministerial \r                       issue \r                            relating to the calculation of certain health\r\n\ninsurance \r                     benefits due to Randlett remains to be resolved.  We\r\n\ntherefore  remand the  case to  the district  court for  this\r\n\nlimited purpose.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                        -18-\r\n",

In 1975, Randlett worked in Denver in the Office\r\n\nof Civil Rights  of the Department  of Health, Education  and\r\n\nWelfare \r                   as \r                      an \r                        equal \r                              opportunity specialist with a civil service\r\n\ngrade  of GS-12.   She  applied for  a promotion  to a  GS-13\r\n\nposition \r                    in \r                       Denver \r                             but \r                                 was denied promotion in favor of another\r\n\ncandidate.   A few  months  later, in  August 1975,  she  was\r\n\nterminated.  \r\n\n     Randlett  filed a  complaint with  the Equal  Employment\r\n\nOpportunity \r                       Commission, \r                                  alleging discrimination based on gender\r\n\nand national origin  (she is white and of European  descent).\r\n\nSix \r               years \r                     later, the EEOC ruled in her favor, finding that the\r\n\nrecord  showed  \"[n]o   other  credible   reason  for   [her]\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nnonselection  . . .  other than the  fact that the  selecting\r\n\nofficial wanted to insure that the Hispanic male was  awarded\r\n\nthe GS-13 position.\"  It found that Randlett's discharge  was\r\n\nsimilarly motivated by discriminatory animus.  In particular,\r\n\nthe EEOC  found that the  official who considered  Randlett's\r\n\npromotion \r                     had applied pressure on the selecting panel to alter\r\n\nits \r               rankings, which favored Randlett, so that the job could go\r\n\ninstead to a friend of the selecting official.\r\n\n     The  EEOC's 1981  order  directed  the  Department,  now\r\n\nmetamorphosed \r                         into \r                             Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), to cancel\r\n\nRandlett's 1975  discharge  and  to  \"immediately  reinstate\"\r\n\nRandlett  in  the  Denver  office  as  an  equal  opportunity\r\n\nspecialist, \r                       grade GS-13.  The order also awarded Randlett back\r\n\npay  and  other  entitlements   for  the  period  since   her\r\n\ntermination, \r                        and \r                           it \r                              required HHS to report within 30 days as to\r\n\nthe \r               steps \r                     it \r                        planned to take to implement the required action.\r\n\n     In late  June  1981, Randlett  began  what would  be  an\r\n\nextensive exchange  of  telephone calls  and  correspondence,\r\n\nprimarily with  Thomas Jefferson,  an HHS  official based  in\r\n\nWashington, \r                       D.C., who was apparently charged with coordinating\r\n\nRandlett's  reinstatement.   She  also talked  with  Patricia\r\n\nTaphorn,  a personnel  official in  the Denver  office.   The\r\n\nupshot, \r                   according to Randlett, was an agreement that she would\r\n\nreturn \r                  to \r                     the payroll of the HHS Denver office as of August 9,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n1981, but by using four weeks of accumulated leave, would not\r\n\nactually report for work until early September 1981.\r\n\n     According \r                          to \r                            both \r                                 Randlett and Taphorn, Jefferson was very\r\n\ndifficult to reach over the course of the summer and did  not\r\n\nact quickly enough to  confirm this understanding, nor  would\r\n\nanyone else in the Washington office take responsibility  for\r\n\ndoing \r                 so. \r                      \r                      We \r                        pass \r                             over \r                                  the details, but there is no indication\r\n\nthat \r                anything other than bureaucratic sloth was the cause.  In\r\n\nany \r               event, \r                      in August 1981, Randlett signed a contract with her\r\n\nthen-current employer, the Barnstable, Massachusetts,  school\r\n\nsystem, \r                   extending her employment there for an additional year.\r\n\n     Not  long afterwards,  Randlett received  a letter  from\r\n\nJefferson, confirming that she  was reinstated in the  Denver\r\n\noffice  as  of  September  1981;  he  also  referred  to  the\r\n\npossibility \r                       of a transfer to another regional office, but said\r\n\nthat  this was  not certain.   Further  telephone calls  were\r\n\nexchanged, \r                      and \r                         the \r                             matter was still unresolved in October 1981,\r\n\nwhen Randlett's father became  seriously ill.  Randlett  then\r\n\ntold \r                Jefferson that she would need to stay in Massachusetts to\r\n\ncare for her father.\r\n\n     After \r                      further \r                             confusion, \r                                        Randlett in February 1982 secured\r\n\nfrom \r                another \r                       HHS \r                           official in Washington a temporary \"detail\" to\r\n\na Boston HHS office, effective March 1, 1982, for a period of\r\n\nnot  more than  120 days.   The  official--Betty Lou  Dotson,\r\n\ndirector of the Office for Civil Rights--wrote Randlett  that\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nthe \r               detail \r                      was \r                         \"granted \r                                  to accommodate your personal situation\"\r\n\nand \r               concluded \r                         by \r                           saying \r                                  that \"I trust this detail will give you\r\n\nthe opportunity to attend to your personal responsibilities.\"\r\n\n     Randlett resigned from  her schoolteaching position  and\r\n\nbegan \r                 working \r                         in \r                           the \r                               Boston HHS office in March 1982.  By then,\r\n\nher \r               father \r                      had \r                         died, \r                               but \r                                   her aging mother's health was failing.\r\n\nRandlett also claims that,  almost immediately, she began  to\r\n\nexperience problems  in  the  Boston HHS  office  because  of\r\n\ninadequate training on work assignments, that she received  a\r\n\n\"low satisfactory\" ranking in an evaluation, and that she was\r\n\nlisted \r                  at \r                     a \r                      GS-12 \r                            level \r                                  in Boston (even though she continued to\r\n\nreceive a GS-13 salary).  \r\n\n     According to Randlett, Jefferson called her in May  1982\r\n\nand asked her when she planned to return to Denver.  Randlett\r\n\nreplied \r                   that \r                        she thought her position in Boston was permanent,\r\n\nbut in  June 1982, she  sent a letter  to HHS in  Washington,\r\n\nrequesting \r                      a \r                        permanent assignment to the Boston office, saying\r\n\n\"this \r                 is \r                    an \r                       unusual request, but probably no more unusual than\r\n\nthe six and a half years of injustices\" that she had endured.\r\n\nIt appears that Randlett also had a telephone conversation on\r\n\nthe subject with Bart Crivella, Jefferson's supervisor.\r\n\n     In \r                   early \r                         July \r                             1982, \r                                   the \r                                       request was answered in writing by\r\n\nNathan  Dick, the  deputy director  of the  Office for  Civil\r\n\nRights.  Dick's  letter denied the transfer request but  said\r\n\nthat HHS was willing to extend the temporary detail in Boston\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nuntil \r                 September \r                          30, \r                              1982, with Randlett returning on October 1,\r\n\n1982, to her \"permanent duty station in Denver.\"  The  letter\r\n\nexplained:\r\n\n     [I]t \r                     is \r                        not \r                            possible for the Office for Civil Rights\r\n     to \r                   offer \r                         you \r                             a permanent assignment in Boston.

In November  1982,\r\n\nRandlett's prospective  supervisor in  Denver, Alex  Aguilar,\r\n\nconfirmed \r                     the request for leave from October 1 to December 31,\r\n\n1982; but the letter also said that Aguilar expected Randlett\r\n\nto report  for work  on January 3,  1983, and  that he  would\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nconsider \r                    any \r                        request for further leave to be \"unreasonable and\r\n\nnot in the best interests of our organization.\"   \r\n\n     Randlett then asked Aguilar for leave-without-pay status\r\n\nafter December 1982.  Aguilar refused, saying that Randlett's\r\n\n\"prolonged\" absence was detrimental to his office.   Randlett\r\n\nthen \r                asked \r                      for \r                         sick \r                              leave.  Aguilar wrote that the agency might\r\n\nbe \r              able \r                   to \r                     make \r                          health-related accommodations for her in Denver\r\n\nso long  as she documented her  ailments; but some two  weeks\r\n\nlater Aguilar told Randlett that the documents she  submitted\r\n\nwere not adequate.  In March 1983, Randlett resigned,  saying\r\n\nthat it  was done  involuntarily to  prevent any  \"additional\r\n\nharassment\" from Aguilar  or \"any  other further  retaliatory\r\n\nacts.\"\r\n\n     Randlett's \r                           September 1982 complaint--directed against the\r\n\nthree named Washington officials--was originally rejected  by\r\n\nHHS on the ground that  it was untimely, but this ruling  was\r\n\nreversed by  the EEOC in 1985.   Incredibly, the ensuing  HHS\r\n\ninternal investigation  lasted over seven  years.  In  August\r\n\n1992, an HHS administrative law judge denied Randlett's claim\r\n\nof retaliation.   His  denial was  sustained by  the EEOC  in\r\n\nNovember 1993.\r\n\n     In \r                   December \r                            1993, Randlett filed her present complaint in\r\n\nthe federal district court under Title VII.  The core of  the\r\n\ncomplaint \r                     was \r                        that \r                             \"[a]lthough HHS had full power and authority\r\n\nto \r              assign \r                     plaintiff a permanent position in the Boston office,\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nit unreasonably refused to do so in order ultimately to force\r\n\nplaintiff \r                     to \r                        resign.\" \r                                 \r                                 The complaint attributed this refusal to\r\n\nretaliation for Randlett's successful 1975 complaint  against\r\n\nthe department, saying that hardship transfers were routinely\r\n\ngranted to individuals with  hardship requests similar to  or\r\n\nless serious than Randlett's.\r\n\n     Randlett \r                         also charged that she had been given an improper\r\n\n\"low satisfactory\" performance rating and inadequate training\r\n\nin Boston.  She asked for \"[r]einstatement to her position in\r\n\nBoston\" with back pay and benefits and reimbursement for some\r\n\nhealth insurance premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses.\r\n\nShe \r               also \r                   sought \r                          compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million\r\n\neach.\r\n\n     After a  period  of  discovery, HHS  moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment. \r                      \r                      It argued that the denial of permanent transfer was\r\n\nnot \r               an \r                  adverse employment action under Title VII, and that the\r\n\nagency \r                  had \r                      made \r                          an \r                             effort to accommodate Randlett's requests by\r\n\ngranting  a temporary detail  to Boston but  that it was  not\r\n\nrequired  to go further.   HHS also  supplied the court  with\r\n\ncorrespondenc\r                        e and a transcript of Randlett's testimony in the\r\n\nEEOC's recent investigation.\r\n\n     Randlett \r                         responded \r                                  with \r                                       her own version of events and also\r\n\nsubmitted \r                     affidavits from HHS employees attesting that HHS did\r\n\napprove \r                   hardship \r                           transfers with some regularity, and suggesting\r\n\nthat she could  have been accommodated in the Boston  office.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nThe most dramatic affidavit was submitted by an EEOC employee\r\n\nwho \r               had \r                   previously worked in the Denver HHS office.  According\r\n\nto \r              the \r                  affiant, in the spring of 1982 he had been talking with\r\n\nAguilar about a GS-13 position in the Denver office and asked\r\n\nif it was going to be filled permanently and if so, by  whom.\r\n\nThe affidavit continued:\r\n\n     Alex  Aguilar told  me \"That  position [cannot]  be\r\n     filled \r                       permanently until the matter of Jean Randlett\r\n     is resolved, but I  am going to make sure that  she\r\n     does not come to Denver.  We are going to put a lot\r\n     of  pressure on  her  so  she will  not  return  to\r\n     Denver.\"\r\n\n     On June  5, 1996, the  district judge  issued a  29-page\r\n\nmemorandum \r                      and \r                         order \r                               granting HHS' motion for summary judgment.\r\n\nThe decision dealt in different ways with Randlett's  various\r\n\nclaims, as will appear from our own discussion.  The decision\r\n\nwent some distance in the direction that HHS had urged in its\r\n\noriginal \r                    motion, holding that \"rejection of Randlett's request\r\n\nto \r              continue \r                       to stay in Boston for personal reasons is not a[n]\r\n\nadverse action cognizable by federal law.\"\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     A grant of summary judgment is subject to de novo review\r\n\non appeal, and this includes any claim that the evidence made\r\n\nout a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment.\r\n\nSargent\r                  , \r                    108 \r                        F.3d at 6.  Before addressing the central issue--\r\n\nthe denial of Randlett's request for a transfer to Boston--we\r\n\nconsider \r                    briefly, and then put to one side, certain rulings by\r\n\nthe district court that require no extended treatment.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     In the district court, Randlett urged that she had  been\r\n\n\"promised\"  a permanent  transfer  to  Boston  by  Jefferson.\r\n\nAssuming arguendo  that such a  \"promise\" might receive  some\r\n\nspecial protection, the district court carefully reviewed the\r\n\npertinent proffers  of  evidence,  especially  the  documents\r\n\nexchanged  between Randlett  and the  Washington office,  and\r\n\nconcluded  that no  reasonable jury  could find  that such  a\r\n\npromise had been made.  Without repeating the details,  which\r\n\nare set forth in the district court's decision, we agree with\r\n\nthis ruling.\r\n\n     The district  court also made  short work of  Randlett's\r\n\nclaim that  she had received  inadequate training in  Boston,\r\n\nsaying \r                  that \r                       even if this were true, there was no evidence that\r\n\nit was based upon a  motive to retaliate against her for  her\r\n\nearlier complaint.  \"At most,\" the district judge ruled, \"the\r\n\nevidence shows that the  Boston assignment was an  awkwardly-\r\n\ndesigned and  temporary  expedient  to  accommodate  Randlett\r\n\npending \r                   her \r                       return \r                             to \r                                the duty station [Denver] directed by the\r\n\n1981 EEOC decision.\"  This ruling also is well supported.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court \r                                  also \r                                       rejected Randlett's claim that she\r\n\nwas improperly listed  as a GS-12 employee in Boston,  saying\r\n\nthat this was not an adverse employment action since Randlett\r\n\ncontinued \r                     to \r                        be \r                          paid \r                               at \r                                  the GS-13 level.  We affirm this ruling\r\n\non a narrower ground:   no evidence exists that this  alleged\r\n\nBoston-office \"error\" was motivated by a desire to  retaliate\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                        -10-\r\r\n\nagainst Randlett  for filing a  complaint seven years  before\r\n\nagainst \r                   a \r                     different HHS office.  Whether in some other case an\r\n\ninaccurate listing could be an adverse action under Title VII\r\n\nneed not be pursued here.  \r\n\n     The \r                    central \r                            issue is HHS' refusal to transfer Randlett to\r\n\nthe \r               Boston \r                      office.  The district court said that this was \"not\r\n\na[n] adverse action  cognizable by federal law,\" but it  also\r\n\nsaid that not  even a \"scintilla  of evidence\" supported  the\r\n\nclaim \r                 \"that \r                       the agency retaliated against Randlett by refusing\r\n\nto \r              provide \r                      a \r                        permanent transfer to Boston for hardship reasons\r\n\nor to extend her temporary detail.\"  These are two  different\r\n\nreasons, one relating to law and the other to fact.\r\n\n     The \r                    more \r                         difficult \r                                  of \r                                     the two is the legal question:  what\r\n\ntypes of employer actions adverse to the employee can,  where\r\n\nimproperly \r                      motivated, give rise to a Title VII complaint.  The\r\n\ndistrict  judge, arguably  supported  by  references  in  the\r\n\ndecisions of a few other courts, accepted HHS' argument  that\r\n\nthe refusal  of a lateral transfer  to another office of  the\r\n\nagency does  not rise to the  level of an adverse  employment\r\n\naction compensable  under  Title  VII--even if  done  for  an\r\n\nimproper motive.\r\n\n     The  statute  itself  says  that  an  employer  may  not\r\n\n\"discriminate\" against an employee or applicant \"because [the\r\n\nemployee \r                    or \r                       applicant] has made a charge . . . or participated\r\n\nin \r              any \r                  manner\" in a Title VII investigation or proceeding.  42\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r\n\nU.S.C. \r                  S \r                    2000e-3(a). \r                                \r                                Elsewhere, the statute lists actions that\r\n\ncan \r               constitute discrimination, specifying a refusal to hire, a\r\n\ndischarge, or any  discriminatory treatment  with respect  to\r\n\n\"compensation, \r                          terms, \r                                conditions, or privileges of employment.\"\r\n\nId.

The latter is  the\r\n\nbetter \r                  perspective \r                             since \r                                   (even before the lawsuit began) Dick's\r\n\nletter did  explain  HHS'  reasons for  denying  a  permanent\r\n\ntransfer.\r\n\n     The \r                    difficulty for Randlett is that there is virtually no\r\n\nevidence  that HHS  officials in  Washington acted  out of  a\r\n\nretaliatory \r                       motive \r                             in \r                                denying the permanent transfer to Boston.\r\n\nRandlett's \r                      main \r                          argument \r                                   for inferring an improper motive--that\r\n\nis, a connection  to her previous complaint--is based on  her\r\n\naffidavits about HHS practice in granting hardship transfers.\r\n\nIf HHS handed out transfers as a matter of course whenever an\r\n\nemployee showed a hardship need, it might well be  suspicious\r\n\nwere Randlett alone singled out for a denial.\r\n\n     But \r                    in \r                       fact \r                            there \r                                 is \r                                    no \r                                       showing that in denying Randlett's\r\n\nrequest, \r                    HHS \r                        was departing from its usual practice.  Carefully\r\n\nread, all that the  affidavits say is that HHS often  granted\r\n\nhardship transfers in similar  cases; there is no  indication\r\n\nthat HHS granted  them invariably and  without regard to  the\r\n\nconvenience of  the agency.   And  in this  instance HHS,  in\r\n\ndenying \r                   Randlett's request, explained that reductions in force\r\n\n(\"RIFs\") \r                    and \r                        budget \r                              cuts \r                                   had reduced its flexibility and it was\r\n\nnot convenient to the agency to transfer Randlett permanently\r\n\nto Boston.\r\n\n     Randlett's only  other  evidence is  several  affidavits\r\n\ndescribing \r                      reassignments and hires within the Boston office in\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                        -15-\r\r\n\nor  around  1982.    This  confirms  that  there  were   some\r\n\nreassignments\r                         (due, at least in part, to the RIFs mentioned in\r\n\nDick's letter) and at least one new hire for a GS-12 position\r\n\nafter Randlett's resignation.  But nothing in the  affidavits\r\n\nshows retaliation  against  Randlett.   At  most,  one  might\r\n\nconclude that  some  other mix  of reassignments  might  have\r\n\nproduced a  GS-13  position for  Randlett, doubtless  to  the\r\n\ndisadvantage of some other employee.\r\n\n     Whatever  inference  might be  drawn  from  any  of  the\r\n\naffidavits \r                      has \r                          to \r                            be \r                               set \r                                   against other facts.  However careless\r\n\nJefferson  may  have  been  in  arranging  Randlett's  timely\r\n\nreassignment to Denver,  higher officials in  Washington--who\r\n\nwere responsible  for  refusing the  permanent  transfer--had\r\n\nhelped Randlett from the start, both by securing a  temporary\r\n\nposition in Boston and by deferring her start date in Denver.\r\n\nTaking everything  together, no basis  exists for  a jury  to\r\n\nconclude that the  permanent transfer was denied in order  to\r\n\nretaliate.\r\n\n     Our  causation analysis  would  be  quite  different  if\r\n\nRandlett's claim related to  Aguilar's action in refusing  to\r\n\ngrant an additional temporary delay to Randlett to permit her\r\n\nto delay reporting to duty in Denver in early 1983.  The tone\r\n\nof \r              Aguilar's \r                       alleged \r                               remarks, quoted above, might create a jury\r\n\nissue as  to  Aguilar's  own motive  in  refusing  Randlett's\r\n\nrequests to him.  This is so even though, absent the remarks,\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                        -16-\r\r\n\nthe Denver  office had good  reason for  wanting Randlett  to\r\n\nreport \r                  to \r                    duty \r                         (apparently, it was paying for Randlett's detail\r\n\nto Boston and had to leave her permanent position unfilled).\r\n\n     We need not  decide this issue because Randlett has  not\r\n\ncomplained of the Denver office's denial of further temporary\r\n\ndeferrals  in   her  reporting  date.     Rather,  her   1982\r\n\nadministrativ\r                        e complaint, which was the condition precedent to\r\n\nthis lawsuit, see 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-5(f), is directed at  the\r\n\nWashington \r                      officials' denial of a permanent transfer.  That is\r\n\nthe \r               relief \r                      she seeks in the district court.  No claim was made\r\n\nconcerning \r                      Aguilar's denial of a further temporary deferral of\r\n\nher return to Denver.\r\n\n     The   statutory    regime   requiring   exhaustion    of\r\n\nadministrative \r                          remedies \r                                  itself precludes any effort by Randlett\r\n\nat this late date to develop and pursue a new charge directed\r\n\nagainst Aguilar's own conduct in refusing further  deferrals.\r\n\nLattimore\r                     \r                     v. \r                        Polaroid Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728907\"><a href=\"/opinion/728907/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-397-36-fedrserv3d-569-ollie-lattimore-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 464 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\nNor is this some slip  of the pen:  everything in  Randlett's\r\n\nsituation makes clear that  the central grievance relates  to\r\n\nWashington's  denial  of  a  permanent  transfer  to  Boston.\r\n\nAccordingly, Aguilar's  actions  in  Denver,  whatever  their\r\n\nmotive,  would not support  a trial of  the only claims  that\r\n\nRandlett has made and preserved.\r\n\n     No one  can view  with  pride HHS'  record of  delay  in\r\n\ninvestigating this case or fail to sympathize with Randlett's\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                        -17-\r\r\n\npredicament--\r                        a job in one city and an aging parent in another.\r\n\nAt oral argument, we  forcefully urged the parties to seek  a\r\n\nsettlement and  asked  them  to use  our  court's  settlement\r\n\nprogram, delaying  this decision until  we were advised  that\r\n\nefforts \r                   at \r                      settlement had failed.  It will now be obvious that\r\n\nboth sides would have gained through a settlement.  \r\n\n     In sum, we affirm the decision of the district judge  on\r\n\nthe grant of summary judgment, although our reasoning differs\r\n\nin certain respects, and we decline to order costs for either\r\n\nside.  It  appears from the briefs  and oral argument that  a\r\n\nministerial \r                       issue \r                            relating to the calculation of certain health\r\n\ninsurance \r                     benefits due to Randlett remains to be resolved.  We\r\n\ntherefore  remand the  case to  the district  court for  this\r\n\nlimited purpose.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                        -18-\r\n</pre>",
