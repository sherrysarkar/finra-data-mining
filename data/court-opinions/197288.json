Count  nine, charging  Noriega-\r\n\nMillan  with possession of a  machine gun in  violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    922(o),   carried  a   ten-year  maximum   term  of\r\n\nimprisonment.  For each of the remaining  counts, the maximum\r\n\nterm of  imprisonment was  five years.    The district  court\r\n\naccepted  Noriega-Millan's plea  at  a  joint  change-of-plea\r\n\nhearing at which Noriega-Millan and two of his co-defendants,\r\n\neach represented by counsel, pleaded guilty.  \r\n\n          Noriega-Millan  entered his guilty plea pursuant to\r\n\nan  agreement which  stipulated  that  the government  would,\r\n\namong other things, reduce the total offense level from 31 to\r\n\n28,  and recommend a sentence of 97 months of imprisonment, a\r\n\nsentence in  the  middle of  the applicable  range of  87-108\r\n\nmonths  of  imprisonment.   At  the  sentencing hearing,  the\r\n\ndistrict   court  declined   to   accept   the   government's\r\n\nrecommendation  of a  97-month term  and imposed  the maximum\r\n\nsentence of 108 months,  to be served concurrently as  to all\r\n\ncounts of the indictment.\r\n\n          On  appeal, Noriega-Millan  argues that  his guilty\r\n\nplea should be set aside because, although the district judge\r\n\ncomplied with Rule  11(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nProcedure by warning him that the court was not  bound by the\r\n\ngovernment's recommendations, the judge failed, in derogation\r\n\nof Rule 11(e)(2) and Noriega-Millan's substantial rights,  to\r\n\nadvise him that  he would  not be permitted  to withdraw  his\r\n\nplea  if  the  court  declined  to  accept  the  government's\r\n\nrecommendations.   We affirm  the judgment of  conviction and\r\n\nthe sentence.  \r\n\n                             I.  \r                                         I.\r\n\n          The only issue on  appeal concerns the procedure by\r\n\nwhich  Noriega-Millan's  plea  of  guilty  was  entered   and\r\n\naccepted, as to which the record reveals the following.  \r\n\n          Noriega-Millan's  plea  agreement  states that  the\r\n\nagreement  was made pursuant to Rules 11 (e)(1)(A) and (B) of\r\n\nthe  Federal Rules  of  Criminal Procedure.1   The  agreement\r\n\nprovided that Noriega-Millan would plead guilty to all counts\r\n\nof the indictment in  exchange for the government's agreement\r\n\nto  do the following: (i)  reduce the total  offense level by\r\n\nthree levels  from 31 to 28 for acceptance of responsibility;\r\n\n(ii) recommend a sentence of 97 months of imprisonment, based\r\n\nupon  an estimated  total offense  level  of 28  and criminal\r\n\nhistory category of II, for which the sentencing range is 87-\r\n\n108 months of imprisonment; and (iii) raise no opposition  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Plea agreements made under  Rules 11(e)(1)(A) and (C) are\r\nsubject  to  different   procedural  requirements  than   are\r\nagreements made under Rule 11(e)(1)(B).  The Rule 11(e)(1)(A)\r\nportion of Noriega-Millan's agreement is not at issue in this\r\nappeal and will not be discussed.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\na  recommendation of  a  sentence at  the  lower end  of  the\r\n\napplicable range, if such a recommendation were to be made by\r\n\nthe United States Probation Office in its Presentence Report.\r\n\n          Prior to the change-of-plea hearing, Noriega-Millan\r\n\nreviewed the plea agreement with his attorney, at  which time\r\n\nhe initialed each  page of the document at  the center of the\r\n\nleft margin,  and signed his name in two places at the end of\r\n\nthe document.2   Paragraph  six of  the  agreement states  as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n               The  defendant  is  aware  that  the\r\n          defendant's sentence is within  the sound\r\n          discretion  of  the sentencing  judge and\r\n          will  be imposed  in accordance  with the\r\n          United   States   Sentencing  Guidelines,\r                                                               \r\n          Policy   Statements,   Application,   and\r                                                               \r\n          Background Notes.  The defendant is aware\r                                      \r\n          that  the  Court  has   jurisdiction  and\r\n          authority to impose  any sentence  within\r\n          the statutory maximum set for the offense\r\n          to which the defendant pleads guilty.  If\r\n          the Court should impose  a sentence up to\r\n          the maximum established  by statute,  the\r\n          defendant cannot, for that  reason alone,\r\n          withdraw a  guilty plea, and  will remain\r\n          bound  to fulfill all  of the obligations\r\n          under this plea agreement. \r\n\n          Paragraph  ten of the  agreement states, \"Defendant\r\n\nRafael  Noriega Millan is fully  aware that the  Court is not\r\n\nbound by  this plea agreement, including but  not limited to:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The plea agreement contained  in the record on  appeal is\r\nin  English; the  transcript of  the change-of-plea  hearing,\r\nhowever,  indicates   that   Noriega-Millan  had   read   and\r\nunderstood a Spanish version of the agreement. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nsentencing  guidelines   calculations,  stipulations,  and/or\r\n\nsentence recommendations.\"\r\n\n          In  contrast to  plea  agreements made  pursuant to\r\n\nRules 11(e)(1)(A) and (C), Rule 11(e)(1)(B) agreements cannot\r\n\nbe withdrawn if  the court chooses to reject the terms of the\r\n\nagreement;  once  accepted  by  the district  court,  a  Rule\r\n\n11(e)(1)(B) agreement \"foreclose[s]  forever the  defendant's\r\n\nother options.\"  United States v. Graibe, 946 F.2d 1428, 1432\r                                                    \r\n\n(9th  Cir. 1991).  For  this reason, when  a defendant pleads\r\n\nguilty pursuant to a Rule 11(e)(1)(B) agreement, the district\r\n\njudge  is required by  Rule 11(e)(2) to  advise the defendant\r\n\nthat the  court is not  obligated to accept  the government's\r\n\nrecommendations and that the  defendant will not be permitted\r\n\nto withdraw her guilty plea in  the event that the court does\r\n\nnot follow the government's recommendations.  \r\n\n          The  Supreme Court has  stressed the  importance in\r\n\nRule 11 proceedings of  direct interrogation of the defendant\r\n\nby   the  district   court   in  order   to  facilitate   the\r\n\ndetermination of  the voluntariness  of a defendant's  guilty\r\n\nplea.

Kennell, 15 F.3d  134, 136,  137 (9th\r                                           \r\n\nCir. 1994).     \r\n\n          A joint change-of-plea hearing was held on July 31,\r\n\n1995, with Noriega-Millan and two co-defendants present, each\r\n\nrepresented  by  counsel.    Although   the  judge  sometimes\r\n\naddressed  himself to all  three defendants  collectively, he\r\n\nengaged in individual colloquies with Noriega-Millan and each\r\n\nco-defendant regarding the following: his competence to plead\r\n\nguilty;  the voluntariness  of  his plea;  his knowledge  and\r\n\nunderstanding of  the charges  against him and  the penalties\r\n\nattending  the  charges; and  whether  he  had consulted  his\r\n\nattorney  regarding the charges and the  plea agreement.  The\r\n\njudge addressed the  defendants collectively regarding  their\r\n\nawareness and understanding of the constitutional rights they\r\n\nwaived by entering a plea of guilty.  Throughout the hearing,\r\n\nthe court  addressed the  defendants through an  interpreter,\r\n\nalthough  Noriega-Millan  sometimes   answered  the   court's\r\n\nquestions in English.\r\n\n          In response to  the court's questioning during  his\r\n\nindividual colloquy, Noriega-Millan acknowledged, inter alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat  he had reviewed the plea  agreement with the assistance\r\n\nof  counsel prior to the  hearing, and that  his attorney had\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nexplained the agreement to  him before he signed it;  that he\r\n\nhad  read the plea agreement and understood everything in it;\r\n\nthat he was aware  that his criminal history category  was II\r\n\nand  that  the total  offense level  was  28, based  upon the\r\n\ngovernment's  recommendation of a  three-level reduction from\r\n\noffense level  31 for  acceptance of responsibility;  that he\r\n\nunderstood that  the sentencing  range specified in  the plea\r\n\nagreement was 87-108  months of imprisonment; that,  pursuant\r\n\nto  the  plea agreement,  the  government  would recommend  a\r\n\nsentence of 97 months of imprisonment; and that he understood\r\n\nthat the government's  recommendations were not  binding upon\r\n\nthe court.  \r\n\n          The district judge gave  the Rule 11(e)(2) warnings\r\n\nto  each  defendant  separately,   rather  than  to  all  the\r\n\ndefendants  collectively.   During his  individual colloquies\r\n\nwith  Noriega-Millan's  co-defendants,  the   district  judge\r\n\nwarned each defendant both that  the court was not  obligated\r\n\nto accept  the  government's  recommendations  and  that  the\r\n\ndefendant  would not be permitted to withdraw his plea if the\r\n\ncourt  did  not  follow  the   government's  recommendations.\r\n\nDuring his individual  colloquy with Noriega-Millan, however,\r\n\nthe  district judge advised him  only that the  court was not\r\n\nbound to follow the  government's recommendations; he did not\r\n\nwarn  Noriega-Millan  that  he  would  not  be  permitted  to\r\n\nwithdraw  his  plea  in   the  event  that  the  government's\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nrecommendations were not followed.  On  November  2, 1995,  a\r\n\nsentencing hearing was held at which  Noriega-Millan appeared\r\n\nas  the sole defendant, again represented by counsel.  At the\r\n\nsentencing hearing,  as at  the  change-of-plea hearing,  the\r\n\ndistrict  judge warned that  the government's recommendations\r\n\nwere not binding upon  the court but did not  advise Noriega-\r\n\nMillan that he  would not be allowed to  withdraw his plea if\r\n\nthe court were to reject the government's recommendations.  \r\n\n          After  permitting  Noriega-Millan  to  address  the\r\n\ncourt   regarding  his   family  ties   and  his   desire  to\r\n\nrehabilitate   himself,  the  district   court  accepted  the\r\n\ngovernment's recommendation regarding  concurrent service  of\r\n\nsentence but  rejected its recommendation of  a 97-month term\r\n\nof imprisonment,  instead  sentencing Noriega-Millan  to  the\r\n\nmaximum term  of 108 months,  to be served  concurrently with\r\n\nthe sentences imposed on other counts.  Noriega-Millan raised\r\n\nno  objection to the sentence and made no attempt to withdraw\r\n\nhis plea in the district court.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II. \r                                         II.\r\n\n          Federal  Rule  of  Criminal Procedure  11(e)(1)(B),\r\n\nwhich  governs Noriega-Millan's  plea  agreement, provides  a\r\n\nprocedure by which a  defendant may agree to plead  guilty in\r\n\nexchange  for   the   government's  agreement   to  \"make   a\r\n\nrecommendation, or agree[ment] not to oppose the  defendant's\r\n\nrequest,  for a  particular sentence, with  the understanding\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthat such recommendation or request shall not be binding upon\r\n\nthe court.\"  Rule 11(e)(2) provides that, before the district\r\n\ncourt may accept  a guilty  plea entered pursuant  to a  Rule\r\n\n11(e)(1)(B)  agreement, \"the court shall advise the defendant\r\n\nthat  if the  court  does not  accept  the recommendation  or\r\n\nrequest the  defendant nevertheless has no  right to withdraw\r\n\nthe plea.\"\r\n\n          Noriega-Millan  asserts  that he  did  not  move to\r\n\nwithdraw his  plea prior to  sentencing because he  had hoped\r\n\nthat  the  district  court  would  follow  the   government's\r\n\nrecommendation  of a 97-month sentence, and that he would not\r\n\nhave pleaded guilty had he known that he would not be allowed\r\n\nto withdraw his plea if the district court did not follow the\r\n\ngovernment's recommendation.   He contends that  the district\r\n\ncourt's  failure  to  give  this  required  warning  was  not\r\n\nharmless  error because, as a result of the court's error, he\r\n\ndid not understand the consequences  of his guilty plea  and,\r\n\ntherefore,   his  plea  was  not  knowingly  and  voluntarily\r\n\nentered.  Noriega-Millan raises these arguments for the first\r\n\ntime on appeal.  \r\n\n          Ordinarily, we deem an  issue not raised before the\r\n\ndistrict  court to  be waived.   We will,  however, determine\r\n\ncompliance with  Rule 11, even  if a claim  of non-compliance\r\n\nwas not presented  in the  district court, if  the record  is\r\n\nsufficiently developed, which  is generally the  case because\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nof Rule 11(g)'s  requirement that the  district court make  a\r\n\ncomplete  record  of the  plea  proceedings.

The  record reveals,  and Noriega-\r\n\nMillan does  not dispute, that the  district judge personally\r\n\nwarned him that  the court  was not obligated  to follow  the\r\n\ngovernment's   sentencing  recommendations,   and  personally\r\n\nensured  that Noriega-Millan  understood  that, although  the\r\n\ngovernment had  agreed to recommend a  97-month sentence, the\r\n\nmaximum sentence that the court could impose  was 108 months.\r\n\nGiven  these facts and  Noriega-Millan's willingness to plead\r\n\nguilty  in exchange for a  97-month sentence, it  seems to us\r\n\nhighly  unlikely that,  properly warned  of his  inability to\r\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea once it was accepted, Noriega-Millan\r\n\nwould  have  chosen  to go  to  trial  rather  than risk  the\r\n\npossibility that  the district court might  impose a sentence\r\n\neleven  months  longer   than  the  government's  recommended\r\n\nsentence.   We conclude that  the district court's failure to\r\n\nwarn Noriega-Millan of his inability to withdraw his plea did\r\n\nnot affect his decision to plead guilty.\r\n\n          Our conclusion is  supported by  Martinez-Martinez,\r                                                                        \r\n\nin  which  we  found  the  advisement  requirements  of  Rule\r\n\n11(e)(2) to  be satisfied  where the  district judge  did not\r\n\nexplicitly inform  the defendant that she  could not withdraw\r\n\nher guilty plea, but where the court \"personally ensured that\r\n\n[the  defendant] understood  the  non-binding nature  of  the\r\n\n[government's]  recommendation.\"   69 F.3d  at 1223-24.

Count  nine, charging  Noriega-\r\n\nMillan  with possession of a  machine gun in  violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    922(o),   carried  a   ten-year  maximum   term  of\r\n\nimprisonment.  For each of the remaining  counts, the maximum\r\n\nterm of  imprisonment was  five years.    The district  court\r\n\naccepted  Noriega-Millan's plea  at  a  joint  change-of-plea\r\n\nhearing at which Noriega-Millan and two of his co-defendants,\r\n\neach represented by counsel, pleaded guilty.  \r\n\n          Noriega-Millan  entered his guilty plea pursuant to\r\n\nan  agreement which  stipulated  that  the government  would,\r\n\namong other things, reduce the total offense level from 31 to\r\n\n28,  and recommend a sentence of 97 months of imprisonment, a\r\n\nsentence in  the  middle of  the applicable  range of  87-108\r\n\nmonths  of  imprisonment.   At  the  sentencing hearing,  the\r\n\ndistrict   court  declined   to   accept   the   government's\r\n\nrecommendation  of a  97-month term  and imposed  the maximum\r\n\nsentence of 108 months,  to be served concurrently as  to all\r\n\ncounts of the indictment.\r\n\n          On  appeal, Noriega-Millan  argues that  his guilty\r\n\nplea should be set aside because, although the district judge\r\n\ncomplied with Rule  11(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nProcedure by warning him that the court was not  bound by the\r\n\ngovernment's recommendations, the judge failed, in derogation\r\n\nof Rule 11(e)(2) and Noriega-Millan's substantial rights,  to\r\n\nadvise him that  he would  not be permitted  to withdraw  his\r\n\nplea  if  the  court  declined  to  accept  the  government's\r\n\nrecommendations.   We affirm  the judgment of  conviction and\r\n\nthe sentence.  \r\n\n                             I.  \r                                         I.\r\n\n          The only issue on  appeal concerns the procedure by\r\n\nwhich  Noriega-Millan's  plea  of  guilty  was  entered   and\r\n\naccepted, as to which the record reveals the following.  \r\n\n          Noriega-Millan's  plea  agreement  states that  the\r\n\nagreement  was made pursuant to Rules 11 (e)(1)(A) and (B) of\r\n\nthe  Federal Rules  of  Criminal Procedure.1   The  agreement\r\n\nprovided that Noriega-Millan would plead guilty to all counts\r\n\nof the indictment in  exchange for the government's agreement\r\n\nto  do the following: (i)  reduce the total  offense level by\r\n\nthree levels  from 31 to 28 for acceptance of responsibility;\r\n\n(ii) recommend a sentence of 97 months of imprisonment, based\r\n\nupon  an estimated  total offense  level  of 28  and criminal\r\n\nhistory category of II, for which the sentencing range is 87-\r\n\n108 months of imprisonment; and (iii) raise no opposition  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Plea agreements made under  Rules 11(e)(1)(A) and (C) are\r\nsubject  to  different   procedural  requirements  than   are\r\nagreements made under Rule 11(e)(1)(B).  The Rule 11(e)(1)(A)\r\nportion of Noriega-Millan's agreement is not at issue in this\r\nappeal and will not be discussed.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\na  recommendation of  a  sentence at  the  lower end  of  the\r\n\napplicable range, if such a recommendation were to be made by\r\n\nthe United States Probation Office in its Presentence Report.\r\n\n          Prior to the change-of-plea hearing, Noriega-Millan\r\n\nreviewed the plea agreement with his attorney, at  which time\r\n\nhe initialed each  page of the document at  the center of the\r\n\nleft margin,  and signed his name in two places at the end of\r\n\nthe document.2   Paragraph  six of  the  agreement states  as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n               The  defendant  is  aware  that  the\r\n          defendant's sentence is within  the sound\r\n          discretion  of  the sentencing  judge and\r\n          will  be imposed  in accordance  with the\r\n          United   States   Sentencing  Guidelines,\r                                                               \r\n          Policy   Statements,   Application,   and\r                                                               \r\n          Background Notes.  The defendant is aware\r                                      \r\n          that  the  Court  has   jurisdiction  and\r\n          authority to impose  any sentence  within\r\n          the statutory maximum set for the offense\r\n          to which the defendant pleads guilty.  If\r\n          the Court should impose  a sentence up to\r\n          the maximum established  by statute,  the\r\n          defendant cannot, for that  reason alone,\r\n          withdraw a  guilty plea, and  will remain\r\n          bound  to fulfill all  of the obligations\r\n          under this plea agreement. \r\n\n          Paragraph  ten of the  agreement states, \"Defendant\r\n\nRafael  Noriega Millan is fully  aware that the  Court is not\r\n\nbound by  this plea agreement, including but  not limited to:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The plea agreement contained  in the record on  appeal is\r\nin  English; the  transcript of  the change-of-plea  hearing,\r\nhowever,  indicates   that   Noriega-Millan  had   read   and\r\nunderstood a Spanish version of the agreement. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nsentencing  guidelines   calculations,  stipulations,  and/or\r\n\nsentence recommendations.\"\r\n\n          In  contrast to  plea  agreements made  pursuant to\r\n\nRules 11(e)(1)(A) and (C), Rule 11(e)(1)(B) agreements cannot\r\n\nbe withdrawn if  the court chooses to reject the terms of the\r\n\nagreement;  once  accepted  by  the district  court,  a  Rule\r\n\n11(e)(1)(B) agreement \"foreclose[s]  forever the  defendant's\r\n\nother options.\"  United States v.

For  this reason, when  a defendant pleads\r\n\nguilty pursuant to a Rule 11(e)(1)(B) agreement, the district\r\n\njudge  is required by  Rule 11(e)(2) to  advise the defendant\r\n\nthat the  court is not  obligated to accept  the government's\r\n\nrecommendations and that the  defendant will not be permitted\r\n\nto withdraw her guilty plea in  the event that the court does\r\n\nnot follow the government's recommendations.  \r\n\n          The  Supreme Court has  stressed the  importance in\r\n\nRule 11 proceedings of  direct interrogation of the defendant\r\n\nby   the  district   court   in  order   to  facilitate   the\r\n\ndetermination of  the voluntariness  of a defendant's  guilty\r\n\nplea.

Although   the  judge  sometimes\r\n\naddressed  himself to all  three defendants  collectively, he\r\n\nengaged in individual colloquies with Noriega-Millan and each\r\n\nco-defendant regarding the following: his competence to plead\r\n\nguilty;  the voluntariness  of  his plea;  his knowledge  and\r\n\nunderstanding of  the charges  against him and  the penalties\r\n\nattending  the  charges; and  whether  he  had consulted  his\r\n\nattorney  regarding the charges and the  plea agreement.  The\r\n\njudge addressed the  defendants collectively regarding  their\r\n\nawareness and understanding of the constitutional rights they\r\n\nwaived by entering a plea of guilty.  Throughout the hearing,\r\n\nthe court  addressed the  defendants through an  interpreter,\r\n\nalthough  Noriega-Millan  sometimes   answered  the   court's\r\n\nquestions in English.\r\n\n          In response to  the court's questioning during  his\r\n\nindividual colloquy, Noriega-Millan acknowledged, inter alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat  he had reviewed the plea  agreement with the assistance\r\n\nof  counsel prior to the  hearing, and that  his attorney had\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nexplained the agreement to  him before he signed it;  that he\r\n\nhad  read the plea agreement and understood everything in it;\r\n\nthat he was aware  that his criminal history category  was II\r\n\nand  that  the total  offense level  was  28, based  upon the\r\n\ngovernment's  recommendation of a  three-level reduction from\r\n\noffense level  31 for  acceptance of responsibility;  that he\r\n\nunderstood that  the sentencing  range specified in  the plea\r\n\nagreement was 87-108  months of imprisonment; that,  pursuant\r\n\nto  the  plea agreement,  the  government  would recommend  a\r\n\nsentence of 97 months of imprisonment; and that he understood\r\n\nthat the government's  recommendations were not  binding upon\r\n\nthe court.  \r\n\n          The district judge gave  the Rule 11(e)(2) warnings\r\n\nto  each  defendant  separately,   rather  than  to  all  the\r\n\ndefendants  collectively.   During his  individual colloquies\r\n\nwith  Noriega-Millan's  co-defendants,  the   district  judge\r\n\nwarned each defendant both that  the court was not  obligated\r\n\nto accept  the  government's  recommendations  and  that  the\r\n\ndefendant  would not be permitted to withdraw his plea if the\r\n\ncourt  did  not  follow  the   government's  recommendations.\r\n\nDuring his individual  colloquy with Noriega-Millan, however,\r\n\nthe  district judge advised him  only that the  court was not\r\n\nbound to follow the  government's recommendations; he did not\r\n\nwarn  Noriega-Millan  that  he  would  not  be  permitted  to\r\n\nwithdraw  his  plea  in   the  event  that  the  government's\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nrecommendations were not followed.  On  November  2, 1995,  a\r\n\nsentencing hearing was held at which  Noriega-Millan appeared\r\n\nas  the sole defendant, again represented by counsel.  At the\r\n\nsentencing hearing,  as at  the  change-of-plea hearing,  the\r\n\ndistrict  judge warned that  the government's recommendations\r\n\nwere not binding upon  the court but did not  advise Noriega-\r\n\nMillan that he  would not be allowed to  withdraw his plea if\r\n\nthe court were to reject the government's recommendations.  \r\n\n          After  permitting  Noriega-Millan  to  address  the\r\n\ncourt   regarding  his   family  ties   and  his   desire  to\r\n\nrehabilitate   himself,  the  district   court  accepted  the\r\n\ngovernment's recommendation regarding  concurrent service  of\r\n\nsentence but  rejected its recommendation of  a 97-month term\r\n\nof imprisonment,  instead  sentencing Noriega-Millan  to  the\r\n\nmaximum term  of 108 months,  to be served  concurrently with\r\n\nthe sentences imposed on other counts.  Noriega-Millan raised\r\n\nno  objection to the sentence and made no attempt to withdraw\r\n\nhis plea in the district court.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II. \r                                         II.\r\n\n          Federal  Rule  of  Criminal Procedure  11(e)(1)(B),\r\n\nwhich  governs Noriega-Millan's  plea  agreement, provides  a\r\n\nprocedure by which a  defendant may agree to plead  guilty in\r\n\nexchange  for   the   government's  agreement   to  \"make   a\r\n\nrecommendation, or agree[ment] not to oppose the  defendant's\r\n\nrequest,  for a  particular sentence, with  the understanding\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthat such recommendation or request shall not be binding upon\r\n\nthe court.\"  Rule 11(e)(2) provides that, before the district\r\n\ncourt may accept  a guilty  plea entered pursuant  to a  Rule\r\n\n11(e)(1)(B)  agreement, \"the court shall advise the defendant\r\n\nthat  if the  court  does not  accept  the recommendation  or\r\n\nrequest the  defendant nevertheless has no  right to withdraw\r\n\nthe plea.\"\r\n\n          Noriega-Millan  asserts  that he  did  not  move to\r\n\nwithdraw his  plea prior to  sentencing because he  had hoped\r\n\nthat  the  district  court  would  follow  the   government's\r\n\nrecommendation  of a 97-month sentence, and that he would not\r\n\nhave pleaded guilty had he known that he would not be allowed\r\n\nto withdraw his plea if the district court did not follow the\r\n\ngovernment's recommendation.   He contends that  the district\r\n\ncourt's  failure  to  give  this  required  warning  was  not\r\n\nharmless  error because, as a result of the court's error, he\r\n\ndid not understand the consequences  of his guilty plea  and,\r\n\ntherefore,   his  plea  was  not  knowingly  and  voluntarily\r\n\nentered.  Noriega-Millan raises these arguments for the first\r\n\ntime on appeal.  \r\n\n          Ordinarily, we deem an  issue not raised before the\r\n\ndistrict  court to  be waived.

We conclude that  the district court's failure to\r\n\nwarn Noriega-Millan of his inability to withdraw his plea did\r\n\nnot affect his decision to plead guilty.\r\n\n          Our conclusion is  supported by  Martinez-Martinez,\r                                                                        \r\n\nin  which  we  found  the  advisement  requirements  of  Rule\r\n\n11(e)(2) to  be satisfied  where the  district judge  did not\r\n\nexplicitly inform  the defendant that she  could not withdraw\r\n\nher guilty plea, but where the court \"personally ensured that\r\n\n[the  defendant] understood  the  non-binding nature  of  the\r\n\n[government's]  recommendation.\"   69 F.3d  at 1223-24.
