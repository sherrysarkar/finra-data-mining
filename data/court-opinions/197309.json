BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Although the  accepted summary judgment  protocol calls\r\n\nfor  us to cast the facts in  the light most complimentary to the\r\n\nplaintiff's position, consistent with record support,  see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nGarside v. Osco  Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48  (1st Cir. 1990), we\r                                     \r\n\ntemper that protocol here to the extent that we set off, as point\r\n\nand counterpoint,  conflicting evidence where the  clash helps to\r\n\nilluminate pertinent legal issues.  For simplicity's sake we omit\r\n\nany further reference to CIS and treat its insured as  if he were\r\n\nthe sole defendant.\r\n\n          Dr.  Gonz lez,  a  specialist in  obstetrics,  provided\r\n\nprenatal care to Cort s after she  became pregnant with Jos .  On\r\n\nDecember 15, 1979, Cort s  related to Dr. Gonz lez that  her last\r\n\nmenstrual  cycle prior  to  conception began  on  November 2  and\r\n\nlasted  only two days.   The length of  her immediately preceding\r\n\nmenses was three days,  and her periods typically had  lasted two\r\n\nor three days  during the  year prior to  her current  pregnancy.\r\n\nBased  on this  data, Dr.  Gonz lez calculated  Cort s' estimated\r\n\ndelivery date (EDD) to be  August 9, 1980.  He delivered  Jos  by\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ncesarean section on  July 30,  1980.  The  newborn weighed  eight\r\n\npounds,  eight and  three-quarter  ounces (two  pounds more  than\r\n\nCort s' first child) and exhibited no fetal distress.\r\n\n          According to the  defendant's computations, Cort s  was\r\n\nin her  thirty-ninth  week of  pregnancy when  the baby  arrived.\r\n\nThis  calculation forms  the nub  of the  case.   The plaintiff's\r\n\ntheory  is that Dr. Gonz lez misfigured the baby's fetal age and,\r\n\nconsequently, allowed the pregnancy  to continue beyond forty-two\r\n\nweeks,  thus bringing  into play  a risk  factor known  as \"post-\r\n\ndatism\" or \"post-maturity.\"   A  post-dated fetus is  at risk  of\r\n\noxygen deprivation during its extended stay in the mother's womb,\r\n\nand brain damage is a predictable result.  While Jos , at  birth,\r\n\ndisplayed   no  detectable   symptoms  suggesting   a  post-dated\r\n\ndelivery,  the   circumstances  of  the  delivery  revealed  some\r\n\nindications  of potential  perinatal difficulties;  for instance,\r\n\nthe cesarean  section took  twenty-one minutes (roughly  twice as\r\n\nlong as  the norm), and,  on one  view of the  proof, a  tracheal\r\n\ncatheter was used to intubate the newborn.1\r\n\n          Time resolved  these mixed signals.   Jos  showed signs\r\n\nof neurologic abnormality at three  months and was diagnosed with\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Other contemporaneous indicators were  inscrutable.  On the\r\none hand, Jos  had a relatively high Apgar score.  An Apgar score\r\nis comprised of five components:  heart rate, respiratory effort,\r\nmuscle  tone,  reflex irritability,  and  color.   It  usually is\r\ncompiled by the anesthesiologist at one minute after the delivery\r\nand again  at the  five-minute mark.   A  low score  is generally\r\nthought to have predictive value in determining brain damage.  On\r\nthe other  hand, testing at  birth revealed  a somewhat  elevated\r\nserum  bilirubin   level  (which  could   indicate  an  incipient\r\nmetabolic problem).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nimpaired motor  development and hearing loss  at fourteen months.\r\n\nHis condition worsened as the years passed.  As an adolescent, he\r\n\nwas  diagnosed  as   severely  brain   damaged,  epileptic,   and\r\n\nprofoundly deaf.   At that  juncture, Cort s, then  a citizen  of\r\n\nFlorida,  sued Dr.  Gonz lez  in Puerto  Rico's federal  district\r\n\ncourt, see 28 U.S.C.   1332(a) (diversity jurisdiction), alleging\r                    \r\n\nthat the physician's negligence caused her son's infirmities.\r\n\n          Cort s'  case rests  primarily on  the opinions  of two\r\n\nexperts.  An  obstetrician, Dr. Bernard Nathanson,  opined that a\r\n\ncompetent obstetrician, rather than  relying upon a reported two-\r\n\nday menstrual  period to  calculate a  gravid woman's  EDD, would\r\n\nhave launched a more detailed gynecologic investigation.  Had Dr.\r\n\nGonz lez done so,  the witness stated,  he would have  discovered\r\n\nthat Cort s'  actual  EDD was  July 9,  1980, and  he would  have\r\n\nrecognized that  a substantial risk of post-datism arose when her\r\n\npregnancy extended past the EDD (a risk which he presumably could\r\n\nhave negated  by performing  the cesarean section  earlier).   In\r\n\nreaching  these conclusions, Dr.  Nathanson stressed  the unusual\r\n\nbrevity  of the  reported period  (especially as  contrasted with\r\n\nCort s' previous menses) and Dr. Gonz lez' failure to confirm the\r\n\nEDD by  performing various tests  which the  witness stated  were\r\n\navailable in  1979-1980 (e.g., a B-scan  ultrasound examination).\r\n\nIn Dr. Nathanson's opinion, the pregnancy was post-dated, and the\r\n\ndefendant's  failure to  realize  it and  take corrective  action\r\n\nviolated the prevailing standard of care.\r\n\n          Dr. Nathanson  also  disputed Dr.  Gonz lez'  assertion\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat  he in fact performed a manual pelvic examination at Cort s'\r\n\ninitial   appointment  and   subsequently  measured   her  uterus\r\n\nthroughout  her pregnancy to corroborate the  EDD.  Dr. Nathanson\r\n\nsaw no evidence that  these steps had been taken.   Moreover, Dr.\r\n\nGonz lez'  office  record did  not  mention  either the  periodic\r\n\nuterine measurements  or their results.  Although some of Cort s'\r\n\nprenatal charts apparently had  been lost,  Dr.  Nathanson stated\r\n\nthat  these data  \"are  so  vital that  they  should  be in  [Dr.\r\n\nGonz lez'] record in any case had he done them.\"\r\n\n          The plaintiff's second expert, Dr.  Allan Hausknecht, a\r\n\nneurologist,  diagnosed Jos  as  suffering from  Lennox Gasteault\r\n\nSyndrome (LGS).  This neurological condition is caused roughly\r\n\nfifty percent of  the time by  perinatal brain damage  (resulting\r\n\nfrom  a lack of  sufficient oxygen to  the fetal  brain).  Doctor\r\n\nHausknecht  stated  that,  in  his  experience,  this  percentage\r\n\nincreases sharply when, as  in this instance, no evidence  of any\r\n\nother known cause exists.  Noting that the gradual development of\r\n\nJos 's condition  was characteristic of a  post-mature fetus, Dr.\r\n\nHausknecht rendered an opinion  that Jos 's brain damage resulted\r\n\nfrom the  post-datism which Dr.  Nathanson had identified.   This\r\n\nopinion was bolstered in some degree by Dr. Nathanson's statement\r\n\nthat, while some  post-dated infants will show immediate signs of\r\n\nplacental senescence, such as  meconium-stained amniotic fluid or\r\n\npeeling of the skin  (Jos  had neither), many others  will appear\r\n\nasymptomatic at birth yet manifest the  effects of post-datism at\r\n\na later time.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          To  be   sure,  the  plaintiff's  evidence   was  hotly\r\n\ncontested.  The defendant   claimed that he  had figured the  EDD\r\n\naccurately  and that many of the tests suggested by Dr. Nathanson\r\n\nwere  unnecessary, or impracticable, or  both.  He also presented\r\n\nexperts  who   offered  an  alternative   theory  of   causation:\r\n\nintrauterine  cytomegalovirus (CMV)  infection, a  rare condition\r\n\nwhich  occurs in  0.2 to  2.2 percent  of all  live births.   The\r\n\nresults  of blood tests performed on Jos  at age fifteen revealed\r\n\nprevious or  latent CMV infection,  but did not  indicate whether\r\n\nthe   infection  had  been  contracted  in  utero.    This  is  a\r\n\nsignificant omission  because, while infants who  suffer from CMV\r\n\nmay  be  asymptomatic  at  birth and  thereafter  develop  mental\r\n\nretardation  or deafness, CMV can  be transmitted in various ways\r\n\nand affects most individuals during their lifetimes.\r\n\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\n          A court  may grant summary judgment  \"if the pleadings,\r\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and  admissions on file,\r\n\ntogether  with  the affidavits,  if any,  show  that there  is no\r\n\ngenuine issue as  to any material fact and that  the moving party\r\n\nis  entitled to a judgment as a matter  of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56(c).  We  have expounded this standard and its particulars in a\r\n\nsymphony  of cases,  see, e.g.,  McCarthy v.  Northwest Airlines,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir. 1995) (collecting cases), and we\r              \r\n\nrefrain from  rehearsing this  jurisprudential chorus here.   For\r\n\nour  purposes,  it  suffices   briefly  to  describe  the  rule's\r\n\noperation.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          The  objective of  summary judgment  \"is to  pierce the\r\n\nboilerplate  of the  pleadings and  assay the  parties' proof  in\r\n\norder to determine whether trial is actually required.\"  Wynne v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791,  794 (1st Cir. 1992).  To\r                                  \r\n\ndefeat  a motion for  summary judgment, the  nonmoving party must\r\n\ndemonstrate  the existence  of  a trialworthy  issue  as to  some\r\n\nmaterial  fact.  See Coyne v. Taber  Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 457\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1995).  A fact  is \"material\" if it  potentially could\r\n\naffect the  suit's outcome.   See  Garside, 895 F.2d  at 48.   An\r                                                    \r\n\nissue  concerning  such  a  fact  is  \"genuine\"  if  a reasonable\r\n\nfactfinder, examining  the  evidence and  drawing all  reasonable\r\n\ninferences helpful to the party resisting summary judgment, could\r\n\nresolve  the  dispute  in  that  party's  favor.    See  National\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d  731, 735 (1st Cir.),\r                                            \r\n\ncert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2247 (1995).\r                      \r\n\n          Exercising de novo review,  see Coyne, 53 F.3d  at 457,\r                                                         \r\n\nwe  hold that the record in  this case presents triable issues as\r\n\nto whether  Dr. Gonz lez violated his  duty of care,  and, if so,\r\n\nwhether his  actions caused  Jos 's injuries.   Consequently, the\r\n\ndistrict  court   erred  in   granting  the  motion   for  brevis\r                                                                           \r\n\ndisposition.\r\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\r          III.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          We  first survey  the junction  where summary  judgment\r\n\nprinciples  and  the  standards  governing the  admissibility  of\r\n\nexpert scientific evidence intersect.  We then evaluate the lower\r\n\ncourt's ruling.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n          The  defendant  asserts on  appeal  that  the entry  of\r\n\njudgment should  be affirmed because  the district court  had the\r\n\npower  to exclude  the  plaintiff's expert  evidence pursuant  to\r\n\nDaubert  v.  Merrell  Dow  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,  509  U.S.  579\r                                                          \r\n\n(1993),  and that,  without such  evidence, the plaintiff  has no\r\n\ncase.  Cort s parries this thrust by contending that Daubert does\r                                                                      \r\n\nnot  apply at  the  summary  judgment  stage.    The  truth  lies\r\n\nsomewhere in between.\r\n\n          The  Daubert  Court  formulated  a regime  for  use  in\r                                \r\n\nascertaining  the  admissibility  of  expert  scientific evidence\r\n\nunder  Fed. R. Evid. 702.2   This regime  contemplates that trial\r\n\njudges  will perform a gatekeeping function, determining \"whether\r\n\nthe  reasoning  or  methodology  underlying   [proffered  expert]\r\n\ntestimony  is  scientifically  valid  and  .  .  .  whether  that\r\n\nreasoning  or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in\r\n\nissue.\"   Daubert,  509  U.S. at  592-93;  see United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSepulveda, 15  F.3d 1161, 1183  (1st Cir. 1993)  (discussing this\r                   \r\n\nfunction).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The rule stipulates:\r\n\n               If   scientific,  technical,   or  other\r\n          specialized knowledge will  assist the  trier\r\n          of  fact to  understand  the  evidence or  to\r\n          determine   a  fact   in  issue,   a  witness\r\n          qualified as  an expert by  knowledge, skill,\r\n          experience,   training,   or  eduction,   may\r\n          testify thereto in the  form of an opinion or\r\n          otherwise.\r\n\nFed.

A  trial setting  normally will  provide the  best\r\n\noperating environment for the triage which Daubert demands.

Moreover,  given  the  complex  factual  inquiry\r\n\nrequired by Daubert, courts  will be hard-pressed in all  but the\r                             \r\n\nmost clearcut cases to gauge the reliability of expert proof on a\r\n\ntruncated record.   Because the summary judgment process does not\r\n\nconform well to the discipline that  Daubert imposes, the Daubert\r                                                                           \r\n\nregime should be employed only with great care and circumspection\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nat the summary judgment stage.\r\n\n          We  conclude, therefore,  that  at  the junction  where\r\n\nDaubert  intersects  with summary  judgment practice,  Daubert is\r                                                                        \r\n\naccessible, but courts must be cautious   except when defects are\r\n\nobvious  on the  face of  a proffer    not  to exclude  debatable\r\n\nscientific  evidence  without  affording  the  proponent  of  the\r\n\nevidence adequate opportunity to  defend its admissibility.3  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMargaret A.

This asseveration suffers from a very basic\r\n\nshortcoming:   the  defendant never  asked the district  court to\r\n\nexclude this evidence from  consideration, and the district court\r\n\nmade no effort to do  so on its own initiative.   If trial courts\r\n\nshould be slow to  employ Daubert at the summary  judgment stage,\r                                           \r\n\nappellate courts should  be even  more hesitant to  head in  that\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Though such an opportunity is most easily afforded at trial\r\nor in  a trial-like  setting, courts have  displayed considerable\r\ningenuity in devising  ways in  which an adequate  record can  be\r\ndeveloped  so  as  to  permit  Daubert  rulings  to  be  made  in\r                                                \r\nconjunction with motions for summary  judgment.

We  do  not  in  any  way  disparage  such\r\npractices; we merely  warn that  the game sometimes  will not  be\r\nworth the candle.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\ndirection where there has been no development of the issue below.\r\n\nAfter all, the bifurcated  inquiry into reliability and relevance\r\n\nwhich Daubert  requires is best  performed by  trial judges  who,\r                       \r\n\nunlike appellate judges, have a broad array of tools which can be\r\n\nbrought to bear on  the evaluation of expert testimony.4   Hence,\r\n\nwe can  envision few, if  any, cases in which  an appellate court\r\n\nwould venture to superimpose  a Daubert ruling on a  cold, poorly\r                                                 \r\n\ndeveloped  record when  neither the  parties  nor the  nisi prius\r\n\ncourt has had a meaningful opportunity to mull the question.\r\n\n          This case falls squarely into the maw of these  general\r\n\nprinciples.   The  defendant, notwithstanding  the animadversions\r\n\nthat he spouts on  appeal, never asked  in the district court  to\r\n\nstrike or otherwise defenestrate the statements of Drs. Nathanson\r\n\nand/or Hausknecht.   The district court's  rescript neither cites\r\n\nDaubert nor  purposes to exclude the expert evidence submitted on\r                 \r\n\nthe plaintiff's behalf.   And, moreover, the record as  it stands\r\n\nis wholly inadequate to  permit a reasoned Daubert determination.\r                                                            \r\n\nFor these reasons, we decline the defendant's odd invitation that\r\n\nwe start from  scratch and  undertake a Daubert  analysis in  the\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4It  is for this reason,  coupled with the  special coign of\r\nvantage which trial  courts enjoy, that we have afforded district\r\njudges  broad   discretion  in  determining   whether  particular\r\nscientific testimony is or is not admissible at trial.

In this vein,  we note that  the Supreme Court  soon will\r\nresolve a disagreement  among the circuits as  to the appropriate\r\nstandard for reviewing  such decisions.   See  Joiner v.

See  Erie  R.R. v.  Tompkins,  304 U.S.  64,  78\r                                                       \r\n\n(1938); Rolon-Alvarado v.

The Puerto  Rico Civil Code  states that  \"[a]\r\n\nperson who by an act or omission causes damage to another through\r\n\nfault  or negligence  shall be  obliged to  repair the  damage so\r\n\ndone.\"    P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit.  31,    5141  (1991).  Under this\r\n\nproviso, three elements  comprise a prima  facie case of  medical\r\n\nmalpractice; a plaintiff must establish (1) the  duty owed (i.e.,\r\n\nthe minimum standard of professional knowledge and skill required\r\n\nin  the   relevant  circumstances),   (2)  an  act   or  omission\r\n\ntransgressing  that  duty,  and  (3) a  sufficient  causal  nexus\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5In all events, we  note that the two  grounds urged by  the\r\ndefendant   in   support   of   his   exclusionary   request  are\r\ninappropriate.    First, Dr.  Gonz lez  asserts  that his  expert\r\nevidence is more persuasive than the plaintiff's.  His insistence\r\nthat this circumstance warrants exclusion of the competing expert\r\nevidence contradicts  fundamental principles of  summary judgment\r\npractice.   See, e.g., Greenburg v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping\r                                                                           \r\nAuth.,  835  F.2d 932,  936 (1st  Cir. 1987).

See Daubert, 509 U.S. at  595-96; see\r                                                                           \r\nalso  Ambrosini v. Labarraque,  101 F.3d  129, 140-41  (D.C.

Second, he claims that the testimony of the\r\nplaintiff's witnesses, if allowed, would  be confusing.  The fact\r\nthat particular expert evidence might tend  to confuse or mislead\r\na  jury can constitute grounds  for exclusion of  the evidence at\r\ntrial, see  Fed. R. Evid. 403, but it is not directly relevant to\r                    \r\na Daubert analysis.

Thus,  we address\r\n\nthem in the ensemble.\r\n\n          Puerto  Rico  holds  health  care  professionals  to  a\r\n\nnational standard of  care.  See Oliveros v. Abreu, 101 P.R. Dec.\r                                                            \r\n\n209, 226-27, translated in 1 P.R. Sup.  Ct. Off'l Trans. 293, 313\r                                    \r\n\n(1973).  Accordingly,  a health care provider has  \"a duty to use\r\n\nthe same degree of expertise as could reasonably be expected of a\r\n\ntypically competent practitioner in the identical specialty under\r\n\nthe  same  or  similar   circumstances,  regardless  of  regional\r\n\nvariations  in  professional acumen  or level  of care.\"   Rolon-\r                                                                           \r\n\nAlvarado, 1 F.3d at 77-78.  Nevertheless, because Puerto Rico law\r                  \r\n\npresumes  that physicians exercise  reasonable care,  a plaintiff\r\n\nbent  on  establishing a  breach of  a  physician's duty  of care\r\n\nordinarily  must  adduce expert  testimony  to  limn the  minimum\r\n\nacceptable standard and confirm the defendant doctor's failure to\r\n\nmeet it.  See id. at 78.\r                           \r\n\n          Cort s'  proffer  is  sufficient  to  this  end.    Dr.\r\n\nNathanson,  a  specialist  in the  same  field  as  Dr. Gonz lez,\r\n\nclearly delineated the  standard of care  and identified what  he\r\n\nbelieved  to  be Dr.  Gonz lez' departures  from  it.   He stated\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\ncategorically that an \"average gynecologist\" would not rely on  a\r\n\nreported  two-day  menstrual period     unusually  short even  if\r\n\nrelatively common  to that particular  individual   and  that the\r\n\nfailure  to perform corroborating  tests then  available violated\r\n\n\"the  prevailing  medical standard.\"    For  purposes of  summary\r\n\njudgment, affiants and witnesses need not be precise to the point\r\n\nof  pedantry.  Thus, we  treat Dr. Nathanson's  references to the\r\n\n\"average gynecologist\"  and to \"the prevailing  medical standard\"\r\n\nas meaning the  national standard of care.  Cf.  Lama, 16 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n479 n.7.\r\n\n          The district court advanced three principal  grounds in\r\n\nsupport of its  conclusion that these issues    duty and breach  \r\n\ncould  be resolved against the  plaintiff at the summary judgment\r\n\nstage, notwithstanding Dr. Nathanson's  opinion evidence.  All of\r\n\nthese grounds lack persuasive force.\r\n\n          First,   the  court  observed  that  Cort s'  menstrual\r\n\nperiods  had lasted  \"an  average of  two  to three  days,\"  and,\r\n\naccordingly,  \"a two-day  period  was not  abnormal or  unusually\r\n\nshort  for  her.\"   Irizarry,  928  F. Supp.  at  146.   But  Dr.\r                                      \r\n\nNathanson's  testimony supported  the opposite  conclusion; thus,\r\n\nwhether the menses was  abnormal and whether it triggered  a duty\r\n\nto inquire further became questions of fact not properly resolved\r\n\non  summary  judgment.    See,  e.g.,  Greenburg v.  Puerto  Rico\r                                                                           \r\n\nMaritime Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                                 \r\n\n          Second, the court determined that, because Dr. Gonz lez\r\n\nmeasured  the  uterus  periodically  throughout   the  pregnancy,\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nyielding results consistent with  the EDD on which he  relied, he\r\n\nhad no  reason to  suspect an  earlier date  of conception or  to\r\n\norder any additional tests.   See Irizarry, 928 F. Supp. at  146.\r                                                    \r\n\nWhile Dr. Gonz lez so testified, the court erred in treating that\r\n\ntestimony as conclusive.  When Dr. Gonz lez'  and Dr. Nathanson's\r\n\nassertions are juxtaposed, the  net result is a factual  issue as\r\n\nto  whether  the defendant  made  the measurements,  and,  if so,\r\n\nwhether this procedure satisfied the applicable standard of care.\r\n\n          Third, the  court damned  Dr. Nathanson's  opinion with\r\n\nthe faintest of  praise, characterizing it  as nothing more  than\r\n\none doctor's  assertion that he  would have acted  differently in\r\n\nidentical  circumstances  than  did another,  and,  consequently,\r\n\ndenying  it effect in the summary judgment  calculus.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n147.  We accept the  court's premise that a mere disagreement  in\r\n\nmedical  judgment, without more, does not prove duty or breach in\r\n\na  medical malpractice case brought  under Puerto Rico  law.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nRolon-Alvarado,  1 F.3d  at  78.    But  we  reject  the  court's\r                        \r\n\nconclusion; Dr. Nathanson's declarations, read in context, amount\r\n\nto  a  satisfactory statement  of the  standard  of care  and the\r\n\ndefendant's deviation from it which, if credited by a jury, could\r\n\nsupport  a finding  for the  plaintiff on  these elements  of her\r\n\ncause of action.   And in the absence of a  Daubert determination\r                                                             \r\n\nexcluding the Nathanson evidence as scientifically untenable, the\r\n\ntrial court was not at liberty on summary judgment to ignore that\r\n\nevidence merely because it deemed other evidence more credible.\r\n\n          2.   Causation.  Notwithstanding proof of both duty and\r                    2.   Causation.\r                                  \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nbreach,  a  plaintiff  also  must  offer  competent  evidence  of\r\n\ncausation in a  medical malpractice case.   See Rolon-Alvarado, 1\r                                                                        \r\n\nF.3d at 77.  The lower court found the plaintiff's submissions on\r\n\nthis element wanting.   See Irizarry,  928 F. Supp.  at 147.   We\r                                              \r\n\ndemur.\r\n\n          A medical  malpractice plaintiff can   and often does  \r\n\nestablish causation through expert testimony.   See Lama, 16 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat  478.   Cort s  took that  route.   Dr.  Nathanson offered  an\r\n\nopinion to a reasonable degree  of medical certainty that Cort s'\r\n\nEDD was actually  July 9, not August  9, and that  this one-month\r\n\ndiscrepancy had  dire consequences.  If  accepted, this testimony\r\n\nmeant  that Dr.  Gonz lez  did not  perform the  cesarean section\r\n\nuntil the forty-third week of a post-dated pregnancy.\r\n\n          Relatedly,  Dr. Hausknecht diagnosed  Jos  as suffering\r\n\nfrom LGS,  which, in the  absence of any  genetic or other  known\r\n\nexplanation, is generally thought to be caused by perinatal brain\r\n\ndamage.  It is undisputed that the adverse effects of post-datism\r\n\ninclude oxygen  deprivation, and thus  can lead to  brain damage.\r\n\nFinding no evidence  of any hereditary  etiology and observing  a\r\n\npathology consistent with post-datism, Dr. Hausknecht opined that\r\n\nJos 's  cerebral damage  probably was  caused by  the post-datism\r\n\nwhich  Dr.  Nathanson identified.    Both  physicians also  noted\r\n\nlikely indications of complications  at birth, and these findings\r\n\nbuttress  the  plaintiff's   theory  of   causation.6     Drawing\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Dr.  Nathanson  dwelled  on  the unusual  duration  of  the\r\ncesarean section and the  apparent use of a tracheal  catheter to\r\nresuscitate the infant at birth.  Dr. Hausknecht noted that there\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nreasonable inferences  from this evidence, a  rational jury could\r\n\nfind that Dr.  Gonz lez' negligent reliance upon  a reported two-\r\n\nday  menstrual period  and  his eschewal  of further  (available)\r\n\ntests  caused  a  post-dated  pregnancy,  the  effects  of  which\r\n\nincluded perinatal  brain damage  which manifested itself  in the\r\n\nform of LGS.\r\n\n          Of  course,  the   defendant's  experts  debunked   the\r\n\nplaintiff's  proof and offered an alternative causal theory   the\r\n\npresence  of a  CMV infection    which  the district  court found\r\n\n\"more  compelling.\"   Irizarry, 928  F. Supp.  at 147.   But such\r                                        \r\n\ncomparisons are invidious at the summary judgment stage.  Even at\r\n\ntrial, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit need not prove a\r\n\ncausal  connection with  mathematical accuracy nor  eliminate all\r\n\nother  possible  causes  of  damage.    See   Cruz  Rodriguez  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCorporaci n de  Servicios del Centro  M dico, 113 P.R.

Legal rules  of this sort acquire added  significance on\r\n\nsummary  judgment because Rule  56 \"contemplates  an abecedarian,\r\n\nalmost one  dimensional, exercise geared  to determining  whether\r\n\nthe nonmovant's  most favorable evidence and  the most flattering\r\n\ninferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom are sufficient\r\n\nto  create any authentic question  of material fact.\"  Greenburg,\r                                                                          \r\n\n835 F.2d at 936.\r\n\n          In this  case, the defendant's evidence on the issue of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nhad been an  abnormal bilirubin  level at birth  and expressed  a\r\nbelief  that this might  evince a metabolic  problem damaging the\r\nbrain.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ncausation, as compelling as it might have seemed, did not warrant\r\n\nthe  entry of  summary judgment.   The  plaintiff articulated  an\r\n\nalternative  theory of  causation  and backed  it up  with expert\r\n\ntestimony  as to  the causal  nexuses between  LGS  and perinatal\r\n\ndamage,  and between perinatal  damage and  post-datism.   At the\r\n\nsame time, she cast doubt on the defendant's theory of causation,\r\n\nestablishing the low incidence  of intrauterine CMV infection and\r\n\nsuggesting  an alternate  origin of  any  CMV detected  in Jos 's\r\n\nsystem (related  to a  history of  sexual molestation  at school,\r\n\nthereby  opening up  the possibility that  any CMV  infection was\r\n\nsexually  transmitted).    This  evidence sufficed  to  create  a\r\n\ntrialworthy issue vis- -vis the element of causation.  See Coyne,\r                                                                          \r\n\n53 F.3d at 460 (explaining that \"when the facts support plausible\r\n\nbut  conflicting inferences on a  pivotal issue in  the case, the\r\n\njudge may  not choose  between those  inferences  at the  summary\r\n\njudgment stage\"); see also United States  v.

For simplicity's sake we omit\r\n\nany further reference to CIS and treat its insured as  if he were\r\n\nthe sole defendant.\r\n\n          Dr.  Gonz lez,  a  specialist in  obstetrics,  provided\r\n\nprenatal care to Cort s after she  became pregnant with Jos .  On\r\n\nDecember 15, 1979, Cort s  related to Dr. Gonz lez that  her last\r\n\nmenstrual  cycle prior  to  conception began  on  November 2  and\r\n\nlasted  only two days.   The length of  her immediately preceding\r\n\nmenses was three days,  and her periods typically had  lasted two\r\n\nor three days  during the  year prior to  her current  pregnancy.\r\n\nBased  on this  data, Dr.  Gonz lez calculated  Cort s' estimated\r\n\ndelivery date (EDD) to be  August 9, 1980.  He delivered  Jos  by\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ncesarean section on  July 30,  1980.  The  newborn weighed  eight\r\n\npounds,  eight and  three-quarter  ounces (two  pounds more  than\r\n\nCort s' first child) and exhibited no fetal distress.\r\n\n          According to the  defendant's computations, Cort s  was\r\n\nin her  thirty-ninth  week of  pregnancy when  the baby  arrived.\r\n\nThis  calculation forms  the nub  of the  case.   The plaintiff's\r\n\ntheory  is that Dr. Gonz lez misfigured the baby's fetal age and,\r\n\nconsequently, allowed the pregnancy  to continue beyond forty-two\r\n\nweeks,  thus bringing  into play  a risk  factor known  as \"post-\r\n\ndatism\" or \"post-maturity.\"   A  post-dated fetus is  at risk  of\r\n\noxygen deprivation during its extended stay in the mother's womb,\r\n\nand brain damage is a predictable result.  While Jos , at  birth,\r\n\ndisplayed   no  detectable   symptoms  suggesting   a  post-dated\r\n\ndelivery,  the   circumstances  of  the  delivery  revealed  some\r\n\nindications  of potential  perinatal difficulties;  for instance,\r\n\nthe cesarean  section took  twenty-one minutes (roughly  twice as\r\n\nlong as  the norm), and,  on one  view of the  proof, a  tracheal\r\n\ncatheter was used to intubate the newborn.1\r\n\n          Time resolved  these mixed signals.   Jos  showed signs\r\n\nof neurologic abnormality at three  months and was diagnosed with\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Other contemporaneous indicators were  inscrutable.  On the\r\none hand, Jos  had a relatively high Apgar score.  An Apgar score\r\nis comprised of five components:  heart rate, respiratory effort,\r\nmuscle  tone,  reflex irritability,  and  color.   It  usually is\r\ncompiled by the anesthesiologist at one minute after the delivery\r\nand again  at the  five-minute mark.   A  low score  is generally\r\nthought to have predictive value in determining brain damage.  On\r\nthe other  hand, testing at  birth revealed  a somewhat  elevated\r\nserum  bilirubin   level  (which  could   indicate  an  incipient\r\nmetabolic problem).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nimpaired motor  development and hearing loss  at fourteen months.\r\n\nHis condition worsened as the years passed.  As an adolescent, he\r\n\nwas  diagnosed  as   severely  brain   damaged,  epileptic,   and\r\n\nprofoundly deaf.   At that  juncture, Cort s, then  a citizen  of\r\n\nFlorida,  sued Dr.  Gonz lez  in Puerto  Rico's federal  district\r\n\ncourt, see 28 U.S.C.   1332(a) (diversity jurisdiction), alleging\r                    \r\n\nthat the physician's negligence caused her son's infirmities.\r\n\n          Cort s'  case rests  primarily on  the opinions  of two\r\n\nexperts.  An  obstetrician, Dr. Bernard Nathanson,  opined that a\r\n\ncompetent obstetrician, rather than  relying upon a reported two-\r\n\nday menstrual  period to  calculate a  gravid woman's  EDD, would\r\n\nhave launched a more detailed gynecologic investigation.  Had Dr.\r\n\nGonz lez done so,  the witness stated,  he would have  discovered\r\n\nthat Cort s'  actual  EDD was  July 9,  1980, and  he would  have\r\n\nrecognized that  a substantial risk of post-datism arose when her\r\n\npregnancy extended past the EDD (a risk which he presumably could\r\n\nhave negated  by performing  the cesarean section  earlier).   In\r\n\nreaching  these conclusions, Dr.  Nathanson stressed  the unusual\r\n\nbrevity  of the  reported period  (especially as  contrasted with\r\n\nCort s' previous menses) and Dr. Gonz lez' failure to confirm the\r\n\nEDD by  performing various tests  which the  witness stated  were\r\n\navailable in  1979-1980 (e.g., a B-scan  ultrasound examination).\r\n\nIn Dr. Nathanson's opinion, the pregnancy was post-dated, and the\r\n\ndefendant's  failure to  realize  it and  take corrective  action\r\n\nviolated the prevailing standard of care.\r\n\n          Dr. Nathanson  also  disputed Dr.  Gonz lez'  assertion\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat  he in fact performed a manual pelvic examination at Cort s'\r\n\ninitial   appointment  and   subsequently  measured   her  uterus\r\n\nthroughout  her pregnancy to corroborate the  EDD.  Dr. Nathanson\r\n\nsaw no evidence that  these steps had been taken.   Moreover, Dr.\r\n\nGonz lez'  office  record did  not  mention  either the  periodic\r\n\nuterine measurements  or their results.  Although some of Cort s'\r\n\nprenatal charts apparently had  been lost,  Dr.  Nathanson stated\r\n\nthat  these data  \"are  so  vital that  they  should  be in  [Dr.\r\n\nGonz lez'] record in any case had he done them.\"\r\n\n          The plaintiff's second expert, Dr.  Allan Hausknecht, a\r\n\nneurologist,  diagnosed Jos  as  suffering from  Lennox Gasteault\r\n\nSyndrome (LGS).  This neurological condition is caused roughly\r\n\nfifty percent of  the time by  perinatal brain damage  (resulting\r\n\nfrom  a lack of  sufficient oxygen to  the fetal  brain).  Doctor\r\n\nHausknecht  stated  that,  in  his  experience,  this  percentage\r\n\nincreases sharply when, as  in this instance, no evidence  of any\r\n\nother known cause exists.  Noting that the gradual development of\r\n\nJos 's condition  was characteristic of a  post-mature fetus, Dr.\r\n\nHausknecht rendered an opinion  that Jos 's brain damage resulted\r\n\nfrom the  post-datism which Dr.  Nathanson had identified.   This\r\n\nopinion was bolstered in some degree by Dr. Nathanson's statement\r\n\nthat, while some  post-dated infants will show immediate signs of\r\n\nplacental senescence, such as  meconium-stained amniotic fluid or\r\n\npeeling of the skin  (Jos  had neither), many others  will appear\r\n\nasymptomatic at birth yet manifest the  effects of post-datism at\r\n\na later time.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          To  be   sure,  the  plaintiff's  evidence   was  hotly\r\n\ncontested.  The defendant   claimed that he  had figured the  EDD\r\n\naccurately  and that many of the tests suggested by Dr. Nathanson\r\n\nwere  unnecessary, or impracticable, or  both.  He also presented\r\n\nexperts  who   offered  an  alternative   theory  of   causation:\r\n\nintrauterine  cytomegalovirus (CMV)  infection, a  rare condition\r\n\nwhich  occurs in  0.2 to  2.2 percent  of all  live births.   The\r\n\nresults  of blood tests performed on Jos  at age fifteen revealed\r\n\nprevious or  latent CMV infection,  but did not  indicate whether\r\n\nthe   infection  had  been  contracted  in  utero.    This  is  a\r\n\nsignificant omission  because, while infants who  suffer from CMV\r\n\nmay  be  asymptomatic  at  birth and  thereafter  develop  mental\r\n\nretardation  or deafness, CMV can  be transmitted in various ways\r\n\nand affects most individuals during their lifetimes.\r\n\nII.

The district court's  rescript neither cites\r\n\nDaubert nor  purposes to exclude the expert evidence submitted on\r                 \r\n\nthe plaintiff's behalf.   And, moreover, the record as  it stands\r\n\nis wholly inadequate to  permit a reasoned Daubert determination.\r                                                            \r\n\nFor these reasons, we decline the defendant's odd invitation that\r\n\nwe start from  scratch and  undertake a Daubert  analysis in  the\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4It  is for this reason,  coupled with the  special coign of\r\nvantage which trial  courts enjoy, that we have afforded district\r\njudges  broad   discretion  in  determining   whether  particular\r\nscientific testimony is or is not admissible at trial.

Laws Ann.  tit.  31,    5141  (1991).  Under this\r\n\nproviso, three elements  comprise a prima  facie case of  medical\r\n\nmalpractice; a plaintiff must establish (1) the  duty owed (i.e.,\r\n\nthe minimum standard of professional knowledge and skill required\r\n\nin  the   relevant  circumstances),   (2)  an  act   or  omission\r\n\ntransgressing  that  duty,  and  (3) a  sufficient  causal  nexus\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5In all events, we  note that the two  grounds urged by  the\r\ndefendant   in   support   of   his   exclusionary   request  are\r\ninappropriate.

Thus,  we address\r\n\nthem in the ensemble.\r\n\n          Puerto  Rico  holds  health  care  professionals  to  a\r\n\nnational standard of  care.  See Oliveros v.

Accordingly,  a health care provider has  \"a duty to use\r\n\nthe same degree of expertise as could reasonably be expected of a\r\n\ntypically competent practitioner in the identical specialty under\r\n\nthe  same  or  similar   circumstances,  regardless  of  regional\r\n\nvariations  in  professional acumen  or level  of care.\"   Rolon-\r                                                                           \r\n\nAlvarado, 1 F.3d at 77-78.  Nevertheless, because Puerto Rico law\r                  \r\n\npresumes  that physicians exercise  reasonable care,  a plaintiff\r\n\nbent  on  establishing a  breach of  a  physician's duty  of care\r\n\nordinarily  must  adduce expert  testimony  to  limn the  minimum\r\n\nacceptable standard and confirm the defendant doctor's failure to\r\n\nmeet it.  See id. at 78.\r                           \r\n\n          Cort s'  proffer  is  sufficient  to  this  end.    Dr.\r\n\nNathanson,  a  specialist  in the  same  field  as  Dr. Gonz lez,\r\n\nclearly delineated the  standard of care  and identified what  he\r\n\nbelieved  to  be Dr.  Gonz lez' departures  from  it.   He stated\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\ncategorically that an \"average gynecologist\" would not rely on  a\r\n\nreported  two-day  menstrual period     unusually  short even  if\r\n\nrelatively common  to that particular  individual   and  that the\r\n\nfailure  to perform corroborating  tests then  available violated\r\n\n\"the  prevailing  medical standard.\"    For  purposes of  summary\r\n\njudgment, affiants and witnesses need not be precise to the point\r\n\nof  pedantry.  Thus, we  treat Dr. Nathanson's  references to the\r\n\n\"average gynecologist\"  and to \"the prevailing  medical standard\"\r\n\nas meaning the  national standard of care.  Cf.  Lama, 16 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n479 n.7.\r\n\n          The district court advanced three principal  grounds in\r\n\nsupport of its  conclusion that these issues    duty and breach  \r\n\ncould  be resolved against the  plaintiff at the summary judgment\r\n\nstage, notwithstanding Dr. Nathanson's  opinion evidence.  All of\r\n\nthese grounds lack persuasive force.\r\n\n          First,   the  court  observed  that  Cort s'  menstrual\r\n\nperiods  had lasted  \"an  average of  two  to three  days,\"  and,\r\n\naccordingly,  \"a two-day  period  was not  abnormal or  unusually\r\n\nshort  for  her.\"   Irizarry,  928  F. Supp.  at  146.   But  Dr.\r                                      \r\n\nNathanson's  testimony supported  the opposite  conclusion; thus,\r\n\nwhether the menses was  abnormal and whether it triggered  a duty\r\n\nto inquire further became questions of fact not properly resolved\r\n\non  summary  judgment.    See,  e.g.,  Greenburg v.

See Irizarry, 928 F. Supp. at  146.\r                                                    \r\n\nWhile Dr. Gonz lez so testified, the court erred in treating that\r\n\ntestimony as conclusive.  When Dr. Gonz lez'  and Dr. Nathanson's\r\n\nassertions are juxtaposed, the  net result is a factual  issue as\r\n\nto  whether  the defendant  made  the measurements,  and,  if so,\r\n\nwhether this procedure satisfied the applicable standard of care.\r\n\n          Third, the  court damned  Dr. Nathanson's  opinion with\r\n\nthe faintest of  praise, characterizing it  as nothing more  than\r\n\none doctor's  assertion that he  would have acted  differently in\r\n\nidentical  circumstances  than  did another,  and,  consequently,\r\n\ndenying  it effect in the summary judgment  calculus.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n147.  We accept the  court's premise that a mere disagreement  in\r\n\nmedical  judgment, without more, does not prove duty or breach in\r\n\na  medical malpractice case brought  under Puerto Rico  law.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nRolon-Alvarado,  1 F.3d  at  78.    But  we  reject  the  court's\r                        \r\n\nconclusion; Dr. Nathanson's declarations, read in context, amount\r\n\nto  a  satisfactory statement  of the  standard  of care  and the\r\n\ndefendant's deviation from it which, if credited by a jury, could\r\n\nsupport  a finding  for the  plaintiff on  these elements  of her\r\n\ncause of action.   And in the absence of a  Daubert determination\r                                                             \r\n\nexcluding the Nathanson evidence as scientifically untenable, the\r\n\ntrial court was not at liberty on summary judgment to ignore that\r\n\nevidence merely because it deemed other evidence more credible.\r\n\n          2.   Causation.  Notwithstanding proof of both duty and\r                    2.   Causation.\r                                  \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nbreach,  a  plaintiff  also  must  offer  competent  evidence  of\r\n\ncausation in a  medical malpractice case.   See Rolon-Alvarado, 1\r                                                                        \r\n\nF.3d at 77.  The lower court found the plaintiff's submissions on\r\n\nthis element wanting.   See Irizarry,  928 F. Supp.  at 147.   We\r                                              \r\n\ndemur.\r\n\n          A medical  malpractice plaintiff can   and often does  \r\n\nestablish causation through expert testimony.   See Lama, 16 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat  478.   Cort s  took that  route.   Dr.  Nathanson offered  an\r\n\nopinion to a reasonable degree  of medical certainty that Cort s'\r\n\nEDD was actually  July 9, not August  9, and that  this one-month\r\n\ndiscrepancy had  dire consequences.  If  accepted, this testimony\r\n\nmeant  that Dr.  Gonz lez  did not  perform the  cesarean section\r\n\nuntil the forty-third week of a post-dated pregnancy.\r\n\n          Relatedly,  Dr. Hausknecht diagnosed  Jos  as suffering\r\n\nfrom LGS,  which, in the  absence of any  genetic or other  known\r\n\nexplanation, is generally thought to be caused by perinatal brain\r\n\ndamage.  It is undisputed that the adverse effects of post-datism\r\n\ninclude oxygen  deprivation, and thus  can lead to  brain damage.\r\n\nFinding no evidence  of any hereditary  etiology and observing  a\r\n\npathology consistent with post-datism, Dr. Hausknecht opined that\r\n\nJos 's  cerebral damage  probably was  caused by  the post-datism\r\n\nwhich  Dr.  Nathanson identified.    Both  physicians also  noted\r\n\nlikely indications of complications  at birth, and these findings\r\n\nbuttress  the  plaintiff's   theory  of   causation.6     Drawing\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Dr.  Nathanson  dwelled  on  the unusual  duration  of  the\r\ncesarean section and the  apparent use of a tracheal  catheter to\r\nresuscitate the infant at birth.  Dr. Hausknecht noted that there\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nreasonable inferences  from this evidence, a  rational jury could\r\n\nfind that Dr.  Gonz lez' negligent reliance upon  a reported two-\r\n\nday  menstrual period  and  his eschewal  of further  (available)\r\n\ntests  caused  a  post-dated  pregnancy,  the  effects  of  which\r\n\nincluded perinatal  brain damage  which manifested itself  in the\r\n\nform of LGS.\r\n\n          Of  course,  the   defendant's  experts  debunked   the\r\n\nplaintiff's  proof and offered an alternative causal theory   the\r\n\npresence  of a  CMV infection    which  the district  court found\r\n\n\"more  compelling.\"   Irizarry, 928  F. Supp.  at 147.   But such\r                                        \r\n\ncomparisons are invidious at the summary judgment stage.  Even at\r\n\ntrial, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit need not prove a\r\n\ncausal  connection with  mathematical accuracy nor  eliminate all\r\n\nother  possible  causes  of  damage.    See   Cruz  Rodriguez  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCorporaci n de  Servicios del Centro  M dico, 113 P.R.

Legal rules  of this sort acquire added  significance on\r\n\nsummary  judgment because Rule  56 \"contemplates  an abecedarian,\r\n\nalmost one  dimensional, exercise geared  to determining  whether\r\n\nthe nonmovant's  most favorable evidence and  the most flattering\r\n\ninferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom are sufficient\r\n\nto  create any authentic question  of material fact.\"  Greenburg,\r                                                                          \r\n\n835 F.2d at 936.\r\n\n          In this  case, the defendant's evidence on the issue of\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nhad been an  abnormal bilirubin  level at birth  and expressed  a\r\nbelief  that this might  evince a metabolic  problem damaging the\r\nbrain.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ncausation, as compelling as it might have seemed, did not warrant\r\n\nthe  entry of  summary judgment.   The  plaintiff articulated  an\r\n\nalternative  theory of  causation  and backed  it up  with expert\r\n\ntestimony  as to  the causal  nexuses between  LGS  and perinatal\r\n\ndamage,  and between perinatal  damage and  post-datism.   At the\r\n\nsame time, she cast doubt on the defendant's theory of causation,\r\n\nestablishing the low incidence  of intrauterine CMV infection and\r\n\nsuggesting  an alternate  origin of  any  CMV detected  in Jos 's\r\n\nsystem (related  to a  history of  sexual molestation  at school,\r\n\nthereby  opening up  the possibility that  any CMV  infection was\r\n\nsexually  transmitted).    This  evidence sufficed  to  create  a\r\n\ntrialworthy issue vis- -vis the element of causation.  See Coyne,\r                                                                          \r\n\n53 F.3d at 460 (explaining that \"when the facts support plausible\r\n\nbut  conflicting inferences on a  pivotal issue in  the case, the\r\n\njudge may  not choose  between those  inferences  at the  summary\r\n\njudgment stage\"); see also United States  v.

Scrutinizing the  entire record\r\n\nin the  light most  congenial to  the plaintiff, rational  jurors\r\n\ncould find all the  elements of medical malpractice.   Though the\r\n\nplaintiff's  evidence may  appear  thin to  some, it  establishes\r\n\nfactual disagreements  as to  which reasonable minds  may differ.\r\n\nNo  more is exigible.  See Greenburg, 835 F.2d at 936 (explaining\r                                              \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nthat the  ground rules associated with  summary judgment practice\r\n\n\"admit of no room for credibility determinations, no room for the\r\n\nmeasured  weighing  of conflicting  evidence  such  as the  trial\r\n\nprocess entails, no  room for  the judge to  superimpose his  own\r\n\nideas  of probability  and likelihood  (no matter  how reasonable\r\n\nthose  ideas  may be)  upon the  carapace  of the  cold record\").\r\n\nRight or  wrong, the plaintiff is entitled to present her case to\r\n\na jury.\r\n\n          The order granting summary  judgment is vacated and the\r                    The order granting summary  judgment is vacated and the\r                                                                           \r\n\ncase is remanded for trial.
