As  its determination\r                                           \r\n\nthat  Rose intended  to  remain  a New  York  domiciliary is  not\r\n\nclearly  erroneous, Lundquist v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n946  F.2d 8, 11  (1st Cir.  1991), we  affirm the  district court\r\n\njudgment. \r\n\n          The district  court considered the  appropriate factors\r\n\nin determining  Rose's domiciliary intent.   See Bank  One, Tex.,\r                                                                           \r\n\nN.A.  v.  Montle,  964  F.2d  48, 50  (1st  Cir.  1992)  (listing\r                          \r\n\nfactors),  opinion after remand,  974 F.2d  220 (1st  Cir. 1992).\r                                         \r\n\nAlthough Rose owned a home, practiced law, and lived on Nantucket\r\n\nfor a number of years, he owned a home in New York (where he kept\r\n\nhis most valuable  possessions), retained his bar  membership and\r\n\ndriver's license in New York, and maintained the bulk of his bank\r\n\nand investment accounts, filed tax returns, and continued to vote\r\n\nin New  York by  absentee ballot, see  id. (voter  registration a\r                                                    \r\n\n\"weighty\" factor).   The district court thus  possessed diversity\r\n\njurisdiction.   See Anderson v.  City of Bessemer City,  470 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n564, 574  (1985) (\"Where there  are two permissible views  of the\r\n\nevidence,  the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly\r\n\nerroneous.\").  \r\n\n          In 1984,  Francis and  her son  inherited a  commercial\r\n\nproperty on Main  Street, Nantucket.  She met Rose in August 1985\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nand an intimate relationship developed.  Rose obtained a Benetton\r\n\nclothing  franchise in  late  1985, and  asked Francis  if Rose's\r\n\ncompany, Nanben  Corporation (\"Nanben\"),  could operate  a retail\r\n\nstore at Francis' Main Street location.  Individually represented\r\n\nby retained  counsel, the parties  negotiated and entered  into a\r\n\nlease on March  6, 1986.  During this  time, Francis began living\r\n\nwith Rose.  She worked with him at the store as well.\r\n\n          In November 1989, Nanben failed to pay the monthly rent\r\n\ndue Francis.  Rose explained that he owed Benetton for spring and\r\n\nsummer inventory.  In April  1990, with Nanben four months behind\r\n\nin its rent, Francis told Rose:  \"You owe me a lot of money here,\r\n\nand  I  want to  do something.    Should I  do something?\"   Rose\r\n\nresponded, \"No,  you don't have to do anything.   Trust me.  Just\r\n\nhave patience.   You will get paid.\"   Despite similar assurances\r\n\nfrom  Rose,  Nanben  continued to  lag  behind  in rent  payments\r\n\nthrough April 1991.  \r\n\n          In  late June  1991, Francis  and  Rose stopped  living\r\n\ntogether but remained  friends.  Rose  had handled various  legal\r\n\nmatters  for Francis during  their intimate relationship,  but in\r\n\nJune 1992 Francis again consulted the attorney who had negotiated\r\n\nthe  store  lease, and  decided  to initiate  a  summary eviction\r\n\naction against  Nanben.   Nanben  promptly sought  refuge in  the\r\n\nbankruptcy  court,  and  although  Francis  eventually   regained\r\n\npossession  of the  store, she  was unable  to collect  a $92,898\r\n\njudgment  for  unpaid  rent and  costs,  which  precipitated this\r\n\ndiversity  action charging Rose  with malpractice for  failing to\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nadvise Francis to seek  independent representation regarding  the\r\n\nunpaid store rent.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          The  action  was  tried   before  the  district   court\r\n\n(Lindsay, J.), without a jury.   Following the case in chief, the\r\n\ndistrict  court ruled  that  Francis  had  never  established  an\r\n\nattorney-client  relationship  with  Rose.    The  court  entered\r\n\njudgment for Rose under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c) (\"If during a trial\r\n\nwithout a jury a party  has been fully heard on an issue  and the\r\n\ncourt finds against the  party on that issue, the court may enter\r\n\njudgment as a  matter of law against that party with respect to a\r\n\nclaim . . . that cannot under the controlling law be maintained .\r\n\n. . without  a favorable finding on that issue. . . .\").  Francis\r\n\nappealed. \r\n\n          All  agree that Massachusetts  law governs  the Francis\r\n\nmalpractice claim.   See  One Nat'l Bank  v. Antonellis,  80 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n606, 608  (1st Cir. 1996) (court ordinarily applies governing law\r\n\nagreed upon by parties).  As a  general rule, an  attorney cannot\r\n\nbe found liable  for malpractice absent a  breach of duty to  the\r\n\nclient.  DeVaux v. American Home Assur. Co., 444 N.E.2d 355,  357\r                                                     \r\n\n(Mass. 1983).   Nor is  it sufficient to  show that an  attorney-\r\n\nclient  relationship existed as  to an unrelated  matter; rather,\r\n\nthe  plaintiff  must  prove that  the  relationship  existed with\r\n\nrespect to  the act  or omission  which forms  the basis  for the\r\n\nmalpractice claim.    Symmons v.  O'Keeffe, 644  N.E.2d 631,  639\r                                                    \r\n\n(Mass. 1995); Robertson v. Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, 536 N.E.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n344, 348-49  (Mass.)

In appropriate cases, the third element may\r\n\nbe  established  by  proving  that the  attorney  knew  that  the\r\n\nplaintiff  reasonably relied  on the  attorney  to provide  legal\r\n\nservices,  but did nothing  to prevent the  detrimental reliance.\r\n\nSheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1264-68 (1st Cir. 1991).1\r                            \r\n\n          We find no  clear error.  Francis never  told Rose that\r\n\nshe wanted legal  advice with respect to the store  rent, nor did\r\n\nRose bill her  for such legal advice.  See Symmons, 644 N.E.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n639.  At trial, Francis conceded that Rose was merely a tenant at\r\n\nthe time she spoke with him concerning the unpaid store rent.  On\r\n\nthe  other hand,  she testified  that  she thought  Rose was  her\r                                                            \r\n\nattorney when she asked him during the same conversation  whether\r\n\nshe  should  \"do  something\"  about  the store  rent.    But  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nSheinkopf, 927  F.2d at  1265 (requiring  more than  \"subjective,\r                   \r\n\nunspoken  belief\" that  person  is  acting  in  legal  capacity).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Whether an attorney-client relationship exists presents  an\r\nissue  of fact  under Massachusetts  law.   Page v.  Frazier, 445\r                                                                      \r\nN.E.2d 148, 152  (Mass. 1983).   Thus,  Francis must  demonstrate\r\nclear  error in  the district  court  finding that  there was  no\r\nattorney-client  relationship.  See  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 52 advisory\r                                             \r\ncommittee's  note to  1991  Amendment  (mandating  \"clear  error\"\r\nreview of  factual findings);   Atlantic Track  &amp; Turnout  Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\nPerini Corp., 989 F.2d 541, 543 (1st Cir. 1993) (same).  \r                      \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nMoreover, Francis testified:  \"I believed that [Rose]  would give\r\n\nme good advice since we were an item.\"  \r\n\n          On this  record, we  cannot disturb  the well-supported\r\n\ndistrict  court finding  that Rose  had  no reason  to know  that\r\n\nFrancis  was seeking  legal advice  from  him, as  opposed to  an\r\n\nappraisal of his company's  financial ability, as her  tenant, to\r\n\npay the store rent, and that the trust Francis placed in Rose was\r\n\ndue, in  large part, to  their intimate relationship.   Thus, the\r\n\ndistrict  court correctly concluded that the failure to establish\r\n\nan  attorney-client relationship with  respect to the  store rent\r\n\nforeclosed Francis' malpractice  claim.  See Symmons,  644 N.E.2d\r                                                              \r\n\nat 639; DeVaux, 444 N.E.2d at 357.\r                        \r\n\n          Affirmed.

Rose opposed the motion for remand and requested an evidentiary hearing.   On the exclusive basis of the parties' written submissions, which included conflicting documentary evidence, the district court (Harrington, J.) denied the motion for remand in a margin order, without elaboration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurisdictional dispute below centered on whether Rose intended to remain a citizen of New York even though he had relocated to Nantucket, established a law practice, and resided continually on the island from 1987 until his death in 1995.   Following the denial of the motion for remand, the action proceeded to trial before United States District Judge Reginald C. Lindsay, sitting without a jury.   After Francis rested her case in chief, the trial judge found that she had not established an attorney-client relationship with Rose at the time he gave her the advice alleged as the basis for the malpractice claim.

III, &#167;&#167; 1, 2;  see Casas Office Mach. v. Mita Copystar Am., 42 F.3d 668, 674 (1st Cir.1994).   As diversity of citizenship is the sole basis for invoking subject matter jurisdiction in the present case, without a preponderance of evidence establishing diversity the district court would lack judicial power to adjudicate this controversy under section 1332(a)(1).  Bank One, Tex., N.A. v. Montle, 964 F.2d 48, 50 (1st Cir.1992), opinion after remand, 974 F.2d 220 (1st Cir.1992);  Mansfield, Coldwater &amp; Lake Mich.  Ry. v. Swan, 111 U.S. 379, 381-82, 4 S.Ct. 510, 511-12, 28 L.Ed. 462 (1884).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The uncontested evidence revealed that Rose was born in the State of New York, where he was domiciled for most of his life, and that he continued to maintain significant ties with New York throughout the time he resided in Massachusetts from 1987 until his death in 1995.   As it is undisputed that Francis is a Massachusetts citizen, her motion for remand necessitated a district court determination regarding Rose's intention to change his domicile from New York to Massachusetts, see Montle, 964 F.2d at 50 (describing shifting burdens and the elements of proof required to establish a change of domicile), as a prerequisite to its subject matter jurisdiction.   Although the documentation and argumentation submitted in writing by the parties below conflicted sharply, the district court denied the motion by margin order, without oral argument or an evidentiary hearing, and made neither findings of fact nor subsidiary conclusions of law from which a reviewing court might discern either the documentary evidence or the argumentation relied upon in resolving the central question:  whether Rose intended to abandon his New York domicile in favor of a Massachusetts domicile notwithstanding the countervailing evidence.   See id. at 53-54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument on appeal, Rose's counsel acknowledged that factual findings regarding Rose's domiciliary intentions would be helpful, but suggested that we might alter the standard of review to compensate for their absence.   Ordinarily, of course, the factual findings underlying a district court ruling on citizenship under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(1) are reviewed for clear error.  Lundquist v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 946 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1991).   Thus, the suggestion that we instead engage in de novo review runs directly counter to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a):  \"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous....\"  (emphasis added), as well as Supreme Court precedent, Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 145, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 2450, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986) (\"As this Court frequently has emphasized, appellate courts are not to decide factual questions de novo, reversing any findings they would have made differently.\"), rev'g United States v.

Consequently, the suggestion that we conduct plenary review would dispense entirely with trial court findings and conclusions.   The Supreme Court, on the other hand, has cautioned against independent factfinding by the courts of appeals in the context of Rule 52.  Icicle Seafoods, Inc. v. Worthington, 475 U.S. 709, 714, 106 S.Ct. 1527, 1530, 89 L.Ed.2d 739 (1986):  \"If the Court of Appeals believed that the District Court had failed to make findings of fact essential to a proper resolution of the legal question, it should have remanded to the District Court to make those findings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the first time we have addressed the importance of adequate trial court findings and subsidiary conclusions in the diversity context.   In Media Duplication Serv. v. HDG Software, 928 F.2d 1228, 1231 (1st Cir.1991), for example, the district court denied, by endorsement, a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   On appeal, the party asserting federal jurisdiction was deprived of its judgment on the merits because \"the district court's bare, unexplained denial of the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction [did] not provide a basis to evaluate the factual grounds for its decision.\"  Id. at 1237;  see also Halleran v. Hoffman, 966 F.2d 45, 47 (1st Cir.1992) (citing with approval Shahmoon Indus. v. Imperato, 338 F.2d 449, 452 (3d Cir.1964) (remanding for \"appropriate findings and conclusions\" as to diverse citizenship in light of conflicting evidence)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More particularly, in Hawes v. Club Ecuestre El Comandante, 598 F.2d 698, 702 (1st Cir.1979), we suggested that a diversity ruling may implicate Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (\"In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon....\").  Although Rule 52(a) goes on to state that such findings and conclusions are not necessary when the district court acts on a Rule 12 or a Rule 56 motion, this provision excepts final dispositions made on partial findings under Rule 52(c), see Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) &amp; Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) advisory committee's note to 1991 amendment, and we now hold that the final sentence of Rule 52(a) does not dispense with the requirement that the trial court make not only special findings as to the relevant disputed facts, but also subsidiary conclusions of law, as necessary to enable effective appellate review of rulings on motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   See Horizons Titanium Corp. v. Norton Co., 290 F.2d 421, 424 n. 3 (1st Cir.1961) (noting that the last sentence of Rule 52(a) was \"either poorly worded\" or \"too broad\");  see also 5A James W. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice p 52.08 at 52-156-58 (2d ed. 1995) (comparing Rule 52(c) and Rule 12 motions encompassing disputed issues of fact).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have observed on several occasions, \"some explication of the trial court's reasoning will often prove valuable to both the litigants and to the reviewing court.\"  Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 424 n. 4 (1st Cir.1995) (failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted);  see also Roque-Rodriguez v. Lema Moya, 926 F.2d 103, 105 n. 3 (1st Cir.1991) (summary judgment).   When a contested issue as sensitive and dispositive as the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal forum in a removed action is at stake, it will be the unusual case in which findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary to enable effective appellate review.   See Getty Oil, Div. of Texaco v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 841 F.2d 1254, 1260 (5th Cir.1988).   This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First of all, even now the parties do not agree as to all relevant historical facts and there can be no question that the district court is better situated and equipped to engage in the required factfinding.   See Montle, 964 F.2d at 51-55 (discussing broad trial court discretion to determine appropriate procedures for resolving jurisdictional disputes).   Second, were we to displace the district court from its factfinding role, but see Taylor, 477 U.S. at 145, 106 S.Ct. at 2450, there would be no appellate review as of right.   Cf. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(1) (1994);  Sup.Ct.R. 10.1 (listing general considerations for granting writ of certiorari).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final argument advanced by Rose is that the district court judgment should be affirmed in the interests of judicial economy and minimizing litigation costs.   Not only do these considerations, important as they are, not override those discussed above, but federal courts are not at liberty to overlook limitations on their subject matter jurisdiction.  Mansfield, 111 U.S. at 382, 4 S.Ct. at 511 (\"[T]he rule, springing from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States, is inflexible and without exception which requires this court, of its own motion, to deny its own jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of its appellate power, that of all other courts of the United States, in all cases where such jurisdiction does not affirmatively appear in the record on which, in the exercise of that power, it is called to act.\");   see also, e.g., In re Unanue Casal, 998 F.2d 28, 30-31 (1st Cir.1993) (inquiring sua sponte into appellate jurisdiction);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (court shall dismiss action whenever it appears that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.   The district court may permit the parties to submit additional evidence, as appropriate, and determine whether or not to entertain argument or conduct an evidentiary hearing.   See Montle, 964 F.2d at 54-55.   The proceedings on remand should be completed, together with the required findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the diversity of the parties, within 90 days.  Id. at 55.   The district court's findings and conclusions may be brief, see Lundquist, 946 F.2d at 10, provided they are sufficiently precise and detailed to enable effective appellate review.   See Keller v. United States, 38 F.3d 16, 24-25 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We retain appellate jurisdiction awaiting the decision on remand.  Montle, 964 F.2d at 55.   Should the district court determine that diversity jurisdiction is lacking, it should remand the case to the superior court and that will end its odyssey in federal court.  Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 494, 497, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995) (discussing 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(d));  Halleran, 966 F.2d at 48.   Otherwise, it may enter judgment for Rose on the merits, and we will revisit Francis' assignments of error.   The parties shall bear their own costs in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although defendants-appellees David Goodman and Karen Dunnett, executors of the Rose estate, were substituted as defendants, we refer throughout to Rose.   In addition, since plaintiff-appellant Robert Francis, Ingrid's son, is a Massachusetts citizen as well, our discussion of their jurisdictional claim mentions only Ingrid Francis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We have given consideration to bypassing the jurisdictional question entirely, in the manner employed by the Supreme Court in Norton v.

Co. v. INX Reinsurance Corp., 72 F.3d 218, 223-24 n. 9 (1st Cir.1995).   We decline to do so, since Francis is the party challenging federal-court subject matter jurisdiction, and we are not prepared to venture whether the district court clearly erred in rejecting the malpractice claim on the merits.

Following the denial of the motion for remand, the action proceeded to trial before United States District Judge Reginald C. Lindsay, sitting without a jury.   After Francis rested her case in chief, the trial judge found that she had not established an attorney-client relationship with Rose at the time he gave her the advice alleged as the basis for the malpractice claim.

Although Rule 52(a) goes on to state that such findings and conclusions are not necessary when the district court acts on a Rule 12 or a Rule 56 motion, this provision excepts final dispositions made on partial findings under Rule 52(c), see Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) &amp; Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) advisory committee's note to 1991 amendment, and we now hold that the final sentence of Rule 52(a) does not dispense with the requirement that the trial court make not only special findings as to the relevant disputed facts, but also subsidiary conclusions of law, as necessary to enable effective appellate review of rulings on motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

When a contested issue as sensitive and dispositive as the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal forum in a removed action is at stake, it will be the unusual case in which findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary to enable effective appellate review.   See Getty Oil, Div. of Texaco v. Insurance Co. of N.

See Montle, 964 F.2d at 51-55 (discussing broad trial court discretion to determine appropriate procedures for resolving jurisdictional disputes).   Second, were we to displace the district court from its factfinding role, but see Taylor, 477 U.S. at 145, 106 S.Ct. at 2450, there would be no appellate review as of right.   Cf. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(1) (1994);  Sup.Ct.R. 10.1 (listing general considerations for granting writ of certiorari).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final argument advanced by Rose is that the district court judgment should be affirmed in the interests of judicial economy and minimizing litigation costs.   Not only do these considerations, important as they are, not override those discussed above, but federal courts are not at liberty to overlook limitations on their subject matter jurisdiction.  Mansfield, 111 U.S. at 382, 4 S.Ct. at 511 (\"[T]he rule, springing from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States, is inflexible and without exception which requires this court, of its own motion, to deny its own jurisdiction, and, in the exercise of its appellate power, that of all other courts of the United States, in all cases where such jurisdiction does not affirmatively appear in the record on which, in the exercise of that power, it is called to act.\");   see also, e.g., In re Unanue Casal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610897\"><a href=\"/opinion/610897/in-re-ulpiano-unanue-casal-debtor-gerardo-a-quiros-lopez-v-ulpiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 30-31 (1st Cir.1993) (inquiring sua sponte into appellate jurisdiction);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (court shall dismiss action whenever it appears that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.   The district court may permit the parties to submit additional evidence, as appropriate, and determine whether or not to entertain argument or conduct an evidentiary hearing.   See Montle, 964 F.2d at 54-55.   The proceedings on remand should be completed, together with the required findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the diversity of the parties, within 90 days.  Id. at 55.   The district court's findings and conclusions may be brief, see Lundquist, 946 F.2d at 10, provided they are sufficiently precise and detailed to enable effective appellate review.   See Keller v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195675\"><a href=\"/opinion/195675/keller-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We retain appellate jurisdiction awaiting the decision on remand.  Montle, 964 F.2d at 55.   Should the district court determine that diversity jurisdiction is lacking, it should remand the case to the superior court and that will end its odyssey in federal court.
