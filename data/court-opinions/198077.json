Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Shekela Farmer on brief pro se.\r\n Wilfred J. Benoit, Jr. and Goodwin, Procter &amp; Hoar LLP on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 31, 1998\r\n\n                                                  Per Curiam.  We have carefully considered the record\r\nand briefs on appeal and affirm the judgment below.    A final\r\njudgment on the merits precludes the parties from relitigating\r\nclaims that were or could have been raised in the original\r\naction.  Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980).  A single\r\ntransaction may generate a wealth of claims under a variety of\r\nlegal theories, but a legal theory which was neglected in the\r\noriginal action will not be entertained in a subsequent action. \r\nGonzalez v. Banco Central Corporation, 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1stCir. 1994); Kale v. Combined Insurance Company, 924 F.2d 1161,\r\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 816 (1991).   \r\n   The judgment in the original action was rendered on\r\nthe merits, even if, as the appellant states, her attorney\r\nwrongly neglected to oppose summary judgment.  Down v. Society\r\nof St. Columbans, 861 F.2d 761, 764 (1st Cir. 1988).  Even if\r\nsuch neglect occurred, the appellee cannot be made accountable\r\nby requiring it to re-litigate the action.  The doctrine of res\r\njudicata serves the important goals of fairness and efficiency\r\nby promoting finality and preventing vexatious or repetitive\r\nlitigation.  Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597 (1948). \r\n   Affirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
