George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Aldrich, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n   Thomas M. Bond with whom David B. Kaplan and The Kaplan/Bond\r\nGroup were on brief for David Daniels.\r\n   Joseph A. Regan with whom Paige L. Tobin and Regan &amp; Kiely LLPwere on brief for Diamond Girl Fisheries.\r\n\nJuly 1, 1998\r\n\n ALDRICH, Senior Circuit Judge.  According to the\r\ncomplaint filed March 18, 1996, plaintiff David Daniels, when\r\na member of the crew of the lobster vessel F/V DIAMOND GIRL,\r\ninjured his back, on or about April 1, 1993, as the result of\r\nan incident in the pilot house with the captain.  Either the\r\ncaptain pushed him against a console on his way to the galley\r\nfor a cup of coffee (plaintiff's account), or plaintiff,\r\n\"horsing around,\" grabbed the captain from behind and they both\r\nstumbled and plaintiff fell against a couch (captain's\r\naccount).  Plaintiff had been with the vessel for some time\r\nand, admittedly, had engaged in such horseplay with the captain\r\n(without injury) on a prior occasion.\r\n  Plaintiff brought suit for negligence under the Jones\r\nAct, 46 U.S.C.  688, as well as for unseaworthiness and\r\nmaintenance and cure.  The jury found for the defendant on\r\nnegligence and unseaworthiness, and plaintiff appeals on the\r\nground that the court improperly admitted a recorded statement\r\nof an absent witness under Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), now Rule\r\n807, substantially confirming the captain's testimony.  On\r\nthese counts we affirm.\r\n  Without going into details, this ruling stretched the\r\nresidual hearsay exception, intended for exceptional occasions,\r\nperhaps to the breaking point.  But also, in our opinion, the\r\ncaptain's account is so strong, when viewed against plaintiff's\r\nextraordinary one, that we are not interested in a new trial\r\nsimply because it was, perhaps, wrongfully corroborated. \r\nPlaintiff's account was, \"The captain came by me, pushed me out\r\nof the way.  And in the process of doing that, I banged my back\r\non the edge of the console and had nothing but trouble ever\r\nsince.\"  Passing the fact that plaintiff waited two years and\r\n11 months before suing, \"nothing but trouble\" consisted of\r\nremaining with the DIAMOND GIRL, at a full percentage share,\r\nfor a year and a half, leaving, when her earnings decreased, to\r\ngo first with one, and then another, vessel, in each case\r\nstating, in writing, that he was well and capable of doing a\r\nfull job.  Equally, why would the captain leave the wheel, when\r\nthey were running a river to the dock, to enjoy a cup of\r\ncoffee, when he could readily have asked plaintiff to get him\r\none, or, at the least, put him at the wheel rather than shove\r\nhim against the console and depart?  All this may have\r\nhappened, but we think one trial is enough.\r\n  There is a second matter, the jury's award of\r\nmaintenance and cure, which defendant appeals.  Plaintiff's\r\ndemands, and the jury findings, may seem large, particularly\r\nhaving in mind that he continued to work on board defendant's\r\nvessel (and even signed a receipt for reimbursement for a\r\nchiropractor, but denied having been paid), but the appeal was\r\nnot well taken.  It reads, \"from the Jury Verdict on Count III\r\nof the plaintiff's complaint . . . and the court order denying\r\nJudgment as a Matter of Law entered in this action . . . .\"  It\r\nis elementary that one cannot appeal from a verdict, but only\r\nfrom some order of the court, for example, denying a motion to\r\nset the verdict aside as excessive.  Defendant failed to file\r\nsuch a motion.  The motion for judgment as a matter of law was\r\nprocedurally proper, but substantively inappropriate because\r\nthere was at least some evidence in plaintiff's favor that\r\ncould have been credited.\r\n  Affirmed.  No costs to either party.\r\n",
