The parting of ways of attorneys\n\nin a law firm is often difficult; in this instance it has been\n\nunusually acrimonious.         In this dispute between Edward Paul\n\nCoady, an attorney, and Ashcraft & Gerel, his former law firm,\n\nthe   firm    appeals   the   district       court's   confirmation    of   an\n\narbitration award.       The core of this case concerns the award to\n\nCoady of $45,000 in additional bonus compensation, plus fees and\n\nexpenses for the arbitration.          Ashcraft & Gerel argues that the\n\narbitrators      exceeded     their    authority       under   the    limited\n\narbitration clause of Coady's employment agreement.              Ashcraft &\n\nGerel also appeals the district court's earlier refusal to\n\ntransfer Coady's application for arbitration to the federal\n\ndistrict court for the District of Columbia, where the law firm\n\nhad earlier filed a complaint alleging, inter alia, that Coady\n\nwas in breach of his contract.              Coady later counterclaimed in\n\nthe D.C. court for breach of contract.1\n\n\n\n\n      1   Alleging arbitrator misconduct, Ashcraft & Gerel also\nargues that the district court erred in not vacating the award\nunder 9 U.S.C. ยง 10(a)(3) as being fundamentally unfair.\nBecause of our resolution of the issue of the scope of the\narbitrators' authority, we need not reach this issue.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f           We hold that the initial order of reference to the\n\narbitrators by the Massachusetts district court referred matters\n\noutside    the     arbitrators'     authority,       and    that   in   making\n\ndeterminations as to the bonus owed to Coady, the arbitrators\n\nexceeded the scope of their authority under the arbitration\n\nclause.    The arbitrators did so in at least three ways.               First,\n\nonce the parties stipulated as to the meaning of certain terms\n\nin   Coady's     employment   contract,      there    was    no    longer   any\n\nambiguity or question of interpretation for the arbitrators to\n\nresolve.    Next, the panel made factual findings regarding the\n\nlaw firm's alleged manipulation of its \"senior partner draw,\" a\n\nsum that limited the size of the bonus that Coady could receive.2\n\nFinally, the panel calculated the amount of the additional bonus\n\nowed to Coady.      The latter two were issues of the application of\n\nthe contract terms to the facts, matters that were not within\n\nthe arbitrators' limited authority under the contract.                       We\n\nvacate    the    arbitral   award   and    remand    with   instructions     to\n\ntransfer any further proceedings related to Coady's bonus to the\n\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.                   We do not\n\n\n     2    In addition to his salary, Coady was entitled to\nreceive in 1997 a bonus equal to 25% of the net profits of\nAshcraft & Gerel's Boston office, which he managed.         His\nemployment agreement, however, set a cap on his total earnings:\n\"[Coady] shall receive in no event any amount in total\ncompensation for any calendar year in excess of a senior\npartner's draw for [the] same calendar year.\"\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdecide    whether   the       Massachusetts     district      court     abused    its\n\ndiscretion by initially refusing to transfer the case, but\n\nconclude that it was in error as to the primary factor on which\n\nit relied.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            In 1989, Coady joined the Boston office of Ashcraft &\n\nGerel, a law firm based in Washington, D.C.                 He later became the\n\nmanaging attorney of the Boston office, and held that position\n\nuntil    April   1998.        Coady    was    never    an   equity     partner;   he\n\ncharacterized his status in 1996 as a \"contract non-equity\n\npartner.\"\n\n            In early 1997, disputes arose between Coady and the\n\nfirm over Coady's compensation and his management of the office.\n\nCoady's     employment         agreement       authorized        arbitration       of\n\n\"ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract,\"\n\nif the parties could not resolve their differences.                          Coady\n\ninformed    Ashcraft      &    Gerel   that    he     intended    to    submit    the\n\ndisputed employment issues to arbitration.\n\n            After unsuccessful negotiations (including indications\n\nthat Coady planned to resort to arbitration), Ashcraft & Gerel\n\nfiled a complaint for damages and a declaratory judgment in the\n\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on August 1,\n\n1997.     The firm claimed that Coady had violated his duties and\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fobligations to the firm, and sought a declaration that it was\n\nentitled under the employment agreement to terminate Coady for\n\ncause.     The firm had an interest in terminating him for cause\n\nbecause the employment contract called for a payment of $400,000\n\nto the innocent party in case of breach.                       Coady later filed a\n\ncounterclaim for breach of contract.\n\n            On August 19, 1997, Coady filed an application for\n\narbitration       in    Massachusetts       state    court;      Ashcraft    &   Gerel\n\nremoved    that    action     to    the    federal       district   court    for    the\n\nDistrict    of     Massachusetts          and    moved    to   dismiss,     stay,    or\n\ntransfer venue to the District of Columbia court.                      Although the\n\nMassachusetts          federal     district      court     initially    decided      to\n\ntransfer the case to the D.C. court, it later reconsidered the\n\ntransfer.     See Coady v. Ashcraft & Gerel, 996 F. Supp. 95, 98\n\n(D. Mass. 1998).         It reconsidered because its original transfer\n\ndecision had been premised not on the first-filed doctrine, but\n\non a ground never presented to it by the parties.                      See id.\n\n            After reconsideration, the Massachusetts district court\n\ndenied    Ashcraft       &   Gerel's      motion     to    transfer,    citing      the\n\nexistence of what it perceived as a judicial emergency in the\n\nfederal district court for the District of Columbia as its\n\nprimary reason for refusing to transfer the case.                         See id. at\n\n100, 106.     The court then considered Coady's application for\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\farbitration.     Coady sought an order compelling arbitration of\n\n\"all of the matters in dispute\" between himself and Ashcraft &\n\nGerel.     Id.   at   106.     The   court    found,   however,    that    the\n\narbitration clause in his employment contract was an unusually\n\nlimited one: it authorized arbitration only of questions of\n\nambiguity or interpretation of the contract; questions of breach\n\nof contract were not within the scope of the clause.              See id. at\n\n106-07.    Neither    party    disputes      this    holding.     The   court\n\nidentified four major issues that it considered to be contract\n\ninterpretation issues and referred them to an arbitration panel\n\nin Massachusetts.      See id. at 108-10.           The court acknowledged\n\nthat the arbitration could not completely resolve the parties'\n\ndisagreements: \"Unless the parties mutually agree to continue\n\narbitration for the purpose of complete resolution of a dispute,\n\nthe dispute must be resolved through litigation, or private\n\nsettlement.\"     Id. at 107.\n\n          In May 1998, the D.C. district court denied Coady's\n\nmotion for a stay of proceedings pending the arbitration.                 From\n\nthat point on, one federal district court action proceeded in\n\nMassachusetts while another proceeded between the same parties\n\nin the District of Columbia on essentially the same subject\n\nmatter.   In addition, the arbitration, related to both lawsuits,\n\nproceeded in Massachusetts.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            The arbitration panel held a three-day hearing in\n\nBoston in November 1998, and issued its first Findings, Orders,\n\nand Award on February 16, 1999.          Ashcraft & Gerel then filed a\n\nmotion in the Massachusetts district court to vacate the panel's\n\ndecision.    On April 29, 1999, the Massachusetts district court\n\ndenied the motion.     The court affirmed the arbitrators' order\n\nthat there be additional discovery in order to assist the panel\n\nin calculating Coady's bonus.        The panel had decided at least\n\ntwo issues of breach of contract, finding that Coady was not in\n\nbreach, but the law firm was.      Ashcraft & Gerel protested to the\n\ndistrict    court   that   these   findings    exceeded   the    panel's\n\nauthority.    The court declined to address the breach issues,\n\nsaying they should be resolved by the D.C. district court.           The\n\npanel had also awarded Coady his expenses and          counsel fees on\n\na finding that he was the winner of the arbitration.3           The court\n\nmade no determination on that issue because of its decision to\n\nrefer the breach issues to the D.C. court.4\n\n\n\n\n    3    The employment agreement provided that \"the reasonable\nexpenses and costs of [the arbitration] will be borne by the\nloser.\"\n    4     The court also upheld the panel's findings that Coady\nhad not misused his firm credit card, and that the firm's\npartners, not Coady, had the ultimate authority over hiring in\nthe Boston office.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f                In June 1999, the D.C. district court ruled on the\n\nbreach issues in the panel's decision that the Massachusetts\n\ndistrict court had declined to address.                      The D.C. court held\n\nthat the law firm had never submitted to a broader scope of\n\narbitration, as Coady contended, and that the panel had exceeded\n\nits jurisdiction on the breach of contract issues.                    It vacated\n\nthe panel's decision as to those issues.                     The D.C. court held\n\nthat       it   could    not   rule   on    the     bonus    issue   because   the\n\nMassachusetts district court had retained control of it.5\n\n                Ashcraft & Gerel's request for a ruling that it had\n\ncause to terminate Coady and its breach of fiduciary duty claim\n\nagainst him were later tried to a jury in the District of\n\nColumbia proceedings.           The jury found that Ashcraft & Gerel had\n\ngood       cause   for   terminating   Coady,        which    foreclosed   Coady's\n\nbreach of contract counterclaim.                 The jury also found that Coady\n\nhad not breached his fiduciary duties to the firm.                     Ashcraft &\n\nGerel was awarded $400,000 in liquidated damages against Coady\n\nunder the employment contract.6\n\n\n       5  The D.C. court also ruled that the portions of the\narbitration award to which Ashcraft & Gerel had not objected\nwould have preclusive effect in the D.C. litigation, including\nthe panel's finding that Coady did not misuse his firm credit\ncard.\n       6  We were informed by counsel at oral argument that this\ndecision has been appealed to the D.C. Circuit. See Ashcraft &\nGerel v. Coady, No. 00-7105 (D.C. Cir. filed Apr. 12, 2000).\n\n                                           -8-\n\f           Meanwhile, the Massachusetts arbitration panel issued\n\na Supplemental Order, Finding, and Award on May 7, 1999, in\n\nwhich it clarified that even if it did not consider the breach\n\nof contract findings that were referred to (and later vacated\n\nby) the D.C. court, it would still find that Coady was the\n\nwinner of the arbitration.          It thus reaffirmed that Coady was\n\nentitled   to   an    award    of    fees    and       expenses,   including\n\nreimbursement of $36,000 for his arbitration expenses.               It also\n\nrejected objections to its discovery orders, and found that\n\nAshcraft & Gerel's argument that it misunderstood its discovery\n\nobligations \"exceed[ed] the bounds of credulity.\"\n\n           The panel held another hearing on May 25, 1999, and on\n\nJune 4 issued its Supplemental Findings, Orders, and Award\n\naddressing Coady's 1997 bonus.             As explained above, \"senior\n\npartner draw\" was a key term in understanding how Coady's bonus\n\nwas   calculated,    because   it    acted    as   a    cap   on   his   total\n\ncompensation.   During the November 1998 arbitration hearings,\n\nthe firm had stipulated that it agreed with Coady's view of the\n\nmethod for calculating his bonus:\n\n           [T]he calculation of the bonus that Mr.\n           Coady   calculated   [based   on  a   stated\n           percentage of the Boston office's net\n           profits, with net profits defined as Boston\n           office revenue minus Boston office expenses]\n           is accurate for as far as it gets you. But\n           it doesn't get you very far because his\n           bonus, total compensation, was subject to a\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            cap, and he couldn't earn any more than the\n            senior partners earned. And we have further\n            stipulated that the cap should be calculated\n            in accordance with historic accounting\n            practices of Ashcraft & Gerel and in\n            accordance    with    generally     accepted\n            accounting practices of Ashcraft & Gerel.\n\n            The real disagreement between the parties thus centered\n\nnot on the method of calculating the bonus, but on Coady's claim\n\nthat the firm had deliberately underpaid its senior partners in\n\n1997 in order to lower the cap and thereby reduce his bonus.\n\nCoady claimed that the firm had accomplished this by improperly\n\ndeferring 1997 income to 1998, and by not attributing income\n\nfrom the firm's separate affiliation with the Boston firm of\n\nHugo & Pollack.    In response, the firm repeatedly objected that\n\nthese issues were beyond the scope of arbitration, but put on\n\nevidence.\n\n            In its June 4 decision, the panel proceeded to apply\n\nthe interpretation of the bonus calculation method agreed on by\n\nthe parties to the facts, including its finding that Coady had\n\nmade a prima facie case that the law firm had manipulated the\n\nsize of the senior partners' draw.     The panel found that while\n\nit could not calculate Coady's exact 1997 bonus on the evidence\n\nbefore it, it was able to determine that Coady was entitled to\n\nat least $45,000 more than he had received.        The arbitrators\n\nalso held that Coady was the winner of the arbitration on the\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fissue of his 1997 bonus, and thus entitled to fees and expenses\n\nrelated to that issue.     The panel gave Coady two options: accept\n\n$45,000   as   the   additional   bonus    figure,     or   pursue    further\n\ndiscovery.     Coady opted for the $45,000.       The panel issued its\n\nfinal order on June 30, and Coady moved the next day in the\n\nMassachusetts district court for confirmation of the arbitral\n\naward.    Ashcraft    &   Gerel   again    objected,    arguing      that   the\n\narbitrators had exceeded their authority, due at least in part\n\nto error in the initial order of reference to the arbitrators by\n\nthe Massachusetts court.          The district court confirmed the\n\narbitration award on September 15, 1999.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           This case comes to us in an unusual posture, partly as\n\na result of there being different proceedings involving the same\n\ncase in two different federal courts and at least an arguable\n\ninconsistency in the outcomes.            While Ashcraft & Gerel makes\n\nseveral arguments on appeal, at the heart of the case now is the\n\narbitral decision concerning Coady's bonus.             The resolution of\n\nthat issue considerably alters the posture of the remaining\n\nclaims.\n\nA. Rulings on the Arbitrability of the Bonus Issue\n\n           Coady's employment was primarily governed by his 1993\n\nemployment agreement with Ashcraft & Gerel, which was amended in\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f1994.7    The employment agreement, as amended, covers Coady's\n\nduties, his compensation, and his degree of control over the\n\nBoston office, and also sets liquidated damages for a breach by\n\neither party.    The agreement includes the following arbitration\n\nclause:\n\n                  It is agreed by the parties that any\n           ambiguities or questions of interpretation\n           of this contract shall be the subject of\n           discussions by COADY and a [partners'\n           committee] . . . . Any decision which [the\n           committee] may reach in such a matter shall\n           be binding on the partnership. Either party\n           may at [its] option elect to submit the\n           matter    to   Binding   arbitration,    the\n           reasonable expenses and costs of which will\n           be borne by the loser; however, both parties\n           agree to use reasonable means and good faith\n           to attempt to resolve any differences that\n           may arise prior to resorting to arbitration.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n           In   its   March   1998   decision,   the   district   court\n\ninterpreted this arbitration clause, stating:\n\n                  This arbitration provision is not a\n           standard broad arbitration clause applying\n           to any dispute between Coady and Ashcraft &\n\n\n     7    There was also a so-called 1991 \"prenuptial agreement,\"\nwhich governed the process for Coady's departure from the firm\n-- in particular, the apportionment of fees from Coady's\ncontinued representation of former Ashcraft & Gerel clients.\nThe prenuptial agreement contains this arbitration clause: \"In\nthe event of any dispute over the construction, interpretation,\nor application of this Agreement, the parties agree to binding\narbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration\nAssociation.\" (emphasis added).     The terms of the prenuptial\nagreement are not relevant to the issues in this appeal.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f         Gerel arising out of or relating to the\n         Employment Agreement. Instead, this Court\n         reads this arbitration clause to define a\n         limited scope of arbitration.     Under the\n         Employment Agreement, the parties have\n         agreed to arbitrate disputes (1) requiring\n         clarification of the meaning of a particular\n         contractual provision because the language\n         of the contract suggests more than one\n         reasonable interpretation (ambiguities) and\n         (2)    requiring   construction    of    the\n         substantive provisions of the contract.\n         Once the arbitrator determines the meaning\n         of a contractual provision, the role of the\n         arbitrator is complete. Unless the parties\n         mutually agree to continue arbitration for\n         the purpose of complete resolution of a\n         dispute, the dispute must be resolved\n         through litigation, or private settlement.\n\nCoady, 996 F. Supp. at 107 (emphasis added).8\n\n         The district court then proceeded to identify which of\n\nthe disputed issues were arbitrable.   See id. at 108-09.   On the\n\nissue of the payment of Coady's bonus for the first half of\n\n1997, the district court wrote:\n\n                By the express terms of the Employment\n         Agreement, Coady is entitled to a bi-annual\n         bonus equal to twenty-five percent of the\n         net profits of the Boston office.        This\n         bonus payment is capped; Coady's total\n         annual compensation cannot exceed a senior\n         partner's draw for the same calendar year.\n         Coady asserts that Ashcraft & Gerel has\n\n\n    8     In contrast, the court described the prenuptial\nagreement's arbitration clause, see supra note 7, as \"slightly\nbroader . . . as it subjects to arbitration not simply the\nprocess of discovering and ascertaining the meaning of the\ncontract[,] but also applying the terms of the Agreement to a\nspecific set of facts.\" Id.\n\n                             -13-\n\f            failed to make this bonus payment for the\n            first half of 1997. The calculation of the\n            bonus is the subject of arbitration as the\n            determination   of   net   profit   requires\n            interpretation of whether certain expenses\n            are \"related.\"   However, the obligation to\n            make this payment is not the subject of\n            arbitration, as there is no ambiguity in the\n            Employment Agreement regarding Ashcraft &\n            Gerel's duty[] to make this bonus payment.\n\n\nId.   at   108    (citations   omitted)   (emphasis   added).   In   the\n\nconclusion of its opinion, the court identified four issues for\n\narbitration.      Only one was related to the bonus issue: \"What are\n\nthe related expenses for determining the Boston office's net\n\nprofits?\"        Id. at 109.    As described earlier, the \"related\n\nexpenses\" issue was removed from consideration by the law firm's\n\nacceptance, during the arbitration, of Coady's figures.9\n\n            In its November 4, 1998 report on the issues subject\n\nto arbitration, and again in its February 1999 Findings, Orders,\n\nand Award, the arbitration panel stated that it believed that\n\nthe amount of Coady's bonus -- not simply the nature of \"related\n\nexpenses for determining the Boston office's net profits\" -- was\n\nsubject to arbitration.        The arbitrators based this conclusion\n\non the district court's statement that \"[t]he calculation of the\n\nbonus is the subject of arbitration,\"          Coady, 996 F. Supp. at\n\n\n\n      9   As a result, there is no occasion to consider whether\nthis portion of the order of reference was in error.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f108,   and   on    the    district   court's    later   affirmance   of    the\n\narbitrators' discovery order.             In its February 1999 decision,\n\nthe panel also found that Coady had made a prima facie case that\n\nAshcraft & Gerel had manipulated its 1997 senior partner draw in\n\norder to reduce his         bonus, and ordered further discovery that\n\nwould allow it to calculate what Coady's bonus should have been.\n\n             In its April 1999 Memorandum and Order, the district\n\ncourt denied Ashcraft & Gerel's motion to vacate in part the\n\narbitration award.          The court held that deference should be\n\ngiven to the arbitration panel's view of the scope of its\n\nauthority, citing Larocque v. R.W.F, Inc., 8 F.3d 95 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   \"[A]n arbitrator's view of the scope of the issue . . .\n\nis entitled to the same . . . deference . . . normally accorded\n\nto the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective bargaining\n\nagreement itself.\"         Id. at 97 (quoting El Dorado Tech. Servs.,\n\nInc. v. Union Gen. de Trabajadores, 961 F.2d 317, 321 (1st Cir.\n\n1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             On    the   bonus   issue,   the   court   concluded   that   the\n\narbitrators had not exceeded the scope of their authority when\n\nthey sought to calculate the amount of Coady's bonus and ordered\n\ndiscovery     on    the    senior    partner    draw    to   facilitate    the\n\ncalculation of the bonus amount.             Quoting its March 1998 order\n\nof reference, the court wrote:\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f                  This Court concluded that the panel\n           was to identify \"the related expenses for\n           determining the Boston office's net profits\"\n           to help calculate the bonus owed Coady.\n           Ashcraft sought to limit the panel's scope\n           to these related expenses only and now\n           objects to the panel's going beyond this\n           identification. In its discussion, however,\n           this Court stated that \"[t]he calculation of\n           the bonus is the subject of arbitration as\n           the determination of net profits requires\n           interpretation of whether certain expenses\n           are 'related.'\"   Thus, the Court's limited\n           conclusion should be read in light of its\n           more expansive discussion of this issue.\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n           After another hearing and two supplemental orders, the\n\narbitration panel issued its final order on June 30, 1999, which\n\nthe court confirmed at a hearing on September 15, 1999.                    The\n\ndistrict   court   did   not   issue   a   written     explanation   of    its\n\nSeptember 15 decision.         At the hearing, however, the court\n\nrepeated the reasoning from its April 1999 decision: first, the\n\nMarch 1998 decision did refer the calculation of Coady's bonus\n\nto the arbitrators; and second, the arbitrators' conclusions as\n\nto the scope of the arbitration should be given deference.\n\n           In Ashcraft & Gerel's view, the district court's March\n\n1998 decision concerning the scope of arbitration held that the\n\nemployment contract limited arbitration to matters of contract\n\ninterpretation     only.       Ashcraft    &   Gerel     argues   that    the\n\narbitrators   exceeded     their   authority     when     they    held    that\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fAshcraft     had    manipulated       the     senior    partners'       draw     and\n\ndetermined     that      the   firm     owed     Coady    additional           bonus\n\ncompensation.      The firm argues that the district court erred in\n\nits April 1999 decision; when it ruled that the arbitrators had\n\nnot exceeded the scope of their authority, the firm says, the\n\ncourt was misinterpreting its own March 1998 decision.\n\n           Coady argues that t he district court's confirmation of\n\nthe arbitration award was proper.                 According to Coady, the\n\ncalculation of his bonus required interpretation of an ambiguous\n\nterm in the employment contract, a task the arbitrators were\n\nspecifically empowered to engage in by both the employment\n\ncontract   and     the   district     court    order.     Coady   phrases        the\n\nquestion     facing      the   arbitrators       this    way:     was     Coady's\n\ncompensation capped by the number announced by Ashcraft & Gerel\n\nas the senior partners' draw, or did the firm have an obligation\n\nunder the contract to follow its usual accounting practices to\n\ndetermine the cap on Coady's compensation?               Coady says that the\n\npanel concluded in its February 1999 order that the cap number\n\nwas not the one announced by Ashcraft in 1997, but that the\n\nactual number was yet unknown, as Coady had submitted prima\n\nfacie evidence of \"a substantial straddle of income in 1997.\"\n\nB. Standard of Review and Interpretation of the Arbitration\n\nClause\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f          The question of the appropriate standard of review is\n\nmultifaceted.     The    question    whether   the    parties    agreed   to\n\narbitrate certain matters was for the court to decide.                    See\n\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944\n\n(1995).   Indeed, in PaineWebber, Inc. v. Elahi, 87 F.3d 589 (1st\n\nCir. 1996), we held that \"the question whether the subject\n\nmatter of the underlying dispute is within the scope of an\n\nexpressly limited arbitration agreement is an 'arbitrability'\n\nissue.\"     Id.   at    596   (construing      AT&T    Techs.,     Inc.    v.\n\nCommunications Workers of Am., 475 U.S. 643, 651 (1986)).                 And\n\n\"arbitrability depends on contract interpretation, which is a\n\nquestion of law.\"      Id. at 592 (construing Commercial Union Ins.\n\nCo. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 992 F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n          As stated in First Options, \"[c]ourts should not assume\n\nthat the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there\n\nis 'clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]' evidence that they did so.\"\n\nFirst Options, 514 U.S. at 944 (quoting AT&T Techs., 475 U.S. at\n\n649) (second and third alterations in original).                The limited\n\narbitration clause in Coady's employment agreement contains no\n\nsuch \"clear and unmistakable\" language; there is in fact no\n\nevidence that the parties agreed to submit the question of\n\narbitrability to arbitration.          Thus, the arbitrators' views\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fabout what is arbitrable are not given the usual leeway courts\n\ngive to arbitrators.             See id. at 945-47.\n\n             Coady responds by citing the familiar doctrine that\n\n\"[a]ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should\n\nbe resolved in favor of arbitration.\"               Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp.\n\nv. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983).                    Even before\n\nFirst    Options,          however,    that       doctrine     was    subject        to\n\nconstraints.         \"So long as the arbitrator, acting within the\n\nscope of his delegated authority, is arguably construing the\n\ncontract, his decision must stand.\"               El Dorado Tech. Servs., 961\n\nF.2d at 319 (emphasis added).                  The Federal Arbitration Act\n\nexpressly provides that an award may be vacated \"[w]here the\n\narbitrators exceeded their powers.\"                9 U.S.C. ยง 10(a)(4).\n\n             To   use      the   doctrine    as   Coady    posits     would    be    to\n\nundermine First Options.             Where the arbitrability of a dispute\n\nis to be determined by a court and the court determines that an\n\nissue is not arbitrable, the arbitrators' contrary conclusion\n\nthat    an   issue    is    arbitrable      carries   no     weight   and     is    not\n\nentitled to deference.              This is true even when the district\n\ncourt's order of reference is in error, as here.                       If the rule\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fwere otherwise, a party who did not agree to arbitrate could be\n\nlocked into an arbitral award through a series of errors.10\n\n         Here, the district court's initial order of reference\n\ndetermined that the employment agreement authorized arbitration\n\nonly of questions of ambiguity or interpretation of the contract\n\nand that questions of breach of contract were not within the\n\nscope of the clause.     See Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 107.      The\n\narbitrators were without power to enlarge upon that ruling.\n\nSome language in the order of reference, however, went beyond\n\nthe district court's core holding that only issues of contract\n\ninterpretation were arbitrable, and suggested to the arbitrators\n\nthat they could decide the ultimate issue of the size of the\n\nbonus owed to Coady.   See id. at 108 (\"[t]he calculation of the\n\nbonus is the subject of arbitration\").\n\n\n\n\n    10    The arbitral panel made the argument that Ashcraft &\nGerel waived its objections to the arbitrators' view of the\nscope of their authority through its submissions to the panel.\nCoady has not made that argument on appeal. Even if Coady had\nmade that argument, it is one we reject. Parties may supplement\nby their submissions the authority granted an arbitration panel\nunder a contract.    See Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v. Union de\nTrabajadores de la Industria Gastronomica Local 610, 959 F.2d 2,\n4 (1st Cir. 1992).       Having examined Ashcraft & Gerel's\nsubmissions to the arbitrators and the transcripts of the\narbitration hearings, we find that the firm consistently and\nvigorously maintained its objection to the            scope of\narbitration.    (The D.C. district court reached the same\nconclusion in its June 19, 1999, ruling on Ashcraft & Gerel's\nmotion to vacate the arbitration award.)\n\n                              -20-\n\f            Whether the arbitration clause mandates that the actual\n\ncalculation of Coady's bonus is subject to arbitration is, in\n\nour view, an issue of interpretation of the contractual language\n\n\"ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract.\"\n\nThe district court's ruling was one of interpretation, which did\n\nnot turn on any factual findings.               Thus, we review the point de\n\nnovo, see MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Exalon Indus., Inc., 138 F.3d\n\n426, 428 (1st Cir. 1998); Keystone Shipping Co. v. New England\n\nPower Co., 109 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1997), and find that it was\n\nerror.\n\n            By    its    plain   language,       the       arbitration     clause      is\n\nlimited to ambiguities and questions of interpretation.                              When\n\nthese parties wanted an arbitration clause that covered the\n\napplication of contract terms to specific facts, they were\n\ncapable of drafting such a clause.                 The arbitration clause in\n\nthe 1991 \"prenuptial agreement,\" see supra note 7, applies to\n\n\"the     construction,        interpretation          or    application        of    this\n\nAgreement.\"       Coady,      996   F.   Supp.    at       98   (original      emphasis\n\nremoved     and    new    emphasis       added);       see      also     id.    at    107\n\n(contrasting the arbitration clause in the prenuptial agreement,\n\nwhich    \"subjects       to   arbitration       not    simply      the    process      of\n\ndiscovering and ascertaining the meaning of the contract[,] but\n\nalso applying the terms of the Agreement to a specific set of\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\ffacts,\" to the narrower clause in the employment agreement).          At\n\nbottom, arbitration remains \"simply a matter of contract between\n\nthe parties; it is a way to resolve the disputes -- but only\n\nthose disputes -- that the parties have agreed to submit to\n\narbitration.\"     First Options, 514 U.S. at 943.      The employment\n\nagreement    plainly   manifests    the   parties'   intent   to   limit\n\narbitration to the interpretation of ambiguous contract terms.\n\n            The stipulations presented by the law firm at the\n\nNovember 1998 arbitration hearings resolved the ambiguities and\n\nquestions of interpretation surrounding Coady's bonus; indeed,\n\nthey eliminated any dispute between Coady and the law firm on\n\nthese points.11   This left no issue concerning the bonus that was\n\nwithin the scope of the arbitrators' authority.        But, given the\n\nlanguage in the district court's order of reference, it is\n\nunderstandable that the arbitrators went further.\n\n            There was, of course, considerable dispute about the\n\napplication of the agreed-upon interpretations -- for example,\n\nwhether the law firm had violated accepted accounting practices.\n\nBut these issues of breach and calculation of sums were properly\n\n\n\n\n     11   In retrospect, it might have been better for the law\nfirm to have informed the Massachusetts district court at the\ntime of its consideration of the order of reference that the\nfirm would so stipulate. That might have framed the matter in\nsharper focus for the district court.\n\n                                   -22-\n\fpart of the factfinding in the D.C. court litigation, and not\n\npart of the arbitrators' task.\n\n\n\n\n                             -23-\n\fC. Remedy\n\n            The   question     becomes    then   one    of   fashioning   an\n\nappropriate remedy, given the status of the bonus dispute and\n\nthe parallel litigation that has proceeded in the District of\n\nColumbia.    We remand to the Massachusetts district court with\n\ninstructions to transfer the action, including the records of\n\nthe arbitral hearings that have been filed, to Judge Kollar-\n\nKotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThere is nothing left of the Massachusetts action, which was\n\nbrought to compel arbitration.            If there are to be further\n\nproceedings on the bonus issue, they should take place under the\n\nauthority    of   the   D.C.   district   court,   which     is   completely\n\nfamiliar with legal and factual determinations made in the\n\ncourse of the D.C. trial, some of which may bear on the bonus\n\ndispute.\n\n            Our remand and transfer order is not based on Ashcraft\n\n& Gerel's argument that the Massachusetts court erred in failing\n\nto transfer the action in April 1998.                  The district court,\n\nAshcraft & Gerel says, disregarded the \"first-filed rule\" and\n\nimproperly applied the transfer criteria under 28 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1404(a), thereby dividing jurisdiction over a single dispute\n\nbetween federal courts in Boston and Washington, D.C.               Ashcraft\n\n& Gerel contends that the district court's ruling ran counter to\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fa principal concern behind both the first-filed rule and venue\n\ntransfer under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a): preventing duplication of\n\neffort and incompatible rulings.                 Coady defends the district\n\ncourt's decision, arguing that because Ashcraft & Gerel was\n\nguilty of \"racing to the courthouse,\" it was not entitled to\n\napplication of the first-filed rule.\n\n             We   would   review      the    district     court's     decision   on\n\ntransfer of venue for an abuse of discretion.                  See Cianbro Corp.\n\nv. Curran-Lavoie, Inc., 814 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1987).                     Under\n\nยง 1404(a), a district court may transfer any civil action to any\n\nother   district       where   it    may    have   been    brought     \"[f]or    the\n\nconvenience       of   parties      and    witnesses,     in   the   interest     of\n\njustice.\"     28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a).\n\nIn addition to the convenience of parties and witnesses, the\n\nfactors to be considered by the court include the availability\n\nof documents; the possibility of consolidation; and the order in\n\nwhich the district court obtained jurisdiction.                      See Cianbro,\n\n814   F.2d   at    11.     \"Where     identical     actions     are    proceeding\n\nconcurrently in two federal courts . . . the first filed action\n\nis generally preferred in a choice-of-venue decision.\"                   Id.     The\n\nburden of proof rests with the party seeking transfer; there is\n\na strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of\n\n\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\fforum.    See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947).\n\n\n\n           Here, however, the decision by the district court not\n\nto transfer the action was \"primarily due to the existence of a\n\njudicial emergency in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia.\"           Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 106 (emphasis\n\nadded).    This was an issue the district court introduced into\n\nthe case sua sponte, the parties not having argued it.                        The\n\ndistrict     court   apparently         thought    that   the      District    of\n\nMassachusetts could handle the action better, given that it was\n\nat full strength, whereas the federal district court for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia did not have its full complement of judges.\n\n           The    court's    reliance       on     this   factor     (which    is\n\nmaterially different from docket congestion) was error.                       The\n\ndistrict court did not base its decision on undue delay to\n\nparties,    but   rather    on    the    mere     existence   of    a   judicial\n\nemergency.

In this dispute between Edward Paul Coady, an attorney, and Ashcraft &amp; Gerel, his former law firm, the firm appeals the district court's confirmation of an arbitration award. The core of this case concerns the award to Coady of $45,000 in additional bonus compensation, plus fees and expenses for the arbitration. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority under the limited arbitration clause of Coady's employment agreement. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel also appeals the district court's earlier refusal to transfer Coady's application for arbitration to the federal district court for the District of Columbia, where the law firm had earlier filed a complaint alleging, inter alia, that Coady was in breach of his contract. Coady later counterclaimed in the D.C. court for breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the initial order of reference to the arbitrators by the Massachusetts district court referred matters outside the arbitrators' authority, and that in making determinations as to the bonus owed to Coady, the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority under the arbitration clause. The arbitrators did so in at least three ways. First, once the parties stipulated as to the meaning of certain terms in Coady's employment contract, there was no longer any ambiguity or question of interpretation for the arbitrators to resolve. Next, the panel made factual findings regarding the law firm's alleged manipulation of its \"senior partner draw,\" a sum that limited the size of the bonus that Coady could receive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Finally, the panel calculated the amount of the additional bonus owed to Coady. The latter two were issues of the application of the contract terms to the facts, matters that were not within the arbitrators' limited authority under the contract. We vacate the arbitral award and remand with instructions to transfer any further proceedings related to Coady's bonus to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. We do not decide whether the Massachusetts district court abused its discretion by initially refusing to transfer the case, but conclude that it was in error as to the primary factor on which it relied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Coady joined the Boston office of Ashcraft &amp; Gerel, a law firm based in Washington, D.C. He later became the managing attorney of the Boston office, and held that position until April 1998. Coady was never an equity partner; he characterized his status in 1996 as a \"contract non-equity partner.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1997, disputes arose between Coady and the firm over Coady's compensation and his management of the office. Coady's employment agreement authorized arbitration of \"ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract,\" if the parties could not resolve their differences. Coady informed Ashcraft &amp; Gerel that he intended to submit the disputed employment issues to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessful negotiations (including indications that Coady planned to resort to arbitration), Ashcraft &amp; Gerel filed a complaint for damages and a declaratory judgment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on August 1, 1997. The firm claimed that Coady had violated his duties and obligations to the firm, and sought a declaration that it was entitled under the employment agreement to terminate Coady for cause. The firm had an interest in terminating him for cause because the employment contract called for a payment of $400,000 to the innocent party in case of breach. Coady later filed a counterclaim for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 1997, Coady filed an application for arbitration in Massachusetts state court; Ashcraft &amp; Gerel removed that action to the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts and moved to dismiss, stay, or transfer venue to the District of Columbia court. Although the Massachusetts federal district court initially decided to transfer the case to the D.C. court, it later reconsidered the transfer. See Coady v. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel, 996 F. Supp. 95, 98 (D. Mass. 1998). It reconsidered because its original transfer decision had been premised not on the first-filed doctrine, but on a ground never presented to it by the parties. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reconsideration, the Massachusetts district court denied Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's motion to transfer, citing the existence of what it perceived as a judicial emergency in the federal district court for the District of Columbia as its primary reason for refusing to transfer the case. See id. at 100, 106. The court then considered Coady's application for arbitration. Coady sought an order compelling arbitration of \"all of the matters in dispute\" between himself and Ashcraft &amp; Gerel. Id. at 106. The court found, however, that the arbitration clause in his employment contract was an unusually limited one: it authorized arbitration only of questions of ambiguity or interpretation of the contract; questions of breach of contract were not within the scope of the clause. See id. at 106-07. Neither party disputes this holding. The court identified four major issues that it considered to be contract interpretation issues and referred them to an arbitration panel in Massachusetts. See id. at 108-10. The court acknowledged that the arbitration could not completely resolve the parties' disagreements: \"Unless the parties mutually agree to continue arbitration for the purpose of complete resolution of a dispute, the dispute must be resolved through litigation, or private settlement.\" Id. at 107.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1998, the D.C. district court denied Coady's motion for a stay of proceedings pending the arbitration. From that point on, one federal district court action proceeded in Massachusetts while another proceeded between the same parties in the District of Columbia on essentially the same subject matter. In addition, the arbitration, related to both lawsuits, proceeded in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitration panel held a three-day hearing in Boston in November 1998, and issued its first Findings, Orders, and Award on February 16, 1999. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel then filed a motion in the Massachusetts district court to vacate the panel's decision. On April 29, 1999, the Massachusetts district court denied the motion. The court affirmed the arbitrators' order that there be additional discovery in order to assist the panel in calculating Coady's bonus. The panel had decided at least two issues of breach of contract, finding that Coady was not in breach, but the law firm was. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel protested to the district court that these findings exceeded the panel's authority. The court declined to address the breach issues, saying they should be resolved by the D.C. district court. The panel had also awarded Coady his expenses and counsel fees on a finding that he was the winner of the arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court made no determination on that issue because of its decision to refer the breach issues to the D.C. court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1999, the D.C. district court ruled on the breach issues in the panel's decision that the Massachusetts district court had declined to address. The D.C. court held that the law firm had never submitted to a broader scope of arbitration, as Coady contended, and that the panel had exceeded its jurisdiction on the breach of contract issues. It vacated the panel's decision as to those issues. The D.C. court held that it could not rule on the bonus issue because the Massachusetts district court had retained control of it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's request for a ruling that it had cause to terminate Coady and its breach of fiduciary duty claim against him were later tried to a jury in the District of Columbia proceedings. The jury found that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel had good cause for terminating Coady, which foreclosed Coady's breach of contract counterclaim. The jury also found that Coady had not breached his fiduciary duties to the firm. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel was awarded $400,000 in liquidated damages against Coady under the employment contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Massachusetts arbitration panel issued a Supplemental Order, Finding, and Award on May 7, 1999, in which it clarified that even if it did not consider the breach of contract findings that were referred to (and later vacated by) the D.C. court, it would still find that Coady was the winner of the arbitration. It thus reaffirmed that Coady was entitled to an award of fees and expenses, including reimbursement of $36,000 for his arbitration expenses. It also rejected objections to its discovery orders, and found that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's argument that it misunderstood its discovery obligations \"exceed[ed] the bounds of credulity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel held another hearing on May 25, 1999, and on June 4 issued its Supplemental Findings, Orders, and Award addressing Coady's 1997 bonus. As explained above, \"senior partner draw\" was a key term in understanding how Coady's bonus was calculated, because it acted as a cap on his total compensation. During the November 1998 arbitration hearings, the firm had stipulated that it agreed with Coady's view of the method for calculating his bonus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he calculation of the bonus that Mr. Coady calculated [based on a stated percentage of the Boston office's net profits, with net profits defined as Boston office revenue minus Boston office expenses] is accurate for as far as it gets you. But it doesn't get you very far because his bonus, total compensation, was subject to a cap, and he couldn't earn any more than the senior partners earned. And we have further stipulated that the cap should be calculated in accordance with historic accounting practices of Ashcraft &amp; Gerel and in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices of Ashcraft &amp; Gerel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real disagreement between the parties thus centered not on the method of calculating the bonus, but on Coady's claim that the firm had deliberately underpaid its senior partners in 1997 in order to lower the cap and thereby reduce his bonus. Coady claimed that the firm had accomplished this by improperly deferring 1997 income to 1998, and by not attributing income from the firm's separate affiliation with the Boston firm of Hugo &amp; Pollack. In response, the firm repeatedly objected that these issues were beyond the scope of arbitration, but put on evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its June 4 decision, the panel proceeded to apply the interpretation of the bonus calculation method agreed on by the parties to the facts, including its finding that Coady had made a prima facie case that the law firm had manipulated the size of the senior partners' draw. The panel found that while it could not calculate Coady's exact 1997 bonus on the evidence before it, it was able to determine that Coady was entitled to at least $45,000 more than he had received. The arbitrators also held that Coady was the winner of the arbitration on the issue of his 1997 bonus, and thus entitled to fees and expenses related to that issue. The panel gave Coady two options: accept $45,000 as the additional bonus figure, or pursue further discovery. Coady opted for the $45,000. The panel issued its final order on June 30, and Coady moved the next day in the Massachusetts district court for confirmation of the arbitral award. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel again objected, arguing that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority, due at least in part to error in the initial order of reference to the arbitrators by the Massachusetts court. The district court confirmed the arbitration award on September 15, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us in an unusual posture, partly as a result of there being different proceedings involving the same case in two different federal courts and at least an arguable inconsistency in the outcomes. While Ashcraft &amp; Gerel makes several arguments on appeal, at the heart of the case now is the arbitral decision concerning Coady's bonus. The resolution of that issue considerably alters the posture of the remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Rulings on the Arbitrability of the Bonus Issue</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coady's employment was primarily governed by his 1993 employment agreement with Ashcraft &amp; Gerel, which was amended in 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The employment agreement, as amended, covers Coady's duties, his compensation, and his degree of control over the Boston office, and also sets liquidated damages for a breach by either party. The agreement includes the following arbitration clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is agreed by the parties that any ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract shall be the subject of discussions by COADY and a [partners' committee].... Any decision which [the committee] may reach in such a matter shall be binding on the partnership. Either party may at [its] option elect to submit the matter to Binding arbitration, the reasonable expenses and costs of which will be borne by the loser; however, both parties agree to use reasonable means and good faith to attempt to resolve any differences that may arise prior to resorting to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its March 1998 decision, the district court interpreted this arbitration clause, stating:This arbitration provision is not a standard broad arbitration clause applying to any dispute between Coady and Ashcraft &amp; Gerel arising out of or relating to the Employment Agreement. Instead, this Court reads this arbitration clause to define a limited scope of arbitration. Under the Employment Agreement, the parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes (1) requiring clarification of the meaning of a particular contractual provision because the language of the contract suggests more than one reasonable interpretation (ambiguities) and (2) requiring construction of the substantive provisions of the contract. Once the arbitrator determines the meaning of a contractual provision, the role of the arbitrator is complete. Unless the parties mutually agree to continue arbitration for the purpose of complete resolution of a dispute, the dispute must be resolved through litigation, or private settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 107 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then proceeded to identify which of the disputed issues were arbitrable. See id. at 108-09. On the issue of the payment of Coady's bonus for the first half of 1997, the district court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the express terms of the Employment Agreement, Coady is entitled to a bi-annual bonus equal to twenty-five percent of the net profits of the Boston office. This bonus payment is capped; Coady's total annual compensation cannot exceed a senior partner's draw for the same calendar year. Coady asserts that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel has failed to make this bonus payment for the first half of 1997. The calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration as the determination of net profit requires interpretation of whether certain expenses are \"related.\" However, the obligation to make this payment is not the subject of arbitration, as there is no ambiguity in the Employment Agreement regarding Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's duty[] to make this bonus payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 108 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In the conclusion of its opinion, the court identified four issues for arbitration. Only one was related to the bonus issue: \"What are the related expenses for determining the Boston office's net profits?\" Id. at 109. As described earlier, the \"related expenses\" issue was removed from consideration by the law firm's acceptance, during the arbitration, of Coady's figures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its November 4, 1998 report on the issues subject to arbitration, and again in its February 1999 Findings, Orders, and Award, the arbitration panel stated that it believed that the amount of Coady's bonus -- not simply the nature of \"related expenses for determining the Boston office's net profits\" -- was subject to arbitration. The arbitrators based this conclusion on the district court's statement that \"[t]he calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration,\" Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 108, and on the district court's later affirmance of the arbitrators' discovery order. In its February 1999 decision, the panel also found that Coady had made a prima facie case that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel had manipulated its 1997 senior partner draw in order to reduce his bonus, and ordered further discovery that would allow it to calculate what Coady's bonus should have been.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its April 1999 Memorandum and Order, the district court denied Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's motion to vacate in part the arbitration award. The court held that deference should be given to the arbitration panel's view of the scope of its authority, citing Larocque v. R.W.F, Inc., 8 F.3d 95 (1st Cir. 1993). \"[A]n arbitrator's view of the scope of the issue... is entitled to the same... deference... normally accorded to the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement itself.\" Id. at 97 (quoting El Dorado Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Union Gen. de Trabajadores, 961 F.2d 317, 321 (1st Cir. 1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the bonus issue, the court concluded that the arbitrators had not exceeded the scope of their authority when they sought to calculate the amount of Coady's bonus and ordered discovery on the senior partner draw to facilitate the calculation of the bonus amount. Quoting its March 1998 order of reference, the court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court concluded that the panel was to identify \"the related expenses for determining the Boston office's net profits\" to help calculate the bonus owed Coady. Ashcraft sought to limit the panel's scope to these related expenses only and now objects to the panel's going beyond this identification. In its discussion, however, this Court stated that \"[t]he calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration as the determination of net profits requires interpretation of whether certain expenses are 'related.'\" Thus, the Court's limited conclusion should be read in light of its more expansive discussion of this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After another hearing and two supplemental orders, the arbitration panel issued its final order on June 30, 1999, which the court confirmed at a hearing on September 15, 1999. The district court did not issue a written explanation of its September 15 decision. At the hearing, however, the court repeated the reasoning from its April 1999 decision: first, the March 1998 decision did refer the calculation of Coady's bonus to the arbitrators; and second, the arbitrators' conclusions as to the scope of the arbitration should be given deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's view, the district court's March 1998 decision concerning the scope of arbitration held that the employment contract limited arbitration to matters of contract interpretation only. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority when they held that Ashcraft had manipulated the senior partners' draw and determined that the firm owed Coady additional bonus compensation. The firm argues that the district court erred in its April 1999 decision; when it ruled that the arbitrators had not exceeded the scope of their authority, the firm says, the court was misinterpreting its own March 1998 decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coady argues that the district court's confirmation of the arbitration award was proper. According to Coady, the calculation of his bonus required interpretation of an ambiguous term in the employment contract, a task the arbitrators were specifically empowered to engage in by both the employment contract and the district court order. Coady phrases the question facing the arbitrators this way: was Coady's compensation capped by the number announced by Ashcraft &amp; Gerel as the senior partners' draw, or did the firm have an obligation under the contract to follow its usual accounting practices to determine the cap on Coady's compensation? Coady says that the panel concluded in its February 1999 order that the cap number was not the one announced by Ashcraft in 1997, but that the actual number was yet unknown, as Coady had submitted prima facie evidence of \"a substantial straddle of income in 1997.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

The question whether the parties agreed to arbitrate certain matters was for the court to decide. See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944 (1995). Indeed, in PaineWebber, Inc. v. Elahi, 87 F.3d 589 (1st Cir. 1996), we held that \"the question whether the subject matter of the underlying dispute is within the scope of an expressly limited arbitration agreement is an 'arbitrability' issue.\" Id. at 596 (construing AT&amp;T Techs., Inc. v. Communications Workers of Am., 475 U.S. 643, 651 (1986)). And \"arbitrability depends on contract interpretation, which is a question of law.\" Id. at 592 (construing Commercial Union Ins. Co. v.

The limited arbitration clause in Coady's employment agreement contains no such \"clear and unmistakable\" language; there is in fact no evidence that the parties agreed to submit the question of arbitrability to arbitration. Thus, the arbitrators' views about what is arbitrable are not given the usual leeway courts give to arbitrators. See id. at 945-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coady responds by citing the familiar doctrine that \"[a]ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\" Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1983). Even before First Options, however, that doctrine was subject to constraints. \"So long as the arbitrator, acting within the scope of his delegated authority, is arguably construing the contract, his decision must stand.\" El Dorado Tech. Servs., 961 F.2d at 319 (emphasis added). The Federal Arbitration Act expressly provides that an award may be vacated \"[w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To use the doctrine as Coady posits would be to undermine First Options. Where the arbitrability of a dispute is to be determined by a court and the court determines that an issue is not arbitrable, the arbitrators' contrary conclusion that an issue is arbitrable carries no weight and is not entitled to deference. This is true even when the district court's order of reference is in error, as here. If the rule were otherwise, a party who did not agree to arbitrate could be locked into an arbitral award through a series of errors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's initial order of reference determined that the employment agreement authorized arbitration only of questions of ambiguity or interpretation of the contract and that questions of breach of contract were not within the scope of the clause. See Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 107. The arbitrators were without power to enlarge upon that ruling. Some language in the order of reference, however, went beyond the district court's core holding that only issues of contract interpretation were arbitrable, and suggested to the arbitrators that they could decide the ultimate issue of the size of the bonus owed to Coady. See id. at 108 (\"[t]he calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the arbitration clause mandates that the actual calculation of Coady's bonus is subject to arbitration is, in our view, an issue of interpretation of the contractual language \"ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract.\" The district court's ruling was one of interpretation, which did not turn on any factual findings. Thus, we review the point de novo, see MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Exalon Indus., Inc., 138 F.3d 426, 428 (1st Cir. 1998); Keystone Shipping Co. v. New England Power Co., 109 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 1997), and find that it was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its plain language, the arbitration clause is limited to ambiguities and questions of interpretation. When these parties wanted an arbitration clause that covered the application of contract terms to specific facts, they were capable of drafting such a clause. The arbitration clause in the 1991 \"prenuptial agreement,\" see supra note 7, applies to \"the construction, interpretation or application of this Agreement.\" Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 98 (original emphasis removed and new emphasis added); see also id. at 107 (contrasting the arbitration clause in the prenuptial agreement, which \"subjects to arbitration not simply the process of discovering and ascertaining the meaning of the contract[,] but also applying the terms of the Agreement to a specific set of facts,\" to the narrower clause in the employment agreement). At bottom, arbitration remains \"simply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a way to resolve the disputes -- but only those disputes -- that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\" First Options, 514 U.S. at 943. The employment agreement plainly manifests the parties' intent to limit arbitration to the interpretation of ambiguous contract terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stipulations presented by the law firm at the November 1998 arbitration hearings resolved the ambiguities and questions of interpretation surrounding Coady's bonus; indeed, they eliminated any dispute between Coady and the law firm on these points.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> This left no issue concerning the bonus that was within the scope of the arbitrators' authority. But, given the language in the district court's order of reference, it is understandable that the arbitrators went further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was, of course, considerable dispute about the application of the agreed-upon interpretations -- for example, whether the law firm had violated accepted accounting practices. But these issues of breach and calculation of sums were properly part of the factfinding in the D.C. court litigation, and not part of the arbitrators' task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question becomes then one of fashioning an appropriate remedy, given the status of the bonus dispute and the parallel litigation that has proceeded in the District of Columbia. We remand to the Massachusetts district court with instructions to transfer the action, including the records of the arbitral hearings that have been filed, to Judge Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. There is nothing left of the Massachusetts action, which was brought to compel arbitration. If there are to be further proceedings on the bonus issue, they should take place under the authority of the D.C. district court, which is completely familiar with legal and factual determinations made in the course of the D.C. trial, some of which may bear on the bonus dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our remand and transfer order is not based on Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's argument that the Massachusetts court erred in failing to transfer the action in April 1998. The district court, Ashcraft &amp; Gerel says, disregarded the \"first-filed rule\" and improperly applied the transfer criteria under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a), thereby dividing jurisdiction over a single dispute between federal courts in Boston and Washington, D.C. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel contends that the district court's ruling ran counter to a principal concern behind both the first-filed rule and venue transfer under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a): preventing duplication of effort and incompatible rulings. Coady defends the district court's decision, arguing that because Ashcraft &amp; Gerel was guilty of \"racing to the courthouse,\" it was not entitled to application of the first-filed rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would review the district court's decision on transfer of venue for an abuse of discretion. See Cianbro Corp. v. Curran-Lavoie, Inc., 814 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1987). Under &#167; 1404(a), a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district where it may have been brought \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a). In addition to the convenience of parties and witnesses, the factors to be considered by the court include the availability of documents; the possibility of consolidation; and the order in which the district court obtained jurisdiction. See Cianbro, 814 F.2d at 11. \"Where identical actions are proceeding concurrently in two federal courts... the first filed action is generally preferred in a choice-of-venue decision.\" Id. The burden of proof rests with the party seeking transfer; there is a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the decision by the district court not to transfer the action was \"primarily due to the existence of a judicial emergency in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\" Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 106 (emphasis added). This was an issue the district court introduced into the case sua sponte, the parties not having argued it. The district court apparently thought that the District of Massachusetts could handle the action better, given that it was at full strength, whereas the federal district court for the District of Columbia did not have its full complement of judges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reliance on this factor (which is materially different from docket congestion) was error. The district court did not base its decision on undue delay to parties, but rather on the mere existence of a judicial emergency. While expressions of concern that the President and Congress fill existing judicial vacancies are appropriate in other contexts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> it has no place in determining the rights of litigants under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a), and is not \"in the interest of justice.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a). Neither constitutional nor statutory rights of parties are suspended when there are judicial vacancies in a district. We do not know whether absent this \"primary\" factor the court would have transferred the action. Nor do we need to decide whether absent that factor, the decision to refuse to transfer was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority and vacate the arbitral award. The case is now in a different posture than it was in April 1998, and the solution most consistent with the policies behind &#167; 1404(a) is to have any remaining matters addressed by Judge Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> We direct the district court to transfer this case to Judge Kollar-Kotelly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Alleging arbitrator misconduct, Ashcraft &amp; Gerel also argues that the district court erred in not vacating the award under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3) as being fundamentally unfair.

The prenuptial agreement contains this arbitration clause: \"In the event of any dispute over the construction, interpretation, or application of this Agreement, the parties agree to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.\" (emphasis added). The terms of the prenuptial agreement are not relevant to the issues in this appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  In contrast, the court described the prenuptial agreement's arbitration clause, see supra note 7, as \"slightly broader... as it subjects to arbitration not simply the process of discovering and ascertaining the meaning of the contract[,] but also applying the terms of the Agreement to a specific set of facts.\" Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  As a result, there is no occasion to consider whether this portion of the order of reference was in error.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  The arbitral panel made the argument that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel waived its objections to the arbitrators' view of the scope of their authority through its submissions to the panel.

Parties may supplement by their submissions the authority granted an arbitration panel under a contract. See Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v.

Having examined Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's submissions to the arbitrators and the transcripts of the arbitration hearings, we find that the firm consistently and vigorously maintained its objection to the scope of arbitration.

In this dispute between Edward Paul Coady, an attorney, and Ashcraft &amp; Gerel, his former law firm, the firm appeals the district court's confirmation of an arbitration award. The core of this case concerns the award to Coady of $45,000 in additional bonus compensation, plus fees and expenses for the arbitration. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority under the limited arbitration clause of Coady's employment agreement. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel also appeals the district court's earlier refusal to transfer Coady's application for arbitration to the federal district court for the District of Columbia, where the law firm had earlier filed a complaint alleging, inter alia, that Coady was in breach of his contract. Coady later counterclaimed in the D.C. court for breach of contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the initial order of reference to the arbitrators by the Massachusetts district court referred matters outside the arbitrators' authority, and that in making determinations as to the bonus owed to Coady, the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority under the arbitration clause. The arbitrators did so in at least three ways. First, once the parties stipulated as to the meaning of certain terms in Coady's employment contract, there was no longer any ambiguity or question of interpretation for the arbitrators to resolve. Next, the panel made factual findings regarding the law firm's alleged manipulation of its \"senior partner draw,\" a sum that limited the size of the bonus that Coady could receive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Finally, the panel calculated the amount of the additional bonus owed to Coady. The latter two were issues of the application of the contract terms to the facts, matters that were not within the arbitrators' limited authority under the contract. We vacate the arbitral award and remand with instructions to transfer any further proceedings related to Coady's bonus to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. We do not decide whether the Massachusetts district court abused its discretion by initially refusing to transfer the case, but conclude that it was in error as to the primary factor on which it relied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1989, Coady joined the Boston office of Ashcraft &amp; Gerel, a law firm based in Washington, D.C. He later became the managing attorney of the Boston office, and held that position until April 1998. Coady was never an equity partner; he characterized his status in 1996 as a \"contract non-equity partner.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1997, disputes arose between Coady and the firm over Coady's compensation and his management of the office. Coady's employment agreement authorized arbitration of \"ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract,\" if the parties could not resolve their differences. Coady informed Ashcraft &amp; Gerel that he intended to submit the disputed employment issues to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After unsuccessful negotiations (including indications that Coady planned to resort to arbitration), Ashcraft &amp; Gerel filed a complaint for damages and a declaratory judgment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on August 1, 1997. The firm claimed that Coady had violated his duties and obligations to the firm, and sought a declaration that it was entitled under the employment agreement to terminate Coady for cause. The firm had an interest in terminating him for cause because the employment contract called for a payment of $400,000 to the innocent party in case of breach. Coady later filed a counterclaim for breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 1997, Coady filed an application for arbitration in Massachusetts state court; Ashcraft &amp; Gerel removed that action to the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts and moved to dismiss, stay, or transfer venue to the District of Columbia court. Although the Massachusetts federal district court initially decided to transfer the case to the D.C. court, it later reconsidered the transfer. See Coady v. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625226\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625226/coady-v-ashcraft-gerel/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 98 (D. Mass. 1998). It reconsidered because its original transfer decision had been premised not on the first-filed doctrine, but on a ground never presented to it by the parties. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reconsideration, the Massachusetts district court denied Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's motion to transfer, citing the existence of what it perceived as a judicial emergency in the federal district court for the District of Columbia as its primary reason for refusing to transfer the case. See id. at 100, 106. The court then considered Coady's application for arbitration. Coady sought an order compelling arbitration of \"all of the matters in dispute\" between himself and Ashcraft &amp; Gerel. Id. at 106. The court found, however, that the arbitration clause in his employment contract was an unusually limited one: it authorized arbitration only of questions of ambiguity or interpretation of the contract; questions of breach of contract were not within the scope of the clause. See id. at 106-07. Neither party disputes this holding. The court identified four major issues that it considered to be contract interpretation issues and referred them to an arbitration panel in Massachusetts. See id. at 108-10. The court acknowledged that the arbitration could not completely resolve the parties' disagreements: \"Unless the parties mutually agree to continue arbitration for the purpose of complete resolution of a dispute, the dispute must be resolved through litigation, or private settlement.\" Id. at 107.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1998, the D.C. district court denied Coady's motion for a stay of proceedings pending the arbitration. From that point on, one federal district court action proceeded in Massachusetts while another proceeded between the same parties in the District of Columbia on essentially the same subject matter. In addition, the arbitration, related to both lawsuits, proceeded in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitration panel held a three-day hearing in Boston in November 1998, and issued its first Findings, Orders, and Award on February 16, 1999. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel then filed a motion in the Massachusetts district court to vacate the panel's decision. On April 29, 1999, the Massachusetts district court denied the motion. The court affirmed the arbitrators' order that there be additional discovery in order to assist the panel in calculating Coady's bonus. The panel had decided at least two issues of breach of contract, finding that Coady was not in breach, but the law firm was. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel protested to the district court that these findings exceeded the panel's authority. The court declined to address the breach issues, saying they should be resolved by the D.C. district court. The panel had also awarded Coady his expenses and counsel fees on a finding that he was the winner of the arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court made no determination on that issue because of its decision to refer the breach issues to the D.C. court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1999, the D.C. district court ruled on the breach issues in the panel's decision that the Massachusetts district court had declined to address. The D.C. court held that the law firm had never submitted to a broader scope of arbitration, as Coady contended, and that the panel had exceeded its jurisdiction on the breach of contract issues. It vacated the panel's decision as to those issues. The D.C. court held that it could not rule on the bonus issue because the Massachusetts district court had retained control of it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's request for a ruling that it had cause to terminate Coady and its breach of fiduciary duty claim against him were later tried to a jury in the District of Columbia proceedings. The jury found that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel had good cause for terminating Coady, which foreclosed Coady's breach of contract counterclaim. The jury also found that Coady had not breached his fiduciary duties to the firm. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel was awarded $400,000 in liquidated damages against Coady under the employment contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Massachusetts arbitration panel issued a Supplemental Order, Finding, and Award on May 7, 1999, in which it clarified that even if it did not consider the breach of contract findings that were referred to (and later vacated by) the D.C. court, it would still find that Coady was the winner of the arbitration. It thus reaffirmed that Coady was entitled to an award of fees and expenses, including reimbursement of $36,000 for his arbitration expenses. It also rejected objections to its discovery orders, and found that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's argument that it misunderstood its discovery obligations \"exceed[ed] the bounds of credulity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel held another hearing on May 25, 1999, and on June 4 issued its Supplemental Findings, Orders, and Award addressing Coady's 1997 bonus. As explained above, \"senior partner draw\" was a key term in understanding how Coady's bonus was calculated, because it acted as a cap on his total compensation. During the November 1998 arbitration hearings, the firm had stipulated that it agreed with Coady's view of the method for calculating his bonus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he calculation of the bonus that Mr. Coady calculated [based on a stated percentage of the Boston office's net profits, with net profits defined as Boston office revenue minus Boston office expenses] is accurate for as far as it gets you. But it doesn't get you very far because his bonus, total compensation, was subject to a cap, and he couldn't earn any more than the senior partners earned. And we have further stipulated that the cap should be calculated in accordance with historic accounting practices of Ashcraft &amp; Gerel and in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices of Ashcraft &amp; Gerel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real disagreement between the parties thus centered not on the method of calculating the bonus, but on Coady's claim that the firm had deliberately underpaid its senior partners in 1997 in order to lower the cap and thereby reduce his bonus. Coady claimed that the firm had accomplished this by improperly deferring 1997 income to 1998, and by not attributing income from the firm's separate affiliation with the Boston firm of Hugo &amp; Pollack. In response, the firm repeatedly objected that these issues were beyond the scope of arbitration, but put on evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its June 4 decision, the panel proceeded to apply the interpretation of the bonus calculation method agreed on by the parties to the facts, including its finding that Coady had made a prima facie case that the law firm had manipulated the size of the senior partners' draw. The panel found that while it could not calculate Coady's exact 1997 bonus on the evidence before it, it was able to determine that Coady was entitled to at least $45,000 more than he had received. The arbitrators also held that Coady was the winner of the arbitration on the issue of his 1997 bonus, and thus entitled to fees and expenses related to that issue. The panel gave Coady two options: accept $45,000 as the additional bonus figure, or pursue further discovery. Coady opted for the $45,000. The panel issued its final order on June 30, and Coady moved the next day in the Massachusetts district court for confirmation of the arbitral award. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel again objected, arguing that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority, due at least in part to error in the initial order of reference to the arbitrators by the Massachusetts court. The district court confirmed the arbitration award on September 15, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comes to us in an unusual posture, partly as a result of there being different proceedings involving the same case in two different federal courts and at least an arguable inconsistency in the outcomes. While Ashcraft &amp; Gerel makes several arguments on appeal, at the heart of the case now is the arbitral decision concerning Coady's bonus. The resolution of that issue considerably alters the posture of the remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The agreement includes the following arbitration clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is agreed by the parties that any ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract shall be the subject of discussions by COADY and a [partners' committee].... Any decision which [the committee] may reach in such a matter shall be binding on the partnership. Either party may at [its] option elect to submit the matter to Binding arbitration, the reasonable expenses and costs of which will be borne by the loser; however, both parties agree to use reasonable means and good faith to attempt to resolve any differences that may arise prior to resorting to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its March 1998 decision, the district court interpreted this arbitration clause, stating:This arbitration provision is not a standard broad arbitration clause applying to any dispute between Coady and Ashcraft &amp; Gerel arising out of or relating to the Employment Agreement. Instead, this Court reads this arbitration clause to define a limited scope of arbitration. Under the Employment Agreement, the parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes (1) requiring clarification of the meaning of a particular contractual provision because the language of the contract suggests more than one reasonable interpretation (ambiguities) and (2) requiring construction of the substantive provisions of the contract. Once the arbitrator determines the meaning of a contractual provision, the role of the arbitrator is complete. Unless the parties mutually agree to continue arbitration for the purpose of complete resolution of a dispute, the dispute must be resolved through litigation, or private settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coady, 996 F.

See id. at 108-09. On the issue of the payment of Coady's bonus for the first half of 1997, the district court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the express terms of the Employment Agreement, Coady is entitled to a bi-annual bonus equal to twenty-five percent of the net profits of the Boston office. This bonus payment is capped; Coady's total annual compensation cannot exceed a senior partner's draw for the same calendar year. Coady asserts that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel has failed to make this bonus payment for the first half of 1997. The calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration as the determination of net profit requires interpretation of whether certain expenses are \"related.\" However, the obligation to make this payment is not the subject of arbitration, as there is no ambiguity in the Employment Agreement regarding Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's duty[] to make this bonus payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 108 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In the conclusion of its opinion, the court identified four issues for arbitration. Only one was related to the bonus issue: \"What are the related expenses for determining the Boston office's net profits?\" Id. at 109. As described earlier, the \"related expenses\" issue was removed from consideration by the law firm's acceptance, during the arbitration, of Coady's figures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its November 4, 1998 report on the issues subject to arbitration, and again in its February 1999 Findings, Orders, and Award, the arbitration panel stated that it believed that the amount of Coady's bonus -- not simply the nature of \"related expenses for determining the Boston office's net profits\" -- was subject to arbitration. The arbitrators based this conclusion on the district court's statement that \"[t]he calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration,\" Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 108, and on the district court's later affirmance of the arbitrators' discovery order. In its February 1999 decision, the panel also found that Coady had made a prima facie case that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel had manipulated its 1997 senior partner draw in order to reduce his bonus, and ordered further discovery that would allow it to calculate what Coady's bonus should have been.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its April 1999 Memorandum and Order, the district court denied Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's motion to vacate in part the arbitration award. The court held that deference should be given to the arbitration panel's view of the scope of its authority, citing Larocque v. R.W.F, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656106\"><a href=\"/opinion/656106/edward-larocque-v-rwf-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1993). \"[A]n arbitrator's view of the scope of the issue... is entitled to the same... deference... normally accorded to the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement itself.\" Id. at 97 (quoting El Dorado Tech.

Union Gen. de Trabajadores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581363\"><a href=\"/opinion/581363/el-dorado-technical-services-inc-v-union-general-de-trabajadores-de/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 321 (1st Cir. 1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the bonus issue, the court concluded that the arbitrators had not exceeded the scope of their authority when they sought to calculate the amount of Coady's bonus and ordered discovery on the senior partner draw to facilitate the calculation of the bonus amount. Quoting its March 1998 order of reference, the court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court concluded that the panel was to identify \"the related expenses for determining the Boston office's net profits\" to help calculate the bonus owed Coady. Ashcraft sought to limit the panel's scope to these related expenses only and now objects to the panel's going beyond this identification. In its discussion, however, this Court stated that \"[t]he calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration as the determination of net profits requires interpretation of whether certain expenses are 'related.'\" Thus, the Court's limited conclusion should be read in light of its more expansive discussion of this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After another hearing and two supplemental orders, the arbitration panel issued its final order on June 30, 1999, which the court confirmed at a hearing on September 15, 1999. The district court did not issue a written explanation of its September 15 decision. At the hearing, however, the court repeated the reasoning from its April 1999 decision: first, the March 1998 decision did refer the calculation of Coady's bonus to the arbitrators; and second, the arbitrators' conclusions as to the scope of the arbitration should be given deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's view, the district court's March 1998 decision concerning the scope of arbitration held that the employment contract limited arbitration to matters of contract interpretation only. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority when they held that Ashcraft had manipulated the senior partners' draw and determined that the firm owed Coady additional bonus compensation. The firm argues that the district court erred in its April 1999 decision; when it ruled that the arbitrators had not exceeded the scope of their authority, the firm says, the court was misinterpreting its own March 1998 decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coady argues that the district court's confirmation of the arbitration award was proper. According to Coady, the calculation of his bonus required interpretation of an ambiguous term in the employment contract, a task the arbitrators were specifically empowered to engage in by both the employment contract and the district court order. Coady phrases the question facing the arbitrators this way: was Coady's compensation capped by the number announced by Ashcraft &amp; Gerel as the senior partners' draw, or did the firm have an obligation under the contract to follow its usual accounting practices to determine the cap on Coady's compensation? Coady says that the panel concluded in its February 1999 order that the cap number was not the one announced by Ashcraft in 1997, but that the actual number was yet unknown, as Coady had submitted prima facie evidence of \"a substantial straddle of income in 1997.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

The limited arbitration clause in Coady's employment agreement contains no such \"clear and unmistakable\" language; there is in fact no evidence that the parties agreed to submit the question of arbitrability to arbitration. Thus, the arbitrators' views about what is arbitrable are not given the usual leeway courts give to arbitrators. See id. at 945-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coady responds by citing the familiar doctrine that \"[a]ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\" Moses H.

Even before First Options, however, that doctrine was subject to constraints. \"So long as the arbitrator, acting within the scope of his delegated authority, is arguably construing the contract, his decision must stand.\" El Dorado Tech. Servs., 961 F.2d at 319 (emphasis added). The Federal Arbitration Act expressly provides that an award may be vacated \"[w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To use the doctrine as Coady posits would be to undermine First Options. Where the arbitrability of a dispute is to be determined by a court and the court determines that an issue is not arbitrable, the arbitrators' contrary conclusion that an issue is arbitrable carries no weight and is not entitled to deference. This is true even when the district court's order of reference is in error, as here. If the rule were otherwise, a party who did not agree to arbitrate could be locked into an arbitral award through a series of errors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court's initial order of reference determined that the employment agreement authorized arbitration only of questions of ambiguity or interpretation of the contract and that questions of breach of contract were not within the scope of the clause. See Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 107. The arbitrators were without power to enlarge upon that ruling. Some language in the order of reference, however, went beyond the district court's core holding that only issues of contract interpretation were arbitrable, and suggested to the arbitrators that they could decide the ultimate issue of the size of the bonus owed to Coady. See id. at 108 (\"[t]he calculation of the bonus is the subject of arbitration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the arbitration clause mandates that the actual calculation of Coady's bonus is subject to arbitration is, in our view, an issue of interpretation of the contractual language \"ambiguities or questions of interpretation of this contract.\" The district court's ruling was one of interpretation, which did not turn on any factual findings. Thus, we review the point de novo, see MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Exalon Indus., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752112\"><a href=\"/opinion/752112/mci-telecommunications-corp-v-exalon-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span>, 428 (1st Cir. 1998); Keystone Shipping Co. v.

When these parties wanted an arbitration clause that covered the application of contract terms to specific facts, they were capable of drafting such a clause. The arbitration clause in the 1991 \"prenuptial agreement,\" see supra note 7, applies to \"the construction, interpretation or application of this Agreement.\" Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 98 (original emphasis removed and new emphasis added); see also id. at 107 (contrasting the arbitration clause in the prenuptial agreement, which \"subjects to arbitration not simply the process of discovering and ascertaining the meaning of the contract[,] but also applying the terms of the Agreement to a specific set of facts,\" to the narrower clause in the employment agreement). At bottom, arbitration remains \"simply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a way to resolve the disputes -- but only those disputes -- that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\" First Options, 514 U.S. at 943. The employment agreement plainly manifests the parties' intent to limit arbitration to the interpretation of ambiguous contract terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stipulations presented by the law firm at the November 1998 arbitration hearings resolved the ambiguities and questions of interpretation surrounding Coady's bonus; indeed, they eliminated any dispute between Coady and the law firm on these points.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> This left no issue concerning the bonus that was within the scope of the arbitrators' authority. But, given the language in the district court's order of reference, it is understandable that the arbitrators went further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was, of course, considerable dispute about the application of the agreed-upon interpretations -- for example, whether the law firm had violated accepted accounting practices. But these issues of breach and calculation of sums were properly part of the factfinding in the D.C. court litigation, and not part of the arbitrators' task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question becomes then one of fashioning an appropriate remedy, given the status of the bonus dispute and the parallel litigation that has proceeded in the District of Columbia. We remand to the Massachusetts district court with instructions to transfer the action, including the records of the arbitral hearings that have been filed, to Judge Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. There is nothing left of the Massachusetts action, which was brought to compel arbitration. If there are to be further proceedings on the bonus issue, they should take place under the authority of the D.C. district court, which is completely familiar with legal and factual determinations made in the course of the D.C. trial, some of which may bear on the bonus dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our remand and transfer order is not based on Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's argument that the Massachusetts court erred in failing to transfer the action in April 1998. The district court, Ashcraft &amp; Gerel says, disregarded the \"first-filed rule\" and improperly applied the transfer criteria under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a), thereby dividing jurisdiction over a single dispute between federal courts in Boston and Washington, D.C. Ashcraft &amp; Gerel contends that the district court's ruling ran counter to a principal concern behind both the first-filed rule and venue transfer under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a): preventing duplication of effort and incompatible rulings. Coady defends the district court's decision, arguing that because Ashcraft &amp; Gerel was guilty of \"racing to the courthouse,\" it was not entitled to application of the first-filed rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would review the district court's decision on transfer of venue for an abuse of discretion.

Under &#167; 1404(a), a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district where it may have been brought \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a). In addition to the convenience of parties and witnesses, the factors to be considered by the court include the availability of documents; the possibility of consolidation; and the order in which the district court obtained jurisdiction. See Cianbro, 814 F.2d at 11. \"Where identical actions are proceeding concurrently in two federal courts... the first filed action is generally preferred in a choice-of-venue decision.\" Id. The burden of proof rests with the party seeking transfer; there is a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104393\"><a href=\"/opinion/104393/gulf-oil-corp-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, 508 (1947).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the decision by the district court not to transfer the action was \"primarily due to the existence of a judicial emergency in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\" Coady, 996 F. Supp. at 106 (emphasis added). This was an issue the district court introduced into the case sua sponte, the parties not having argued it. The district court apparently thought that the District of Massachusetts could handle the action better, given that it was at full strength, whereas the federal district court for the District of Columbia did not have its full complement of judges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's reliance on this factor (which is materially different from docket congestion) was error. The district court did not base its decision on undue delay to parties, but rather on the mere existence of a judicial emergency. While expressions of concern that the President and Congress fill existing judicial vacancies are appropriate in other contexts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> it has no place in determining the rights of litigants under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a), and is not \"in the interest of justice.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a). Neither constitutional nor statutory rights of parties are suspended when there are judicial vacancies in a district. We do not know whether absent this \"primary\" factor the court would have transferred the action. Nor do we need to decide whether absent that factor, the decision to refuse to transfer was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the arbitrators exceeded the scope of their authority and vacate the arbitral award. The case is now in a different posture than it was in April 1998, and the solution most consistent with the policies behind &#167; 1404(a) is to have any remaining matters addressed by Judge Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> We direct the district court to transfer this case to Judge Kollar-Kotelly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Alleging arbitrator misconduct, Ashcraft &amp; Gerel also argues that the district court erred in not vacating the award under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(3) as being fundamentally unfair.

His employment agreement, however, set a cap on his total earnings: \"[Coady] shall receive in no event any amount in total compensation for any calendar year in excess of a senior partner's draw for [the] same calendar year.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  The employment agreement provided that \"the reasonable expenses and costs of [the arbitration] will be borne by the loser.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  The court also upheld the panel's findings that Coady had not misused his firm credit card, and that the firm's partners, not Coady, had the ultimate authority over hiring in the Boston office.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  The D.C. court also ruled that the portions of the arbitration award to which Ashcraft &amp; Gerel had not objected would have preclusive effect in the D.C. litigation, including the panel's finding that Coady did not misuse his firm credit card.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  We were informed by counsel at oral argument that this decision has been appealed to the D.C.

The prenuptial agreement contains this arbitration clause: \"In the event of any dispute over the construction, interpretation, or application of this Agreement, the parties agree to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.\" (emphasis added). The terms of the prenuptial agreement are not relevant to the issues in this appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  In contrast, the court described the prenuptial agreement's arbitration clause, see supra note 7, as \"slightly broader... as it subjects to arbitration not simply the process of discovering and ascertaining the meaning of the contract[,] but also applying the terms of the Agreement to a specific set of facts.\" Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  As a result, there is no occasion to consider whether this portion of the order of reference was in error.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  The arbitral panel made the argument that Ashcraft &amp; Gerel waived its objections to the arbitrators' view of the scope of their authority through its submissions to the panel. Coady has not made that argument on appeal. Even if Coady had made that argument, it is one we reject. Parties may supplement by their submissions the authority granted an arbitration panel under a contract. See Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v. Union de Trabajadores de la Industria Gastronomica Local 610, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579482\"><a href=\"/opinion/579482/dorado-beach-hotel-corporation-v-union-de-trabajadores-de-la-industria/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1992). Having examined Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's submissions to the arbitrators and the transcripts of the arbitration hearings, we find that the firm consistently and vigorously maintained its objection to the scope of arbitration. (The D.C. district court reached the same conclusion in its June 19, 1999, ruling on Ashcraft &amp; Gerel's motion to vacate the arbitration award.)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  In retrospect, it might have been better for the law firm to have informed the Massachusetts district court at the time of its consideration of the order of reference that the firm would so stipulate.
