Appellant Giuseppe Pellerito  appeals the\r                           \r\n\ndenial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence, pursuant\r\n\nto Fed. R. Crim P. 35(a).  We affirm.\r\n\n     Pellerito raises two arguments in support of this claim.\r\n\nFirst, he asserts that his involvement in the  conspiracy for\r\n\nwhich he  was sentenced  ended before  1984 and therefore  he\r\n\nshould  have been  sentenced  in  accord  with  the  pre-1984\r\n\npenalty provisions  of 21  U.S.C.   846.   Second,  he claims\r\n\nthat,  even if his  involvement lasted beyond  November 1984,\r\n\nthe  penalty provisions of section 846 were not changed until\r\n\n1988.  Neither argument has merit.\r\n\n     Pellerito  claims that the  indictment to which  he pled\r\n\nguilty only  referred to  his involvement  in the  conspiracy\r\n\nduring  the  years  of  1978  and  1979.  However, while  the\r\n\nindictment  is not entirely clear  as to when his involvement\r\n\nin  the  conspiracy  ended,  the government  stated,  without\r\n\nobjection, at  the change  of plea  hearing that  Pellerito's\r\n\ninvolvement  lasted  \"through   1985\"  and  the   presentence\r\n\ninvestigation  report  states  that  Pellerito's  involvement\r\n\nlasted at least until the summer of 1985.\r\n\n     Pellerito also claims  that, even if his  involvement in\r\n\nthe  conspiracy  lasted  beyond November  1984,  the  penalty\r\n\nprovisions of section 846 were  not changed until 1988.  This\r\n\nclaim is without merit.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     In 1970  Congress enacted  the Comprehensive  Drug Abuse\r\n\nand Control Act.   One section of the act, now codified as 21\r\n\nU.S.C.   841, provided for up to 15  years imprisonment and a\r\n\n$25,000  fine  or   both,  for  possession  with   intent  to\r\n\ndistribute  or the distribution  of narcotic drugs.   Another\r\n\nsection, now 21  U.S.C.   846,  provided that conspiracy  for\r\n\n\"any offense in this subchapter is punishable by imprisonment\r\n\nor fine or  both which may not exceed  the maximum punishment\r\n\nprescribed for the offense,  the commission of which  was the\r\n\nobject of  the .  . .  conspiracy.\"   While  the language  of\r\n\nsection  846 was  not  changed until  1988,  section 841  was\r\n\namended in 1984  to increase the punishments to  a maximum of\r\n\n20 years and a  fine of $250,000 or  both.  Pellerito  claims\r\n\nthat,  since section  846  was not  amended  until 1988,  its\r\n\npenalty  provisions remained the same as those originally set\r\n\nin 1970, i.e.,  a maximum of 15 years imprisonment  or a fine\r                         \r\n\nof $25,000 or both.\r\n\n     According  to the Supreme  Court, \"[a]s a  general rule,\r\n\nwhere the  legislation  dealing  with  a  particular  subject\r\n\nconsists of  a system of  general provisions indicative  of a\r\n\nsettled policy,  new enactments  of a  fragmentary nature  on\r\n\nthat subject are  to be  taken as  intended to  fit into  the\r\n\nexisting system and to be carried into effect  conformably to\r\n\nit,  excepting  as  a different  purpose  is  plainly shown.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v. Jefferson  Electric Co., 291  U.S. 386, 396\r                                                     \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n(1933)  (citing   cases).  In  the  instant   case,  Congress\r\n\noriginally  enacted  sections  841  and 846  as  \"part  of  a\r\n\ncomprehensive  legislative  scheme  [the  Comprehensive  Drug\r\n\nAbuse and Control Act of 1970] designed to halt drug abuse in\r\n\nthe United  States.\"  United  States v. Baker, 609  F.2d 134,\r                                                         \r\n\n137 (5th Cir.  1980).  Pursuant to that comprehensive scheme,\r\n\nthe  punishment for  conspiracies  was  not  to  \"exceed  the\r\n\nmaximum punishment  prescribed for the offense.\"  21 U.S.C.  \r\n\n846.  The 1984 amendment, increasing penalties for violations\r\n\nof  the offense, was clearly a \"fragmentary\" enactment which,\r\n\nin turn, was designed to  halt drug trafficking.  Since there\r\n\nis no indication that Congress intended in 1984 to modify the\r\n\nprior  relation between the punishment scheme for the offense\r\n\nand  that for conspiracy, the amendment  must be carried into\r\n\neffect conformably with that scheme, i.e., the punishment for\r                                                     \r\n\nconspiracy must still  be limited to the  \"maximum punishment\r\n\nfor the offense\" which would now be 20 years imprisonment and\r\n\na $250,000 fine, or both.   Cf. United States v.  Layton, 509\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.Supp. 212, 225 (N.D.Cal.) (18 U.S.C.   1117, which provides\r\n\npunishment  for those who \"conspire to violate sections 1111,\r\n\n1114 or 1116 of this title,\" incorporates amendments to those\r\n\nsections), appeal dismissed,  645 F.2d 681 (9th  Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 452 U.S. 972 (1981)\r                  \r\n\n     Pellerito reliance on Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n381 (1980) is misplaced.  In Bifulco, the court held that the\r                                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\npenalty  provisions of   846 did not incorporate the \"special\r\n\nparole\" provisions of   841.   The court reasoned that, since\r\n\n  846  referred only to  \"imprisonment or fines,\" it  did not\r\n\nauthorize other penalties, such as special parole, which were\r\n\nneither.   This  reasoning,  however, does  not apply  to the\r\n\ninstant  case  since  the issue  here  is  \"imprisonment\" and\r\n\n\"fines\" which are specifically authorized in   846.\r\n\n     Affirmed.

In Bifulco, the court held that the\r                                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\npenalty  provisions of   846 did not incorporate the \"special\r\n\nparole\" provisions of   841.   The court reasoned that, since\r\n\n  846  referred only to  \"imprisonment or fines,\" it  did not\r\n\nauthorize other penalties, such as special parole, which were\r\n\nneither.   This  reasoning,  however, does  not apply  to the\r\n\ninstant  case  since  the issue  here  is  \"imprisonment\" and\r\n\n\"fines\" which are specifically authorized in   846.\r\n\n     Affirmed.
