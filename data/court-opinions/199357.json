Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Ramón M. González for appellant.\n     Ruth J. Vernet, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States\nAttorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant United States\nAttorney, Chief, Criminal Division, and Camille Vélez-Rivé,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        April 5, 2001\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.          Carlos Rivera-Ruiz appeals his\n\nconviction for one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine.        He also appeals his sentence of 121 months.\n\nRivera claims that the evidence presented at trial, consisting\n\nlargely of the testimony of one cooperating witness about one\n\ntransaction, was insufficient to convict him of participating in\n\na conspiracy.       He also argues that there was an impermissible\n\nvariance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof\n\noffered at trial, and that the prosecutor's closing argument\n\ndenied him due process of law.               Finally, he claims that the\n\ndistrict    court   made    an    error   in   sentencing.     Although    we\n\nacknowledge the closeness of the sufficiency issue, we affirm\n\nthe conviction and sentence.\n\n                                 I. Background\n\n           Carlos Rivera-Ruiz (\"Rivera\") was charged in count six\n\nof a ten-count indictment charging various individuals with\n\nviolations of federal drug laws.            While some of the other counts\n\ncharged    substantive     drug    offenses,    Rivera   was   charged   with\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f841(a)(1)1   and   846.2   The   indictment   alleged   that   Rivera,\n\ntogether with Jaime Padilla Rodríguez (\"Padilla\"), Jorge Arroyo-\n\nRivera (\"Arroyo\"), and two unindicted co-conspirators,3 conspired\n\nto possess and distribute cocaine.     All of the other individuals\n\nnamed in the indictment pled guilty.    Trial for Rivera commenced\n\nin mid-September, 1997.     Following a three-day trial, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict of guilty.     The court sentenced Rivera to 121\n\nmonths in prison.\n\n               II. The Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          Rivera moved for a judgment of acquittal after the\n\ngovernment rested and again at the close of all the evidence.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.    The district court denied that motion,\n\nand we review that ruling de novo.            See United States v.\n\nHernández, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).      In considering the\n\nevidence presented at trial, we view the facts and draw all\n\n\n\n     121 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) provides that \"it shall be unlawful\nfor any person knowingly or intentionally . . . to manufacture,\ndistribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture,\ndistribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\"\n     2 21 U.S.C. § 846 provides: \"Any person who attempts or\nconspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall\nbe subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the\noffense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt\nor conspiracy.\"\n     3Unindicted co-conspirator No. 1 was identified as William\nNegrón Zapata (\"Negrón\"), and unindicted co-conspirator No. 2\nwas identified as Víctor Ramírez de Arellano (\"Ramírez\").\n\n                                 -3-\n\freasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution.              See United\n\nStates v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 678 (1st Cir. 2000).              We have\n\na limited role in reviewing this evidence.\n\n           An    appellate    court    plays    a   very\n           circumscribed    role    in    gauging    the\n           sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation\n           upon which a criminal conviction rests. The\n           court   of   appeals   neither    weighs  the\n           credibility of the witnesses nor attempts to\n           assess whether the prosecution succeeded in\n           eliminating every possible theory consistent\n           with the defendant's innocence.\n\n\nUnited States v.       Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).    Our inquiry is only whether \"the guilty verdict finds\n\nsupport in a 'plausible rendition of the record.'\" United States\n\nv. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\nA. The Evidence\n\n           The evidence presented by the government at Rivera's\n\ntrial consisted largely of the testimony of William Negrón\n\nZapata, who testified that he met Rivera in 1986 through a\n\nmutual friend, Ricardo Maldonado.           He further stated that he saw\n\nRivera on several occasions in 1986, as well as in 1990.               The\n\ntwo would meet at Rivera's home, and Negrón stated that Rivera\n\nsometimes visited him at his automobile repair shop which he\n\noperated    out   of    his   home.         He   successfully   identified\n\n                                      -4-\n\fphotographs of property owned by Rivera at trial and knew that\n\nRivera also ran an automobile repair shop out of his home.\n\n              Regarding the transactions charged in the indictment,\n\nNegrón testified that he agreed to purchase two kilograms of\n\ncocaine on April 15, 1991 from Amador Irizarry Sanabria, a man\n\nhe had known since 1989 and had purchased drugs from on prior\n\noccasions.       Negrón paid him a total of $26,000 for the drugs, or\n\n$13,000 for each kilogram.         Jaime Padilla Rodríguez, a friend of\n\nIrizarry's, arrived at Negrón's house that day to deliver the\n\ncocaine.       Because Negrón had customers in his auto repair shop\n\nwhen Padilla arrived, he asked Padilla to leave and follow a\n\nspecified road to a point where they could exchange the cocaine\n\nmore       privately.    Padilla   complied   with   these    instructions.\n\nNegrón, accompanied by his personal bodyguard, Jorge Arroyo\n\nRivera, met Padilla at the specified location and collected the\n\npackage of cocaine.4\n\n              After obtaining the two kilograms of cocaine from\n\nIrizarry,       Negrón   contacted    his   friend   Víctor    Ramírez   de\n\nArellano, an attorney.         Negrón first met Ramírez in December\n\n1989 when he retained him          to represent his uncle in a criminal\n\nmatter.        Ramírez had purchased drugs from Negrón on several\n\n\n       4\n       Negrón's testimony regarding this transaction was not\ncorroborated by other witnesses. Padilla died in 1996, one year\nbefore the trial.\n\n                                     -5-\n\foccasions beginning in February 1991.          On April 15, Ramírez\n\nagreed to buy one kilogram of cocaine for $13,500.             Ramírez\n\ncorroborated Negrón's account of this transaction at trial.\n\n          Negrón also called Rivera on the afternoon of April 15,\n\nand Rivera agreed to buy the other kilogram of cocaine from him\n\nfor $13,500.       The two agreed that they would meet at Rivera's\n\nhouse at the Anones Ward in Las Marías the following morning.\n\nThe prosecution did not offer a record of this phone call at\n\ntrial, and Negrón testified on cross-examination that he did not\n\nremember what phone he used to place the call.         Early on April\n\n16, Negrón arrived at Rivera's home, unaccompanied, and gave him\n\nthe   drugs   in   exchange   for   $13,500.   He   stated   that   this\n\ntransaction occurred in a living room on the first floor of\n\nRivera's house and that only he and Rivera were present when\n\nthey exchanged the drugs.\n\n          After leaving Rivera's house, Negrón called Padilla\n\nfrom his cellular phone and asked him to bring an additional two\n\nkilograms of cocaine from Irizarry.       As before, Padilla arrived\n\nat Negrón's home and auto shop and the two then left separately\n\nto meet at the same specified location.         Negrón gave Padilla\n\n$26,000 for the two kilograms of cocaine he had received the day\n\nbefore, and Padilla gave him an additional two kilograms.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          Negrón sold one kilogram to Roberto Rivera Ortiz, to\n\nwhom he had sold cocaine on several prior occasions.            He sold\n\nthe other kilogram to Ramírez the following morning, April 17.\n\nRamírez testified that he then sold the cocaine to two other\n\npeople.   Padilla   arrived   at    Negrón's   house   to   collect   the\n\n$26,000 payment for the cocaine after Negrón made these sales.\n\n\n\n          Negrón's testimony about his drug transactions in April\n\n1991 was uncorroborated, except by Ramírez who corroborated\n\nNegrón's account of their two transactions.        However, Negrón's\n\ntestimony was also uncontradicted.       The only witness offered by\n\nRivera was Ramonita Malavé, his ex-wife.        The two were married\n\nfor 18 years and divorced in 1989, two years prior to the events\n\ndescribed in the indictment.       Malavé testified that a man named\n\nJosé López, together with his family, was renting the first\n\nfloor of the home owned by Rivera where Negrón alleged that the\n\ntransfer of cocaine had occurred.        She stated that López moved\n\nfrom the first floor of the home to the second floor sometime\n\nafter April 1991, but she was uncertain of the exact date when\n\nquestioned on cross-examination.         Malavé also testified that\n\nRivera was able to purchase and maintain several properties\n\nbecause of the rents he collected and the income he earned from\n\nhis automobile repair shop.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fB. Applicable Principles\n\n             To establish Rivera's guilt on the conspiracy charge,\n\nthe government needed to show \"the existence of a conspiracy,\n\nthe defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's\n\nvoluntary participation in the conspiracy.\"                     United States v.\n\nMorillo, 158 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 1998).                 Rivera conceded, both\n\nbelow and on appeal, that a conspiracy to distribute cocaine\n\nexisted.      He    only    disputes      his     own   involvement   with      that\n\nconspiracy.\n\n             Rivera's voluntary participation in the conspiracy\n\ncould have been demonstrated by evidence that he intended to\n\nenter into an agreement with the other parties to the conspiracy\n\nand   that   he    intended    \"to   effectuate         the   commission   of    the\n\nsubstantive offense.\"          United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 615\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).       \"The agreement itself 'need not be express,\n\nbut   may    consist   of     no   more    than    a    tacit   understanding.'\"\n\nEcheverri, 982 F.2d at 679 (quoting United States v. Glover, 814\n\nF.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1987)).             The proof of Rivera's involvement\n\nin the conspiracy \"may consist of indirect evidence, including\n\nreasonable inferences drawn from attendant circumstances.\"                       Id.\n\n             In determining whether a single conspiracy exists, we\n\nhave considered whether the participants shared a common goal.\n\nSee United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fThe common goal of selling cocaine for profit satisfies this\n\nelement. See id.     We have also examined whether there was\n\noverlap among the participants to the conspiracy.   See id.   Such\n\noverlap exists where a conspiracy is marked by the \"pervasive\n\ninvolvement of a single 'core conspirator,'\" or \"hub character.\"\n\nId. (quoting United States v. Wilson, 116 F.3d 1066, 1076 (5th\n\nCir. 1997)).\n\n         There is no need for a conspirator to know the other\n\nparticipants in the conspiracy.   See United States v. Sepúlveda,\n\n15 F.3d 1161, 1191 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Nueva, 979\n\nF.2d 880, 884 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[T]he government need not prove\n\nthat the defendant knew all the details or all the members of\n\nthe conspiracy.\").   Additionally, there is no requirement that\n\na conspirator realize the full extent of the conspiracy to be\n\nfound guilty.   See United States v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 770\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).   As we said in Portela, the requisite level of\n\ninterdependence among conspirators exists where the defendant\n\nrealized that the success of his own drug   transactions depended\n\non the ability of others to obtain drugs from suppliers and to\n\nsell them for profit to other purchasers:\n\n         [T]here was sufficient evidence for the jury\n         to conclude that [the appellant] understood\n         that his transaction's success depended on\n         the   health   of   the   trafficking    and\n         distribution network focused around [the\n         seller of drugs], which in turn depended on\n\n                              -9-\n\f           continued transactions between [the seller]\n           and other suppliers.   Although these other\n           suppliers were perhaps unknown individually\n           to [the appellant], the jury could have\n           reasonably inferred that he must have been\n           aware of their existence.\n\nPortela, 167 F.3d at 697.         Ultimately, our analysis of whether\n\nRivera was part of a conspiracy does not rest on any particular\n\nelement because \"this court has looked beyond any . . . lists of\n\nfactors to the 'totality of the evidence' in determining whether\n\nthere is factual support for a finding of a single conspiracy.\"\n\nId. at 696 (quoting United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1984)).\n\nC. Applying the Principles to the Evidence\n\n           1. Transaction between Negrón and Rivera\n\n           Rivera claims that Negrón's uncorroborated testimony\n\nregarding the single transaction between them is unreliable\n\nbecause   Negrón    agreed   to    cooperate    with   the   government.\n\nHowever, credibility determinations are uniquely within the\n\nprovince of the jury, and we do not evaluate those judgments on\n\nappeal.   See Woodward, 149 F.3d at 56.        Moreover, Rivera's trial\n\ncounsel subjected Negrón to lengthy cross-examination about his\n\ncooperation with the government and his other drug transactions.\n\nDespite these efforts to impeach Negrón, the jury could have\n\nrationally concluded that Negrón was telling the truth about his\n\nsale of cocaine to Rivera.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           Rivera also attempted to contradict this testimony by\n\noffering   the   testimony   of   his    ex-wife,   Malavé,   that   his\n\nresidence was occupied by a tenant at the time of the alleged\n\ntransaction.     However, the jury could reasonably have found\n\nNegrón's testimony to be more credible than Malavé's.         Malavé's\n\nrecollection of the relevant dates was uncertain, especially on\n\ncross-examination, and Rivera's attorney even conceded in his\n\nclosing argument that Malavé's testimony had been \"all over the\n\nplace.\"\n\n           Rivera further contends that, even if the jury found\n\ncredible Negrón's uncorroborated testimony that Negrón sold\n\ncocaine to him, this single transaction cannot, as a matter of\n\nlaw, establish his guilt of the crime of conspiracy.          We agree\n\nthat a single drug transaction for the personal use of the\n\npurchaser, without prearrangement or other factors indicative of\n\nconspiratorial intent, does not establish a conspiracy.              See\n\nUnited States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1304 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nNonetheless, we have found, under certain circumstances, that\n\none drug transaction may provide sufficient evidence for a jury\n\nto find the existence of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.\n\nSee, e.g., Portela, 167 F.3d at 698 (\"The evidence . . . was\n\nthus sufficient to have led a reasonable jury to conclude that\n\n[the defendant] was a party to a tacit agreement relating to\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f[the seller's] entire continuing enterprise, despite the fact\n\nthat there was only a single transaction between them.\"); Moran,\n\n984 F.2d at 1303 (\"Even a single sale for resale, embroidered\n\nwith evidence suggesting a joint undertaking between buyer and\n\nseller, could suffice.\");         United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d\n\n21, 27 (1st Cir. 1986).      Drawing on the body of conspiracy law\n\nwe have just described, we evaluate the circumstances that\n\nsupport the conspiracy conviction.\n\n           2. Knowing participation in a conspiracy to possess\n           with intent to distribute cocaine\n\n           Negrón admitted that he sold cocaine for profit, and\n\nhe testified that he sold one kilogram of cocaine to Rivera.\n\nSuch a large quantity of drugs supports the inference that\n\nRivera did not intend to use the cocaine merely for personal\n\nconsumption,     but   rather      intended    to    acquire      it   for\n\nredistribution.    See United States v. Jesús-Ríos, 990 F.2d 672,\n\n680 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Geer, 923 F.2d 892, 895\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (\"The jury could infer the fact of a conspiracy\n\nto distribute drugs from the quantities of cocaine and hashish\n\ninvolved   -   quantities   far    larger   than   needed   for   personal\n\nuse.\").    The inference that Rivera's purchase was for resale is\n\nstrengthened by Ramírez's testimony that Ramírez resold the one\n\nkilogram of cocaine he purchased from Negrón.\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f            Rivera's    cash   payment   of   $13,500    to   Negrón   also\n\nsupports an inference that Rivera was engaged in the business of\n\nbuying and selling cocaine.      Negrón testified that Rivera agreed\n\nto purchase the cocaine on the afternoon of April 15.            Slightly\n\nmore than twelve hours later, in the early morning of April 16,\n\nRivera gave Negrón $13,500 in exchange for the drugs.                   The\n\nability to gather such a large amount of cash overnight supports\n\nan   inference   that   Rivera   was   more   than   a   one-time,   casual\n\npurchaser of cocaine.     That inference draws further support from\n\nthe promptness of Negrón's phone call to Rivera after coming\n\ninto possession of the cocaine.           Negrón did not make random\n\ncalls.    He called Ramírez, to whom he had sold drugs on several\n\noccasions, and Rivera, whom he knew.            As the government said\n\nduring its closing argument: \"This is not a supermarket where\n\nyou go and you select the product that you want.              If you want\n\ndrugs you have to know where to get them and who sells them\n\nbecause William Negrón Zapata would not sell you or any one of\n\nyou any drugs unless he knew that you were in the same business\n\nhe was.\"5\n\n\n\n\n      5Although Rivera claims on appeal that this was improper\nargument, inviting the jury to convict Rivera \"merely as a\nresult of knowing Negrón-Zapata,\" we find that this was a fair\nargument given the evidence presented.\n\n                                  -13-\n\f             Additionally, there was evidence that Rivera owned\n\nmultiple properties in Puerto Rico.               As the government argues,\n\nit    is   reasonable    to    question     the   source    of    this   wealth,\n\nparticularly because Rivera's automobile shop in his home was\n\nnot likely to generate the quantity of cash Rivera had available\n\nto purchase cocaine from Negrón.6            A reasonable jury could find,\n\non these facts, that Rivera's income was supplemented by money\n\nhe earned from buying cocaine and selling it for profit.\n\n             There is ample evidence, in short, that Rivera and\n\nNegrón shared the common objective of buying and selling cocaine\n\nfor   profit,   agreed    on    a   transaction     for    that    purpose,     and\n\ncarried it out.    See Portela, 167 F.3d at 695.             This transaction\n\nwas    far   different    than      the   \"unplanned      spot    sale   with    no\n\nagreement beyond that inherent in the sale\" noted in                      Moran.\n\nMoran, 984 F.2d at 1302.              \"[W]here advanced plans are made\n\nregarding the sale of narcotics in wholesale quantities, the\n\n\n       6\n       Rivera objects to the government's comment, in closing\nargument,   about   his   ownership    of   these   properties.\nSpecifically, he contends that the following comments by the\nprosecutor were misleading and may have led the jury to convict\nhim for an improper reason: \"The defendant, you know from the\nevidence, is the owner of at least four structures . . . . And\nwhat is the occupation of the defendant? Mechanic body repair\nshop. How many people do you know who own a mechanic shop, auto\nbody repair shop, you see them all over the island, that own\nfour houses. . . . Look at that house.        Big.   Commercial\nantennas, solar system. The works. What a house. Two stories.\nWe know that he owns a house. Good.\" There was no error in\nthis closing argument, which was based on the evidence.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fparticipants in the transaction may be presumed to know that\n\nthey are part of a broader conspiracy.\" United States v. Harris,\n\n8 F.3d 943, 946 (2d Cir. 1993) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n              With     respect      to    that     broader    conspiracy,      Ramírez\n\ntestified that he and Negrón engaged in cocaine transactions on\n\nnumerous occasions, and Negrón provided the details of his sale\n\nof   cocaine     to    Rivera.          Negrón     also   testified    that    he    had\n\n\"participated in endless numbers of drug transactions with Mr.\n\nAmador [Irizarry]\"7 prior to 1991.                  Negrón and Rivera had known\n\neach other since 1986 and met on several occasions in 1990.\n\nThese       contacts       over    a     several     year    period    provided       an\n\nopportunity for Rivera to know of Negrón's involvement in other\n\ndrug       transactions,        particularly       because    Negrón    had    a    long\n\nhistory as a drug dealer.                  Indeed, Negrón's familiarity with\n\nRivera is demonstrated by the fact that Negrón chose not to\n\nbring his bodyguard with him when he delivered the cocaine to\n\nRivera,      although      he     did    bring   his   bodyguard      along   when    he\n\nreceived      the    two    kilograms       of   cocaine     from   Padilla.        This\n\nroutine quality of Rivera and Negrón's one kilogram transaction\n\nin April 1991 supports an inference of Rivera's awareness of\n\nNegrón's      involvement         with    these     other    transactions.          This\n\n\n\n       7\n       For unexplained reasons, the indictment did not allege\nthat Irizarry was part of this conspiracy.\n\n                                           -15-\n\fknowledge,       coupled    with    Rivera's    cash     purchase         of       a   large\n\nquantity of cocaine for resale, suffices to establish that\n\nRivera     was   aware     that    his   purchase    was      part    of       a       larger\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine, and that he furthered the\n\npurpose of that conspiracy with his purchase.                     That Rivera did\n\nnot    fully     understand       the    details    of   Negrón's          many          drug\n\ntransactions is of no import.            See Walters, 904 F.2d at 771 (\"It\n\nis not necessary that the government prove that the defendant .\n\n. . knew the extent of the conspiracy.\").                Thus, a rational jury\n\ncould have concluded that Rivera tacitly acquiesced in the\n\nscheme of Negrón and the other co-conspirators to distribute\n\ncocaine for profit when he purchased the kilogram from Negrón.\n\nSuch a tacit understanding is sufficient for Rivera to be guilty\n\nof conspiracy.       See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.\n\n            Rivera relies on our decision in United States v.\n\nDeLutis, 722 F.2d 902 (1st Cir. 1983), to support his contention\n\nthat   a   single    act     is    insufficient     to     hold      an    individual\n\ncriminally accountable for conspiracy.                   In   DeLutis, however,\n\nthere was no drug transaction, no evidence of an intent to sell\n\nthe defendant a large quantity of cocaine, and only an inference\n\nthat the defendant intended to buy an undetermined amount of\n\ncocaine.     See 722 F.2d at 907.           Still, we reaffirm the general\n\nproposition advanced in DeLutis that \"a single sale of drugs\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fwithout more does not establish a conspiracy.\"                  Id. at 906.\n\nHere there was enough additional evidence to establish the\n\nconspiracy    charged   and     to     withstand     Rivera's   sufficiency\n\nchallenge.\n\n                  III. Amendment to the Indictment\n\n         Rivera     argues     that    he    was   prejudiced   because    the\n\ngovernment, prior to trial, amended the indictment to correct a\n\nclerical error.    In the overt acts charged under Count VI, the\n\nconspiracy    charge,   the    government      amended   the    language    to\n\nsubstitute \"UCC No. 1\" for \"UCC No. 2,\" and vice versa, in every\n\nparagraph except one.         In other words, the indictment wrongly\n\nreferred to Negrón, UCC No. 1, as UCC No. 2 in the description\n\nof the overt acts, and similarly referred to Ramírez, UCC No. 2,\n\nas UCC No. 1.    The correction simply required a substitution of\n\n\"No. 1\" for \"No. 2\" and \"No. 2\" for \"No. 1.\"                Rivera has not\n\nexplained how this correction failed to give him notice of the\n\nconspiracy charge against him.         Moreover, the government was not\n\neven required to prove any overt acts in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.     See Portela, 167 F.3d at 702.             Thus, correcting\n\nthis clerical error did not deprive Rivera of notice of the\n\ncharge against him.\n\n                               IV. Variance\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f           In a claim closely related to his claim about the\n\namendment to the indictment, Rivera argues that his conviction\n\nshould be vacated because there was a variance between the\n\nconduct alleged in the indictment and the proof offered at\n\ntrial.   \"To be sufficient grounds for reversal, a variance must\n\nbe severe enough to affect the defendant's substantial rights.\"\n\nPortela, 167 F.3d at 700.      We review this question de novo.           See\n\nid.\n\n           As   we   just   explained,   the    government   amended      the\n\nindictment prior to trial to exchange the words \"UCC No. 1\" for\n\n\"UCC No. 2\" in the description of the overt acts, except for\n\nparagraph four of that description, which remained unchanged.\n\nThe relevant portions of the corrected indictment, described as\n\nthe   overt   acts   in   furtherance    of    the   conspiracy,   read    as\n\nfollows:\n\n           3.   On  or   about   April   15,  1991   at\n           approximately 7:30 p.m., UCC No. 1 called\n           Carlos Rivera-Ruiz to offer him one (1)\n           kilogram of cocaine for the price of\n           thirteen thousand five hundred dollars\n           ($13,500.00). Rivera-Ruiz agreed and on the\n           following date April 16, 1991 UCC No. 1\n           delivered to Rivera-Ruiz one (1) kilogram of\n           cocaine located at Road 4406, Anones ward,\n           Las Marías, Puerto Rico.\n           4.   On  or   about   April   16,  1991   at\n           approximately 8:00 a.m., UCC No. 1 sold and\n           delivered to Carlos Rivera-Ruiz one (1)\n           kilogram of cocaine and was paid for\n           thirteen thousand five hundred dollars\n           ($13,500.00).\n\n                                  -18-\n\fRivera argues that paragraphs three and four of the amended\n\nindictment charge him with purchasing two kilograms of cocaine\n\nfrom Negrón, while the evidence presented at trial established\n\nonly that he purchased one kilogram.\n\n         We reject this claim.     Based on a reasonable reading\n\nof paragraphs three and four, we conclude that the purchase of\n\none kilogram of cocaine on the morning of April 16 is simply\n\ndescribed twice.    The indictment does not allege two separate\n\npurchases.   There was no variance.      Moreover, as noted, the\n\nprosecution was not required to prove overt acts in order to\n\nestablish Rivera's guilt on the conspiracy charge.   See Portela,\n\n167 F.3d at 702.      Thus, even if we were to adopt Rivera's\n\nstrained reading of paragraphs three and four, that reading\n\nwould not warrant reversal of his conviction because such an\n\nerror in the recitation of the overt acts did not affect his\n\nsubstantial rights.\n\n                       V. Closing Arguments\n\n         Rivera contends that the prosecutor deprived him of due\n\nprocess of law by making several improper remarks during his\n\nclosing argument.     Specifically, he identifies four comments\n\nthat he claims could have led the jury to convict him on an\n\nimproper basis.    Because Rivera did not object to these comments\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fat trial, we review his claim for plain error.                     See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 52(b); see also United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n731 (1993); United States v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 681 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     To correct the alleged error, \"we must conclude\n\nthat there was error, that the error was plain, and that it\n\naffected the substantial rights of the defendant.\"              Baldyga, 233\n\nF.3d at 681.     We may find that the allegedly improper remarks\n\naffected Rivera's substantial rights only if we conclude that\n\nthe   prosecutor's   comments      affected    the    outcome      of    Rivera's\n\ntrial.     See id. at 682.\n\n            As we noted in our discussion of the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, Rivera objects to one comment about his ownership of\n\nmultiple properties and to another comment where the prosecutor\n\nargued that Negrón would not have called Rivera if the two men\n\nwere not in the same business (\"the supermarket comment\").                      We\n\nhave already ruled that there was nothing improper about these\n\nremarks.      Although    Rivera   quotes     the    other   two    challenged\n\nremarks at length in his brief, we need not discuss these\n\npassages     separately    because     we     are    convinced          that   the\n\nprosecutor's closing argument did not affect the outcome of\n\nRivera's trial, and hence there was no plain error in the\n\nremarks.\n\n                             VI. Sentencing\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f           Finally, Rivera appeals the sentence of 121 months\n\nimposed    by   the   district   court,   arguing   that   the   court\n\nerroneously based this sentence on the understanding that Rivera\n\npurchased two kilograms of cocaine, rather than only one.           We\n\nreview this claim for plain error because Rivera did not object\n\nat the time of sentencing.       See United States v. Torres-Rosa,\n\n209 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 2000).          Because we find that Rivera\n\nfaced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years regardless of\n\nthe amount of cocaine for which he was held accountable, see 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B),8 we conclude that there was no plain\n\nerror.\n\n           More than one year prior to trial, the government filed\n\nan information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851 9 to establish that\n\nRivera had a prior conviction for importing cocaine into Puerto\n\nRico.    The document served to notify Rivera that the prosecution\n\nintended to seek an increased sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(B) because of this prior conviction.            Thus, as\n\n\n    8 Section 841(b)(1)(B) provides: \"If any person commits such\na violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense\nhas become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment which may not be less than 10 years.\"\n    9  Section 851 provides, in pertinent part: \"No person who\nstands convicted of an offense under this part shall be\nsentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior\nconvictions, unless before trial . . . the United States\nattorney files an information with the court . . . stating in\nwriting the previous convictions to be relied upon.\"\n\n                                 -21-\n\fRivera concedes in his brief to this court, he faced a mandatory\n\nminimum   sentence    of    ten   years   regardless       of    the   amount   of\n\ncocaine attributed to him by the sentencing court.                 Accordingly,\n\nhis challenge to the amount of cocaine attributed to him is\n\nirrelevant to his sentence.        See, e.g., United States v. Tavano,\n\n12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"It is unnecessary to address\n\na   dispute   over   drug   quantity      if,   and   to   the    extent   that,\n\nadjudicating it will not . . . bring a different mandatory\n\nminimum sentence into play.\").\n\n           Judgment and Sentence Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\f",

He also argues that there was an impermissible variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof offered at trial, and that the prosecutor's closing argument denied him due process of law.

Although we acknowledge the closeness of the sufficiency issue, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carlos Rivera-Ruiz (\"Rivera\") was charged in count six of a ten-count indictment charging various individuals with violations of federal drug laws. While some of the other counts charged substantive drug offenses, Rivera was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The indictment alleged that Rivera, together with Jaime Padilla Rodriguez (\"Padilla\"), Jorge Arroyo-Rivera (\"Arroyo\"), and two unindicted co-conspirators,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> conspired to possess and distribute cocaine. All of the other individuals named in the indictment pled guilty. Trial for Rivera commenced in mid-September, 1997. Following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The court sentenced Rivera to 121 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera moved for a judgment of acquittal after the government rested and again at the close of all the evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. The district court denied that motion, and we review that ruling de novo. See United States v. Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998). In considering the evidence presented at trial, we view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution. See United States v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 678 (1st Cir. 2000). We have a limited role in reviewing this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court plays a very circumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.

Our inquiry is only whether \"the guilty verdict finds support in a 'plausible rendition of the record.'\" United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v.

The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented by the government at Rivera's trial consisted largely of the testimony of William Negron Zapata, who testified that he met Rivera in 1986 through a mutual friend, Ricardo Maldonado. He further stated that he saw Rivera on several occasions in 1986, as well as in 1990. The two would meet at Rivera's home, and Negron stated that Rivera sometimes visited him at his automobile repair shop which he operated out of his home. He successfully identified photographs of property owned by Rivera at trial and knew that Rivera also ran an automobile repair shop out of his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the transactions charged in the indictment, Negron testified that he agreed to purchase two kilograms of cocaine on April 15, 1991 from Amador Irizarry Sanabria, a man he had known since 1989 and had purchased drugs from on prior occasions. Negron paid him a total of $26,000 for the drugs, or $13,000 for each kilogram. Jaime Padilla Rodriguez, a friend of Irizarry's, arrived at Negron's house that day to deliver the cocaine. Because Negron had customers in his auto repair shop when Padilla arrived, he asked Padilla to leave and follow a specified road to a point where they could exchange the cocaine more privately. Padilla complied with these instructions. Negron, accompanied by his personal bodyguard, Jorge Arroyo Rivera, met Padilla at the specified location and collected the package of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After obtaining the two kilograms of cocaine from Irizarry, Negron contacted his friend Victor Ramirez de Arellano, an attorney. Negron first met Ramirez in December 1989 when he retained him to represent his uncle in a criminal matter. Ramirez had purchased drugs from Negron on several occasions beginning in February 1991. On April 15, Ramirez agreed to buy one kilogram of cocaine for $13,500. Ramirez corroborated Negron's account of this transaction at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron also called Rivera on the afternoon of April 15, and Rivera agreed to buy the other kilogram of cocaine from him for $13,500. The two agreed that they would meet at Rivera's house at the Anones Ward in Las Marias the following morning. The prosecution did not offer a record of this phone call at trial, and Negron testified on cross-examination that he did not remember what phone he used to place the call. Early on April 16, Negron arrived at Rivera's home, unaccompanied, and gave him the drugs in exchange for $13,500. He stated that this transaction occurred in a living room on the first floor of Rivera's house and that only he and Rivera were present when they exchanged the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving Rivera's house, Negron called Padilla from his cellular phone and asked him to bring an additional two kilograms of cocaine from Irizarry. As before, Padilla arrived at Negron's home and auto shop and the two then left separately to meet at the same specified location. Negron gave Padilla $26,000 for the two kilograms of cocaine he had received the day before, and Padilla gave him an additional two kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron sold one kilogram to Roberto Rivera Ortiz, to whom he had sold cocaine on several prior occasions. He sold the other kilogram to Ramirez the following morning, April 17. Ramirez testified that he then sold the cocaine to two other people. Padilla arrived at Negron's house to collect the $26,000 payment for the cocaine after Negron made these sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron's testimony about his drug transactions in April 1991 was uncorroborated, except by Ramirez who corroborated Negron's account of their two transactions. However, Negron's testimony was also uncontradicted. The only witness offered by Rivera was Ramonita Malave, his ex-wife. The two were married for 18 years and divorced in 1989, two years prior to the events described in the indictment. Malave testified that a man named Jose Lopez, together with his family, was renting the first floor of the home owned by Rivera where Negron alleged that the transfer of cocaine had occurred. She stated that Lopez moved from the first floor of the home to the second floor sometime after April 1991, but she was uncertain of the exact date when questioned on cross-examination. Malave also testified that Rivera was able to purchase and maintain several properties because of the rents he collected and the income he earned from his automobile repair shop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Applicable Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish Rivera's guilt on the conspiracy charge, the government needed to show \"the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" United States v. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 1998). Rivera conceded, both below and on appeal, that a conspiracy to distribute cocaine existed. He only disputes his own involvement with that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera's voluntary participation in the conspiracy could have been demonstrated by evidence that he intended to enter into an agreement with the other parties to the conspiracy and that he intended \"to effectuate the commission of the substantive offense.\" United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 615 (1st Cir. 1994). \"The agreement itself 'need not be express, but may consist of no more than a tacit understanding.'\" Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679 (quoting United States v. Glover, 814 F.2d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1987)). The proof of Rivera's involvement in the conspiracy \"may consist of indirect evidence, including reasonable inferences drawn from attendant circumstances.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a single conspiracy exists, we have considered whether the participants shared a common goal. See United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 695 (1st Cir. 1999). The common goal of selling cocaine for profit satisfies this element. See id. We have also examined whether there was overlap among the participants to the conspiracy. See id. Such overlap exists where a conspiracy is marked by the \"pervasive involvement of a single 'core conspirator,'\" or \"hub character.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Wilson, 116 F.3d 1066, 1076 (5th Cir. 1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need for a conspirator to know the other participants in the conspiracy. See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1191 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880, 884 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[T]he government need not prove that the defendant knew all the details or all the members of the conspiracy.\"). Additionally, there is no requirement that a conspirator realize the full extent of the conspiracy to be found guilty. See United States v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1990). As we said in Portela, the requisite level of interdependence among conspirators exists where the defendant realized that the success of his own drug transactions depended on the ability of others to obtain drugs from suppliers and to sell them for profit to other purchasers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that [the appellant] understood that his transaction's success depended on the health of the trafficking and distribution network focused around [the seller of drugs], which in turn depended on continued transactions between [the seller] and other suppliers. Although these other suppliers were perhaps unknown individually to [the appellant], the jury could have reasonably inferred that he must have been aware of their existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Portela, 167 F.3d at 697. Ultimately, our analysis of whether Rivera was part of a conspiracy does not rest on any particular element because \"this court has looked beyond any . . . lists of factors to the 'totality of the evidence' in determining whether there is factual support for a finding of a single conspiracy.\" Id. at 696 (quoting United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Applying the Principles to the Evidence</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Transaction between Negron and Rivera</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera claims that Negron's uncorroborated testimony regarding the single transaction between them is unreliable because Negron agreed to cooperate with the government. However, credibility determinations are uniquely within the province of the jury, and we do not evaluate those judgments on appeal. See Woodward, 149 F.3d at 56. Moreover, Rivera's trial counsel subjected Negron to lengthy cross-examination about his cooperation with the government and his other drug transactions. Despite these efforts to impeach Negron, the jury could have rationally concluded that Negron was telling the truth about his sale of cocaine to Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera also attempted to contradict this testimony by offering the testimony of his ex-wife, Malave, that his residence was occupied by a tenant at the time of the alleged transaction. However, the jury could reasonably have found Negron's testimony to be more credible than Malave's. Malave's recollection of the relevant dates was uncertain, especially on cross-examination, and Rivera's attorney even conceded in his closing argument that Malave's testimony had been \"all over the place.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera further contends that, even if the jury found credible Negron's uncorroborated testimony that Negron sold cocaine to him, this single transaction cannot, as a matter of law, establish his guilt of the crime of conspiracy. We agree that a single drug transaction for the personal use of the purchaser, without prearrangement or other factors indicative of conspiratorial intent, does not establish a conspiracy. SeeUnited States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1304 (1st Cir. 1993). Nonetheless, we have found, under certain circumstances, that one drug transaction may provide sufficient evidence for a jury to find the existence of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. See, e.g., Portela, 167 F.3d at 698 (\"The evidence . . . was thus sufficient to have led a reasonable jury to conclude that [the defendant] was a party to a tacit agreement relating to [the seller's] entire continuing enterprise, despite the fact that there was only a single transaction between them.\"); Moran, 984 F.2d at 1303 (\"Even a single sale for resale, embroidered with evidence suggesting a joint undertaking between buyer and seller, could suffice.\"); United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 1986). Drawing on the body of conspiracy law we have just described, we evaluate the circumstances that support the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Knowing participation in a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron admitted that he sold cocaine for profit, and he testified that he sold one kilogram of cocaine to Rivera. Such a large quantity of drugs supports the inference that Rivera did not intend to use the cocaine merely for personal consumption, but rather intended to acquire it for redistribution. See United States v. Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 680 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Geer, 923 F.2d 892, 895 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"The jury could infer the fact of a conspiracy to distribute drugs from the quantities of cocaine and hashish involved - quantities far larger than needed for personal use.\"). The inference that Rivera's purchase was for resale is strengthened by Ramirez's testimony that Ramirez resold the one kilogram of cocaine he purchased from Negron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera's cash payment of $13,500 to Negron also supports an inference that Rivera was engaged in the business of buying and selling cocaine. Negron testified that Rivera agreed to purchase the cocaine on the afternoon of April 15. Slightly more than twelve hours later, in the early morning of April 16, Rivera gave Negron $13,500 in exchange for the drugs. The ability to gather such a large amount of cash overnight supports an inference that Rivera was more than a one-time, casual purchaser of cocaine. That inference draws further support from the promptness of Negron's phone call to Rivera after coming into possession of the cocaine. Negron did not make random calls. He called Ramirez, to whom he had sold drugs on several occasions, and Rivera, whom he knew. As the government said during its closing argument: \"This is not a supermarket where you go and you select the product that you want. If you want drugs you have to know where to get them and who sells them because William Negron Zapata would not sell you or any one of you any drugs unless he knew that you were in the same business he was.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, there was evidence that Rivera owned multiple properties in Puerto Rico. As the government argues, it is reasonable to question the source of this wealth, particularly because Rivera's automobile shop in his home was not likely to generate the quantity of cash Rivera had available to purchase cocaine from Negron.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> A reasonable jury could find, on these facts, that Rivera's income was supplemented by money he earned from buying cocaine and selling it for profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample evidence, in short, that Rivera and Negron shared the common objective of buying and selling cocaine for profit, agreed on a transaction for that purpose, and carried it out. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 695. This transaction was far different than the \"unplanned spot sale with no agreement beyond that inherent in the sale\" noted in Moran. Moran, 984 F.2d at 1302. \"[W]here advanced plans are made regarding the sale of narcotics in wholesale quantities, the participants in the transaction may be presumed to know that they are part of a broader conspiracy.\" United States v. Harris, 8 F.3d 943, 946 (2d Cir. 1993) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to that broader conspiracy, Ramirez testified that he and Negron engaged in cocaine transactions on numerous occasions, and Negron provided the details of his sale of cocaine to Rivera. Negron also testified that he had \"participated in endless numbers of drug transactions with Mr. Amador [Irizarry]\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> prior to 1991. Negron and Rivera had known each other since 1986 and met on several occasions in 1990. These contacts over a several year period provided an opportunity for Rivera to know of Negron's involvement in other drug transactions, particularly because Negron had a long history as a drug dealer. Indeed, Negron's familiarity with Rivera is demonstrated by the fact that Negron chose not to bring his bodyguard with him when he delivered the cocaine to Rivera, although he did bring his bodyguard along when he received the two kilograms of cocaine from Padilla. This routine quality of Rivera and Negron's one kilogram transaction in April 1991 supports an inference of Rivera's awareness of Negron's involvement with these other transactions. This knowledge, coupled with Rivera's cash purchase of a large quantity of cocaine for resale, suffices to establish that Rivera was aware that his purchase was part of a larger conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and that he furthered the purpose of that conspiracy with his purchase. That Rivera did not fully understand the details of Negron's many drug transactions is of no import. See Walters, 904 F.2d at 771 (\"It is not necessary that the government prove that the defendant . . . knew the extent of the conspiracy.\"). Thus, a rational jury could have concluded that Rivera tacitly acquiesced in the scheme of Negron and the other co-conspirators to distribute cocaine for profit when he purchased the kilogram from Negron. Such a tacit understanding is sufficient for Rivera to be guilty of conspiracy. See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera relies on our decision in United States v. DeLutis, 722 F.2d 902 (1st Cir. 1983), to support his contention that a single act is insufficient to hold an individual criminally accountable for conspiracy. In DeLutis, however, there was no drug transaction, no evidence of an intent to sell the defendant a large quantity of cocaine, and only an inference that the defendant intended to buy an undetermined amount of cocaine. See 722 F.2d at 907. Still, we reaffirm the general proposition advanced in DeLutis that \"a single sale of drugs without more does not establish a conspiracy.\" Id. at 906. Here there was enough additional evidence to establish the conspiracy charged and to withstand Rivera's sufficiency challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Amendment to the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera argues that he was prejudiced because the government, prior to trial, amended the indictment to correct a clerical error. In the overt acts charged under Count VI, the conspiracy charge, the government amended the language to substitute \"UCC No. 1\" for \"UCC No. 2,\" and vice versa, in every paragraph except one. In other words, the indictment wrongly referred to Negron, UCC No. 1, as UCC No. 2 in the description of the overt acts, and similarly referred to Ramirez, UCC No. 2, as UCC No. 1. The correction simply required a substitution of \"No. 1\" for \"No. 2\" and \"No. 2\" for \"No. 1.\" Rivera has not explained how this correction failed to give him notice of the conspiracy charge against him. Moreover, the government was not even required to prove any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 702. Thus, correcting this clerical error did not deprive Rivera of notice of the charge against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a claim closely related to his claim about the amendment to the indictment, Rivera argues that his conviction should be vacated because there was a variance between the conduct alleged in the indictment and the proof offered at trial. \"To be sufficient grounds for reversal, a variance must be severe enough to affect the defendant's substantial rights.\" Portela, 167 F.3d at 700. We review this question de novo. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we just explained, the government amended the indictment prior to trial to exchange the words \"UCC No. 1\" for \"UCC No. 2\" in the description of the overt acts, except for paragraph four of that description, which remained unchanged. The relevant portions of the corrected indictment, described as the overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. On or about April 15, 1991 at approximately 7:30 p.m., UCC No. 1 called Carlos Rivera-Ruiz to offer him one (1) kilogram of cocaine for the price of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars ($13,500.00). Rivera-Ruiz agreed and on the following date April 16, 1991 UCC No. 1 delivered to Rivera-Ruiz one (1) kilogram of cocaine located at Road 4406, Anones ward, Las Marias, Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. On or about April 16, 1991 at approximately 8:00 a.m., UCC No. 1 sold and delivered to Carlos Rivera-Ruiz one (1) kilogram of cocaine and was paid for thirteen thousand five hundred dollars ($13,500.00).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera argues that paragraphs three and four of the amended indictment charge him with purchasing two kilograms of cocaine from Negron, while the evidence presented at trial established only that he purchased one kilogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this claim. Based on a reasonable reading of paragraphs three and four, we conclude that the purchase of one kilogram of cocaine on the morning of April 16 is simply described twice. The indictment does not allege two separate purchases. There was no variance. Moreover, as noted, the prosecution was not required to prove overt acts in order to establish Rivera's guilt on the conspiracy charge. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 702. Thus, even if we were to adopt Rivera's strained reading of paragraphs three and four, that reading would not warrant reversal of his conviction because such an error in the recitation of the overt acts did not affect his substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera contends that the prosecutor deprived him of due process of law by making several improper remarks during his closing argument. Specifically, he identifies four comments that he claims could have led the jury to convict him on an improper basis. Because Rivera did not object to these comments at trial, we review his claim for plain error. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); see also United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993); United States v. Baldyga, 233 F.3d 674, 681 (1st Cir. 2000). To correct the alleged error, \"we must conclude that there was error, that the error was plain, and that it affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\" Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 681. We may find that the allegedly improper remarks affected Rivera's substantial rights only if we conclude that the prosecutor's comments affected the outcome of Rivera's trial. See id. at 682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in our discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, Rivera objects to one comment about his ownership of multiple properties and to another comment where the prosecutor argued that Negron would not have called Rivera if the two men were not in the same business (\"the supermarket comment\"). We have already ruled that there was nothing improper about these remarks. Although Rivera quotes the other two challenged remarks at length in his brief, we need not discuss these passages separately because we are convinced that the prosecutor's closing argument did not affect the outcome of Rivera's trial, and hence there was no plain error in the remarks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rivera appeals the sentence of 121 months imposed by the district court, arguing that the court erroneously based this sentence on the understanding that Rivera purchased two kilograms of cocaine, rather than only one. We review this claim for plain error because Rivera did not object at the time of sentencing. See United States v. Torres-Rosa, 209 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 2000). Because we find that Rivera faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years regardless of the amount of cocaine for which he was held accountable, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> we conclude that there was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than one year prior to trial, the government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> to establish that Rivera had a prior conviction for importing cocaine into Puerto Rico. The document served to notify Rivera that the prosecution intended to seek an increased sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167;a841(b)(1)(B) because of this prior conviction. Thus, as Rivera concedes in his brief to this court, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years regardless of the amount of cocaine attributed to him by the sentencing court. Accordingly, his challenge to the amount of cocaine attributed to him is irrelevant to his sentence. See, e.g., United States v. Tavano, 12 F.3d 301, 307 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"It is unnecessary to address a dispute over drug quantity if, and to the extent that, adjudicating it will not . . . bring a different mandatory minimum sentence into play.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment and Sentence Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) provides that \"it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally . . . to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 provides: \"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Unindicted co-conspirator No. 1 was identified as William Negron Zapata (\"Negron\"), and unindicted co-conspirator No. 2 was identified as Victor Ramirez de Arellano (\"Ramirez\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Negron's testimony regarding this transaction was not corroborated by other witnesses.

Specifically, he contends that the following comments by the prosecutor were misleading and may have led the jury to convict him for an improper reason: \"The defendant, you know from the evidence, is the owner of at least four structures . . . . And what is the occupation of the defendant? Mechanic body repair shop. How many people do you know who own a mechanic shop, auto body repair shop, you see them all over the island, that own four houses. . . . Look at that house. Big. Commercial antennas, solar system. The works. What a house. Two stories. We know that he owns a house.

He also appeals his sentence of 121 months. Rivera claims that the evidence presented at trial, consisting largely of the testimony of one cooperating witness about one transaction, was insufficient to convict him of participating in a conspiracy. He also argues that there was an impermissible variance between the allegations in the indictment and the proof offered at trial, and that the prosecutor's closing argument denied him due process of law. Finally, he claims that the district court made an error in sentencing. Although we acknowledge the closeness of the sufficiency issue, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carlos Rivera-Ruiz (\"Rivera\") was charged in count six of a ten-count indictment charging various individuals with violations of federal drug laws. While some of the other counts charged substantive drug offenses, Rivera was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The indictment alleged that Rivera, together with Jaime Padilla Rodriguez (\"Padilla\"), Jorge Arroyo-Rivera (\"Arroyo\"), and two unindicted co-conspirators,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> conspired to possess and distribute cocaine. All of the other individuals named in the indictment pled guilty. Trial for Rivera commenced in mid-September, 1997. Following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The court sentenced Rivera to 121 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. The Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera moved for a judgment of acquittal after the government rested and again at the close of all the evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. The district court denied that motion, and we review that ruling de novo. See United States v.

The Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented by the government at Rivera's trial consisted largely of the testimony of William Negron Zapata, who testified that he met Rivera in 1986 through a mutual friend, Ricardo Maldonado. He further stated that he saw Rivera on several occasions in 1986, as well as in 1990. The two would meet at Rivera's home, and Negron stated that Rivera sometimes visited him at his automobile repair shop which he operated out of his home. He successfully identified photographs of property owned by Rivera at trial and knew that Rivera also ran an automobile repair shop out of his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the transactions charged in the indictment, Negron testified that he agreed to purchase two kilograms of cocaine on April 15, 1991 from Amador Irizarry Sanabria, a man he had known since 1989 and had purchased drugs from on prior occasions. Negron paid him a total of $26,000 for the drugs, or $13,000 for each kilogram. Jaime Padilla Rodriguez, a friend of Irizarry's, arrived at Negron's house that day to deliver the cocaine. Because Negron had customers in his auto repair shop when Padilla arrived, he asked Padilla to leave and follow a specified road to a point where they could exchange the cocaine more privately. Padilla complied with these instructions. Negron, accompanied by his personal bodyguard, Jorge Arroyo Rivera, met Padilla at the specified location and collected the package of cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After obtaining the two kilograms of cocaine from Irizarry, Negron contacted his friend Victor Ramirez de Arellano, an attorney. Negron first met Ramirez in December 1989 when he retained him to represent his uncle in a criminal matter. Ramirez had purchased drugs from Negron on several occasions beginning in February 1991. On April 15, Ramirez agreed to buy one kilogram of cocaine for $13,500. Ramirez corroborated Negron's account of this transaction at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron also called Rivera on the afternoon of April 15, and Rivera agreed to buy the other kilogram of cocaine from him for $13,500. The two agreed that they would meet at Rivera's house at the Anones Ward in Las Marias the following morning. The prosecution did not offer a record of this phone call at trial, and Negron testified on cross-examination that he did not remember what phone he used to place the call. Early on April 16, Negron arrived at Rivera's home, unaccompanied, and gave him the drugs in exchange for $13,500. He stated that this transaction occurred in a living room on the first floor of Rivera's house and that only he and Rivera were present when they exchanged the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving Rivera's house, Negron called Padilla from his cellular phone and asked him to bring an additional two kilograms of cocaine from Irizarry. As before, Padilla arrived at Negron's home and auto shop and the two then left separately to meet at the same specified location. Negron gave Padilla $26,000 for the two kilograms of cocaine he had received the day before, and Padilla gave him an additional two kilograms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron sold one kilogram to Roberto Rivera Ortiz, to whom he had sold cocaine on several prior occasions. He sold the other kilogram to Ramirez the following morning, April 17. Ramirez testified that he then sold the cocaine to two other people. Padilla arrived at Negron's house to collect the $26,000 payment for the cocaine after Negron made these sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron's testimony about his drug transactions in April 1991 was uncorroborated, except by Ramirez who corroborated Negron's account of their two transactions. However, Negron's testimony was also uncontradicted. The only witness offered by Rivera was Ramonita Malave, his ex-wife. The two were married for 18 years and divorced in 1989, two years prior to the events described in the indictment. Malave testified that a man named Jose Lopez, together with his family, was renting the first floor of the home owned by Rivera where Negron alleged that the transfer of cocaine had occurred. She stated that Lopez moved from the first floor of the home to the second floor sometime after April 1991, but she was uncertain of the exact date when questioned on cross-examination. Malave also testified that Rivera was able to purchase and maintain several properties because of the rents he collected and the income he earned from his automobile repair shop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Applicable Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish Rivera's guilt on the conspiracy charge, the government needed to show \"the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\" United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198160\"><a href=\"/opinion/198160/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 1998). Rivera conceded, both below and on appeal, that a conspiracy to distribute cocaine existed. He only disputes his own involvement with that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera's voluntary participation in the conspiracy could have been demonstrated by evidence that he intended to enter into an agreement with the other parties to the conspiracy and that he intended \"to effectuate the commission of the substantive offense.\" United States v. Piper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195585\"><a href=\"/opinion/195585/united-states-v-piper/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 615 (1st Cir. 1994). \"The agreement itself 'need not be express, but may consist of no more than a tacit understanding.'\" Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679 (quoting United States v. Glover, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484930\"><a href=\"/opinion/484930/united-states-v-vivian-glover/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1987)). The proof of Rivera's involvement in the conspiracy \"may consist of indirect evidence, including reasonable inferences drawn from attendant circumstances.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a single conspiracy exists, we have considered whether the participants shared a common goal. See United States v. Portela, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761694\"><a href=\"/opinion/761694/united-states-v-rafael-portela-united-states-of-america-v-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 695 (1st Cir. 1999). The common goal of selling cocaine for profit satisfies this element. See id. We have also examined whether there was overlap among the participants to the conspiracy. See id. Such overlap exists where a conspiracy is marked by the \"pervasive involvement of a single 'core conspirator,'\" or \"hub character.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Wilson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742633\"><a href=\"/opinion/742633/united-states-v-don-r-wilson-aka-big-don-alfred-l-brown-aka-goat/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></a></span>, 1076 (5th Cir. 1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need for a conspirator to know the other participants in the conspiracy. See United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1191 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Nueva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595179\"><a href=\"/opinion/595179/united-states-v-alfredo-nueva/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 884 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[T]he government need not prove that the defendant knew all the details or all the members of the conspiracy.\"). Additionally, there is no requirement that a conspirator realize the full extent of the conspiracy to be found guilty. See United States v. Walters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542855\"><a href=\"/opinion/542855/united-states-v-ira-glen-anthony-walters-united-states-v-neville-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 770 (1st Cir. 1990). As we said in Portela, the requisite level of interdependence among conspirators exists where the defendant realized that the success of his own drug transactions depended on the ability of others to obtain drugs from suppliers and to sell them for profit to other purchasers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that [the appellant] understood that his transaction's success depended on the health of the trafficking and distribution network focused around [the seller of drugs], which in turn depended on continued transactions between [the seller] and other suppliers. Although these other suppliers were perhaps unknown individually to [the appellant], the jury could have reasonably inferred that he must have been aware of their existence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Portela, 167 F.3d at 697. Ultimately, our analysis of whether Rivera was part of a conspiracy does not rest on any particular element because \"this court has looked beyond any . . . lists of factors to the 'totality of the evidence' in determining whether there is factual support for a finding of a single conspiracy.\" Id. at 696 (quoting United States v. Drougas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Applying the Principles to the Evidence</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Transaction between Negron and Rivera</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera claims that Negron's uncorroborated testimony regarding the single transaction between them is unreliable because Negron agreed to cooperate with the government. However, credibility determinations are uniquely within the province of the jury, and we do not evaluate those judgments on appeal. See Woodward, 149 F.3d at 56. Moreover, Rivera's trial counsel subjected Negron to lengthy cross-examination about his cooperation with the government and his other drug transactions. Despite these efforts to impeach Negron, the jury could have rationally concluded that Negron was telling the truth about his sale of cocaine to Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera also attempted to contradict this testimony by offering the testimony of his ex-wife, Malave, that his residence was occupied by a tenant at the time of the alleged transaction. However, the jury could reasonably have found Negron's testimony to be more credible than Malave's. Malave's recollection of the relevant dates was uncertain, especially on cross-examination, and Rivera's attorney even conceded in his closing argument that Malave's testimony had been \"all over the place.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera further contends that, even if the jury found credible Negron's uncorroborated testimony that Negron sold cocaine to him, this single transaction cannot, as a matter of law, establish his guilt of the crime of conspiracy. We agree that a single drug transaction for the personal use of the purchaser, without prearrangement or other factors indicative of conspiratorial intent, does not establish a conspiracy. SeeUnited States v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1304 (1st Cir. 1993). Nonetheless, we have found, under certain circumstances, that one drug transaction may provide sufficient evidence for a jury to find the existence of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. See, e.g., Portela, 167 F.3d at 698 (\"The evidence . . . was thus sufficient to have led a reasonable jury to conclude that [the defendant] was a party to a tacit agreement relating to [the seller's] entire continuing enterprise, despite the fact that there was only a single transaction between them.\"); Moran, 984 F.2d at 1303 (\"Even a single sale for resale, embroidered with evidence suggesting a joint undertaking between buyer and seller, could suffice.\"); United States v. Carbone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474549\"><a href=\"/opinion/474549/united-states-v-luis-carbone-aka-luiggi/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir. 1986). Drawing on the body of conspiracy law we have just described, we evaluate the circumstances that support the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Knowing participation in a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Negron admitted that he sold cocaine for profit, and he testified that he sold one kilogram of cocaine to Rivera. Such a large quantity of drugs supports the inference that Rivera did not intend to use the cocaine merely for personal consumption, but rather intended to acquire it for redistribution. See United States v. Jesus-Rios, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604123\"><a href=\"/opinion/604123/united-states-v-jose-de-jesus-rios-aka-papo-rios-united-states-v-eva/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 680 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Geer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554886\"><a href=\"/opinion/554886/united-states-v-terryl-geer-aka-terry-geer/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span>, 895 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"The jury could infer the fact of a conspiracy to distribute drugs from the quantities of cocaine and hashish involved - quantities far larger than needed for personal use.\"). The inference that Rivera's purchase was for resale is strengthened by Ramirez's testimony that Ramirez resold the one kilogram of cocaine he purchased from Negron.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera's cash payment of $13,500 to Negron also supports an inference that Rivera was engaged in the business of buying and selling cocaine. Negron testified that Rivera agreed to purchase the cocaine on the afternoon of April 15. Slightly more than twelve hours later, in the early morning of April 16, Rivera gave Negron $13,500 in exchange for the drugs. The ability to gather such a large amount of cash overnight supports an inference that Rivera was more than a one-time, casual purchaser of cocaine. That inference draws further support from the promptness of Negron's phone call to Rivera after coming into possession of the cocaine. Negron did not make random calls. He called Ramirez, to whom he had sold drugs on several occasions, and Rivera, whom he knew. As the government said during its closing argument: \"This is not a supermarket where you go and you select the product that you want. If you want drugs you have to know where to get them and who sells them because William Negron Zapata would not sell you or any one of you any drugs unless he knew that you were in the same business he was.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, there was evidence that Rivera owned multiple properties in Puerto Rico. As the government argues, it is reasonable to question the source of this wealth, particularly because Rivera's automobile shop in his home was not likely to generate the quantity of cash Rivera had available to purchase cocaine from Negron.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> A reasonable jury could find, on these facts, that Rivera's income was supplemented by money he earned from buying cocaine and selling it for profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample evidence, in short, that Rivera and Negron shared the common objective of buying and selling cocaine for profit, agreed on a transaction for that purpose, and carried it out. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 695. This transaction was far different than the \"unplanned spot sale with no agreement beyond that inherent in the sale\" noted in Moran. Moran, 984 F.2d at 1302. \"[W]here advanced plans are made regarding the sale of narcotics in wholesale quantities, the participants in the transaction may be presumed to know that they are part of a broader conspiracy.\" United States v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656572\"><a href=\"/opinion/656572/united-states-v-eddie-harris-delaine-gipson-gilbert-harris-sheila/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></a></span>, 946 (2d Cir. 1993) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to that broader conspiracy, Ramirez testified that he and Negron engaged in cocaine transactions on numerous occasions, and Negron provided the details of his sale of cocaine to Rivera. Negron also testified that he had \"participated in endless numbers of drug transactions with Mr. Amador [Irizarry]\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> prior to 1991. Negron and Rivera had known each other since 1986 and met on several occasions in 1990. These contacts over a several year period provided an opportunity for Rivera to know of Negron's involvement in other drug transactions, particularly because Negron had a long history as a drug dealer. Indeed, Negron's familiarity with Rivera is demonstrated by the fact that Negron chose not to bring his bodyguard with him when he delivered the cocaine to Rivera, although he did bring his bodyguard along when he received the two kilograms of cocaine from Padilla. This routine quality of Rivera and Negron's one kilogram transaction in April 1991 supports an inference of Rivera's awareness of Negron's involvement with these other transactions. This knowledge, coupled with Rivera's cash purchase of a large quantity of cocaine for resale, suffices to establish that Rivera was aware that his purchase was part of a larger conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and that he furthered the purpose of that conspiracy with his purchase. That Rivera did not fully understand the details of Negron's many drug transactions is of no import. See Walters, 904 F.2d at 771 (\"It is not necessary that the government prove that the defendant . . . knew the extent of the conspiracy.\"). Thus, a rational jury could have concluded that Rivera tacitly acquiesced in the scheme of Negron and the other co-conspirators to distribute cocaine for profit when he purchased the kilogram from Negron. Such a tacit understanding is sufficient for Rivera to be guilty of conspiracy. See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera relies on our decision in United States v. DeLutis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"428309\"><a href=\"/opinion/428309/united-states-v-michael-james-delutis-aka-john-doe-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1983), to support his contention that a single act is insufficient to hold an individual criminally accountable for conspiracy. In DeLutis, however, there was no drug transaction, no evidence of an intent to sell the defendant a large quantity of cocaine, and only an inference that the defendant intended to buy an undetermined amount of cocaine. See 722 F.2d at 907. Still, we reaffirm the general proposition advanced in DeLutis that \"a single sale of drugs without more does not establish a conspiracy.\" Id. at 906. Here there was enough additional evidence to establish the conspiracy charged and to withstand Rivera's sufficiency challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Amendment to the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera argues that he was prejudiced because the government, prior to trial, amended the indictment to correct a clerical error. In the overt acts charged under Count VI, the conspiracy charge, the government amended the language to substitute \"UCC No. 1\" for \"UCC No. 2,\" and vice versa, in every paragraph except one. In other words, the indictment wrongly referred to Negron, UCC No. 1, as UCC No. 2 in the description of the overt acts, and similarly referred to Ramirez, UCC No. 2, as UCC No. 1. The correction simply required a substitution of \"No. 1\" for \"No. 2\" and \"No. 2\" for \"No. 1.\" Rivera has not explained how this correction failed to give him notice of the conspiracy charge against him. Moreover, the government was not even required to prove any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 702. Thus, correcting this clerical error did not deprive Rivera of notice of the charge against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a claim closely related to his claim about the amendment to the indictment, Rivera argues that his conviction should be vacated because there was a variance between the conduct alleged in the indictment and the proof offered at trial. \"To be sufficient grounds for reversal, a variance must be severe enough to affect the defendant's substantial rights.\" Portela, 167 F.3d at 700. We review this question de novo. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we just explained, the government amended the indictment prior to trial to exchange the words \"UCC No. 1\" for \"UCC No. 2\" in the description of the overt acts, except for paragraph four of that description, which remained unchanged. The relevant portions of the corrected indictment, described as the overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. On or about April 15, 1991 at approximately 7:30 p.m., UCC No. 1 called Carlos Rivera-Ruiz to offer him one (1) kilogram of cocaine for the price of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars ($13,500.00). Rivera-Ruiz agreed and on the following date April 16, 1991 UCC No. 1 delivered to Rivera-Ruiz one (1) kilogram of cocaine located at Road 4406, Anones ward, Las Marias, Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. On or about April 16, 1991 at approximately 8:00 a.m., UCC No. 1 sold and delivered to Carlos Rivera-Ruiz one (1) kilogram of cocaine and was paid for thirteen thousand five hundred dollars ($13,500.00).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera argues that paragraphs three and four of the amended indictment charge him with purchasing two kilograms of cocaine from Negron, while the evidence presented at trial established only that he purchased one kilogram.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this claim. Based on a reasonable reading of paragraphs three and four, we conclude that the purchase of one kilogram of cocaine on the morning of April 16 is simply described twice. The indictment does not allege two separate purchases. There was no variance. Moreover, as noted, the prosecution was not required to prove overt acts in order to establish Rivera's guilt on the conspiracy charge. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 702. Thus, even if we were to adopt Rivera's strained reading of paragraphs three and four, that reading would not warrant reversal of his conviction because such an error in the recitation of the overt acts did not affect his substantial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Closing Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rivera contends that the prosecutor deprived him of due process of law by making several improper remarks during his closing argument. Specifically, he identifies four comments that he claims could have led the jury to convict him on an improper basis. Because Rivera did not object to these comments at trial, we review his claim for plain error. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); see also United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 731 (1993); United States v. Baldyga, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199179\"><a href=\"/opinion/199179/united-states-v-baldyga/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span>, 681 (1st Cir. 2000). To correct the alleged error, \"we must conclude that there was error, that the error was plain, and that it affected the substantial rights of the defendant.\" Baldyga, 233 F.3d at 681. We may find that the allegedly improper remarks affected Rivera's substantial rights only if we conclude that the prosecutor's comments affected the outcome of Rivera's trial. See id. at 682.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in our discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, Rivera objects to one comment about his ownership of multiple properties and to another comment where the prosecutor argued that Negron would not have called Rivera if the two men were not in the same business (\"the supermarket comment\"). We have already ruled that there was nothing improper about these remarks. Although Rivera quotes the other two challenged remarks at length in his brief, we need not discuss these passages separately because we are convinced that the prosecutor's closing argument did not affect the outcome of Rivera's trial, and hence there was no plain error in the remarks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rivera appeals the sentence of 121 months imposed by the district court, arguing that the court erroneously based this sentence on the understanding that Rivera purchased two kilograms of cocaine, rather than only one. We review this claim for plain error because Rivera did not object at the time of sentencing. See United States v. Torres-Rosa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768303\"><a href=\"/opinion/768303/united-states-v-cesar-orlando-torres-rosa-aka-lando-aka-orlan/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 2000). Because we find that Rivera faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years regardless of the amount of cocaine for which he was held accountable, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> we conclude that there was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More than one year prior to trial, the government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> to establish that Rivera had a prior conviction for importing cocaine into Puerto Rico. The document served to notify Rivera that the prosecution intended to seek an increased sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167;a841(b)(1)(B) because of this prior conviction. Thus, as Rivera concedes in his brief to this court, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years regardless of the amount of cocaine attributed to him by the sentencing court. Accordingly, his challenge to the amount of cocaine attributed to him is irrelevant to his sentence. See, e.g., United States v. Tavano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195113\"><a href=\"/opinion/195113/united-states-v-tavano/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"It is unnecessary to address a dispute over drug quantity if, and to the extent that, adjudicating it will not . . . bring a different mandatory minimum sentence into play.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment and Sentence Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) provides that \"it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally . . . to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 provides: \"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Unindicted co-conspirator No. 1 was identified as William Negron Zapata (\"Negron\"), and unindicted co-conspirator No. 2 was identified as Victor Ramirez de Arellano (\"Ramirez\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Negron's testimony regarding this transaction was not corroborated by other witnesses.

Specifically, he contends that the following comments by the prosecutor were misleading and may have led the jury to convict him for an improper reason: \"The defendant, you know from the evidence, is the owner of at least four structures . . . . And what is the occupation of the defendant? Mechanic body repair shop. How many people do you know who own a mechanic shop, auto body repair shop, you see them all over the island, that own four houses. . . . Look at that house. Big. Commercial antennas, solar system. The works. What a house. Two stories. We know that he owns a house. Good.\" There was no error in this closing argument, which was based on the evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> For unexplained reasons, the indictment did not allege that Irizarry was part of this conspiracy.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Section 841(b)(1)(B) provides: \"If any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Section 851 provides, in pertinent part: \"No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial . . . the United States attorney files an information with the court . . . stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
