Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n            Aldrich, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nEdward J. Collins for appellant.\r\nKevin P. O'Flaherty with whom Adrienne M. Markham and Goulston\r\n&amp; Storrs, P.C. were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 9, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  In July 1988, when she was 27\r\nyears old, Jennifer Hoult brought suit in the district court\r\nagainst her father, David Hoult, alleging assault and battery,\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of\r\nfiduciary duty.  To support these claims, she alleged that her\r\nfather had sexually abused, raped and threatened her from the time\r\nthat she was about four years old until she was about sixteen years\r\nold.\r\nThe statute of limitations presented an obvious obstacle. \r\nJennifer Hoult sought to overcome it by showing that the alleged\r\nabuse caused her to repress her memory of the events until she\r\nbegan to recapture those memories during therapy sessions in\r\nOctober 1985.  See M.G.L. 260  4C.  The claim of repressed memory\r\nwas supported at trial by testimony from a psychiatrist, Dr. Renee\r\nBrandt, who appeared as an expert witness on repression caused by\r\ntraumatic abuse.\r\nIn June 1993, the district court conducted an eight day\r\njury trial in which Jennifer Hoult testified at length, giving\r\ndetailed descriptions of extensive alleged abuse by her father; in\r\naddition to other forms of abuse, she testified to five specific\r\nepisodes of rape.  Supporting testimony was provided by her former\r\ntherapist and by Dr. Brandt.  In defense, David Hoult testified on\r\nhis own behalf, flatly denying the allegations, but presented no\r\nother witnesses.\r\nOn July 1, 1993, the jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\nJennifer Hoult and ordered damages in the amount of $500,000.  This\r\nverdict was preceded by a separate finding by the jury accepting\r\nthe statute of limitations defense; in effect the jury found that\r\nJennifer Hoult had repressed memory of the abuse until it was\r\nrediscovered within the limitations period.  David Hoult appealed\r\nboth from the judgment against him and the denial of a motion for\r\na new trial, but both appeals were ultimately dismissed for lack of\r\nprosecution.\r\nLater, Jennifer Hoult wrote letters to several\r\nprofessional associations in which she repeated the charge that her\r\nfather had raped her.  David Hoult then brought the present action\r\nin the district court against Jennifer Hoult, claiming that her\r\ncharge of rape against him was defamatory.  Jennifer Hoult moved to\r\ndismiss on the ground that the jury verdict in her earlier assault\r\naction had determined that David Hoult had raped her and that David\r\nHoult was barred by collateral estoppel from relitigating this\r\nfinding.\r\nInitially, the district court denied the motion to\r\ndismiss, saying that the evidence adduced at the trial could have\r\nled the jury to impose liability because David Hoult had sexually\r\nabused Jennifer Hoult \"in ways that did not amount to rape\" or\r\ncould even have done so on the basis of Jennifer Hoult's testimony\r\nthat David Hoult had \"threatened her with murder, chased her around\r\nthe house with a knife, and fondled her in a sexual manner, among\r\nother incidents of violence and assault.\"\r\nBy motion for reconsideration, Jennifer Hoult argued that\r\nthe jury's finding of repression, in rejecting the statute of\r\nlimitations defense, was necessarily based on Dr. Brandt's expert\r\nopinion that the repression required \"repeated acts\" of sexual\r\nabuse; and the only repeated acts of sexual abuse (Jennifer Hoult\r\nargued) were her descriptions of five separate incidents of rape. \r\nAccepting this argument, the district court allowed Jennifer\r\nHoult's motion to dismiss the action, and David Hoult now appeals.\r\nThe governing legal doctrine of collateral estoppel,\r\nwhich we briefly summarize, is largely undisputed; the problem is\r\none of applying the doctrine to this case.  Because the prior\r\njudgment was a federal court judgment, we look to federal law for\r\nits preclusive effect.  See Johnson v. SCA Disposal Servs., 931\r\nF.2d 970, 974 (1st Cir. 1991).  Subject to certain exceptions, the\r\ngeneral rule on \"issue preclusion\" is as follows:\r\nWhen an issue of fact or law is actually\r\nlitigated and determined by a valid and final\r\njudgment, and the determination is essential\r\nto the judgment, the determination is\r\nconclusive in a subsequent action between the\r\nparties, whether on the same or a different\r\nclaim.\r\n\nRestatement (Second) Judgements  27 (1982).  Neither side disputes\r\nthat this formulation sets forth the governing law.\r\nDavid Hoult does not invoke any of the various\r\nexceptions, see Restatement (Second), supra,  28, but instead\r\nsays--as did the district judge in his original order refusing to\r\ndismiss--that there is no proof that the jury ever determined that\r\nDavid Hoult had committed the alleged rapes.  The burden is upon\r\nJennifer Hoult, as the party invoking collateral estoppel, to\r\nestablish that the jury did so determine in the original action. \r\nSee Commercial Associates v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc., 998 F.2d 1092,\r\n1098 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nAdmittedly, the jury made no explicit finding that rapes\r\noccurred.  Nevertheless, \"[a]n issue may be 'actually' decided [for\r\ncollateral estoppel purposes] even if it is not explicitly decided,\r\nfor it may have constituted, logically or practically, a necessary\r\ncomponent of the decision reached.\"  Dennis v. Rhode Island\r\nHospital Trust National Bank, 744 F.2d 893, 899 (1st Cir. 1984). \r\nThe court in the second case may examine the full record in the\r\nearlier one to decide \"whether a rational jury could have grounded\r\nits verdict upon an issue other than that which the [moving party]\r\nseeks to foreclose from consideration.\"  Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S.\r\n436, 444 (1970).\r\nWhether the jury did find, or must have found, rape in\r\nthe earlier trial is perhaps a question of fact.  But where (as\r\nhere) the question is answered by looking only at the paper record\r\nof the earlier trial, appeals courts tend to review the district\r\ncourt ruling de novo.  The more difficult threshold issue is how\r\nclear it must be that the jury found the fact in question.  The\r\nmaxim of Lord Coke which is sometimes quoted by courts is that \"an\r\nestoppel must 'be certain to every intent.'\" Russell v. Place, 94\r\nU.S. 606, 610 (1876).\r\nThis is more demanding than the \"more likely than not\"\r\nstandard commonly applied in civil matters, but sensibly so. \r\nTelling a party that it cannot prove or contest a fact of\r\nimportance in the case at hand is a severe measure.  Courts have\r\nbeen willing to take that step only where it is certain that the\r\nissue has already been decided in a prior case (normally one\r\ninvolving the same parties), and even then there are numerous\r\nescape hatches).  Restatement, supra,  27.\r\nConfronted with a general verdict in the earlier case,\r\ncourts commonly ask whether a finding was \"necessary\" to the\r\njudgment, and answer the question by looking primarily to the\r\ninstructions and the result.  But a finding is \"necessary\" if it\r\nwas central to the route that led the factfinder to the judgment\r\nreached, even if the result \"could have been achieved by a\r\ndifferent, shorter and more efficient route.\"  Commercial\r\nAssociates v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc., 998 F.2d 1092, 1097 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).  And in deciding whether the jury did make and rest\r\ncentrally upon a finding not expressly made, it is proper to\r\nconsider--as Dennis said--not only what was \"logically\" but also\r\nwhat was \"practically\" a \"necessary component of the decision\r\nreached.\"  Dennis, 744 F.2d at 899.\r\nHere, the rape charges were the centerpiece of Jennifer\r\nHoult's case.  In the opening statement, her counsel said that\r\nJennifer Hoult would have to live with her \"memories of the rape,\r\ntorture, and sexual abuse\" by her father and that her father had\r\nhad \"intercourse\" with her.  Defense counsel answered that Jennifer\r\nHoult could not have been \"raped by her father some 3,000 times,\"\r\nas she had once claimed, and he promised evidence to show  the\r\nunlikelihood that numerous rapes could have occurred without\r\ndetection by other family members.\r\nJennifer Hoult then testified specifically to five\r\nincidents of rape and said that there were other like rapes whose\r\ndetails she could not recollect.  On cross-examination by defense\r\ncounsel, she said:\r\n     I know based on the specific memories\r\nthat I have of him attacking me and based on\r\nmy perceptions, and memories of my life as a\r\nwhole that he assaulted me regularly, and that\r\nrape, even the narrower definition [simple\r\nsexual intercourse] was a regular part of the\r\nway that he assaulted me.\r\n\nIn closing argument, defense counsel--who argued first--\r\nsaid at the outset:\r\nSpecifically, Jennifer alleges that her father\r\nsexually abused her.  More specifically,\r\nJennifer claims that her father raped her, and\r\nI will call your attention now, as I did in my\r\nopening statement, that Jennifer describes\r\nrape as forcible vaginal intercourse.\r\n\nIn response, Jennifer Hoult's counsel said: \"And this is not about\r\nhugging and kissing.  She is claiming he assaulted her.  He raped\r\nher.  It's not inappropriate hugging and kissing.\"\r\nA further consideration, stressed by the district court,\r\nis Dr. Brandt's testimony and the jury's finding on the statute of\r\nlimitations.  Dr. Brandt testified that repeated sexual abuse can\r\ncause repression of memory of the abuse and that Jennifer Hoult\"s\r\nsymptoms \"correlated\" with such a syndrome.  In finding that the\r\nstatute of limitations had run, the only plausible explanation is\r\nthat the jury accepted Jennifer Hoult's testimony as to the rapes,\r\nwhich were the salient and specific acts of repeated abuse to which\r\nshe testified.\r\nTheoretically, the jury could have concluded that\r\nJennifer Hoult had made up or imagined the rapes, and it could then\r\nhave found repressed memory and awarded the $500,000 judgment\r\nbecause of improper sexual fondlings and threats or acts of\r\nviolence.  But this is a wholly unrealistic assessment of a trial\r\nin which the rapes were the central and pivotal issue, the\r\nfondlings were the preface to the rapes, and the violence was\r\nconnected to the rapes (either as part of the rapes or to encourage\r\nsilence).  In our view the jury necessarily decided that rapes had\r\noccurred.\r\nThe present law suit seeks, in the guise of a defamation\r\naction, to retry the central issue in the prior assault case\r\nbetween the same litigants.  That issue--ultimately a credibility\r\ncontest between the two opposing parties--was resolved by the jury\r\nat the first trial.  Whether the jury was right or wrong, its\r\ndecision about what happened is not now open to relitigation.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

To support these claims, she alleged that her father had sexually abused, raped and threatened her from the time that she was about four years old until she was about sixteen years old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of limitations presented an obvious obstacle.  Jennifer Hoult sought to overcome it by showing that the alleged abuse caused her to repress her memory of the events until she began to recapture those memories during therapy sessions in October 1985.  See M.G.L. 260 &#167; 4C.  The claim of repressed memory was supported at trial by testimony from a psychiatrist, Dr. Renee Brandt, who appeared as an expert witness on repression caused by traumatic abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1993, the district court conducted an eight day jury trial in which Jennifer Hoult testified at length, giving detailed descriptions of extensive alleged abuse by her father;  in addition to other forms of abuse, she testified to five specific episodes of rape.  Supporting testimony was provided by her former therapist and by Dr. Brandt.  In defense, David Hoult testified on his own behalf, flatly denying the allegations, but presented no other witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 1993, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Jennifer Hoult and ordered damages in the amount of $500,000.  This verdict was preceded by a separate finding by the jury rejecting the statute of limitations defense;  in effect the jury found that Jennifer Hoult had repressed memory of the abuse until it was rediscovered within the limitations period.  David Hoult appealed both from the judgment against him and the denial of a motion for a new trial, but both appeals were ultimately dismissed for lack of prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, Jennifer Hoult wrote letters to several professional associations in which she repeated the charge that her father had raped her.  David Hoult then brought the present action in the district court against Jennifer Hoult, claiming that her charge of rape against him was defamatory.  Jennifer Hoult moved to dismiss on the ground that the jury verdict in her earlier assault action had determined that David Hoult had raped her and that David Hoult was barred by collateral estoppel from relitigating this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the district court denied the motion to dismiss, saying that the evidence adduced at the trial could have led the jury to impose liability because David Hoult had sexually abused Jennifer Hoult \"in ways that did not amount to rape\" or could even have done so on the basis of Jennifer Hoult's testimony that David Hoult had \"threatened her with murder, chased her around the house with a knife, and fondled her in a sexual manner, among other incidents of violence and assault.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By motion for reconsideration, Jennifer Hoult argued that the jury's finding of repression, in rejecting the statute of limitations defense, was necessarily based on Dr. Brandt's expert opinion that the repression required \"repeated acts\" of sexual abuse;  and the only repeated acts of sexual abuse (Jennifer Hoult argued) were her descriptions of five separate incidents of rape.  Accepting this argument, the district court allowed Jennifer Hoult's motion to dismiss the action, and David Hoult now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The governing legal doctrine of collateral estoppel, which we briefly summarize, is largely undisputed;  the problem is one of applying the doctrine to this case.  Because the prior judgment was a federal court judgment, we look to federal law for its preclusive effect.  See Johnson v. SCA Disposal Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560354\"><a href=\"/opinion/560354/peter-a-johnson-grassy-knoll-associates-v-sca-disposal-services-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>, 974 (1st Cir.1991).  Subject to certain exceptions, the general rule on \"issue preclusion\" is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>When an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) Judgements &#167; 27 (1982).  Neither side disputes that this formulation sets forth the governing law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Hoult does not invoke any of the various exceptions, see Restatement (Second), supra, &#167; 28, but instead says--as did the district judge in his original order refusing to dismiss--that there is no proof that the jury ever determined that David Hoult had committed the alleged rapes.  The burden is upon Jennifer Hoult, as the party invoking collateral estoppel, to establish that the jury did so determine in the original action.  See Commercial Associates v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611563\"><a href=\"/opinion/611563/commercial-associates-v-tilcon-gammino-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span>, 1098 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the jury made no explicit finding that rapes occurred.  Nevertheless, \"[a]n issue may be 'actually' decided [for collateral estoppel purposes] even if it is not explicitly decided, for it may have constituted, logically or practically, a necessary component of the decision reached.\"  Dennis v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"442088\"><a href=\"/opinion/442088/robert-b-dennis-etc-v-rhode-island-hospital-trust-national-bank-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></a></span>, 899 (1st Cir.1984).  The court in the second case may examine the full record in the earlier one to decide \"whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the [moving party] seeks to foreclose from consideration.\"  Ashe v. Swenson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108114\"><a href=\"/opinion/108114/ashe-v-swenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 444, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108114\"><a href=\"/opinion/108114/ashe-v-swenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108114\"><a href=\"/opinion/108114/ashe-v-swenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the jury did find, or must have found, rape in the earlier trial is perhaps a question of fact.  But where (as here) the question is answered by looking only at the paper record of the earlier trial, appeals courts tend to review the district court ruling de novo.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The more difficult threshold issue is how clear it must be that the jury found the fact in question.  The maxim of Lord Coke which is sometimes quoted by courts is that \"an estoppel must 'be certain to every intent.' \"  Russell v. Place, 94 U.S.  (4 Otto) 606, 610, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span> (1876).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is more demanding than the \"more likely than not\" standard commonly applied in civil matters, but sensibly so.  Telling a party that it cannot prove or contest a fact of importance in the case at hand is a severe measure.  Courts have been willing to take that step only where it is certain that the issue has already been decided in a prior case (normally one involving the same parties), and even then there are numerous escape hatches.  Restatement, supra, &#167; 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confronted with a general verdict in the earlier case, courts commonly ask whether a finding was \"necessary\" to the judgment, and answer the question by looking primarily to the instructions and the result.  But a finding is \"necessary\" if it was central to the route that led the factfinder to the judgment reached, even if the result \"could have been achieved by a different, shorter and more efficient route.\"  Commercial Associates v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611563\"><a href=\"/opinion/611563/commercial-associates-v-tilcon-gammino-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span>, 1097 (1st Cir.1993).  And in deciding whether the jury did make and rest centrally upon a finding not expressly made, it is proper to consider--as Dennis said--not only what was \"logically\" but also what was \"practically\" a \"necessary component of the decision reached.\"  Dennis, 744 F.2d at 899.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the rape charges were the centerpiece of Jennifer Hoult's case.  In the opening statement, her counsel said that Jennifer Hoult would have to live with her \"memories of the rape, torture, and sexual abuse\" by her father and that her father had had \"intercourse\" with her.  Defense counsel answered that Jennifer Hoult could not have been \"raped by her father some 3,000 times,\" as she had once claimed, and he promised evidence to show the unlikelihood that numerous rapes could have occurred without detection by other family members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jennifer Hoult then testified specifically to five incidents of rape and said that there were other like rapes whose details she could not recollect.  On cross-examination by defense counsel, she said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I know based on the specific memories that I have of him attacking me and based on my perceptions, and memories of my life as a whole that he assaulted me regularly, and that rape, even the narrower definition [simple sexual intercourse] was a regular part of the way that he assaulted me.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing argument, defense counsel--who argued first--said at the outset:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>Specifically, Jennifer alleges that her father sexually abused her.  More specifically, Jennifer claims that her father raped her, and I will call your attention now, as I did in my opening statement, that Jennifer describes rape as forcible vaginal intercourse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Jennifer Hoult's counsel said:  \"And this is not about hugging and kissing.  She is claiming he assaulted her.  He raped her.  It's not inappropriate hugging and kissing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further consideration, stressed by the district court, is Dr. Brandt's testimony and the jury's finding on the statute of limitations.  Dr. Brandt testified that repeated sexual abuse can cause repression of memory of the abuse and that Jennifer Hoult's symptoms \"correlated\" with such a syndrome.  In finding that the statute of limitations had run, the only plausible explanation is that the jury accepted Jennifer Hoult's testimony as to the rapes, which were the salient and specific acts of repeated abuse to which she testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Theoretically, the jury could have concluded that Jennifer Hoult had made up or imagined the rapes, and it could then have found repressed memory and awarded the $500,000 judgment because of improper sexual fondlings and threats or acts of violence.  But this is a wholly unrealistic assessment of a trial in which the rapes were the central and pivotal issue, the fondlings were the preface to the rapes, and the violence was connected to the rapes (either as part of the rapes or to encourage silence).  In our view the jury necessarily decided that rapes had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present law suit seeks, in the guise of a defamation action, to retry the central issue in the prior assault case between the same litigants.  That issue--ultimately a credibility contest between the two opposing parties--was resolved by the jury at the first trial.  Whether the jury was right or wrong, its decision about what happened is not now open to relitigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A year after the judgment, David Hoult filed a motion to vacate the judgment under Rule Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), primarily attacking the trial court's decision to allow Dr. Brandt to testify on repressed memory.  The motion was denied and, when David Hoult appealed this denial, this court affirmed.  Hoult v.
