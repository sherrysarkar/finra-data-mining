Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                       Before\r\n\n              Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n            Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n            and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nStephen R. Kaplan, by appointment of the court, for\r\npetitioner.\r\nDonald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Richard W.\r\nRose, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nOctober 22, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  In 1995, Omil Arroyo was\r\nconvicted by a jury and subsequently sentenced to 151 months in\r\nprison for possession with intent to deliver over 50 grams of\r\ncocaine base and over 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21\r\nU.S.C.  841(a)(1).  His conviction was based in part on drugs and\r\nparaphernalia seized from an apartment leased by Arroyo and\r\nevidently used by him and his confederates to manufacture and store\r\ncrack cocaine.  On direct appeal, Arroyo challenged the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence and his sentence, but we affirmed.  See United\r\nStates v. Arroyo, 125 F.3d 842 (1st Cir. 1997) (per curiam)\r\n(unpublished opinion), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 726 (1998).  \r\nIn February 1998, Arroyo filed a motion for post-\r\nconviction relief under 28 U.S.C.  2255.  Arroyo claimed that he\r\nwas denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the\r\nSixth Amendment because of his attorney's failure at trial to\r\nchallenge the reasonableness of the apartment search on Fourth\r\nAmendment grounds and his attorney's further failure to challenge\r\nthe severity of the sentence.  In July 1998, the district court\r\ndenied the petition, as well as Arroyo's motion for a certificate\r\nof appealability.  We then granted Arroyo the certificate, limited\r\nto counsel's failure to raise the Fourth Amendment challenge.\r\nIn Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976), the Supreme\r\nCourt said that habeas corpus relief to challenge a state\r\nconviction could not be based solely on a Fourth Amendment\r\nviolation because such evidence remains reliable and any increase\r\nin deterrence effected by the exclusionary rule would be slight. \r\nThe government says that the same limitation must apply to relief\r\nunder section 2255, the statutory counterpart to habeas relief for\r\nfederal prisoners.  Although this issue has not squarely been\r\ndecided by the Supreme Court or in this circuit, Arroyo bases his\r\nattack here on the Sixth Amendment, and we similarly limit our\r\nconcern to whether counsel was incompetent in failing to pursue the\r\nFourth Amendment issue.\r\nUnder Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984),\r\ncounsel is not incompetent merely because he may not be perfect. \r\nIn real life, there is room not only for differences in judgment\r\nbut even for mistakes, which are almost inevitable in a trial\r\nsetting, so long as their quality or quantity do not mark out\r\ncounsel as incompetent.  Thus the initial inquiry here is whether\r\nthe Fourth Amendment objection was so obvious and promising that no\r\ncompetent lawyer could have failed to pursue it.  (If incompetence\r\nwere shown, it would still be necessary to show prejudice.  See\r\nKimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 381-82 (1986)).  \r\nIt is common ground that Arroyo's apartment was searched\r\npursuant to a valid search warrant, and Arroyo does not deny the\r\nexistence of probable cause; rather, he disputes the manner by\r\nwhich entrance to the apartment was achieved.  It appears that\r\nafter the police knocked and received no response, a battering ram\r\nwas used to knock the door loose, causing some damage to the door\r\nor door frame.  The use of battering rams is fairly common in drug\r\ncases.  E.g., United States v. Jones, 149 F.3d 715, 715-16 (7th\r\nCir. 1998); Haygood v. Johnson, 70 F.3d 92, 94 (11th Cir.) (per\r\ncuriam), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 949 (1996).\r\nArroyo's argument is that prior to executing the warrant,\r\nthe police had arrested Arroyo and others at another location and\r\ntaken from Arroyo a key ring containing nine keys.  Since the\r\npolice knew they were to search Arroyo's apartment, he argues that\r\nthe reasonable method of search would have been to try the keys and\r\nenter the apartment in that manner.  (After the entry, the keys\r\nwere in fact tried and one of them worked the lock.)  The Fourth\r\nAmendment's reasonableness  requirement has been taken to extend to\r\nthe manner of entry and search.  E.g., United States v. Ramirez,\r\n523 U.S. 65, 71 (1998); Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385, 395\r\nn.5 (1997).\r\nThe government responds, as one might expect, that there\r\nis normally good reason to act swiftly in drug searches.  Within\r\nthe apartment there may be defendants who ignore the knock and\r\nproceed to destroy evidence, flee through windows or other exits,\r\nor prepare to shoot at the police as they enter.  These concerns\r\nhave been so far recognized that they may sometimes justify entry\r\nwithout a prior knock and announcement.  See Richards v. Wisconsin,\r\n520 U.S. 385, 394 (1997).  On this premise the government argues\r\nthat the police did not have to try nine keys (none of which might\r\nhave proved to be the right key) in order to effect a reasonable\r\nentry.  As it turned out, nobody was in the apartment when the\r\npolice entered it, but the police could not know this in advance.\r\nWith some ingenuity, Arroyo's counsel counters by\r\npointing out that in Richards, 520 U.S. at 394, the Court held that\r\nbefore the police can dispense with the ordinary knock and announce\r\nrequirement, they must have a \"reasonable suspicion\" that making\r\ntheir presence known would be dangerous, futile, or damaging to\r\ntheir investigation.  In this case, Arroyo does not dispute the\r\ngovernment's contention that the knock and announce rule was\r\ncomplied with; but Arroyo says that the same rationale ought to\r\nrequire the police to try keys already in their possession unless\r\nthey have a \"reasonable suspicion\" that there may be someone within\r\nto destroy evidence, flee or threaten the lives of the police.\r\nWithout conceding the analogy, the government says that\r\nin this case the surrounding circumstances did create such a\r\nreasonable suspicion that others might be within, since there was\r\nreason to believe that other persons were involved with Arroyo's\r\ndrug activities and that Arroyo was conducting a fairly large scale\r\noperation involving multiple locations.  One could argue about the\r\ninferences to be drawn and, since the issue was never litigated, it\r\nis far from clear that we have all the facts that might support or\r\nundermine a claim of reasonable suspicion.\r\nIt is sufficient that the Sixth Amendment argument made\r\nby Arroyo's present counsel is more a tribute to his own insight\r\nand imagination than anything approaching proof that trial counsel\r\nwas incompetent in failing to make such arguments himself. \r\nChallenging the method of entry rather than the existence of\r\nprobable cause is itself unusual; and the idea that the police had\r\nsome obligation to try nine different keys to enter a suspected\r\ndrug scene would not occur to most judges or lawyers, let alone to\r\npolice officers in the course of a raid.  Only the use of Richards\r\nas the basis for a rather clever argument provides any hope of\r\nconverting the sow's ear into a silk purse.\r\nThere is thus no basis for thinking that trial counsel\r\nwas incompetent in failing to seek to suppress the fruits of the\r\nsearch on the ground now suggested.  We leave for another day the\r\ninteresting issues that may arise from too ready resort to\r\nbattering rams.  It is also unnecessary for us to consider the\r\ngovernment's inevitable discovery argument or its suggestion that\r\nwe adopt the Seventh Circuit's rule in Holman v. Page, 95 F.3d 481,\r\n490-92 (7th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1254 (1997), that\r\ncounsel's failure to make a Fourth Amendment claim can never meet\r\nthe prejudice prong of a Sixth Amendment claim as delineated by\r\nStrickland.  \r\nAffirmed.\n",

Since the police knew they were to search Arroyo's apartment, he argues that the reasonable method of search would have been to try the keys and enter the apartment in that manner. (After the entry, the keys were in fact tried and one of them worked the lock.) The Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement has been taken to extend to the manner of entry and search. E.g., United States v. Ramirez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118180\"><a href=\"/opinion/118180/united-states-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 71 (1998); Richards v. Wisconsin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118103\"><a href=\"/opinion/118103/richards-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 395 n.5 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds, as one might expect, that there is normally good reason to act swiftly in drug searches. Within the apartment there may be defendants who ignore the knock and proceed to destroy evidence, flee through windows or other exits, or prepare to shoot at the police as they enter. These concerns have been so far recognized that they may sometimes justify entry without a prior knock and announcement. See Richards v. Wisconsin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118103\"><a href=\"/opinion/118103/richards-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 394 (1997). On this premise the government argues that the police did not have to try nine keys (none of which might have proved to be the right key) in order to effect a reasonable entry. As it turned out, nobody was in the apartment when the police entered it, but the police could not know this in advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With some ingenuity, Arroyo's counsel counters by pointing out that in Richards, 520 U.S. at 394, the Court held that before the police can dispense with the ordinary knock and announce requirement, they must have a \"reasonable suspicion\" that making their presence known would be dangerous, futile, or damaging to their investigation. In this case, Arroyo does not dispute the government's contention that the knock and announce rule was complied with;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but Arroyo says that the same rationale ought to require the police to try keys already in their possession unless they have a \"reasonable suspicion\" that there may be someone within to destroy evidence, flee or threaten the lives of the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without conceding the analogy, the government says that in this case the surrounding circumstances did create such a reasonable suspicion that others might be within, since there was reason to believe that other persons were involved with Arroyo's drug activities and that Arroyo was conducting a fairly large scale operation involving multiple locations. One could argue about the inferences to be drawn and, since the issue was never litigated, it is far from clear that we have all the facts that might support or undermine a claim of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is sufficient that the Sixth Amendment argument made by Arroyo's present counsel is more a tribute to his own insight and imagination than anything approaching proof that trial counsel was incompetent in failing to make such arguments himself. Challenging the method of entry rather than the existence of probable cause is itself unusual; and the idea that the police had some obligation to try nine different keys to enter a suspected drug scene would not occur to most judges or lawyers, let alone to police officers in the course of a raid. Only the use of Richards as the basis for a rather clever argument provides any hope of converting the sow's ear into a silk purse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is thus no basis for thinking that trial counsel was incompetent in failing to seek to suppress the fruits of the search on the ground now suggested. We leave for another day the interesting issues that may arise from too ready resort to battering rams. It is also unnecessary for us to consider the government's inevitable discovery argument or its suggestion that we adopt the Seventh Circuit's rule in Holman v.
