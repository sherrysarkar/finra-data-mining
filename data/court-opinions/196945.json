Louis Andrade was  convicted\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\r\n\nof possessing cocaine base with intent  to distribute. He was\r\n\nsentenced to  168 months in prison.  He appeals from both his\r\n\nconviction and his sentence. \r\n\n          Andrade's main argument is that the evidence seized\r\n\nwhen the car in which he  was riding was stopped by  officers\r\n\nfrom  the Boston  Anti-Gang  Violence Unit  should have  been\r\n\nsuppressed.  He says that the ostensible reason for the stop,\r\n\na traffic violation, was  only a pretext to search the car in\r\n\nhope  of proving more serious charges.  For these charges, he\r\n\nsays,  there then  existed  no probable  cause or  reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion.  His argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's\r\n\ndecision in Whren v.  United States, 116 S. Ct.  1769 (1996),\r                                               \r\n\ndecided  after  this case  was  initially briefed.    He also\r\n\nargues that the 14.21 grams of cocaine base with which he was\r\n\ncaught  was so  small an  amount that  it is  unreasonable to\r\n\ninfer  that he  had the  needed intent  to distribute.   This\r\n\nargument  is without merit.   As for  Andrade's challenges to\r\n\nhis  sentence,  his  argument  based on  the  distinction  in\r\n\nseverity  of  sentences  between  crack  cocaine  and  powder\r\n\ncocaine  is foreclosed.  That distinction  does not  permit a\r\n\ndownward  departure in sentence.   There was no  error in the\r\n\nenhancement of his sentence  for his attempt to shoot  one of\r\n\nthe arresting officers.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n          We recite  the facts  as the jury  could reasonably\r\n\nhave found them.  Andrade was a passenger in a car which made\r\n\nan  ill-considered and  illegal U-turn  in front  of oncoming\r\n\ntraffic on Columbia Road in Boston on February 20, 1994. This\r\n\nmaneuver was  observed at around  8:00 p.m by  Officers Byrne\r\n\nand Linskey  of  the  Anti-Gang Violence  Unit.    Byrne  and\r\n\nLinskey were patrolling the area in an unmarked car driven by\r\n\nOfficer  Freeman   of  the  same  unit.    The  Unit  gathers\r\n\nintelligence on gangs, leading to arrests  of gang members in\r\n\nthe Roxbury, Mattapan,  and Dorchester areas of Boston.   The\r\n\nUnit uses motor  vehicle violations as a  tool to investigate\r\n\ngang activities.\r\n\n          The officers followed the car, and saw three adults\r\n\nin the  vehicle.   They also  saw that the  car had  a broken\r\n\ntaillight.    As the  car  slowed to  a  stop in  front  of a\r\n\nbuilding on Seaver Street, the officers turned  on their wig-\r\n\nwag  light  and then  approached the  car  on foot.   Officer\r\n\nFreeman  identified himself  and  asked  the  driver,  Sandra\r\n\nWright, for  her license, while Officer  Linskey detained the\r\n\nfront  seat  passenger,   Terrell  Andrade  (Louis  Andrade's\r\n\nbrother), who had  emerged from the  car. As Officer  Freeman\r\n\nshone a flashlight into the car, he saw, in the center of the\r\n\nfront seat, a plastic  bag containing an off-white, rock-like\r\n\nsubstance which looked  like crack cocaine.   He leaned  into\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthe car and picked up the bag and then signalled to the other\r\n\nofficers to handcuff Wright and Terrell Andrade. \r\n\n           Officer Freeman  then went to open  the right rear\r\n\npassenger  door, next  to  where Louis  Andrade was  sitting.\r\n\nWhile Officer Freeman  spoke to Andrade, he  saw that Andrade\r\n\nwas  sitting stiffly  with  his left  hand  behind his  back.\r\n\nAndrade ignored  Officer Freeman's  several commands  that he\r\n\ntake  his hand from behind  his back.   Drawing their service\r\n\npistols,  Officers Freeman  and  Byrne yelled  at Andrade  to\r\n\nremove his hand  from behind  his back.   Andrade pulled  his\r\n\nleft  hand from  behind  his back  and  threw out,  onto  the\r\n\nstreet, a  bag containing  a substance  which appeared  to be\r\n\ncrack  cocaine.    When  Officer Freeman  then  attempted  to\r\n\nhandcuff Andrade,  Andrade lurched backward into  the car and\r\n\ntried to reach down to the floor.  As Officer  Freeman leaned\r\n\ninto  the  car  toward Andrade,  he  suddenly  saw  a gun  in\r\n\nAndrade's hand.  He screamed \"gun,\" pushed  himself away from\r\n\nAndrade, saw a flash,  and heard a noise.   Believing Officer\r\n\nFreeman had been  shot (he  was not), Officer  Byrne fired  a\r\n\nsingle shot at Andrade, hitting him in the leg and ending the\r\n\nconfrontation.\r\n\n          Officer Linskey then pulled  Andrade out of the car\r\n\nand asked  him where the  gun was.   Andrade denied  having a\r\n\ngun, but  Sandra Wright yelled  \"check his ankles;  check his\r\n\nankles.\" The officers did so and  found the gun, not on Louis\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nAndrade's ankle,  but on the  floor of the car  near to where\r\n\nAndrade had been sitting.  A spent cartridge was found jammed\r\n\nin the  gun's chamber,  indicating that  the weapon  had been\r\n\nfired, and, fortuitously, that  no additional rounds could be\r\n\nfired.   An upset Sandra Wright continued to scream \"the dude\r\n\nin  the back shot at  a cop; the  dude in the back  shot at a\r\n\ncop; I could have gotten shot.\"\r\n\n          Accompanying  Louis  Andrade  on  the ride  to  the\r\n\nhospital,  Linskey  observed  Andrade  attempting  to  remove\r\n\n$260.00,  in  mostly ten  and twenty  dollar bills,  from his\r\n\npants pocket.  Linskey later found another plastic bag in the\r\n\nsame pocket.   That bag,  like the others,  contained cocaine\r\n\nbase  (\"crack\");  the two  bags  connected  to Louis  Andrade\r\n\ntotalled  some 14.21 grams in weight.  That amount of cocaine\r\n\nis enough for 140 \"jums\" (doses) or \"dime bags.\"\r\n\n          In a  four  count indictment,  Andrade was  charged\r\n\nwith possession with intent  to distribute cocaine base, with\r\n\nunlawful  possession by  a convicted  felon of a  firearm and\r\n\nammunition,  with   possession  of   a  firearm  bearing   an\r\n\nobliterated serial  number, and  with using a  firearm during\r\n\nand  in relation  to  a drug  trafficking  crime.   The  jury\r\n\nconvicted on  the drug  possession  count under  21 U.S.C.   \r\n\n841(a)(1)  and  deadlocked  on  the  firearms  counts.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court denied  subsequent  motions for  judgment  of\r\n\nacquittal and for a new trial.   Andrade was sentenced to 168\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nmonths in prison  and four years  supervised release.   After\r\n\nsentencing, the  court dismissed  the firearms counts  on the\r\n\ngovernment's motion. \r\n\n                              II\r\n\n          Andrade makes three attacks  on his conviction.  He\r\n\nargues that the trial judge erroneously denied his  motion to\r\n\nsuppress  the  evidence   seized  during  the   \"warrantless,\r\n\npretextual traffic stop of  the car in which defendant  was a\r\n\npassenger.\"   He  also says  that the  evidence of  intent to\r\n\ndistribute   the  drugs   was   insufficient  to   support  a\r\n\nconviction, and that  the thinness of that evidence  at least\r\n\nentitles him to a new trial.  Although ably  briefed, none of\r\n\nthese arguments prevails.\r\n\nA. The Suppression Motion\r                                     \r\n\n          Andrade  filed  a motion  to suppress  the evidence\r\n\nseized during the  car stop on the  theory that the  stop was\r\n\npretextual.   The district court held  an evidentiary hearing\r\n\nand determined the stop  was not pretextual but was  made, as\r\n\nthe  officers said,  to investigate  why the  car had  made a\r\n\n\"sharp, harsh U-turn\" into oncoming traffic.  The court later\r\n\nmodified  its  ruling to  note  that  there was  evidence  to\r\n\nsuggest  a second  motive for  the stop,  but that  under the\r\n\nobjective test of United States v. Miller, 589 F.2d 1117 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir.  1978), cert.  denied,  440 U.S.  958 (1979),  any mixed\r                                      \r\n\nmotive was irrelevant.  Our review of the ultimate conclusion\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nas to whether the  Fourth Amendment was violated is  de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nOrnelas v. United States, 116 S. Ct. 1657, 1662 (1996).\r                                    \r\n\n          In support of his claim that the motion to suppress\r\n\nshould have  been granted, Andrade relies on  a theory firmly\r\n\nrejected  by the  Supreme  Court in  Whren.   In  Whren,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupreme Court  affirmed the denial  of a  motion to  suppress\r\n\ndrugs  seized when  the police  stopped a  car for  a traffic\r\n\nviolation.   The Court held that the temporary detention of a\r\n\nmotorist upon probable cause to believe the traffic laws have\r\n\nbeen  violated does  not  transgress the  Fourth  Amendment's\r\n\nprohibition on  unreasonable seizures,  even  if the  officer\r\n\nwould not  have stopped  the motorist absent  some additional\r\n\nlaw  enforcement  objective.  Whren,  116  S.  Ct.  at  1774.\r                                               \r\n\nBecause  the Fourth  Amendment allows  certain actions  to be\r\n\ntaken in certain  circumstances, regardless  of motives,  the\r\n\nCourt rejected  any  inquiry into  the  officers'  subjective\r\n\nintent or into what a \"reasonable officer\" would have done in\r\n\nsimilar  circumstances.  Id.  at  1775.      The  Court  thus\r                                        \r\n\nforeclosed any  argument that ulterior motives can invalidate\r\n\nan otherwise justified traffic stop. Id. at 1774.\r                                                    \r\n\n          Here, the illegal  U-turn plainly provided probable\r\n\ncause to stop  the car  for violating the  traffic laws,  and\r\n\nAndrade does not  argue otherwise.  Under  Whren, the inquiry\r                                                            \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nstops there, as does  Andrade's appeal on this point.1   Id.;\r                                                                       \r\n\nsee also United States v. Abernathy, 83 F.3d 17, 19 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1996) (officers on  undercover investigatory narcotics detail\r\n\nmay lawfully make traffic violation stop).\r\n\nB. Evidence of Intent to Distribute\r                                               \r\n\n          Andrade's  remaining attacks  are  premised on  his\r\n\ncontention  that the  evidence did  not show  that he  had an\r\n\nintent to distribute the cocaine  base, even if the  evidence\r\n\nwere sufficient to show  that he did possess it  for personal\r\n\nuse.  He challenges  the district court's denial of  both his\r\n\nRule 29  motion for a judgment  of acquittal and his  Rule 33\r\n\nmotion for a new trial.\r\n\n          1. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal\r                                                         \r\n\n          In  a sufficiency challenge,  we determine whether,\r\n\ndrawing   all   reasonable  inferences   in   favor   of  the\r\n\nprosecution,  a  rational  jury  could find  guilt  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt.  United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In his reply brief, Andrade argues that the potential for\r\ndiscriminatory  treatment of members  of minority communities\r\nrequires courts  to invalidate pretextual traffic  stops.  He\r\nsuggests that circumstantial  evidence, particularly  Officer\r\nByrne's description of  the occupants of the car  as \"black,\"\r\nindicates that racial animus was at work  here.  This line of\r\nargument  was  rejected in  Whren,  where  the Supreme  Court\r                                             \r\npointed out  that \"the constitutional basis  for objecting to\r\nintentionally discriminatory application  of the laws  is the\r\nEqual Protection Clause,  not the  Fourth Amendment.\"  Whren,\r                                                                        \r\n116  S. Ct. at 1774.   In any event,  we need not pursue this\r\nissue further; it was not raised in Andrade's principal brief\r\nto this court and is therefore waived.  See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\nEdgar, 82 F.3d 499, 510 (1st Cir.), petition for cert. filed,\r                                                                        \r\n65 U.S.L.W. 3110 (U.S. July 16, 1996)(No. 96-5082).\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n1142,  1149(1st  Cir. 1995),  cert. denied,  116 S.  Ct. 1879\r                                                      \r\n\n(1996).\r\n\n          It would,  of course,  be unusual  for there  to be\r\n\ndirect  evidence of  a defendant's  intent to  distribute the\r\n\ndrugs in his  possession where the defendant  is not observed\r\n\ndealing drugs but instead is merely found with the drugs.  As\r\n\na result, juries,  and courts, have to decide what inferences\r\n\nmay  be  reasonably drawn  from the  available circumstantial\r\n\nevidence. See United States  v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675,  678\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  That evidence may include information about\r\n\nthe  amounts and types of  the drugs possessed  and about the\r\n\naccompanying accoutrements,  such as  the sums of  money also\r\n\nfound, whether there is drug weighing, cutting, and packaging\r\n\nparaphernalia,  whether a weapon is used, and the like.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g.,  id.  at  678-79  (considering  layout  of  defendant's\r                      \r\n\napartment, amount  of cocaine  found, and  the presence of  a\r\n\nscale and a ledger as corroborative of intent).\r\n\n          To  support  his  insufficiency  argument,  Andrade\r\n\nrelies  upon United States v.  Valerio, 48 F.3d  58 (1st Cir.\r                                                  \r\n\n1995).  There, this court vacated a conviction for possession\r\n\nof  powder  cocaine with  intent  to  distribute because  the\r\n\nevidence was  insufficient to  prove that the  defendant knew\r\n\nabout the large quantities of cocaine which were hidden in an\r\n\napartment in which  she was  a short-term guest.  Id. at  64.\r                                                                 \r\n\nThe court found that the defendant could only have been found\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nto be  aware of 14.83  grams of cocaine hidden  in her baby's\r\n\nshoe;  this was \"not large  enough\" a quantity  to support an\r\n\ninference of distributive intent. Id.2\r                                                 \r\n\n          This  is a  different case and  we have  no trouble\r\n\naffirming the jury verdict.  To start, this case involves not\r\n\ncocaine  powder, but cocaine base  or \"crack.\"   The cases on\r\n\nwhich   Andrade  relies   involve  powder   cocaine  (cocaine\r\n\nhydrochloride),  not  crack cocaine  (cocaine base)  which is\r\n\nmore  potent  and  is  sold  in  much  smaller  doses.    The\r\n\nlegislative  history  of  the  federal  drug  laws repeatedly\r\n\nindicates that  crack's greater  potency is a  primary reason\r\n\nthat offenses involving crack  receive higher penalties  than\r\n\ndo those  involving similar amounts of powder  cocaine.  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., United  States v.  Buckner, 894  F.2d 975,  978-80 (8th\r                                            \r\n\nCir. 1990)(compiling statements  of members  of Congress  and\r\n\nhearing testimony of  drug abuse experts).  For example, when\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Andrade  also draws  our  attention to  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\nMartinez, 44 F.3d 148 (2d Cir. 1995), in which a panel of the\r                    \r\nSecond  Circuit (over Judge Walker's dissent) initially found\r\nthe evidence  of intent to distribute  insufficient where the\r\ndefendant  possessed 3.5 grams of powder  cocaine, as well as\r\none-half ounce  of \"cut,\" a one gram scale, and a gun. Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n151.   However, the panel later  reconsidered its disposition\r\nof  the  case and  decided  to  affirm Martinez's  conviction\r\nbecause \"any amount of drugs,  however small, will support  a\r\nconviction  when there  is additional  evidence of  intent to\r\ndistribute.\"  See Martinez  v. United  States, 54  F.3d 1040,\r                                                         \r\n1043  (2d Cir.),  cert. denied,  116 S.  Ct. 545  (1995). The\r                                          \r\n\"cut,\"  the scale,  and particularly  the firearm,  which \"by\r\nitself  provided strong  evidence of  intent to  distribute,\"\r\nsupported  the inference  that the  defendant was  engaged in\r\ndrug trafficking. Id.  \r                                 \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nCongress    disapproved   proposed    Sentencing   Guidelines\r\n\namendments  that  would  have  equalized  the  penalties  for\r\n\noffenses involving crack and powder cocaine, the House Report\r\n\nnoted the \"unique  nature of the  crack cocaine trade,  which\r\n\noften  entails trafficking  in much  smaller  quantities than\r\n\nwith  powder cocaine.\"  H.R.  Rep. No. 272,  104th Cong., 1st\r\n\nSess. 3  (1995).   Thus,  whether  or not  14.21  grams is  a\r                              \r\n\n\"small\" amount of powder cocaine, it is not a small amount of\r\n\ncrack cocaine.  \r\n\n          Nor was  unadorned evidence of amount  all that the\r\n\njury had to  go on.   The government's  expert witness,  Sgt.\r\n\nKevin Buckley, who had  been involved in more than  1000 drug\r\n\ninvestigations, testified  that the  amount of  crack cocaine\r\n\nAndrade possessed  could make  more than  140 \"jums,\"  with a\r\n\nstreet value of at least $1400; that he had never seen a mere\r\n\nuser with more  than 8-10 \"jums\" at  a time; that  mere users\r\n\ntypically use all of  their cash to feed their habit;  that a\r\n\nmere user usually smokes all of the crack he can obtain right\r\n\naway;  and that, in Boston, crack is  usually sold in $10 and\r\n\n$20 bags.  Also, Andrade had no implements  with him to smoke\r\n\nthe crack.   This was  enough, even without  consideration of\r\n\nthe presence of  the firearm.   The jury  had ample  evidence\r\n\nfrom which  to draw  the inference  of intent  to distribute.\r\n\nCf.  United States v. Bergodere,  40 F.3d 512,  518 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1994)(affirming  intent finding  where total value  of heroin\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nseized was $1500  and gun and  drug packaging materials  were\r\n\nfound), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1439 (1995).  The inferences\r                                \r\n\ndrawn by the  jury were  thus proper and  reasonable, and  we\r\n\naffirm  the  district court's  denial  of  Andrade's Rule  29\r\n\nmotion.\r\n\n          2. Motion for a New Trial\r                                               \r\n\n          Andrade  asks that,  even if  we find  the evidence\r\n\nsufficient  to sustain the jury  verdict, we grant  him a new\r\n\ntrial in the interest of justice. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.3  \r                                                 \r\n\nHowever,  \"the decision  to  grant or  deny  a new  trial  is\r\n\ncommitted  to the  sound discretion  of the  district court.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Soto-Alvarez, 958  F.2d 473, 479 (1st Cir.),\r                                         \r\n\ncert. denied,  506 U.S. 877 (1992).  Thus, we will affirm the\r                        \r\n\ndistrict  court's denial of a new trial unless there has been\r\n\na  \"manifest abuse of discretion.\"   United States v.

Wright, Federal Practice &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nProcedure: Criminal     559  (2d  ed.  1982)(appellate  court\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The  government argues  that Andrade's  motion for  a new\r\ntrial   was  untimely,   and  that   the  court   thus  lacks\r\njurisdiction to consider  it.  However, on December 22, 1994,\r\njust two  days after the guilty  verdict, defendant's counsel\r\nfiled a motion  for leave to file a Rule 33 motion at a later\r\ndate;  the district  judge  allowed  that  motion.   Rule  33\r\nexpressly permits  the court  to extend  the  time limit  for\r\nfiling a motion. Motions  shall be made \"within 7  days after\r\nverdict or finding of  guilty or within such further  time as\r                                                                         \r\nthe court may fix during the 7-day period.\" Fed. R.  Crim. P.\r                             \r\n33 (emphasis  added).   Andrade's  Rule  33 motion  was  thus\r\ntimely, and we reach the merits of this claim.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n\"properly  defers\" to trial court on motion for a new trial).\r\n\n          The remedy of  a new  trial is rarely  used; it  is\r\n\nwarranted  \"only  where  there  would  be  a  miscarriage  of\r\n\njustice\" or \"where the evidence preponderates heavily against\r\n\nthe verdict.\"  United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 386\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1979)(internal quotations omitted).   Andrade does\r\n\nnot present any new  evidence or point to any grave errors by\r\n\nthe  trial judge,  but merely  reiterates his claim  that the\r\n\nevidence of intent was thin.  As we find that the evidence in\r\n\nthe record fully supported the jury's verdict, neither of the\r\n\nnecessary     conditions  for  a  new   trial  is  satisfied.\r\n\nAccordingly, the district court  did not abuse its discretion\r\n\nwhen it denied Andrade's Rule 33 motion.     \r\n\n                             III\r\n\n          Andrade's   appeals  from  his  sentence  are  also\r\n\nwithout merit.  Andrade's first  claim is that because  there\r\n\nis a disparity between  the punishments for crack and  powder\r\n\ncocaine, the trial judge  erred in not departing  downward to\r\n\nthe comparable  base offense  level for powder  cocaine.   He\r\n\nargues that  the recent report of  the Sentencing Commission,\r\n\nwhich   recommended   a  modification   of   this  disparity,\r\n\ndemonstrates that there are factors not adequately considered\r\n\nby the current  Guidelines. See  U.S.S.G   5K2.0,  p.s.   The\r                                           \r\n\ndistrict  court agreed  with Andrade  that the  disparity was\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n\"unfair\" and  that, in  the right circumstances,  a departure\r\n\nbased on the  Commission findings would be justified.   Here,\r\n\nhowever, the  district judge  found that  were she  to depart\r\n\ndownward,  Andrade's extensive  criminal  record  would  then\r\n\nrequire   a   substantial   compensatory  upward   departure.\r\n\nAccordingly, the  court set  Andrade's base offense  level at\r\n\n26,  the  required  level  under  the  Guidelines  for  cases\r\n\ninvolving between five and twenty grams of cocaine base.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(7).\r\n\n           The district court thus rejected Andrade's request\r\n\nfor a  departure  on a  discretionary,  not a  legal,  basis.\r\n\nWhile in other circumstances,  this court lacks  jurisdiction\r\n\nto  review  the  discretionary decisions  of  the  sentencing\r\n\njudge,  United States v. Sanchez,  81 F.3d 9,  10 (1st Cir.),\r                                            \r\n\npetition for cert. filed (U.S. July 8, 1996)(No. 96-5082), we\r                                    \r\n\nwould reject Andrade's  appeal here regardless.   As we  have\r\n\nheld, the Sentencing Commission's findings with regard to the\r\n\nsentence disparity between crack  and powder cocaine are \"not\r\n\na  ground for departure under   5K2.0.\"   Id. at 11; see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited   States  v.

Andrade  emphasizes  that  Congress, when  rejecting  the\r\nproposed equalization of crack and powder cocaine  penalties,\r\ninvited  the  Sentencing  Commission   to  come  up  with  an\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nto  depart  downward  based  on  the  sentencing  distinction\r\n\nbetween crack and powder  cocaine.  This court has  also held\r\n\nthe  distinction  to be  constitutional.    United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSingleterry, 29  F.3d 733,  739-41 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n115 S. Ct. 647 (1994). \r\n\n          Andrade also attacks  the district court's decision\r\n\nto  increase his sentence by  three levels for his aggravated\r\n\nassault  on  a  police  officer.   See  U.S.S.G.    3A1.2(b).\r                                                  \r\n\nAndrade contends  that  the presentence  report finding  that\r\n\nAndrade \"retrieved a gun,  which he had earlier  attempted to\r\n\nconceal . .  . and discharged it in the  direction of Officer\r\n\nFreeman\" was  unreliable and  unsupported by trial  evidence.\r\n\nAndrade argues that  the district judge  erred in relying  on\r\n\nthat report and on unreliable trial evidence.\r\n\n          In  a  sentencing appeal,  we  review  the district\r\n\ncourt's  findings of fact for  clear error, giving due regard\r\n\nto  the district  court's  credibility judgments.  18  U.S.C.\r\n\n  3742(e).   Here, the district judge's  finding that Andrade\r\n\nassaulted  Officer  Freeman  was  clearly based  on  her  own\r\n\nassessment  of the evidence presented at trial.  Her findings\r\n\non this point were explicit:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nalternative  proposal.   However,  as has  been observed,  \"a\r\ndirection to  study a matter,  even from Congress,  cannot be\r\nsaid  to change the  state of the  law (here,  the legal fact\r\nthat the  Commission has considered the  'circumstance'-- the\r\ndifference between crack and powder cocaine).\"  United States\r                                                                         \r\nv.

He says that the ostensible reason for the stop, a traffic violation, was only a pretext to search the car in hope of proving more serious charges.  For these charges, he says, there then existed no probable cause or reasonable suspicion.  His argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in  Whren v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), decided after this case was initially briefed.  He also argues that the 14.21 grams of cocaine base with which he was caught was so small an amount that it is unreasonable to infer that he had the needed intent to distribute.  This argument is without merit.  As for Andrade's challenges to his sentence, his argument based on the distinction in severity of sentences between crack cocaine and powder cocaine is foreclosed.

Andrade was a passenger in a car which made an ill-considered and illegal U-turn in front of oncoming traffic on Columbia Road in Boston on February 20, 1994.  This maneuver was observed at around 8:00 p.m by Officers Byrne and Linskey of the Anti-Gang Violence Unit.  Byrne and Linskey were patrolling the area in an unmarked car driven by Officer Freeman of the same unit.

As the car slowed to a stop in front of a building on Seaver Street, the officers turned on their wig-wag light and then approached the car on foot.  Officer Freeman identified himself and asked the driver, Sandra Wright, for her license, while Officer Linskey detained the front seat passenger, Terrell Andrade (Louis Andrade's brother), who had emerged from the car.  As Officer Freeman shone a flashlight into the car, he saw, in the center of the front seat, a plastic bag containing an off-white, rock-like substance which looked like crack cocaine.  He leaned into the car and picked up the bag and then signalled to the other officers to handcuff Wright and Terrell Andrade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Freeman then went to open the right rear passenger door, next to where Louis Andrade was sitting.  While Officer Freeman spoke to Andrade, he saw that Andrade was sitting stiffly with his left hand behind his back.  Andrade ignored Officer Freeman's several commands that he take his hand from behind his back.  Drawing their service pistols, Officers Freeman and Byrne yelled at Andrade to remove his hand from behind his back.  Andrade pulled his left hand from behind his back and threw out, onto the street, a bag containing a substance which appeared to be crack cocaine.  When Officer Freeman then attempted to handcuff Andrade, Andrade lurched backward into the car and tried to reach down to the floor.  As Officer Freeman leaned into the car toward Andrade, he suddenly saw a gun in Andrade's hand.  He screamed \"gun,\" pushed himself away from Andrade, saw a flash, and heard a noise.  Believing Officer Freeman had been shot (he was not), Officer Byrne fired a single shot at Andrade, hitting him in the leg and ending the confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Linskey then pulled Andrade out of the car and asked him where the gun was.  Andrade denied having a gun, but Sandra Wright yelled \"check his ankles;  check his ankles.\"   The officers did so and found the gun, not on Louis Andrade's ankle, but on the floor of the car near to where Andrade had been sitting.  A spent cartridge was found jammed in the gun's chamber, indicating that the weapon had been fired, and, fortuitously, that no additional rounds could be fired.  An upset Sandra Wright continued to scream \"the dude in the back shot at a cop;  the dude in the back shot at a cop;  I could have gotten shot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accompanying Louis Andrade on the ride to the hospital, Linskey observed Andrade attempting to remove $260.00, in mostly ten and twenty dollar bills, from his pants pocket.  Linskey later found another plastic bag in the same pocket.  That bag, like the others, contained cocaine base (\"crack\");  the two bags connected to Louis Andrade totalled some 14.21 grams in weight.  That amount of cocaine is enough for 140 \"jums\" (doses) or \"dime bags.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a four count indictment, Andrade was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, with unlawful possession by a convicted felon of a firearm and ammunition, with possession of a firearm bearing an obliterated serial number, and with using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.  The jury convicted on the drug possession count under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and deadlocked on the firearms counts.  The district court denied subsequent motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial.  Andrade was sentenced to 168 months in prison and four years supervised release.  After sentencing, the court dismissed the firearms counts on the government's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade makes three attacks on his conviction.  He argues that the trial judge erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized during the \"warrantless, pretextual traffic stop of the car in which defendant was a passenger.\"   He also says that the evidence of intent to distribute the drugs was insufficient to support a conviction, and that the thinness of that evidence at least entitles him to a new trial.  Although ably briefed, none of these arguments prevails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Suppression Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the car stop on the theory that the stop was pretextual.  The district court held an evidentiary hearing and determined the stop was not pretextual but was made, as the officers said, to investigate why the car had made a \"sharp, harsh U-turn\" into oncoming traffic.  The court later modified its ruling to note that there was evidence to suggest a second motive for the stop, but that under the objective test of  United States v. Miller, 589 F.2d 1117 (1st Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 958, 99 S.Ct. 1499, 59 L.Ed.2d 771 (1979), any mixed motive was irrelevant.  Our review of the ultimate conclusion as to whether the Fourth Amendment was violated is de novo.  Ornelas v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1662, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his claim that the motion to suppress should have been granted, Andrade relies on a theory firmly rejected by the Supreme Court in  Whren.   In  Whren, the Supreme Court affirmed the denial of a motion to suppress drugs seized when the police stopped a car for a traffic violation.  The Court held that the temporary detention of a motorist upon probable cause to believe the traffic laws have been violated does not transgress the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable seizures, even if the officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law enforcement objective.   Whren, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.   Because the Fourth Amendment allows certain actions to be taken in certain circumstances, regardless of motives, the Court rejected any inquiry into the officers' subjective intent or into what a \"reasonable officer\" would have done in similar circumstances.   Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1775.   The Court thus foreclosed any argument that ulterior motives can invalidate an otherwise justified traffic stop.   Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the illegal U-turn plainly provided probable cause to stop the car for violating the traffic laws, and Andrade does not argue otherwise.  Under  Whren, the inquiry stops there, as does Andrade's appeal on this point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   Id.;   see also United States v. Abernathy, 83 F.3d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1996) (officers on undercover investigatory narcotics detail may lawfully make traffic violation stop).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Evidence of Intent to Distribute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade's remaining attacks are premised on his contention that the evidence did not show that he had an intent to distribute the cocaine base, even if the evidence were sufficient to show that he did possess it for personal use.  He challenges the district court's denial of both his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal and his Rule 33 motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a sufficiency challenge, we determine whether, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1149 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1879, 135 L.Ed.2d 174 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would, of course, be unusual for there to be direct evidence of a defendant's intent to distribute the drugs in his possession where the defendant is not observed dealing drugs but instead is merely found with the drugs.  As a result, juries, and courts, have to decide what inferences may be reasonably drawn from the available circumstantial evidence.  See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 678 (1st Cir.1993).  That evidence may include information about the amounts and types of the drugs possessed and about the accompanying accoutrements, such as the sums of money also found, whether there is drug weighing, cutting, and packaging paraphernalia, whether a weapon is used, and the like.  See, e.g., id. at 678-79 (considering layout of defendant's apartment, amount of cocaine found, and the presence of a scale and a ledger as corroborative of intent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his insufficiency argument, Andrade relies upon  United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58 (1st Cir.1995).  There, this court vacated a conviction for possession of powder cocaine with intent to distribute because the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendant knew about the large quantities of cocaine which were hidden in an apartment in which she was a short-term guest.   Id. at 64.   The court found that the defendant could only have been found to be aware of 14.83 grams of cocaine hidden in her baby's shoe;  this was \"not large enough\" a quantity to support an inference of distributive intent.   Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a different case, and we have no trouble affirming the jury verdict.  To start, this case involves not cocaine powder, but cocaine base or \"crack.\"   The cases on which Andrade relies involve powder cocaine (cocaine hydrochloride), not crack cocaine (cocaine base) which is more potent and is sold in much smaller doses.  The legislative history of the federal drug laws repeatedly indicates that crack's greater potency is a primary reason that offenses involving crack receive higher penalties than do those involving similar amounts of powder cocaine.  See, e.g., United States v. Buckner, 894 F.2d 975, 978-80 (8th Cir.1990) (compiling statements of members of Congress and hearing testimony of drug abuse experts).  For example, when Congress disapproved proposed Sentencing Guidelines amendments that would have equalized the penalties for offenses involving crack and powder cocaine, the House Report noted the \"unique nature of the crack cocaine trade, which often entails trafficking in much smaller quantities than with powder cocaine.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 272, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1995).  Thus, whether or not 14.21 grams is a \"small\" amount of powder cocaine, it is not a small amount of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was unadorned evidence of amount all that the jury had to go on.  The government's expert witness, Sgt. Kevin Buckley, who had been involved in more than 1000 drug investigations, testified that the amount of crack cocaine Andrade possessed could make more than 140 \"jums,\" with a street value of at least $1400;  that he had never seen a mere user with more than 8-10 \"jums\" at a time;  that mere users typically use all of their cash to feed their habit;  that a mere user usually smokes all of the crack he can obtain right away;  and that, in Boston, crack is usually sold in $10 and $20 bags.  Also, Andrade had no implements with him to smoke the crack.  This was enough, even without consideration of the presence of the firearm.  The jury had ample evidence from which to draw the inference of intent to distribute.  Cf. United States v. Bergodere, 40 F.3d 512, 518 (1st Cir.1994) (affirming intent finding where total value of heroin seized was $1500 and gun and drug packaging materials were found), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1439, 131 L.Ed.2d 318 (1995).  The inferences drawn by the jury were thus proper and reasonable, and we affirm the district court's denial of Andrade's Rule 29 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Motion for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade asks that, even if we find the evidence sufficient to sustain the jury verdict, we grant him a new trial in the interest of justice.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  However, \"the decision to grant or deny a new trial is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\"   United States v. Soto-Alvarez, 958 F.2d 473, 479 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 877, 113 S.Ct. 221, 121 L.Ed.2d 159 (1992).  Thus, we will affirm the district court's denial of a new trial unless there has been a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\"   United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 972 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2554, 135 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1996);  see also 3 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure:  Criminal &#167; 559 (2d ed. 1982) (appellate court \"properly defers\" to trial court on motion for a new trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remedy of a new trial is rarely used;  it is warranted \"only where there would be a miscarriage of justice\" or \"where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.\"   United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 386 (1st Cir.1979) (internal quotations omitted).  Andrade does not present any new evidence or point to any grave errors by the trial judge, but merely reiterates his claim that the evidence of intent was thin.  As we find that the evidence in the record fully supported the jury's verdict, neither of the necessary conditions for a new trial is satisfied.  Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Andrade's Rule 33 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade's appeals from his sentence are also without merit.  Andrade's first claim is that because there is a disparity between the punishments for crack and powder cocaine, the trial judge erred in not departing downward to the comparable base offense level for powder cocaine.  He argues that the recent report of the Sentencing Commission, which recommended a modification of this disparity, demonstrates that there are factors not adequately considered by the current Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0, p.s.  The district court agreed with Andrade that the disparity was \"unfair\" and that, in the right circumstances, a departure based on the Commission findings would be justified.  Here, however, the district judge found that were she to depart downward, Andrade's extensive criminal record would then require a substantial compensatory upward departure.  Accordingly, the court set Andrade's base offense level at 26, the required level under the Guidelines for cases involving between five and twenty grams of cocaine base.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thus rejected Andrade's request for a departure on a discretionary, not a legal, basis.  While in other circumstances, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the discretionary decisions of the sentencing judge,  United States v. Sanchez, 81 F.3d 9, 10 (1st Cir.), petition for cert. denied, --- U.S.L.W. ---- (U.S. Oct. 7, 1996), we would reject Andrade's appeal here regardless.  As we have held, the Sentencing Commission's findings with regard to the sentence disparity between crack and powder cocaine are \"not a ground for departure under &#167; 5K2.0.\"   Id. at 11;  see also United States v. Camilo, 71 F.3d 984, 990 (1st Cir.1995) (noting congressional rejection of Guidelines amendments that would have eliminated disparity), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1555, 134 L.Ed.2d 657 (1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court thus had no discretion to depart downward based on the sentencing distinction between crack and powder cocaine.  This court has also held the distinction to be constitutional.   United States v. Singleterry, 29 F.3d 733, 739-41 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 647, 130 L.Ed.2d 552 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade also attacks the district court's decision to increase his sentence by three levels for his aggravated assault on a police officer.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.2(b).  Andrade contends that the presentence report finding that Andrade \"retrieved a gun, which he had earlier attempted to conceal ... and discharged it in the direction of Officer Freeman\" was unreliable and unsupported by trial evidence.  Andrade argues that the district judge erred in relying on that report and on unreliable trial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a sentencing appeal, we review the district court's findings of fact for clear error, giving due regard to the district court's credibility judgments.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e).  Here, the district judge's finding that Andrade assaulted Officer Freeman was clearly based on her own assessment of the evidence presented at trial.  Her findings on this point were explicit:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>I saw the testimony, I saw the witnesses.  I heard what Officer Freeman said.  I listened to him with 25 years of experience behind me.  And I believe him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade points to nothing in the record that renders these findings clearly erroneous.  As the evidence, including Wright's exclamation that \"that dude shot at a cop,\" supports a finding of aggravated assault on an officer, we affirm the three-level enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade's conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In his reply brief, Andrade argues that the potential for discriminatory treatment of members of minority communities requires courts to invalidate pretextual traffic stops.  He suggests that circumstantial evidence, particularly Officer Byrne's description of the occupants of the car as \"black,\" indicates that racial animus was at work here.  This line of argument was rejected in  Whren, where the Supreme Court pointed out that \"the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of the laws is the Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment.\"   Whren, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.   In any event, we need not pursue this issue further;  it was not raised in Andrade's principal brief to this court and is therefore waived.  See United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d 499, 510 (1st Cir.), petition for cert. filed, 65 U.S.L.W. 3110 (U.S. July 16, 1996) (No. 96-5082)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Andrade also draws our attention to  United States v. Martinez, 44 F.3d 148 (2d Cir.1995), in which a panel of the Second Circuit (over Judge Walker's dissent) initially found the evidence of intent to distribute insufficient where the defendant possessed 3.5 grams of powder cocaine, as well as one-half ounce of \"cut,\" a one gram scale, and a gun.   Id. at 151.   However, the panel later reconsidered its disposition of the case and decided to affirm Martinez's conviction because \"any amount of drugs, however small, will support a conviction when there is additional evidence of intent to distribute.\"   See United States v. Martinez, 54 F.3d 1040, 1043 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 545, 133 L.Ed.2d 448 (1995).  The \"cut,\" the scale, and particularly the firearm, which \"by itself provided strong evidence of intent to distribute,\" supported the inference that the defendant was engaged in drug trafficking.   Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The government argues that Andrade's motion for a new trial was untimely, and that the court thus lacks jurisdiction to consider it.  However, on December 22, 1994, just two days after the guilty verdict, defendant's counsel filed a motion for leave to file a Rule 33 motion at a later date;  the district judge allowed that motion.  Rule 33 expressly permits the court to extend the time limit for filing a motion.  Motions shall be made \"within 7 days after verdict or finding of guilty or within such further time as the court may fix during the 7-day period.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (emphasis added).  Andrade's Rule 33 motion was thus timely, and we reach the merits of this claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Andrade emphasizes that Congress, when rejecting the proposed equalization of crack and powder cocaine penalties, invited the Sentencing Commission to come up with an alternative proposal.  However, as has been observed, \"a direction to study a matter, even from Congress, cannot be said to change the state of the law (here, the legal fact that the Commission has considered the 'circumstance'--the difference between crack and powder cocaine).\"   United States v.

He says that the ostensible reason for the stop, a traffic violation, was only a pretext to search the car in hope of proving more serious charges.  For these charges, he says, there then existed no probable cause or reasonable suspicion.  His argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in  Whren v.

He also argues that the 14.21 grams of cocaine base with which he was caught was so small an amount that it is unreasonable to infer that he had the needed intent to distribute.  This argument is without merit.  As for Andrade's challenges to his sentence, his argument based on the distinction in severity of sentences between crack cocaine and powder cocaine is foreclosed.  That distinction does not permit a downward departure in sentence.

Andrade was a passenger in a car which made an ill-considered and illegal U-turn in front of oncoming traffic on Columbia Road in Boston on February 20, 1994.  This maneuver was observed at around 8:00 p.m by Officers Byrne and Linskey of the Anti-Gang Violence Unit.  Byrne and Linskey were patrolling the area in an unmarked car driven by Officer Freeman of the same unit.  The Unit gathers intelligence on gangs, leading to arrests of gang members in the Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester areas of Boston.  The Unit uses motor vehicle violations as a tool to investigate gang activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers followed the car and saw three adults in the vehicle.  They also saw that the car had a broken taillight.  As the car slowed to a stop in front of a building on Seaver Street, the officers turned on their wig-wag light and then approached the car on foot.  Officer Freeman identified himself and asked the driver, Sandra Wright, for her license, while Officer Linskey detained the front seat passenger, Terrell Andrade (Louis Andrade's brother), who had emerged from the car.  As Officer Freeman shone a flashlight into the car, he saw, in the center of the front seat, a plastic bag containing an off-white, rock-like substance which looked like crack cocaine.  He leaned into the car and picked up the bag and then signalled to the other officers to handcuff Wright and Terrell Andrade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Freeman then went to open the right rear passenger door, next to where Louis Andrade was sitting.  While Officer Freeman spoke to Andrade, he saw that Andrade was sitting stiffly with his left hand behind his back.  Andrade ignored Officer Freeman's several commands that he take his hand from behind his back.  Drawing their service pistols, Officers Freeman and Byrne yelled at Andrade to remove his hand from behind his back.  Andrade pulled his left hand from behind his back and threw out, onto the street, a bag containing a substance which appeared to be crack cocaine.  When Officer Freeman then attempted to handcuff Andrade, Andrade lurched backward into the car and tried to reach down to the floor.  As Officer Freeman leaned into the car toward Andrade, he suddenly saw a gun in Andrade's hand.  He screamed \"gun,\" pushed himself away from Andrade, saw a flash, and heard a noise.  Believing Officer Freeman had been shot (he was not), Officer Byrne fired a single shot at Andrade, hitting him in the leg and ending the confrontation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Linskey then pulled Andrade out of the car and asked him where the gun was.  Andrade denied having a gun, but Sandra Wright yelled \"check his ankles;  check his ankles.\"   The officers did so and found the gun, not on Louis Andrade's ankle, but on the floor of the car near to where Andrade had been sitting.  A spent cartridge was found jammed in the gun's chamber, indicating that the weapon had been fired, and, fortuitously, that no additional rounds could be fired.  An upset Sandra Wright continued to scream \"the dude in the back shot at a cop;  the dude in the back shot at a cop;  I could have gotten shot.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accompanying Louis Andrade on the ride to the hospital, Linskey observed Andrade attempting to remove $260.00, in mostly ten and twenty dollar bills, from his pants pocket.  Linskey later found another plastic bag in the same pocket.  That bag, like the others, contained cocaine base (\"crack\");  the two bags connected to Louis Andrade totalled some 14.21 grams in weight.  That amount of cocaine is enough for 140 \"jums\" (doses) or \"dime bags.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a four count indictment, Andrade was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, with unlawful possession by a convicted felon of a firearm and ammunition, with possession of a firearm bearing an obliterated serial number, and with using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.  The jury convicted on the drug possession count under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and deadlocked on the firearms counts.  The district court denied subsequent motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial.  Andrade was sentenced to 168 months in prison and four years supervised release.  After sentencing, the court dismissed the firearms counts on the government's motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade makes three attacks on his conviction.  He argues that the trial judge erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized during the \"warrantless, pretextual traffic stop of the car in which defendant was a passenger.\"   He also says that the evidence of intent to distribute the drugs was insufficient to support a conviction, and that the thinness of that evidence at least entitles him to a new trial.  Although ably briefed, none of these arguments prevails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Suppression Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the car stop on the theory that the stop was pretextual.  The district court held an evidentiary hearing and determined the stop was not pretextual but was made, as the officers said, to investigate why the car had made a \"sharp, harsh U-turn\" into oncoming traffic.  The court later modified its ruling to note that there was evidence to suggest a second motive for the stop, but that under the objective test of  United States v.

In  Whren, the Supreme Court affirmed the denial of a motion to suppress drugs seized when the police stopped a car for a traffic violation.  The Court held that the temporary detention of a motorist upon probable cause to believe the traffic laws have been violated does not transgress the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable seizures, even if the officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law enforcement objective.   Whren, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.   Because the Fourth Amendment allows certain actions to be taken in certain circumstances, regardless of motives, the Court rejected any inquiry into the officers' subjective intent or into what a \"reasonable officer\" would have done in similar circumstances.   Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1775.   The Court thus foreclosed any argument that ulterior motives can invalidate an otherwise justified traffic stop.

Evidence of Intent to Distribute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade's remaining attacks are premised on his contention that the evidence did not show that he had an intent to distribute the cocaine base, even if the evidence were sufficient to show that he did possess it for personal use.  He challenges the district court's denial of both his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal and his Rule 33 motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

As a result, juries, and courts, have to decide what inferences may be reasonably drawn from the available circumstantial evidence.  See United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 678 (1st Cir.1993).  That evidence may include information about the amounts and types of the drugs possessed and about the accompanying accoutrements, such as the sums of money also found, whether there is drug weighing, cutting, and packaging paraphernalia, whether a weapon is used, and the like.  See, e.g., id. at 678-79 (considering layout of defendant's apartment, amount of cocaine found, and the presence of a scale and a ledger as corroborative of intent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his insufficiency argument, Andrade relies upon  United States v. Valerio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195933\"><a href=\"/opinion/195933/united-states-v-valerio/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995).  There, this court vacated a conviction for possession of powder cocaine with intent to distribute because the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendant knew about the large quantities of cocaine which were hidden in an apartment in which she was a short-term guest.   Id. at 64.   The court found that the defendant could only have been found to be aware of 14.83 grams of cocaine hidden in her baby's shoe;  this was \"not large enough\" a quantity to support an inference of distributive intent.   Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a different case, and we have no trouble affirming the jury verdict.  To start, this case involves not cocaine powder, but cocaine base or \"crack.\"   The cases on which Andrade relies involve powder cocaine (cocaine hydrochloride), not crack cocaine (cocaine base) which is more potent and is sold in much smaller doses.  The legislative history of the federal drug laws repeatedly indicates that crack's greater potency is a primary reason that offenses involving crack receive higher penalties than do those involving similar amounts of powder cocaine.  See, e.g., United States v. Buckner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535661\"><a href=\"/opinion/535661/united-states-v-reginald-sinclair-buckner/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span>, 978-80 (8th Cir.1990) (compiling statements of members of Congress and hearing testimony of drug abuse experts).  For example, when Congress disapproved proposed Sentencing Guidelines amendments that would have equalized the penalties for offenses involving crack and powder cocaine, the House Report noted the \"unique nature of the crack cocaine trade, which often entails trafficking in much smaller quantities than with powder cocaine.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 272, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1995).  Thus, whether or not 14.21 grams is a \"small\" amount of powder cocaine, it is not a small amount of crack cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor was unadorned evidence of amount all that the jury had to go on.  The government's expert witness, Sgt. Kevin Buckley, who had been involved in more than 1000 drug investigations, testified that the amount of crack cocaine Andrade possessed could make more than 140 \"jums,\" with a street value of at least $1400;  that he had never seen a mere user with more than 8-10 \"jums\" at a time;  that mere users typically use all of their cash to feed their habit;  that a mere user usually smokes all of the crack he can obtain right away;  and that, in Boston, crack is usually sold in $10 and $20 bags.  Also, Andrade had no implements with him to smoke the crack.  This was enough, even without consideration of the presence of the firearm.  The jury had ample evidence from which to draw the inference of intent to distribute.  Cf. United States v. Bergodere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195758\"><a href=\"/opinion/195758/united-states-v-bergodere/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 518 (1st Cir.1994) (affirming intent finding where total value of heroin seized was $1500 and gun and drug packaging materials were found), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Andrade does not present any new evidence or point to any grave errors by the trial judge, but merely reiterates his claim that the evidence of intent was thin.  As we find that the evidence in the record fully supported the jury's verdict, neither of the necessary conditions for a new trial is satisfied.  Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Andrade's Rule 33 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andrade's appeals from his sentence are also without merit.  Andrade's first claim is that because there is a disparity between the punishments for crack and powder cocaine, the trial judge erred in not departing downward to the comparable base offense level for powder cocaine.  He argues that the recent report of the Sentencing Commission, which recommended a modification of this disparity, demonstrates that there are factors not adequately considered by the current Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0, p.s.  The district court agreed with Andrade that the disparity was \"unfair\" and that, in the right circumstances, a departure based on the Commission findings would be justified.  Here, however, the district judge found that were she to depart downward, Andrade's extensive criminal record would then require a substantial compensatory upward departure.  Accordingly, the court set Andrade's base offense level at 26, the required level under the Guidelines for cases involving between five and twenty grams of cocaine base.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thus rejected Andrade's request for a departure on a discretionary, not a legal, basis.

He suggests that circumstantial evidence, particularly Officer Byrne's description of the occupants of the car as \"black,\" indicates that racial animus was at work here.  This line of argument was rejected in  Whren, where the Supreme Court pointed out that \"the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of the laws is the Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment.\"   Whren, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.

Rule 33 expressly permits the court to extend the time limit for filing a motion.  Motions shall be made \"within 7 days after verdict or finding of guilty or within such further time as the court may fix during the 7-day period.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (emphasis added).
