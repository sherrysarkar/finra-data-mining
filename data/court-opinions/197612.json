Zaki appeals from summary\r\njudgments entered in favor of six insurance companies and\r\ndismissing Zaki's counterclaims.  Each insurer was granted\r\nrescission of one or more disability insurance policies issued\r\nto Zaki and, as applicable, Zaki was ordered to repay the\r\nbenefits which he received (less premiums paid) under the\r\npolicies.   Having carefully reviewed the judgments in light of\r\nthe extensive briefs and the record, we share the district\r\ncourt's well-reasoned view that there was no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact and that each insurer was entitled to judgment as\r\na matter of law.  The court did not misapply state law, nor did\r\nit misinterpret Zaki's waiver of the policies' incontestability\r\nclauses.  There was no relevant factual dispute as to Zaki's\r\nintent.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
