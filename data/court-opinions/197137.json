Plaintiff-appellant Caribbean\r                                           \r\n\nMushroom  Company,  Inc.  seeks  damages for  the  breach  of  an\r\n\nagreement to provide it with  a $100,000 loan.  The issue  before\r\n\nus  is whether the company  waited too long  to bring its action.\r\n\nThe  agreement  allegedly  was  breached in  January  1978.   The\r\n\nlawsuit was  filed nearly fifteen  years later, in  January 1993.\r\n\nThe district court  concluded that  the action was  subject to  a\r\n\nthree-year statute of limitations,  and therefore granted summary\r\n\njudgment for the defendants.  Our review of the relevant statutes\r\n\nand caselaw  persuades us that a  fifteen-year limitations period\r\n\napplies, and, consequently, that  the complaint was timely filed.\r\n\nWe therefore reverse.\r\n\n                          I. Background\r                                                 \r\n\n     The facts  underlying this  appeal are few,  and undisputed.\r\n\nIn November 1977, defendant Puerto Rico Development Fund (\"PRDF\")\r\n\nsent  plaintiff  Caribbean  Mushroom Co.,  Inc.  (\"Caribbean\")  a\r\n\ncommitment  letter in which it agreed to loan Caribbean $100,000,\r\n\nsubject to specific terms  and conditions.1  On or  about January\r\n\n10,  1978, PRDF  informed Caribbean  that it  would not  loan the\r\n\nmoney.   Caribbean brought  this diversity  action on  January 7,\r\n\n1993, alleging that PRDF's refusal to make the loan constituted a\r\n\nbreach of contract.  It claimed $4.5 million in damages.\r\n\n     PRDF  filed a  motion for  summary judgment  alleging, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia,  that Caribbean's claim was time barred.  It contended that\r              \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1 PRDF  is a department  of the Government  Development Bank\r\nfor  Puerto Rico, the other defendant.  For convenience, we refer\r\nthroughout this opinion only to PRDF as defendant.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nthe applicable  statute of limitations was  the three-year period\r\n\nprovided  in Article 946 of  the Puerto Rico  Commerce Code, P.R.\r\n\nLaws Ann. tit. 10,   1908.  Caribbean argued in response that the\r\n\naction was governed by  Article 1864 of the Civil  Code of Puerto\r\n\nRico, P.R. Laws  Ann. tit. 31,   5294, which  sets a fifteen-year\r\n\nlimitations  period for  actions for  which there is  no specific\r\n\nterm  set.  Because Caribbean's  lawsuit was filed  just short of\r\n\nfifteen years after the alleged breach,  it is viable only if the\r\n\nlonger period applies.\r\n\n     The district court sided  with PRDF.  It concluded  that the\r\n\ndisputed transaction fell under the  Commerce Code and its three-\r\n\nyear limitations provision for  actions arising out of commercial\r\n\ninstruments because it involved  an agreement to loan money  to a\r\n\nmerchant  for   a  commercial   purpose.    The   court  rejected\r\n\nplaintiff's  contention that  the  fifteen-year provision  should\r\n\napply because the  claim involved  a breach of  contract and  not\r\n\nenforcement of  the terms of a commercial loan.  In doing so, the\r\n\ncourt  invoked First Circuit  precedent holding  that \"`litigants\r\n\ncannot circumvent a specific provision of the Puerto Rico Code by\r\n\ncharacterizing their  claims generally as a  \"breach of contract\"\r\n\nin order to obtain the benefit of a longer statute of limitations\r\n\nperiod,'\"  Caribbean Mushroom  Co.  v. Government  Dev. Bank  for\r                                                                           \r\n\nPuerto  Rico, 906 F. Supp.  70, 74 (D.P.R.  1995) (quoting Rivera\r                                                                           \r\n\nSurillo &amp; Co. v. Falconer Glass  Indus., 37 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1994)).   The court's  determination on the  limitations question\r\n\nled it to grant summary judgment for defendants.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n     On  appeal,   Caribbean  argues  that  the   district  court\r\n\nmisconstrued the scope of Article  946, which contains the three-\r\n\nyear deadline, and erroneously invoked the Rivera Surillo line of\r                                                                   \r\n\ncases barring litigants from  broadly classifying their claims as\r\n\ncontractual  breaches  to  avoid  more  particular,  and shorter,\r\n\nlimitations  provisions.   Caribbean  contends  that  it has  not\r\n\nartificially re-characterized its lawsuit  to fall under  Article\r\n\n1864, but that  the fifteen-year period applies because  no other\r\n\nlimitations provision fits.\r\n\n     Although  the  district  court's  resort to  the  three-year\r\n\nlimitations period  attracts us  as a  practical matter,  we have\r\n\nconcluded that  it is  not supportable  as a matter  of law.   We\r\n\nexplain our reasoning in the following section.\r\n\n                          II.

That provision reads in its entirety as follows:\r\n\n          Actions arising from drafts shall extinguish three\r\n     years  after maturity,  whether such  drafts have  been\r\n     protested or not.\r\n\n          A  similar  rule  shall be  applied  to commercial\r\n     bills  of exchange and  promissory notes, checks, stubs\r\n     and  other  instruments of  draft  or  exchange and  to\r\n     coupons and  amounts for the  redemption of obligations\r\n     issued in accordance with this Code.\r\n\nP.R.  Laws Ann.  tit. 10    1908.   Plaintiffs maintain  that the\r\n\napplicable term  is  the Civil  Code's  fifteen-year  \"catch-all\"\r\n\nprovision, which governs when \"no special term of prescription is\r\n\nfixed,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,   5294 (\"Article 1864\").\r\n\n     It  is undisputed  that  Article 946  (setting a  three-year\r\n\nterm) does not on its face govern here because no promissory note\r\n\nor  other  commercial  instrument  was issued  by  defendants  to\r\n\nCaribbean.   The  district  court's  view,  urged  on  appeal  by\r\n\ndefendants, is that the three-year limitation nonetheless applies\r\n\nbecause  the agreement  at  issue essentially  was equivalent  to\r\n\nthose transactions explicitly covered  by the provision.  Indeed,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3 The parties do not dispute that the contract at issue here\r\nis governed by the Commerce  Code.  Consequently, the defendant's\r\nand district  court's  reliance on  Buena  Vista Dairy,  Inc.  v.\r                                                                       \r\nAponte,  108 P.R.  Dec. 657, 660,  8 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 698, 700\r                \r\n(1979), is  misplaced.   In that  case, the  court held that  the\r\nCommerce  Code  applied to  causes  of  action \"ancillary\"  to  a\r\ncommercial agreement even if  such claims might not have  met the\r\nrequirements  of the Code on their own.  Because applicability of\r\nthe Commerce  Code  is uncontested  here,  it is  unnecessary  to\r\ninvoke the \"ancillary\" claim doctrine.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nCaribbean  observed in  its  response to  defendants' motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment  that caselaw  has extended Article  946's reach\r\n\n\"past  actions  on  instruments per  se  to  suits  on loans  not\r                                                                           \r\n\nreflected  in   instruments   but  which   nevertheless  have   a\r\n\n`commercial' basis.\"\r\n\n     On appeal,  Caribbean drops this broad  depiction of Article\r\n\n946's  scope,  and now  argues that  the three-year  provision is\r\n\nconfined to  actions based on commercial  instruments.4  Contrary\r\n\nto defendants' assertions, this is not a new argument that should\r\n\nbe cast aside  because it was not offered below.  Rather, it is a\r\n\nnarrowing of  Caribbean's earlier  position.  While  Caribbean no\r\n\nlonger  acknowledges  that  Article  946 can  extend  beyond  its\r\n\nliteral  terms,  it consistently  has  argued that  this  case is\r\n\noutside the statute's range.   Its position below was  that, even\r\n\nif Article 946 can be construed flexibly to cover suits on loans,\r\n\nit  does not govern this  case because the  transaction sued upon\r\n\nwas  not  a loan  agreement, but  a  contract in  which defendant\r                                                                           \r\n\npromised to make a loan.5   Because no provision of  the Commerce\r                                 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4  In its  brief on  appeal, Caribbean states  that \"[u]ntil\r\nnow, the  statute has never once  been held to bar  an action not\r\ninvolving  an instrument -- every court to which the question has\r\never been presented has held that it did not so apply.\"  Brief at\r                                                      \r\n6 (emphasis in original).\r\n\n     5 In its  opposition to PRDF's motion  for summary judgment,\r\nplaintiff argued:\r\n\n     The statutory  provision is clearly  inapplicable here,\r\n     not because this  action is  on a loan  which is  \"non-\r\n     commercial\" but because it is not on a loan at all.\r\n\n          This  action is not on an instrument or on a loan,\r                                                           \r\n     commercial or  otherwise.  It rather  seeks damages for\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nCode sets  a limitation  period for commercial  contract actions,\r\n\nCaribbean maintained  -- and  continues to  maintain --  that the\r\n\nCivil Code's fifteen-year provision applies.\r\n\n     The threshold question, then, is whether Article 946 governs\r\n\nthe   dispute  underlying   this   case.     Despite  Caribbean's\r\n\nrepresentation to  the district court  that Article 946  has been\r\n\nconstrued flexibly, we have found no case applying the three-year\r\n\nlimitations  period  to  an  action  arising  from  a  commercial\r\n\nagreement  that  does  not  involve   an  instrument  such  as  a\r\n\npromissory note.6  The primary cases cited by defendants focus on\r\n\nthe  preliminary  question  of  whether the  loan  sued  upon  is\r\n\ncommercial.  In each case, a  note had been issued, and a finding\r\n\nthat  the underlying  transaction was commercial  therefore would\r\n\nmean that  that  case would  fall  within Article  946's  literal\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     the breach of  a contract,  a suit of  a far  different\r\n     sort.   The  distinction between  an action  to recover\r\n     money due under an agreement and one to recover damages\r\n     sustained  by breach  of that  agreement is  almost too\r\n     obvious and well recognized to require comment.  . . .\r\n\n          If PRDF had gone through with its loan commitment,\r\n     a later action  by it  against CMC based  on such  loan\r\n     might very  well . . . have  been within the purview of\r\n     Article  946 as  a suit  on a  \"commercial\" obligation.\r\n     From  the other end, on the same reasoning, even a suit\r\n     by CMC to enforce  the loan agreement -- to  compel the\r\n     making  of the loan --  might perhaps have been covered\r\n     by the statute.  No such suit is here present, however.\r\n     This is  not  an action  on the  contract that  existed\r\n     between the  parties but  a  suit for  damages for  its\r\n     breach.\r\n\nOpposition at 12.\r\n\n     6  Caribbean's statement,  contained  in a  footnote of  its\r\nsummary judgment response, was not supported by citations.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nlanguage.

(Issue  #2)  313, 314  (1986)  (\"Juridical\r\n\nDisaster\")  (\"Both  the  loan  and  the  note  are  distinct  and\r\n\nseparable  contracts and as such  they give rise  to two distinct\r\n\nand separable actions\") (footnote omitted).\r\n\n     The absence of identified caselaw extending the provision to\r\n\nthese or  similar circumstances,  together with our  own cautious\r\n\nreading of  Article 946 in Georgia  Pacific (including invocation\r                                                     \r\n\nof the treatise passage  quoted above), lead us to  conclude that\r\n\nthere is no legal support for applying the provision  here.  Even\r\n\nif Caribbean correctly informed the district court that precedent\r\n\nexists  to support  use of  Article 946  for loan  agreements not\r\n\nreflected in a  note, this case  would be another step  away from\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n      7  We note  that one  commentator who  addressed  a related\r\nissue assumed that an action on a loan contract, as distinguished\r                                                         \r\nfrom a note, would be subject to the three-year period unless the\r\nplaintiff  were able  to  prove  that  the  contract  was  not  a\r\ncommercial loan.   Again, however,  no caselaw is  cited for  the\r\nimplicit  proposition that  suits based  on commercial  loans are\r\nsubject  to  Article  946  whether  or  not  an  \"instrument\"  is\r\ninvolved.  See E.S. Belaval Martinez, \"The Puerto Rico Commercial\r                        \r\nCode under  the Federal  Courts: A Juridical  Disaster,\" 55  Rev.\r\nJur. U.P.R.

The\r\n\ncontract  here  represented  an  earlier step  in  the  financing\r\n\nprocess  than a contract that actually sets in motion a financing\r\n\nrelationship;   it  was  an  agreement   to  enter  into  a  loan\r\n\narrangement  at a  later  time  that  might,  or  might  not,  be\r                                        \r\n\nreflected  in a  note.    In  other  words,  defendant  allegedly\r\n\nbreached a promise to make a loan, not to perform the terms  of a\r\n\nloan agreement.\r\n\n     Notwithstanding  this  distinction,  the   district  court's\r\n\ndecision to use  Article 946's three-year  term is appealing  for\r\n\nseveral reasons.  First, there is logic in applying the same term\r\n\nto  all transactions related to a commercial loan, no matter what\r\n\nstage of the process  is involved, and regardless of  whether the\r\n\nfinancing agreement is represented by a promissory  note or other\r\n\ncommercial  \"instrument.\"   Such  technicalities arguably  should\r\n\nmake no difference when closely related  claims are at issue.  We\r\n\nfurther   appreciate   the   rationale   for   applying   shorter\r\n\nprescriptive  terms in  the commercial  arena, where  the orderly\r\n\noperation  of  businesses  would  seem  to  call  for  prompt and\r\n\nefficient resolution of disputes.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court,\r\n\nmoreover,  has \"alluded to the modern  tendency of shortening the\r\n\nterms\"  for  prescription,  see   Culebra  Enterprises  Corp.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nCommonwealth, 91 J.T.S.  18, P.R.

It cites the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision\r\n\nin Culebra  Enterprises, 91 J.T.S.  18, P.R. Offic.  Trans., slip\r                                 \r\n\nop. at 4,  where the court endorsed resort to  \"an analogy to fix\r\n\nthe prescriptive term  of a  certain action for  which the  legal\r\n\nsystem  does not provide a  prescriptive term, but  which is very\r\n\nsimilar  to another  for  which  a  prescriptive  term  has  been\r\n\nprovided.\"  PRDF's plausible  view is that the contract  at issue\r\n\nhere is sufficiently analogous to a promissory note that the same\r\n\nlimitations period should  be applied.  Accepting  Article 946 by\r\n\nanalogy would not contradict caselaw limiting its direct reach to\r\n\nthe realm of commercial instruments; it instead would represent a\r\n\npolicy choice in a context in which the law has left a gap.   \r\n\n     We do not believe that we are free to make that choice.  The\r\n\ncourt  in  Culebra Enterprises  seemed  to  view the  controversy\r                                        \r\n\nbefore  it, which  involved  land  classification and  implicated\r\n\nconstitutional property  principles, as one of  first impression.\r\n\nMultiple  factors, including the need to stabilize the use of the\r\n\nCommonwealth's limited  land  resources and  the desirability  of\r\n\nspeedily resolving  disputes between the State  and its citizens,\r\n\ninfluenced   its   adoption   of   an   \"extraordinary\"  one-year\r\n\nlimitations  period rather  than any  longer term,  including the\r\n\n\"ordinary\" one of fifteen years.\r\n\n     Here, by  contrast, the  prescriptive question is  not open-\r\n\nended, and we  therefore need not -- and, it seems  to us, we may\r\n\nnot -- cast about for a suitable analogy.  As  we read the cases,\r\n\nit is well established  that contract claims that are  covered by\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe Commerce Code but are not designated for special prescriptive\r\n\ntreatment automatically fall under  the Civil Code's fifteen-year\r\n\ncatch-all provision.8  See,  e.g., Rivera Surillo, 37 F.3d  at 27\r                                                           \r\n\n(fifteen-year breach of contract limitations provision applies to\r\n\nthis  business dispute if  no other specific  period applies); K-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMart Corp.  v.

The issue before us is whether the company waited too long to bring its action.  The agreement allegedly was breached in January 1978.  The lawsuit was filed nearly fifteen years later, in January 1993.  The district court concluded that the action was subject to a three-year statute of limitations, and therefore granted summary judgment for the defendants.  Our review of the relevant statutes and caselaw persuades us that a fifteen-year limitations period applies, and, consequently, that the complaint was timely filed.  We therefore reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts underlying this appeal are few, and undisputed.  In November 1977, defendant Puerto Rico Development Fund (\"PRDF\") sent plaintiff Caribbean Mushroom Co., Inc.  (\"Caribbean\") a commitment letter in which it agreed to loan Caribbean $100,000, subject to specific terms and conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On or about January 10, 1978, PRDF informed Caribbean that it would not loan the money.  Caribbean brought this diversity action on January 7, 1993, alleging that PRDF's refusal to make the loan constituted a breach of contract.  It claimed $4.5 million in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRDF filed a motion for summary judgment alleging, inter alia, that Caribbean's claim was time barred.  It contended that the applicable statute of limitations was the three-year period provided in Article 946 of the Puerto Rico Commerce Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, App.  I, &#167; 1908.  Caribbean argued in response that the action was governed by Article 1864 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5294, which sets a fifteen-year limitations period for actions for which there is no specific term set.  Because Caribbean's lawsuit was filed just short of fifteen years after the alleged breach, it is viable only if the longer period applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sided with PRDF.  It concluded that the disputed transaction fell under the Commerce Code and its three-year limitations provision for actions arising out of commercial instruments because it involved an agreement to loan money to a merchant for a commercial purpose.  The court rejected plaintiff's contention that the fifteen-year provision should apply because the claim involved a breach of contract and not enforcement of the terms of a commercial loan.  In doing so, the court invoked First Circuit precedent holding that \" 'litigants cannot circumvent a specific provision of the Puerto Rico Code by characterizing their claims generally as a \"breach of contract\" in order to obtain the benefit of a longer statute of limitations period,' \" Caribbean Mushroom Co. v. Government Dev.  Bank for Puerto Rico, 906 F.Supp. 70, 74 (D.P.R.1995) (quoting Jorge Rivera Surillo &amp; Co. v. Falconer Glass Indus., 37 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.1994)).  The court's determination on the limitations question led it to grant summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Caribbean argues that the district court misconstrued the scope of Article 946, which contains the three-year deadline, and erroneously invoked the Rivera Surillo line of cases barring litigants from broadly classifying their claims as contractual breaches to avoid more particular, and shorter, limitations provisions.  Caribbean contends that it has not artificially re-characterized its lawsuit to fall under Article 1864, but that the fifteen-year period applies because no other limitations provision fits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court's resort to the three-year limitations period attracts us as a practical matter, we have concluded that it is not supportable as a matter of law.

That provision reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Actions arising from drafts shall extinguish three years after maturity, whether such drafts have been protested or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar rule shall be applied to commercial bills of exchange and promissory notes, checks, stubs and other instruments of draft or exchange and to coupons and amounts for the redemption of obligations issued in accordance with this Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, App.  I, &#167; 1908.  Plaintiffs maintain that the applicable term is the Civil Code's fifteen-year \"catch-all\" provision, which governs when \"no special term of prescription is fixed,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5294 (\"Article 1864\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Article 946 (setting a three-year term) does not on its face govern here because no promissory note or other commercial instrument was issued by defendants to Caribbean.  The district court's view, urged on appeal by defendants, is that the three-year limitation nonetheless applies because the agreement at issue essentially was equivalent to those transactions explicitly covered by the provision.  Indeed, Caribbean observed in its response to defendants' motion for summary judgment that caselaw has extended Article 946's reach \"past actions on instruments per se to suits on loans not reflected in instruments but which nevertheless have a 'commercial' basis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Caribbean drops this broad depiction of Article 946's scope, and now argues that the three-year provision is confined to actions based on commercial instruments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Contrary to defendants' assertions, this is not a new argument that should be cast aside because it was not offered below.  Rather, it is a narrowing of Caribbean's earlier position.  While Caribbean no longer acknowledges that Article 946 can extend beyond its literal terms, it consistently has argued that this case is outside the statute's range.  Its position below was that, even if Article 946 can be construed flexibly to cover suits on loans, it does not govern this case because the transaction sued upon was not a loan agreement, but a contract in which defendant promised to make a loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Because no provision of the Commerce Code sets a limitation period for commercial contract actions, Caribbean maintained--and continues to maintain--that the Civil Code's fifteen-year provision applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question, then, is whether Article 946 governs the dispute underlying this case.  Despite Caribbean's representation to the district court that Article 946 has been construed flexibly, we have found no case applying the three-year limitations period to an action arising from a commercial agreement that does not involve an instrument such as a promissory note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The primary cases cited by defendants focus on the preliminary question of whether the loan sued upon is commercial.  In each case, a note had been issued, and a finding that the underlying transaction was commercial therefore would mean that that case would fall within Article 946's literal language.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Consolidated Mortgage, 805 F.2d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir.1986) (holding that loan agreement and notes were commercial, and thus subject to three-year period);  FDIC v. Cardona, 723 F.2d 132, 133-36 (1st Cir.1983) (alternative holding:  non-commercial promissory notes at issue, and so fifteen-year period applies);  FDIC v. Francisco Inv. Corp., 638 F.Supp. 1216, 1217-18 (D.P.R.1986) (promissory notes not commercial;  fifteen-year period applies);  Mediterranean Inv. Corp. v. Rodriguez, 575 F.Supp. 268, 268-69 (D.P.R.1983) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, this Circuit recently gave a limited reading to Article 946 in rejecting its applicability in a commercial case involving a guaranty.  We observed that the provision applies to negotiable instruments, and \"[t]he promise before us ... is plainly not a negotiable instrument,\" Georgia Pacific Corp. v. Pablo Eguia &amp; Sons, Inc., 15 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir.1994) (emphasis in original).  Indeed, we quoted in Georgia Pacific the following passage from a treatise describing the corresponding provision in the Spanish Code of Commerce:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"But a distinction must be made as regards the aim of prescription.  The three-year prescription bars actions arising from negotiable instruments, but not actions arising from the fundamental juridical relations which the contracting parties have sought to identify with the actions on negotiable instruments.  If a loan is guaranteed by a negotiable instrument, the actions derived from the relations arising from the latter shall prescribe, but the right of action arising from the mutual contract shall remain intact and shall survive for its entire term.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citing 5 R. Gay de Montella, Codigo de Comercio Espanol Comentado 503-504 (1936) (translated, and quoted, in Portilla, 75 P.R.R. at 119)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We understand this passage to reject the notion that all claims arising from a transaction involving a negotiable instrument are to be treated identically for limitations purposes based solely on their common factual underpinning.  See also E.S. Belaval Martinez, \"The Puerto Rico Commercial Code under the Federal Courts:  A Juridical Disaster,\" 55 Rev. Jur.  U.P.R. (Issue # 2) 313, 314 (1986) (\"Juridical Disaster\") (\"Both the loan and the note are distinct and separable contracts and as such they give rise to two distinct and separable actions\") (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of identified caselaw extending the provision to these or similar circumstances, together with our own cautious reading of Article 946 in Georgia Pacific (including invocation of the treatise passage quoted above), lead us to conclude that there is no legal support for applying the provision here.  Even if Caribbean correctly informed the district court that precedent exists to support use of Article 946 for loan agreements not reflected in a note, this case would be another step away from that stretching of the provision's specific language.  The contract here represented an earlier step in the financing process than a contract that actually sets in motion a financing relationship;  it was an agreement to enter into a loan arrangement at a later time that might, or might not, be reflected in a note.  In other words, defendant allegedly breached a promise to make a loan, not to perform the terms of a loan agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this distinction, the district court's decision to use Article 946's three-year term is appealing for several reasons.  First, there is logic in applying the same term to all transactions related to a commercial loan, no matter what stage of the process is involved, and regardless of whether the financing agreement is represented by a promissory note or other commercial \"instrument.\"   Such technicalities arguably should make no difference when closely related claims are at issue.  We further appreciate the rationale for applying shorter prescriptive terms in the commercial arena, where the orderly operation of businesses would seem to call for prompt and efficient resolution of disputes.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court, moreover, has \"alluded to the modern tendency of shortening the terms\" for prescription, see Culebra Enterprises Corp. v. Commonwealth, 91 J.T.S. 18, P.R. Offic.  Trans., slip op. at 9 (Feb. 8, 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, in fact, argues that Article 946 should be adopted by analogy in this setting if we deem it inapplicable in its own right.  It cites the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in Culebra Enterprises, 91 J.T.S. 18, P.R. Offic.  Trans., slip op. at 4, where the court endorsed resort to \"an analogy to fix the prescriptive term of a certain action for which the legal system does not provide a prescriptive term, but which is very similar to another for which a prescriptive term has been provided.\"   PRDF's plausible view is that the contract at issue here is sufficiently analogous to a promissory note that the same limitations period should be applied.  Accepting Article 946 by analogy would not contradict caselaw limiting its direct reach to the realm of commercial instruments;  it instead would represent a policy choice in a context in which the law has left a gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that we are free to make that choice.  The court in Culebra Enterprises seemed to view the controversy before it, which involved land classification and implicated constitutional property principles, as one of first impression.  Multiple factors, including the need to stabilize the use of the Commonwealth's limited land resources and the desirability of speedily resolving disputes between the State and its citizens, influenced its adoption of an \"extraordinary\" one-year limitations period rather than any longer term, including the \"ordinary\" one of fifteen years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by contrast, the prescriptive question is not open-ended, and we therefore need not--and, it seems to us, we may not--cast about for a suitable analogy.  As we read the cases, it is well established that contract claims that are covered by the Commerce Code but are not designated for special prescriptive treatment automatically fall under the Civil Code's fifteen-year catch-all provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See, e.g., Rivera Surillo, 37 F.3d at 27 (fifteen-year breach of contract limitations provision applies to this business dispute if no other specific period applies);  K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 911 n. 2 (1st Cir.1989) (in case involving breach of business lease, court noted that \"limitation period for contract claims under Puerto Rico law is fifteen years\");  Kali Seafood, Inc. v. Howe Corp., 887 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1989) (in case involving commercial transaction, court noted that Civil Code's fifteen-year term applies to \"contracts and other personal claims 'for which no special term of prescription is fixed' \");  Lexington Ins. Co. v. Abarca Warehouses Corp., 476 F.2d 44, 47 (1st Cir.1973) (assuming that, if claim were contractual, fifteen-year statute of limitations would apply);  Mortensen &amp; Lange, 19 P.R. Offic.  Trans. at 378 (noting that fifteen-year term would apply if transaction at issue were an agency contract between two business entities, but concluding that it was a \"charterparty\" and thus subject to a six-month term);  id. at 391 (Negron Garcia, J. and Hernandez Denton, J., dissenting) (concluding that the transaction was not a charterparty, and that fifteen-year term consequently applied);  Maryland Casualty Co. v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 92 P.R.R. 320, 324 (1965) (action based on fraudulently endorsed checks did not arise from commercial instrument but is \"an action for collection of money based on a loan contract\" and so is governed by fifteen-year period);  Lugo v. E.M. Amy &amp; Sons, Inc., 87 P.R.R. 527, 533 (1963) (\"actions for damages [in a mercantile setting] arising from a previous contractual relation do not have a fixed term of prescription, for which reason the general prescription of fifteen years fixed by section 1864 of the Civil Code is applicable thereto\").  If, in the face of this precedent, the Puerto Rico legislature has refrained from modifying the limitations scheme for commercial contract cases, we may not second-guess its judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that, notwithstanding our earlier endorsement of the three-year period as fitting for this context, we consider use of the fifteen-year term as neither arbitrary nor irrational.  At least for now, that is still the \"ordinary\" period of prescription for Commonwealth cases, and Caribbean's complaint is intrinsically a run-of-the-mill contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although the commercial nature of the proposed transaction would seem to justify a much shorter term, the fact that the suit does not concern a negotiable instrument has counterbalancing weight in rendering Article 946 inapt.  Negotiable instruments by virtue of their negotiability require particularly quick untangling, and the short limitations term also may be viewed as a quid pro quo for the fact that the issuer of a note has fewer defenses than the typical contract-claim defendant.  See \"Juridical Disaster,\" at 316-17.  Lacking those elements, this case has a lesser claim to urgency.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has recognized, in fact, that some situations \"deviate[ ] from the doctrinal observation that, as a general rule, prescriptive terms in commercial law are shorter than in civil law given the peculiar demands of commercial trade.\"   See Ramallo Bros., P.R. Offic.  Trans., slip op. at 7. See also Georgia Pacific, 15 F.3d at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Article 946's three-year term is inapplicable here because the conflict does not involve a negotiable instrument, or even a loan contract.  The provision is equally unavailable by analogy, since well established precedent directs contract claims governed by the Commerce Code that lack specific prescriptive provisions to the Civil Code's fifteen-year catch-all term.  We therefore conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for defendant based on the timing of plaintiff's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reverse its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> PRDF is a department of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, the other defendant.

Consequently, the defendant's and district court's reliance on Buena Vista Dairy, Inc. v. Aponte, 108 P.R. Dec. 657, 660, 8 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 698, 700 (1979), is misplaced.  In that case, the court held that the Commerce Code applied to causes of action \"ancillary\" to a commercial agreement even if such claims might not have met the requirements of the Code on their own.  Because applicability of the Commerce Code is uncontested here, it is unnecessary to invoke the \"ancillary\" claim doctrine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In its brief on appeal, Caribbean states that \"[u]ntil now, the statute has never once been held to bar an action not involving an instrument--every court to which the question has ever been presented has held that it did not so apply.\"   Brief at 6 (emphasis in original)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In its opposition to PRDF's motion for summary judgment, plaintiff argued:</p>\n        <p>The statutory provision is clearly inapplicable here, not because this action is on a loan which is \"noncommercial\" but because it is not on a loan at all.</p>\n        <p>This action is not on an instrument or on a loan, commercial or otherwise.  It rather seeks damages for the breach of a contract, a suit of a far different sort.  The distinction between an action to recover money due under an agreement and one to recover damages sustained by breach of that agreement is almost too obvious and well recognized to require comment....</p>\n        <p>If PRDF had gone through with its loan commitment, a later action by it against CMC based on such loan might very well ... have been within the purview of Article 946 as a suit on a \"commercial\" obligation.  From the other end, on the same reasoning, even a suit by CMC to enforce the loan agreement--to compel the making of the loan--might perhaps have been covered by the statute.  No such suit is here present, however.  This is not an action on the contract that existed between the parties but a suit for damages for its breach.</p>\n        <p>Opposition at 12.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Caribbean's statement, contained in a footnote of its summary judgment response, was not supported by citations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that one commentator who addressed a related issue assumed that an action on a loan contract, as distinguished from a note, would be subject to the three-year period unless the plaintiff were able to prove that the contract was not a commercial loan.  Again, however, no caselaw is cited for the implicit proposition that suits based on commercial loans are subject to Article 946 whether or not an \"instrument\" is involved.  See E.S. Belaval Martinez, \"The Puerto Rico Commercial Code under the Federal Courts:  A Juridical Disaster,\" 55 Rev. Jur.  U.P.R.

The issue before us is whether the company waited too long to bring its action.  The agreement allegedly was breached in January 1978.  The lawsuit was filed nearly fifteen years later, in January 1993.  The district court concluded that the action was subject to a three-year statute of limitations, and therefore granted summary judgment for the defendants.  Our review of the relevant statutes and caselaw persuades us that a fifteen-year limitations period applies, and, consequently, that the complaint was timely filed.  We therefore reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts underlying this appeal are few, and undisputed.  In November 1977, defendant Puerto Rico Development Fund (\"PRDF\") sent plaintiff Caribbean Mushroom Co., Inc.  (\"Caribbean\") a commitment letter in which it agreed to loan Caribbean $100,000, subject to specific terms and conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On or about January 10, 1978, PRDF informed Caribbean that it would not loan the money.  Caribbean brought this diversity action on January 7, 1993, alleging that PRDF's refusal to make the loan constituted a breach of contract.  It claimed $4.5 million in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRDF filed a motion for summary judgment alleging, inter alia, that Caribbean's claim was time barred.  It contended that the applicable statute of limitations was the three-year period provided in Article 946 of the Puerto Rico Commerce Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, App.  I, &#167; 1908.  Caribbean argued in response that the action was governed by Article 1864 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5294, which sets a fifteen-year limitations period for actions for which there is no specific term set.  Because Caribbean's lawsuit was filed just short of fifteen years after the alleged breach, it is viable only if the longer period applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sided with PRDF.  It concluded that the disputed transaction fell under the Commerce Code and its three-year limitations provision for actions arising out of commercial instruments because it involved an agreement to loan money to a merchant for a commercial purpose.  The court rejected plaintiff's contention that the fifteen-year provision should apply because the claim involved a breach of contract and not enforcement of the terms of a commercial loan.  In doing so, the court invoked First Circuit precedent holding that \" 'litigants cannot circumvent a specific provision of the Puerto Rico Code by characterizing their claims generally as a \"breach of contract\" in order to obtain the benefit of a longer statute of limitations period,' \" Caribbean Mushroom Co. v.

That provision reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Actions arising from drafts shall extinguish three years after maturity, whether such drafts have been protested or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar rule shall be applied to commercial bills of exchange and promissory notes, checks, stubs and other instruments of draft or exchange and to coupons and amounts for the redemption of obligations issued in accordance with this Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, App.  I, &#167; 1908.  Plaintiffs maintain that the applicable term is the Civil Code's fifteen-year \"catch-all\" provision, which governs when \"no special term of prescription is fixed,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5294 (\"Article 1864\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Article 946 (setting a three-year term) does not on its face govern here because no promissory note or other commercial instrument was issued by defendants to Caribbean.  The district court's view, urged on appeal by defendants, is that the three-year limitation nonetheless applies because the agreement at issue essentially was equivalent to those transactions explicitly covered by the provision.  Indeed, Caribbean observed in its response to defendants' motion for summary judgment that caselaw has extended Article 946's reach \"past actions on instruments per se to suits on loans not reflected in instruments but which nevertheless have a 'commercial' basis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Caribbean drops this broad depiction of Article 946's scope, and now argues that the three-year provision is confined to actions based on commercial instruments.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Contrary to defendants' assertions, this is not a new argument that should be cast aside because it was not offered below.  Rather, it is a narrowing of Caribbean's earlier position.  While Caribbean no longer acknowledges that Article 946 can extend beyond its literal terms, it consistently has argued that this case is outside the statute's range.  Its position below was that, even if Article 946 can be construed flexibly to cover suits on loans, it does not govern this case because the transaction sued upon was not a loan agreement, but a contract in which defendant promised to make a loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Because no provision of the Commerce Code sets a limitation period for commercial contract actions, Caribbean maintained--and continues to maintain--that the Civil Code's fifteen-year provision applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold question, then, is whether Article 946 governs the dispute underlying this case.  Despite Caribbean's representation to the district court that Article 946 has been construed flexibly, we have found no case applying the three-year limitations period to an action arising from a commercial agreement that does not involve an instrument such as a promissory note.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The primary cases cited by defendants focus on the preliminary question of whether the loan sued upon is commercial.  In each case, a note had been issued, and a finding that the underlying transaction was commercial therefore would mean that that case would fall within Article 946's literal language.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Consolidated Mortgage, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479204\"><a href=\"/opinion/479204/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-consolidated-mortgage-and-finance/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17-18 (1st Cir.1986) (holding that loan agreement and notes were commercial, and thus subject to three-year period);  FDIC v.

We observed that the provision applies to negotiable instruments, and \"[t]he promise before us ... is plainly not a negotiable instrument,\" Georgia Pacific Corp. v. Pablo Eguia &amp; Sons, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195175\"><a href=\"/opinion/195175/georgia-v-equia/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1994) (emphasis in original).  Indeed, we quoted in Georgia Pacific the following passage from a treatise describing the corresponding provision in the Spanish Code of Commerce:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"But a distinction must be made as regards the aim of prescription.  The three-year prescription bars actions arising from negotiable instruments, but not actions arising from the fundamental juridical relations which the contracting parties have sought to identify with the actions on negotiable instruments.  If a loan is guaranteed by a negotiable instrument, the actions derived from the relations arising from the latter shall prescribe, but the right of action arising from the mutual contract shall remain intact and shall survive for its entire term.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citing 5 R. Gay de Montella, Codigo de Comercio Espanol Comentado 503-504 (1936) (translated, and quoted, in Portilla, 75 P.R.R. at 119)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We understand this passage to reject the notion that all claims arising from a transaction involving a negotiable instrument are to be treated identically for limitations purposes based solely on their common factual underpinning.  See also E.S. Belaval Martinez, \"The Puerto Rico Commercial Code under the Federal Courts:  A Juridical Disaster,\" 55 Rev. Jur.  U.P.R. (Issue # 2) 313, 314 (1986) (\"Juridical Disaster\") (\"Both the loan and the note are distinct and separable contracts and as such they give rise to two distinct and separable actions\") (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of identified caselaw extending the provision to these or similar circumstances, together with our own cautious reading of Article 946 in Georgia Pacific (including invocation of the treatise passage quoted above), lead us to conclude that there is no legal support for applying the provision here.  Even if Caribbean correctly informed the district court that precedent exists to support use of Article 946 for loan agreements not reflected in a note, this case would be another step away from that stretching of the provision's specific language.  The contract here represented an earlier step in the financing process than a contract that actually sets in motion a financing relationship;  it was an agreement to enter into a loan arrangement at a later time that might, or might not, be reflected in a note.  In other words, defendant allegedly breached a promise to make a loan, not to perform the terms of a loan agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this distinction, the district court's decision to use Article 946's three-year term is appealing for several reasons.  First, there is logic in applying the same term to all transactions related to a commercial loan, no matter what stage of the process is involved, and regardless of whether the financing agreement is represented by a promissory note or other commercial \"instrument.\"   Such technicalities arguably should make no difference when closely related claims are at issue.  We further appreciate the rationale for applying shorter prescriptive terms in the commercial arena, where the orderly operation of businesses would seem to call for prompt and efficient resolution of disputes.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court, moreover, has \"alluded to the modern tendency of shortening the terms\" for prescription, see Culebra Enterprises Corp. v. Commonwealth, 91 J.T.S. 18, P.R. Offic.  Trans., slip op. at 9 (Feb. 8, 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, in fact, argues that Article 946 should be adopted by analogy in this setting if we deem it inapplicable in its own right.  It cites the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in Culebra Enterprises, 91 J.T.S. 18, P.R. Offic.  Trans., slip op. at 4, where the court endorsed resort to \"an analogy to fix the prescriptive term of a certain action for which the legal system does not provide a prescriptive term, but which is very similar to another for which a prescriptive term has been provided.\"   PRDF's plausible view is that the contract at issue here is sufficiently analogous to a promissory note that the same limitations period should be applied.  Accepting Article 946 by analogy would not contradict caselaw limiting its direct reach to the realm of commercial instruments;  it instead would represent a policy choice in a context in which the law has left a gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that we are free to make that choice.  The court in Culebra Enterprises seemed to view the controversy before it, which involved land classification and implicated constitutional property principles, as one of first impression.  Multiple factors, including the need to stabilize the use of the Commonwealth's limited land resources and the desirability of speedily resolving disputes between the State and its citizens, influenced its adoption of an \"extraordinary\" one-year limitations period rather than any longer term, including the \"ordinary\" one of fifteen years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by contrast, the prescriptive question is not open-ended, and we therefore need not--and, it seems to us, we may not--cast about for a suitable analogy.  As we read the cases, it is well established that contract claims that are covered by the Commerce Code but are not designated for special prescriptive treatment automatically fall under the Civil Code's fifteen-year catch-all provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See, e.g., Rivera Surillo, 37 F.3d at 27 (fifteen-year breach of contract limitations provision applies to this business dispute if no other specific period applies);  K-Mart Corp. v.

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></span>, 324 (1965) (action based on fraudulently endorsed checks did not arise from commercial instrument but is \"an action for collection of money based on a loan contract\" and so is governed by fifteen-year period);  Lugo v. E.M. Amy &amp; Sons, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></span>, 533 (1963) (\"actions for damages [in a mercantile setting] arising from a previous contractual relation do not have a fixed term of prescription, for which reason the general prescription of fifteen years fixed by section 1864 of the Civil Code is applicable thereto\").  If, in the face of this precedent, the Puerto Rico legislature has refrained from modifying the limitations scheme for commercial contract cases, we may not second-guess its judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that, notwithstanding our earlier endorsement of the three-year period as fitting for this context, we consider use of the fifteen-year term as neither arbitrary nor irrational.  At least for now, that is still the \"ordinary\" period of prescription for Commonwealth cases, and Caribbean's complaint is intrinsically a run-of-the-mill contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although the commercial nature of the proposed transaction would seem to justify a much shorter term, the fact that the suit does not concern a negotiable instrument has counterbalancing weight in rendering Article 946 inapt.  Negotiable instruments by virtue of their negotiability require particularly quick untangling, and the short limitations term also may be viewed as a quid pro quo for the fact that the issuer of a note has fewer defenses than the typical contract-claim defendant.  See \"Juridical Disaster,\" at 316-17.  Lacking those elements, this case has a lesser claim to urgency.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has recognized, in fact, that some situations \"deviate[ ] from the doctrinal observation that, as a general rule, prescriptive terms in commercial law are shorter than in civil law given the peculiar demands of commercial trade.\"   See Ramallo Bros., P.R. Offic.  Trans., slip op. at 7. See also Georgia Pacific, 15 F.3d at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, Article 946's three-year term is inapplicable here because the conflict does not involve a negotiable instrument, or even a loan contract.  The provision is equally unavailable by analogy, since well established precedent directs contract claims governed by the Commerce Code that lack specific prescriptive provisions to the Civil Code's fifteen-year catch-all term.  We therefore conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for defendant based on the timing of plaintiff's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reverse its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> PRDF is a department of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, the other defendant.

Consequently, the defendant's and district court's reliance on Buena Vista Dairy, Inc. v. Aponte, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></span>, 660, 8 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 698, 700 (1979), is misplaced.  In that case, the court held that the Commerce Code applied to causes of action \"ancillary\" to a commercial agreement even if such claims might not have met the requirements of the Code on their own.  Because applicability of the Commerce Code is uncontested here, it is unnecessary to invoke the \"ancillary\" claim doctrine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In its brief on appeal, Caribbean states that \"[u]ntil now, the statute has never once been held to bar an action not involving an instrument--every court to which the question has ever been presented has held that it did not so apply.\"   Brief at 6 (emphasis in original)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In its opposition to PRDF's motion for summary judgment, plaintiff argued:</p>\n        <p>The statutory provision is clearly inapplicable here, not because this action is on a loan which is \"noncommercial\" but because it is not on a loan at all.</p>\n        <p>This action is not on an instrument or on a loan, commercial or otherwise.  It rather seeks damages for the breach of a contract, a suit of a far different sort.  The distinction between an action to recover money due under an agreement and one to recover damages sustained by breach of that agreement is almost too obvious and well recognized to require comment....</p>\n        <p>If PRDF had gone through with its loan commitment, a later action by it against CMC based on such loan might very well ... have been within the purview of Article 946 as a suit on a \"commercial\" obligation.  From the other end, on the same reasoning, even a suit by CMC to enforce the loan agreement--to compel the making of the loan--might perhaps have been covered by the statute.  No such suit is here present, however.  This is not an action on the contract that existed between the parties but a suit for damages for its breach.</p>\n        <p>Opposition at 12.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Caribbean's statement, contained in a footnote of its summary judgment response, was not supported by citations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that one commentator who addressed a related issue assumed that an action on a loan contract, as distinguished from a note, would be subject to the three-year period unless the plaintiff were able to prove that the contract was not a commercial loan.  Again, however, no caselaw is cited for the implicit proposition that suits based on commercial loans are subject to Article 946 whether or not an \"instrument\" is involved.  See E.S. Belaval Martinez, \"The Puerto Rico Commercial Code under the Federal Courts:  A Juridical Disaster,\" 55 Rev. Jur.  U.P.R.
