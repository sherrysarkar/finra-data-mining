In  these cases,  plaintiffs are  government\r\n\nemployees  who are members  of the losing  Popular Democratic\r\n\nParty  (PDP) who assert that  they were terminated or demoted\r\n\nfrom  their jobs  because  of  their political  affiliation.1\r\n\nThis  court faced  an earlier  wave  of such  cases when  PDP\r\n\ncandidates  won election in  1984 and NPP  members complained\r\n\nthat  their government jobs  suffered because of  their party\r\n\nmembership.\r\n\n          In this case, the PDP-affiliated plaintiffs are six\r\n\nlong-term government  employees who  were demoted from  their\r\n\ncivil  service positions  as Managerial  Coordinators in  the\r\n\nCommonwealth's Department  of Social  Services, now  known as\r\n\nthe Department of the Family.   They say their duties are now\r\n\nbeing performed  by NPP members  who have been  designated as\r\n\naides to the Regional Directors  of the agency.  The district\r\n\ncourt granted summary  judgment for defendants on  the theory\r\n\nthat plaintiffs had not made out a prima facie case  and that\r\n\ndefendants  had  established  they would  have  taken  action\r\n\nanyway for  non-political reasons, regardless  of plaintiffs'\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

See id. at 12.\r                                      \r\n\n          Plaintiffs are six  career civil service  employees\r\n\nof the former  Department of Social Services of  Puerto Rico,\r\n\nnow known as the  Department of the Family, all of  whom have\r\n\nbeen working  at the Department  for over twenty years.   All\r\n\nplaintiffs belong  to the PDP,  the party of  former Governor\r\n\nRafael Hernandez Colon, who held office for two terms between\r\n\n1984 and 1992.   In a process that began in  late 1987, a new\r\n\nsupervisory position of  \"Managerial Coordinator\" was created\r\n\nwithin  the  Department.   Between  1988  and  1992,  the six\r\n\nplaintiffs  and  several  others were  promoted  to  this new\r\n\nposition.\r\n\n          The  Managerial  Coordinator classification  was  a\r\n\nmiddle   level   managerial  position   created   to  provide\r\n\nassistance to the  several Regional Directors.   The Regional\r\n\nDirectors, in turn, report to  the Secretary, a member of the\r\n\nGovernor's  cabinet.    The  Managerial  Coordinator job  was\r\n\nestablished  as a career  position under Puerto  Rico's civil\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nservice laws, which require that such an employee be selected\r\n\nstrictly on merit and can only  be removed for cause.  See  3\r                                                                      \r\n\nL.P.R.A.    1301,  1331-1338; Agosto-de-Feliciano v.  Aponte-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRoque, 889  F.2d 1209,  1213 n.3 (1st  Cir. 1989)  (en banc).\r                 \r\n\nThe Regional  Directors,  in  contrast,  were  classified  as\r\n\n\"confidential employees,\" who are  involved in the  formation\r\n\nof public  policy and render  direct services to the  head of\r\n\nthe department,  the Secretary  of Social  Services.   See  3\r                                                                      \r\n\nL.P.R.A.   1350;  Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at  1213 n.3.\r                                                 \r\n\nThe  Central Office of  Personnel Administration  (COPA), the\r\n\nagency charged with administering Puerto Rico's civil service\r\n\nlaws, approved  the creation  of  the Managerial  Coordinator\r\n\nposition.    In  approving the  position,  the  civil service\r\n\nagency necessarily  concluded that political  affiliation was\r\n\nnot  a  necessary  prerequisite   for  holding  a  Managerial\r\n\nCoordinator position.\r\n\n          The  Director   of  COPA  described   the  position\r\n\ngenerally, in a job description written in 1988, as entailing\r\n\n\"managerial and administrative  work of great  complexity and\r\n\nresponsibility  in  the  coordination and  evaluation  of the\r\n\n. . . activities  of the Local Offices . . . .\"   Plaintiffs'\r\n\nimmediate superiors were  the Regional Directors.   On paper,\r\n\naccording to the COPA job description, the official duties of\r\n\na Managerial Coordinator  included offering technical  advice\r\n\non  the agency's work  plans, keeping the  Regional Directors\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nand  the  Secretary  informed  of  local  office  operations,\r\n\ninvestigating  and  reporting  on  grievances  of  employees,\r\n\nmonitoring  local  offices' expenses,  training  local office\r\n\nsupervisors, analyzing statistical reports, preparing reports\r\n\nabout evaluation visits  to local offices, and  other duties.\r\n\nIn practice,  plaintiffs' duties  as Managerial  Coordinators\r\n\nranged   widely,  and   included  coordinating   inter-agency\r\n\nprograms, attending  to client  complaints, substituting  for\r\n\nthe  Regional  Director,  planning  professional  and  social\r\n\nactivities,  and signing per  diem and  mileage reimbursement\r\n\nchecks.  Plaintiffs' positions \"provid[ed] support  functions\r\n\nto the Regional Directors, analogous to those of an aide.\"\r\n\n          In  the 1992 general election, the PDP was defeated\r\n\nby the  rival NPP, and  the present governor,  Pedro Rosello,\r\n\ncame  to  power.   Governor  Rosello  named  defendant Carmen\r\n\nRodriguez-de-Rivera   as   Secretary  of   Social   Services.\r\n\nRodriguez-de-Rivera, in  turn, hired the  Regional Directors.\r\n\nIn the first  month of the  new administration, the  Regional\r\n\nDirectors began to take away many of the duties and functions\r\n\nthat  the   Managerial  Coordinators  had   been  performing,\r\n\nassigning  those duties  to  other  employees  who  were  NPP\r\n\nactivists   and  had   been   designated,     officially   or\r\n\nunofficially,   as   aides   to   the   Regional   Directors.\r\n\nAdditionally,  the  Regional  Directors  took  away from  the\r\n\nManagerial  Coordinators several  perquisites  that had  been\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nassociated with  that position,  such as  parking, telephones\r\n\nand office space.   Defendants were aware  of plaintiffs' PDP\r\n\npolitical  party   affiliation,   and  the   aides  to   whom\r\n\nplaintiffs' duties were assigned were all politically  active\r\n\nsupporters of the NPP party, newly in power.\r\n\n          In February 1993, one  Managerial Coordinator wrote\r\n\ndefendant  Rodriguez-de-Rivera,  to  complain  that  the  new\r\n\nRegional  Directors had taken away the duties and perquisites\r\n\nof  her  position.    Rodriguez-de-Rivera's reaction  was  to\r\n\nlaunch  an investigation  of the  complainant  and the  other\r\n\nManagerial  Coordinators.     The  stated   purpose  of   the\r\n\ninvestigation  was to determine  whether the creation  of the\r\n\nposition and  the selection  of candidates  had been  proper.\r\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the real purpose of the investigation\r\n\nwas to provide a legal cover for the impending demotions.\r\n\n          In   May   1993,    Secretary   Rodriguez-de-Rivera\r\n\ndispatched Carmen Salivia, an official of the Social Services\r\n\nDepartment, to  conduct field interviews  with the Managerial\r\n\nCoordinators.     During   the  interviews,   the  Managerial\r\n\nCoordinators described the  duties of their positions  -- now\r\n\nbeing  performed by  NPP-affiliated aides  --  and said  they\r\n\nreported  to the Regional  Directors.  Salivia  completed the\r\n\ninterviews  and  delivered  her  notes to  defendant  Enrique\r\n\nGonzalez-Polanco, Assistant Secretary in Charge of Personnel,\r\n\nor to Mrs. Carmen Haddock, who worked in the office.  Salivia\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndrew no conclusions and her investigation was terminated when\r\n\nshe went on vacation.\r\n\n          Rodriguez-de-Rivera also hired Francisco Cappas, an\r\n\noutside personnel consultant, to review the matter.  Although\r\n\nSalivia understood that her notes would be used in the Cappas\r\n\ninvestigation, the interview notes were never given to Cappas\r\n\nbefore he completed his reports.   Cappas apparently held  no\r\n\nposition within the government.\r\n\n          In June 1993,  Cappas submitted two letter  reports\r\n\nto  Rodriguez-de-Rivera.  In the first, he concluded that the\r\n\nposition of Managerial Coordinator should be declared a legal\r\n\nnullity  because it  had  been  improperly  created  and  was\r\n\nduplicative  of  the  duties   of  the  Regional   Directors.\r\n\nSpecifically, he  concluded that the  Managerial Coordinators\r\n\nwere in reality policymaking  officials who reported directly\r\n\nto the Secretary, not to the Regional Directors, and that the\r\n\nposition   should   therefore   have   been   classified   as\r\n\n\"confidential\"  rather than as  a career civil  service post.\r\n\nUnder  Puerto  Rico law,  \"confidential  employees\" are  only\r\n\nthose  employees  who report  directly  to  the head  of  the\r\n\nagency.    See 3  L.P.R.A.     1350 (aides  to  the heads  of\r                          \r\n\ndepartments, but not aides to regional directors, included in\r\n\nlist  of  confidential  employees).   These  conclusions  are\r\n\nfacially  contrary to  the determination  made  by COPA,  the\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\ncivil  service agency, when  it approved the  creation of the\r\n\npositions.2  \r\n\n          In his second report, Cappas concluded that many of\r\n\nthe  Managerial Coordinators  had  been improperly  promoted,\r\n\neven though COPA had approved many of these promotions at the\r\n\ntime.  Cappas recommended that the Managerial Coordinators be\r\n\ngiven a  hearing and -- if they could not counter his initial\r\n\nassessment   --  that  they  be  demoted  to  their  previous\r\n\npositions.\r\n\n          In  December  1993, Rodriguez-de-Rivera  asked  the\r\n\nSecretary of  Justice of  Puerto Rico for  an opinion  on the\r\n\nlegality  of   the  Managerial   Coordinators'  appointments,\r\n\nrepeating  the allegations  of the  Cappas reports.   In  May\r\n\n1994,  the Secretary of Justice declined  to give an opinion,\r\n\nnoting  that the  legality  of  the Managerial  Coordinators'\r\n\nappointments  depended  on  the  factual  accuracy  of  those\r\n\nallegations, not  on any question  of law, and  referred that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Cappas  said  that  the   COPA  document  describing  the\r\nposition  had originally stated that the position reported to\r\nthe Secretary, but that this document was altered with liquid\r\npaper  to state that  the position  reported to  the Regional\r\nDirectors.  Cappas drew the inference that COPA had conspired\r\nwith  the Managerial  Coordinators  to  alter the  documents.\r\nThere is  no evidence  that he  considered another  plausible\r\nexplanation  --that  the  alteration was  a  correction  of a\r\nmistake  in  the  original  --  and  Cappas  was  unaware  of\r\nplaintiffs'  statements  to Salivia  in the  field interviews\r\nthat they had always reported  to the Regional Directors.  Of\r\ncourse,  a  reasonable  jury  could  credit  the  plaintiffs'\r\ntestimony and discredit the defendants' forgery theory.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nissue  to COPA, whose special expertise is the administration\r\n\nof Puerto Rico's civil service laws.  \r\n\n          Rodriguez-de-Rivera then requested  the Director of\r\n\nCOPA and  the Director  of the  Budget and  Management Office\r\n\n(BMO)  to   determine  that   the   position  of   Managerial\r\n\nCoordinator was a  nullity, sending a copy of  her letters to\r\n\nGovernor Rosello and his staff.  The  COPA director responded\r\n\nby disputing  several of the  claims contained in  the Cappas\r\n\nreports,  and  by   refusing  to  nullify  the   position  or\r\n\npromotions of the Managerial Coordinators.\r\n\n          In  contrast with the civil service agency, the BMO\r\n\ndirector responded by stating that he could find no  document\r\n\nauthorizing budgetary approval for the position, and drew the\r\n\ninference that the position was therefore illegally created.3\r\n\n          In spite of  the COPA opinion,  on August 9,  1994,\r\n\nRodriguez-de-Rivera issued an  administrative order providing\r\n\n\"[t]hat all  positions classified as  Managerial Coordinators\r\n\nin the Department are null.\"  Plaintiffs were not afforded an\r\n\nadministrative hearing prior to this declaration, or given an\r\n\nopportunity  to dispute  the  allegations  contained  in  the\r\n\nCappas reports, although this had been recommended by Cappas.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  There is no evidence that the BMO director considered the\r\npossibility, also  plausible, that  the proper  document from\r\nsix years earlier simply had not been found.

We do  not\r\nregard such  colorful  rhetoric  as  necessarily  foreclosing\r\nsomething like the \"unreasonably inferior\" rule for personnel\r\nactions short of demotions or transfers.

In this  case, it was\r\n\nuncontested for summary judgment purposes that the plaintiffs\r\n\nwere  all members of the  adverse party, that their superiors\r\n\nknew  this,  and  that  their  duties  were given  to  active\r\n\nsupporters of  the party  in power.   Of course,  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt has cautioned that the mere fact that an adverse action\r\n\nwas  taken after an employee exercises First Amendment rights\r\n\nis not enough by itself to establish a prima facie case.

First, the  reason given for  the supposed\r\n\nnullity of the Managerial Coordinators' appointments was that\r\n\ntheir positions were  improperly classified as  civil service\r\n\nrather  than \"confidential\"  positions.   This  suggests that\r\n\ndefendants  believed it  was  appropriate  to take  political\r\n\nparty affiliation into  account in deciding to  eliminate the\r\n\nManagerial  Coordinators and transfer their duties to the new\r\n\naides to  the Regional  Directors.   Indeed, that is  exactly\r\n\nwhat plaintiffs  say happened: their  duties were transferred\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nto NPP members.  This  happened although a jury could readily\r\n\nfind the  position was  appropriately classified  as a  civil\r\n\nservice position.  \r\n\n          Second, a reasonable  jury could find Rodriguez-de-\r\n\nRivera's reaction to the initial complaint from a  PDP member\r\n\nthat  her  rights under  the  civil service  laws  were being\r\n\nviolated -- to launch an investigation of  the complainant --\r\n\nto be evidence of political discrimination.  \r\n\n          Third, the conduct of that investigation, including\r\n\nthe failure to apprise Cappas of the Managerial Coordinators'\r\n\nstatements  that they  reported  to the  Regional  Directors,\r\n\ncould   support  a  reasonable  inference  that  it  was  not\r\n\nconducted fairly, but rather was simply intended to provide a\r\n\nlegal  pretext  for  a foreordained  decision  to  demote the\r\n\nplaintiffs. \r\n\n          Fourth, the failure to afford  plaintiffs a hearing\r\n\nto  contest the allegations  concerning the alleged \"nullity\"\r\n\nof their  appointments and promotions  could likewise  fairly\r\n\nimply  that the Department  was uninterested in  the truth of\r\n\nthe controversy.  \r\n\n          Finally,  Rodriguez-de-Rivera's  disagreement  with\r\n\nthe advice of  COPA, Puerto Rico's civil  service commission,\r\n\ncasts   serious  doubt  on  the  supposed  \"nullity\"  of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' appointments or promotions and an inference could\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nbe  drawn that  her  decision  was in  fact  motivated by  an\r\n\nunlawful patronage objective.\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n          The  district  court  did  not  rest  its  decision\r\n\nentirely  on  its  view  of  plaintiffs'  prima  facie  case,\r\n\nhowever,  but decided  that defendants  had  established that\r\n\nthey  would  have   taken  the  same  action   regardless  of\r\n\nplaintiffs' political  affiliation  for  what  it  considered\r\n\n\"credible policy reasons\" of departmental  efficiency.  This,\r\n\nthe district  court  reasoned, established  a  valid  defense\r\n\nunder  Mount  Healthy.   The  district  court noted  what  it\r                                 \r\n\nconsidered \"a logical inconsistency\" in plaintiffs' claims of\r\n\npolitical  discrimination.    Observing that  the  record was\r\n\nunclear  whether every Managerial Coordinator was a member of\r\n\nthe PDP, the district court reasoned that political diversity\r\n\namong the Managerial Coordinators undercut plaintiffs' claims\r\n\nof political discrimination.6  The district court added that,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Of  course,  political  diversity  among  the  Managerial\r\nCoordinators would  not doom plaintiffs'  claim.   Defendants\r\ncannot  prevail simply  by showing  that  a desire  to reward\r\ntheir  political supporters, rather  than a desire  to punish\r\ntheir political opponents,  underlay their decision.   Either\r\nmotive may  produce unlawful  results.   The First  Amendment\r\ncondemns  \"the coercion of belief that necessarily flows from\r\nthe knowledge  that one must  have a sponsor in  the dominant\r\nparty  in order to retain one's job.\"   Branti v. Finkel, 445\r                                                                    \r\nU.S. 507, 516 (1980).

First, Cappas's finding that the existence\r\n\nof the Managerial  Coordinators interrupted the free  flow of\r\n\nthe  agency hierarchy  was based  on  a view  that plaintiffs\r\n\nreported  to  the  Secretary, not  to  her  subordinates, the\r\n\nRegional Directors.   Plaintiffs  have successfully  put this\r\n\nconclusion into doubt  through their sworn statements  to the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ntheir upward mobility in the agency thwarted in very concrete\r\nways.  Here, plaintiffs say  their duties were assumed by NPP\r\nmembers.    Rutan  expressly discussed  the  effect  on First\r                             \r\nAmendment rights  of employees  left in  such dead-end  jobs.\r\nSee Rutan, 497 U.S. at 73.\r                     \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\ncontrary.   Second, plaintiffs, in their affidavits, say that\r\n\ntheir duties and  responsibilities have  been transferred  to\r\n\nnew aides to the Regional Directors associated with the  NPP.\r\n\nIf  this is  true, it  calls into  question the  Department's\r\n\n\"efficiency\"  rationale,  as   the  addition  of   new  aides\r\n\nundercuts  any argument that the positions were eliminated to\r\n\nsave departmental resources.\r\n\n          Of course, defendants'  contention that plaintiffs'\r\n\ndemotions were the result of a valid concern for departmental\r\n\nefficiency and regularity -- even if political discrimination\r\n\nwas a  \"substantial factor\"  in the decision  -- is  a viable\r\n\ndefense at trial.  To establish that defense, defendants must\r\n\nshow  that the  allegedly bona  fide  reasons underlying  the\r\n\ndemotions  were  sufficient  by  themselves  to  justify  the\r\n\ndecisions.    After Rutan,  it  is clear  that  if defendants\r                                     \r\n\nthought  that  plaintiffs'   political  beliefs  alone  would\r\n\nprevent  them from carrying out the department's policy, that\r\n\nis  not  an  acceptable   reason  for  the  demotions.     \"A\r\n\ngovernment's  interest in securing employees who will loyally\r\n\nimplement its policies  can be adequately served  by choosing\r\n\nor  dismissing certain high-level  employees on the  basis of\r\n\ntheir political  views.\"   Rutan, 497  U.S. at  74 (citations\r                                            \r\n\nomitted).7   On the other  hand, if defendants  can establish\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  posture of  this  case  makes  it  inappropriate  to\r\nconduct   a   full-scale   examination   of   the   so-called\r\n\"changeover\"  or  \"reorganization\"   defense  established  by\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nthat  plaintiffs opposed  departmental policy  and that  they\r\n\nactively  attempted  in fact  to  thwart  it, that  could  be\r\n\nsufficient to establish a Mount Healthy defense.  See  Rutan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n497   U.S.  at  74  (\"A  government's  interest  in  securing\r\n\neffective  employees can be  met by discharging,  demoting or\r\n\ntransferring staff members whose work is deficient.\").\r\n\n          There  appears to be  lurking in the  wings of this\r\n\ncase, but not  on stage, a suggestion by  the defendants that\r\n\nif the plaintiffs were removed for  political reasons, and if\r\n\ntheir duties continued and were assigned to NPP members, that\r\n\nthose  duties  nevertheless  fall  within  the   Elrod-Branti\r                                                                         \r\n\nexception because those duties are sensitive enough to make a\r\n\npolitical  affiliation  requirement  appropriate.    However,\r\n\ndefendants  did not raise the Elrod-Branti exception issue in\r                                                      \r\n\ntheir  responsive pleading  or in  their  motion for  summary\r\n\njudgment.

Rather, the  district court\r\n\nrested its  decision  on its  view  that plaintiffs  had  not\r\n\nestablished  a prima  facie case.    The issue  has not  been\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d  at 1220-22 in light  of Rutan.\r                                                                        \r\nHowever, we can say that,  after Rutan, a public employer may\r                                                  \r\nnot assign tasks to supporters  of the party in power because\r\nit believes, solely on the basis of their  party affiliation,\r\nthat  such employees will more loyally implement its policies\r\n-- notwithstanding language in Agosto-de-Feliciano that might\r                                                              \r\nbe read to support such a decision.

Although the issue of the Elrod-Branti exception\r                                                               \r\n\nis  somewhat related to  the Secretary's contention  that the\r\n\npositions  were illegally created in part because they should\r\n\nhave been classified as \"confidential\" positions under Puerto\r\n\nRico law, it is by no  means the same argument.  See  Roldan-\r                                                                         \r\n\nPlumey,  115 F.3d at 64-65 (rejecting government's claim that\r                  \r\n\npolitical affiliation requirement is permitted despite Puerto\r\n\nRico's classification of position as \"confidential.\").\r\n\n          Until the contours  of the case  are clear, we  are\r\n\nreluctant,  as we  have  been  invited to  do,  to engage  in\r\n\nfurther analysis  of the effects  of Rutan  on the  so-called\r                                                      \r\n\n\"changeover\"  or  \"reorganization\"  defense  as  outlined  in\r\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1220-22.\r                               \r\n\n          Finally,   we  note   that,   if  plaintiffs   were\r\n\noriginally classified appropriately  as career civil  service\r\n\nemployees,  their claims  under the  Due  Process Clause  and\r\n\nunder  the constitution  and  laws  of  Puerto  Rico  survive\r\n\nindependently  of their First Amendment claim.  If plaintiffs\r\n\nreported to the Regional Directors,  as they claim, they were\r\n\napparently classified  appropriately as career  employees and\r\n\nare therefore protected against political discharge under the\r\n\ncivil service laws of Puerto  Rico.  See 3 L.P.R.A.     1301,\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n1331-1338.    The  Puerto Rico  legislature  may,  of course,\r\n\nestablish  a  civil  service  system  that  provides  greater\r\n\nprotection against  political discrimination  than the  First\r\n\nAmendment.  Plaintiffs may have claims under the Constitution\r\n\nof Puerto  Rico as  well.  Cf.

All plaintiffs belong to the PDP, the party of former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, who held office for two terms between 1984 and 1992.  In a process that began in late 1987, a new supervisory position of \"Managerial Coordinator\" was created within the Department.  Between 1988 and 1992, the six plaintiffs and several others were promoted to this new position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Managerial Coordinator classification was a middle level managerial position created to provide assistance to the several Regional Directors.  The Regional Directors, in turn, report to the Secretary, a member of the Governor's cabinet.  The Managerial Coordinator job was established as a career position under Puerto Rico's civil service laws, which require that such an employee be selected strictly on merit and can only be removed for cause.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 1301, 1331-1338;  Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1213 n. 3 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).  The Regional Directors, in contrast, were classified as \"confidential employees,\" who are involved in the formation of public policy and render direct services to the head of the department, the Secretary of Social Services.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1350;  Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1213 n. 3. The Central Office of Personnel Administration (COPA), the agency charged with administering Puerto Rico's civil service laws, approved the creation of the Managerial Coordinator position.  In approving the position, the civil service agency necessarily concluded that political affiliation was not a necessary prerequisite for holding a Managerial Coordinator position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Director of COPA described the position generally, in a job description written in 1988, as entailing \"managerial and administrative work of great complexity and responsibility in the coordination and evaluation of the ... activities of the Local Offices....\"  Plaintiffs' immediate superiors were the Regional Directors.  On paper, according to the COPA job description, the official duties of a Managerial Coordinator included offering technical advice on the agency's work plans, keeping the Regional Directors and the Secretary informed of local office operations, investigating and reporting on grievances of employees, monitoring local offices' expenses, training local office supervisors, analyzing statistical reports, preparing reports about evaluation visits to local offices, and other duties.  In practice, plaintiffs' duties as Managerial Coordinators ranged widely, and included coordinating inter-agency programs, attending to client complaints, substituting for the Regional Director, planning professional and social activities, and signing per diem and mileage reimbursement checks.  Plaintiffs' positions \"provid[ed] support functions to the Regional Directors, analogous to those of an aide.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1992 general election, the PDP was defeated by the rival NPP, and the present governor, Pedro Rosello, came to power.  Governor Rosello named defendant Carmen Rodriguez-de-Rivera as Secretary of Social Services.  Rodriguez-de-Rivera, in turn, hired the Regional Directors.  In the first month of the new administration, the Regional Directors began to take away many of the duties and functions that the Managerial Coordinators had been performing, assigning those duties to other employees who were NPP activists and had been designated, officially or unofficially, as aides to the Regional Directors.  Additionally, the Regional Directors took away from the Managerial Coordinators several perquisites that had been associated with that position, such as parking, telephones and office space.  Defendants were aware of plaintiffs' PDP political party affiliation, and the aides to whom plaintiffs' duties were assigned were all politically active supporters of the NPP party, newly in power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, one Managerial Coordinator wrote defendant Rodriguez-de-Rivera, to complain that the new Regional Directors had taken away the duties and perquisites of her position.  Rodriguez-de-Rivera's reaction was to launch an investigation of the complainant and the other Managerial Coordinators.  The stated purpose of the investigation was to determine whether the creation of the position and the selection of candidates had been proper.  Plaintiffs contend that the real purpose of the investigation was to provide a legal cover for the impending demotions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1993, Secretary Rodriguez-de-Rivera dispatched Carmen Salivia, an official of the Social Services Department, to conduct field interviews with the Managerial Coordinators.  During the interviews, the Managerial Coordinators described the duties of their positions--now being performed by NPP-affiliated aides--and said they reported to the Regional Directors.  Salivia completed the interviews and delivered her notes to defendant Enrique Gonzalez-Polanco, Assistant Secretary in Charge of Personnel, or to Mrs. Carmen Haddock, who worked in the office.  Salivia drew no conclusions and her investigation was terminated when she went on vacation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez-de-Rivera also hired Francisco Cappas, an outside personnel consultant, to review the matter.  Although Salivia understood that her notes would be used in the Cappas investigation, the interview notes were never given to Cappas before he completed his reports.  Cappas apparently held no position within the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1993, Cappas submitted two letter reports to Rodriguez-de-Rivera.  In the first, he concluded that the position of Managerial Coordinator should be declared a legal nullity because it had been improperly created and was duplicative of the duties of the Regional Directors.  Specifically, he concluded that the Managerial Coordinators were in reality policymaking officials who reported directly to the Secretary, not to the Regional Directors, and that the position should therefore have been classified as \"confidential\" rather than as a career civil service post.  Under Puerto Rico law, \"confidential employees\" are only those employees who report directly to the head of the agency.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1350 (aides to the heads of departments, but not aides to regional directors, included in list of confidential employees).  These conclusions are facially contrary to the determination made by COPA, the civil service agency, when it approved the creation of the positions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second report, Cappas concluded that many of the Managerial Coordinators had been improperly promoted, even though COPA had approved many of these promotions at the time.  Cappas recommended that the Managerial Coordinators be given a hearing and--if they could not counter his initial assessment--that they be demoted to their previous positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1993, Rodriguez-de-Rivera asked the Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico for an opinion on the legality of the Managerial Coordinators' appointments, repeating the allegations of the Cappas reports.  In May 1994, the Secretary of Justice declined to give an opinion, noting that the legality of the Managerial Coordinators' appointments depended on the factual accuracy of those allegations, not on any question of law, and referred that issue to COPA, whose special expertise is the administration of Puerto Rico's civil service laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez-de-Rivera then requested the Director of COPA and the Director of the Budget and Management Office (BMO) to determine that the position of Managerial Coordinator was a nullity, sending a copy of her letters to Governor Rosello and his staff.  The COPA director responded by disputing several of the claims contained in the Cappas reports, and by refusing to nullify the position or promotions of the Managerial Coordinators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast with the civil service agency, the BMO director responded by stating that he could find no document authorizing budgetary approval for the position, and drew the inference that the position was therefore illegally created.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of the COPA opinion, on August 9, 1994, Rodriguez-de-Rivera issued an administrative order providing \"[t]hat all positions classified as Managerial Coordinators in the Department are null.\"   Plaintiffs were not afforded an administrative hearing prior to this declaration, or given an opportunity to dispute the allegations contained in the Cappas reports, although this had been recommended by Cappas.  Each of the plaintiffs was thereafter demoted to the positions they had previously held within the agency.  As a result of the nullification order, each of the plaintiffs suffered a loss of salary in addition to making permanent and official their previous de facto loss of position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs say that their significant job functions have been assumed by other persons, all NPP members, all in the position of aides to the Regional Directors.  It is our understanding that aides to persons at the level of regional directors cannot be classified as \"confidential\" (or political) employees within the Puerto Rico personnel system.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1350.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, plaintiffs filed suit, alleging violations of their First Amendment rights of political affiliation under Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980) and Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990).  Plaintiffs also alleged that they were deprived of a property interest without due process of law, and that their demotions violated the constitution and statutes of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  On January 27, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment for defendants, finding that plaintiffs had not shown a causal connection between their demotions and their political affiliation.  The district court also reasoned that defendants' stated rationale for the demotions--departmental efficiency and respect for the personnel laws--was sufficient to compel a finding that defendants had a defense under Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), even if political affiliation had played some part in their decision.III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs have produced evidence sufficient to support a prima facie case of political party discrimination.  The First Amendment prohibits the government from demoting an employee for patronage purposes unless political party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for that position.  See Rutan, 497 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2731-32;  Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir.1993).  A plaintiff who was demoted from a job for which a party affiliation requirement is inappropriate \"may ordinarily forestall summary judgment by pointing to evidence in the record which, if credited, would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that a demotion occurred and that it stemmed from a discriminatory animus.\"  Nereida-Gonzalez, 990 F.2d at 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that plaintiffs were demoted;  the \"nullity\" decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> eliminated their supervisory positions altogether and returned them to the jobs they held previously, which are of lower rank and salary.  As the subjects of demotion, \"which involve reductions in pay and official rank,\" Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1218 n. 8, plaintiffs plainly need not establish that their new \"work situation [is] unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position\" such that \"the new work conditions would place substantial pressure on even one of thick skin to conform to the prevailing political view.\"  Id. at 1218.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the summary judgment record amply demonstrates that a rational factfinder could conclude that the demotions stemmed from a discriminatory animus.  In this case, it was uncontested for summary judgment purposes that the plaintiffs were all members of the adverse party, that their superiors knew this, and that their duties were given to active supporters of the party in power.  Of course, the Supreme Court has cautioned that the mere fact that an adverse action was taken after an employee exercises First Amendment rights is not enough by itself to establish a prima facie case.  See Board of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, ----, 116 S.Ct. 2342, 2352, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996).  \"Merely juxtaposing a protected characteristic--someone else's politics--with the fact plaintiff was treated unfairly is not enough to state a constitutional claim.\"  Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 58 (1st Cir.1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, a plaintiff need not produce direct evidence of discriminatory treatment (a so-called \"smoking gun\") to establish a prima facie case of politically discriminatory demotion.  We have reversed entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants in cases where plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence of a discriminatory animus through circumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., Rivera-Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332, 335 (1st Cir.1993);  Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 39-40 (1st Cir.1993);  Aponte-Santiago v. Lopez-Rivera, 957 F.2d 40, 43 (1st Cir.1992).  In Anthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603 (1st Cir.1991), this court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>[T]he appellants' argument seems to be that political favoritism must be proved by direct evidence.  We disagree.  Victims of heavy-handed uses of the spoils system are not limited to redress in only those (relatively rare) instances in which a \"smoking gun\" can be produced.  To the exact contrary, we have held, time and again, that circumstantial evidence alone can support a finding of political discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 605 (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, plaintiffs presented much more than the mere fact that they were demoted by supervisors of a different party.  First, the reason given for the supposed nullity of the Managerial Coordinators' appointments was that their positions were improperly classified as civil service rather than \"confidential\" positions.  This suggests that defendants believed it was appropriate to take political party affiliation into account in deciding to eliminate the Managerial Coordinators and transfer their duties to the new aides to the Regional Directors.  Indeed, that is exactly what plaintiffs say happened:  their duties were transferred to NPP members.  This happened although a jury could readily find the position was appropriately classified as a civil service position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a reasonable jury could find Rodriguez-de-Rivera's reaction to the initial complaint from a PDP member that her rights under the civil service laws were being violated--to launch an investigation of the complainant--to be evidence of political discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the conduct of that investigation, including the failure to apprise Cappas of the Managerial Coordinators' statements that they reported to the Regional Directors, could support a reasonable inference that it was not conducted fairly, but rather was simply intended to provide a legal pretext for a foreordained decision to demote the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the failure to afford plaintiffs a hearing to contest the allegations concerning the alleged \"nullity\" of their appointments and promotions could likewise fairly imply that the Department was uninterested in the truth of the controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rodriguez-de-Rivera's disagreement with the advice of COPA, Puerto Rico's civil service commission, casts serious doubt on the supposed \"nullity\" of the plaintiffs' appointments or promotions and an inference could be drawn that her decision was in fact motivated by an unlawful patronage objective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not rest its decision entirely on its view of plaintiffs' prima facie case, however, but decided that defendants had established that they would have taken the same action regardless of plaintiffs' political affiliation for what it considered \"credible policy reasons\" of departmental efficiency.  This, the district court reasoned, established a valid defense under Mount Healthy.   The district court noted what it considered \"a logical inconsistency\" in plaintiffs' claims of political discrimination.  Observing that the record was unclear whether every Managerial Coordinator was a member of the PDP, the district court reasoned that political diversity among the Managerial Coordinators undercut plaintiffs' claims of political discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The district court added that, alternatively, if the positions were filled exclusively with PDP members, that \"would indicate that the position served some political purpose, and was thus a 'de confianza,' or trust position,\" as the Cappas report had claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of persuasion is on the Secretary to establish a Mount Healthy defense.  \"Summary judgment would have been warranted ... only if defendants' evidentiary proffer compelled the finding that political discrimination did not constitute a 'but for' cause for the demotion.\"  Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait, 37 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994).  Here, there are significant disputes of material fact which preclude a finding on summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' evidence that their decision was motivated by a concern for departmental efficiency that would have resulted in the same personnel action regardless of plaintiffs' political affiliation is both disputed and far from conclusive.  First, Cappas's finding that the existence of the Managerial Coordinators interrupted the free flow of the agency hierarchy was based on a view that plaintiffs reported to the Secretary, not to her subordinates, the Regional Directors.  Plaintiffs have successfully put this conclusion into doubt through their sworn statements to the contrary.  Second, plaintiffs, in their affidavits, say that their duties and responsibilities have been transferred to new aides to the Regional Directors associated with the NPP. If this is true, it calls into question the Department's \"efficiency\" rationale, as the addition of new aides undercuts any argument that the positions were eliminated to save departmental resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, defendants' contention that plaintiffs' demotions were the result of a valid concern for departmental efficiency and regularity--even if political discrimination was a \"substantial factor\" in the decision--is a viable defense at trial.  To establish that defense, defendants must show that the allegedly bona fide reasons underlying the demotions were sufficient by themselves to justify the decisions.  After Rutan, it is clear that if defendants thought that plaintiffs' political beliefs alone would prevent them from carrying out the department's policy, that is not an acceptable reason for the demotions.  \"A government's interest in securing employees who will loyally implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or dismissing certain high-level employees on the basis of their political views.\"  Rutan, 497 U.S. at 74, 110 S.Ct. at 2738 (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On the other hand, if defendants can establish that plaintiffs opposed departmental policy and that they actively attempted in fact to thwart it, that could be sufficient to establish a Mount Healthy defense.  See Rutan, 497 U.S. at 74, 110 S.Ct. at 2737 (\"A government's interest in securing effective employees can be met by discharging, demoting or transferring staff members whose work is deficient.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There appears to be lurking in the wings of this case, but not on stage, a suggestion by the defendants that if the plaintiffs were removed for political reasons, and if their duties continued and were assigned to NPP members, that those duties nevertheless fall within the Elrod-Branti exception because those duties are sensitive enough to make a political affiliation requirement appropriate.  However, defendants did not raise the Elrod-Branti exception issue in their responsive pleading or in their motion for summary judgment.  The district court mentioned the Elrod-Branti exception despite the defendants' failure to articulate it, but did not resolve the issue.  Rather, the district court rested its decision on its view that plaintiffs had not established a prima facie case.  The issue has not been fairly briefed on appeal.  This court does not decide issues on appeal that have not been properly raised before the district court.  See McAleer v. Smith, 57 F.3d 109, 115 (1st Cir.1995).  Although the issue of the Elrod-Branti exception is somewhat related to the Secretary's contention that the positions were illegally created in part because they should have been classified as \"confidential\" positions under Puerto Rico law, it is by no means the same argument.  See Roldan-Plumey, 115 F.3d at 64-65 (rejecting government's claim that political affiliation requirement is permitted despite Puerto Rico's classification of position as \"confidential.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until the contours of the case are clear, we are reluctant, as we have been invited to do, to engage in further analysis of the effects of Rutan on the so-called \"changeover\" or \"reorganization\" defense as outlined in Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1220-22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that, if plaintiffs were originally classified appropriately as career civil service employees, their claims under the Due Process Clause and under the constitution and laws of Puerto Rico survive independently of their First Amendment claim.  If plaintiffs reported to the Regional Directors, as they claim, they were apparently classified appropriately as career employees and are therefore protected against political discharge under the civil service laws of Puerto Rico.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 1301, 1331-1338.  The Puerto Rico legislature may, of course, establish a civil service system that provides greater protection against political discrimination than the First Amendment.  Plaintiffs may have claims under the Constitution of Puerto Rico as well.  Cf. Jimenez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 249-250 (Torruella, J., dissenting) (noting that Supreme Court of Puerto Rico grants broad protection against political discrimination, perhaps broader than this circuit's interpretation of the First Amendment);  Raffucci-Alvarado, 816 F.2d at 822-23 (Torruella, J., dissenting) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, because of plaintiffs' tenured status under Puerto Rico law, their summary demotions could raise a claim under the Due Process Clause if their appointments were proper.  See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1493, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (guaranteeing procedural protections to public employees with a property interest in continued employment under state law);  Rivera-Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332, 334 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that, under Puerto Rico law, the existence of a property right in continued public sector employment is dependent on the legality of plaintiffs' appointments under Puerto Rico's civil service laws).  That Due Process claim is not dependent on the merits of plaintiffs' First Amendment claims;  the inquiries are distinct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See Nieves-Villanueva v.

Cappas drew the inference that COPA had conspired with the Managerial Coordinators to alter the documents.  There is no evidence that he considered another plausible explanation--that the alteration was a correction of a mistake in the original--and Cappas was unaware of plaintiffs' statements to Salivia in the field interviews that they had always reported to the Regional Directors.  Of course, a reasonable jury could credit the plaintiffs' testimony and discredit the defendants' forgery theory</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There is no evidence that the BMO director considered the possibility, also plausible, that the proper document from six years earlier simply had not been found.

See id. at 1218 n. 8. Thus we need not consider whether that doctrine survives the Supreme Court's extension of First Amendment protections against patronage dismissals to \"promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions.\"  Rutan, 497 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. at 2739.  \"It is an interesting question whether some vestige of [the 'unreasonably inferior' rule] survives Rutan, thereby providing a sort of ... intermediate First Amendment haven for employees wounded by slings and arrows less damaging than those [official actions] described by the Rutan court.\"  Nereida-Gonzalez, 990 F.2d at 705.   That question must be answered another day</p>\n        <p>The Rutan Court suggested in dicta that any adverse action against a public employee, no matter how minor, violates the First Amendment if it is in retaliation for an employee's exercise of First Amendment rights.  See Rutan, 497 U.S. at 76 n. 8, 110 S.Ct. at 2738 n. 8 (\"The First Amendment ... protects state employees ... from even an act of retaliation as trivial as failing to hold a birthday party ... when intended to punish [them] for exercising [their] free speech rights.\"  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  We do not regard such colorful rhetoric as necessarily foreclosing something like the \"unreasonably inferior\" rule for personnel actions short of demotions or transfers.  The Rutan Court was concerned with \"deprivations less harsh than dismissal that nevertheless press state employees and applicants to conform their beliefs and associations to some state-selected orthodoxy,\" id. at 75, 110 S.Ct. at 2737, a formulation similar to Agosto-de-Feliciano 's standard that \"the new work conditions would place substantial pressure on even one of thick skin to conform to the prevailing political view.\"  Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1218.   We leave the resolution of any conflict in the standard for such adverse personnel actions to some future case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Of course, political diversity among the Managerial Coordinators would not doom plaintiffs' claim.  Defendants cannot prevail simply by showing that a desire to reward their political supporters, rather than a desire to punish their political opponents, underlay their decision.  Either motive may produce unlawful results.  The First Amendment condemns \"the coercion of belief that necessarily flows from the knowledge that one must have a sponsor in the dominant party in order to retain one's job.\"  Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 516, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 1294, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980).  That coercion is equally unlawful when it is directed toward apolitical career employees as when it is directed towards a party's political opponents.  See Bennis v. Gable, 823 F.2d 723, 731-32 (3d Cir.1987).  That a party chooses to reward its followers with good jobs inevitably affects those who are not followers and who see their upward mobility in the agency thwarted in very concrete ways.  Here, plaintiffs say their duties were assumed by NPP members.  Rutan expressly discussed the effect on First Amendment rights of employees left in such dead-end jobs.

However, we can say that, after Rutan, a public employer may not assign tasks to supporters of the party in power because it believes, solely on the basis of their party affiliation, that such employees will more loyally implement its policies--notwithstanding language in Agosto-de-Feliciano that might be read to support such a decision.

In these cases, plaintiffs are government employees who are members of the losing Popular Democratic Party (PDP) who assert that they were terminated or demoted from their jobs because of their political affiliation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This court faced an earlier wave of such cases when PDP candidates won election in 1984 and NPP members complained that their government jobs suffered because of their party membership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the PDP-affiliated plaintiffs are six long-term government employees who were demoted from their civil service positions as Managerial Coordinators in the Commonwealth's Department of Social Services, now known as the Department of the Family.  They say their duties are now being performed by NPP members who have been designated as aides to the Regional Directors of the agency.  The district court granted summary judgment for defendants on the theory that plaintiffs had not made out a prima facie case and that defendants had established they would have taken action anyway for non-political reasons, regardless of plaintiffs' political affiliation.

See id. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs are six career civil service employees of the former Department of Social Services of Puerto Rico, now known as the Department of the Family, all of whom have been working at the Department for over twenty years.  All plaintiffs belong to the PDP, the party of former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, who held office for two terms between 1984 and 1992.  In a process that began in late 1987, a new supervisory position of \"Managerial Coordinator\" was created within the Department.  Between 1988 and 1992, the six plaintiffs and several others were promoted to this new position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Managerial Coordinator classification was a middle level managerial position created to provide assistance to the several Regional Directors.  The Regional Directors, in turn, report to the Secretary, a member of the Governor's cabinet.  The Managerial Coordinator job was established as a career position under Puerto Rico's civil service laws, which require that such an employee be selected strictly on merit and can only be removed for cause.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 1301, 1331-1338;  Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1213 n. 3 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).  The Regional Directors, in contrast, were classified as \"confidential employees,\" who are involved in the formation of public policy and render direct services to the head of the department, the Secretary of Social Services.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1350;  Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1213 n. 3. The Central Office of Personnel Administration (COPA), the agency charged with administering Puerto Rico's civil service laws, approved the creation of the Managerial Coordinator position.  In approving the position, the civil service agency necessarily concluded that political affiliation was not a necessary prerequisite for holding a Managerial Coordinator position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Director of COPA described the position generally, in a job description written in 1988, as entailing \"managerial and administrative work of great complexity and responsibility in the coordination and evaluation of the ... activities of the Local Offices....\"  Plaintiffs' immediate superiors were the Regional Directors.  On paper, according to the COPA job description, the official duties of a Managerial Coordinator included offering technical advice on the agency's work plans, keeping the Regional Directors and the Secretary informed of local office operations, investigating and reporting on grievances of employees, monitoring local offices' expenses, training local office supervisors, analyzing statistical reports, preparing reports about evaluation visits to local offices, and other duties.  In practice, plaintiffs' duties as Managerial Coordinators ranged widely, and included coordinating inter-agency programs, attending to client complaints, substituting for the Regional Director, planning professional and social activities, and signing per diem and mileage reimbursement checks.  Plaintiffs' positions \"provid[ed] support functions to the Regional Directors, analogous to those of an aide.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1992 general election, the PDP was defeated by the rival NPP, and the present governor, Pedro Rosello, came to power.  Governor Rosello named defendant Carmen Rodriguez-de-Rivera as Secretary of Social Services.  Rodriguez-de-Rivera, in turn, hired the Regional Directors.  In the first month of the new administration, the Regional Directors began to take away many of the duties and functions that the Managerial Coordinators had been performing, assigning those duties to other employees who were NPP activists and had been designated, officially or unofficially, as aides to the Regional Directors.  Additionally, the Regional Directors took away from the Managerial Coordinators several perquisites that had been associated with that position, such as parking, telephones and office space.  Defendants were aware of plaintiffs' PDP political party affiliation, and the aides to whom plaintiffs' duties were assigned were all politically active supporters of the NPP party, newly in power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, one Managerial Coordinator wrote defendant Rodriguez-de-Rivera, to complain that the new Regional Directors had taken away the duties and perquisites of her position.  Rodriguez-de-Rivera's reaction was to launch an investigation of the complainant and the other Managerial Coordinators.  The stated purpose of the investigation was to determine whether the creation of the position and the selection of candidates had been proper.  Plaintiffs contend that the real purpose of the investigation was to provide a legal cover for the impending demotions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1993, Secretary Rodriguez-de-Rivera dispatched Carmen Salivia, an official of the Social Services Department, to conduct field interviews with the Managerial Coordinators.  During the interviews, the Managerial Coordinators described the duties of their positions--now being performed by NPP-affiliated aides--and said they reported to the Regional Directors.  Salivia completed the interviews and delivered her notes to defendant Enrique Gonzalez-Polanco, Assistant Secretary in Charge of Personnel, or to Mrs. Carmen Haddock, who worked in the office.  Salivia drew no conclusions and her investigation was terminated when she went on vacation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez-de-Rivera also hired Francisco Cappas, an outside personnel consultant, to review the matter.  Although Salivia understood that her notes would be used in the Cappas investigation, the interview notes were never given to Cappas before he completed his reports.  Cappas apparently held no position within the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1993, Cappas submitted two letter reports to Rodriguez-de-Rivera.  In the first, he concluded that the position of Managerial Coordinator should be declared a legal nullity because it had been improperly created and was duplicative of the duties of the Regional Directors.  Specifically, he concluded that the Managerial Coordinators were in reality policymaking officials who reported directly to the Secretary, not to the Regional Directors, and that the position should therefore have been classified as \"confidential\" rather than as a career civil service post.  Under Puerto Rico law, \"confidential employees\" are only those employees who report directly to the head of the agency.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1350 (aides to the heads of departments, but not aides to regional directors, included in list of confidential employees).  These conclusions are facially contrary to the determination made by COPA, the civil service agency, when it approved the creation of the positions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his second report, Cappas concluded that many of the Managerial Coordinators had been improperly promoted, even though COPA had approved many of these promotions at the time.  Cappas recommended that the Managerial Coordinators be given a hearing and--if they could not counter his initial assessment--that they be demoted to their previous positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1993, Rodriguez-de-Rivera asked the Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico for an opinion on the legality of the Managerial Coordinators' appointments, repeating the allegations of the Cappas reports.  In May 1994, the Secretary of Justice declined to give an opinion, noting that the legality of the Managerial Coordinators' appointments depended on the factual accuracy of those allegations, not on any question of law, and referred that issue to COPA, whose special expertise is the administration of Puerto Rico's civil service laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez-de-Rivera then requested the Director of COPA and the Director of the Budget and Management Office (BMO) to determine that the position of Managerial Coordinator was a nullity, sending a copy of her letters to Governor Rosello and his staff.  The COPA director responded by disputing several of the claims contained in the Cappas reports, and by refusing to nullify the position or promotions of the Managerial Coordinators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast with the civil service agency, the BMO director responded by stating that he could find no document authorizing budgetary approval for the position, and drew the inference that the position was therefore illegally created.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of the COPA opinion, on August 9, 1994, Rodriguez-de-Rivera issued an administrative order providing \"[t]hat all positions classified as Managerial Coordinators in the Department are null.\"   Plaintiffs were not afforded an administrative hearing prior to this declaration, or given an opportunity to dispute the allegations contained in the Cappas reports, although this had been recommended by Cappas.  Each of the plaintiffs was thereafter demoted to the positions they had previously held within the agency.  As a result of the nullification order, each of the plaintiffs suffered a loss of salary in addition to making permanent and official their previous de facto loss of position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs say that their significant job functions have been assumed by other persons, all NPP members, all in the position of aides to the Regional Directors.  It is our understanding that aides to persons at the level of regional directors cannot be classified as \"confidential\" (or political) employees within the Puerto Rico personnel system.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1350.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, plaintiffs filed suit, alleging violations of their First Amendment rights of political affiliation under Elrod v.

Plaintiffs also alleged that they were deprived of a property interest without due process of law, and that their demotions violated the constitution and statutes of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  On January 27, 1997, the district court granted summary judgment for defendants, finding that plaintiffs had not shown a causal connection between their demotions and their political affiliation.  The district court also reasoned that defendants' stated rationale for the demotions--departmental efficiency and respect for the personnel laws--was sufficient to compel a finding that defendants had a defense under Mount Healthy City Sch.

The First Amendment prohibits the government from demoting an employee for patronage purposes unless political party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for that position.  See Rutan, 497 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2731-32;  Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604127\"><a href=\"/opinion/604127/carmen-nereida-gonzalez-v-cirilo-tirado-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 705 (1st Cir.1993).  A plaintiff who was demoted from a job for which a party affiliation requirement is inappropriate \"may ordinarily forestall summary judgment by pointing to evidence in the record which, if credited, would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that a demotion occurred and that it stemmed from a discriminatory animus.\"  Nereida-Gonzalez, 990 F.2d at 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that plaintiffs were demoted;  the \"nullity\" decree<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> eliminated their supervisory positions altogether and returned them to the jobs they held previously, which are of lower rank and salary.  As the subjects of demotion, \"which involve reductions in pay and official rank,\" Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1218 n. 8, plaintiffs plainly need not establish that their new \"work situation [is] unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position\" such that \"the new work conditions would place substantial pressure on even one of thick skin to conform to the prevailing political view.\"  Id. at 1218.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the summary judgment record amply demonstrates that a rational factfinder could conclude that the demotions stemmed from a discriminatory animus.  In this case, it was uncontested for summary judgment purposes that the plaintiffs were all members of the adverse party, that their superiors knew this, and that their duties were given to active supporters of the party in power.  Of course, the Supreme Court has cautioned that the mere fact that an adverse action was taken after an employee exercises First Amendment rights is not enough by itself to establish a prima facie case.  See Board of County Comm'rs v.

We disagree.  Victims of heavy-handed uses of the spoils system are not limited to redress in only those (relatively rare) instances in which a \"smoking gun\" can be produced.

First, the reason given for the supposed nullity of the Managerial Coordinators' appointments was that their positions were improperly classified as civil service rather than \"confidential\" positions.  This suggests that defendants believed it was appropriate to take political party affiliation into account in deciding to eliminate the Managerial Coordinators and transfer their duties to the new aides to the Regional Directors.  Indeed, that is exactly what plaintiffs say happened:  their duties were transferred to NPP members.  This happened although a jury could readily find the position was appropriately classified as a civil service position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, a reasonable jury could find Rodriguez-de-Rivera's reaction to the initial complaint from a PDP member that her rights under the civil service laws were being violated--to launch an investigation of the complainant--to be evidence of political discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the conduct of that investigation, including the failure to apprise Cappas of the Managerial Coordinators' statements that they reported to the Regional Directors, could support a reasonable inference that it was not conducted fairly, but rather was simply intended to provide a legal pretext for a foreordained decision to demote the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the failure to afford plaintiffs a hearing to contest the allegations concerning the alleged \"nullity\" of their appointments and promotions could likewise fairly imply that the Department was uninterested in the truth of the controversy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rodriguez-de-Rivera's disagreement with the advice of COPA, Puerto Rico's civil service commission, casts serious doubt on the supposed \"nullity\" of the plaintiffs' appointments or promotions and an inference could be drawn that her decision was in fact motivated by an unlawful patronage objective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not rest its decision entirely on its view of plaintiffs' prima facie case, however, but decided that defendants had established that they would have taken the same action regardless of plaintiffs' political affiliation for what it considered \"credible policy reasons\" of departmental efficiency.  This, the district court reasoned, established a valid defense under Mount Healthy.   The district court noted what it considered \"a logical inconsistency\" in plaintiffs' claims of political discrimination.  Observing that the record was unclear whether every Managerial Coordinator was a member of the PDP, the district court reasoned that political diversity among the Managerial Coordinators undercut plaintiffs' claims of political discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The district court added that, alternatively, if the positions were filled exclusively with PDP members, that \"would indicate that the position served some political purpose, and was thus a 'de confianza,' or trust position,\" as the Cappas report had claimed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of persuasion is on the Secretary to establish a Mount Healthy defense.  \"Summary judgment would have been warranted ... only if defendants' evidentiary proffer compelled the finding that political discrimination did not constitute a 'but for' cause for the demotion.\"  Jirau-Bernal v. Agrait, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195629\"><a href=\"/opinion/195629/jirau-bernal-v-agrait/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1994).  Here, there are significant disputes of material fact which preclude a finding on summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' evidence that their decision was motivated by a concern for departmental efficiency that would have resulted in the same personnel action regardless of plaintiffs' political affiliation is both disputed and far from conclusive.  First, Cappas's finding that the existence of the Managerial Coordinators interrupted the free flow of the agency hierarchy was based on a view that plaintiffs reported to the Secretary, not to her subordinates, the Regional Directors.  Plaintiffs have successfully put this conclusion into doubt through their sworn statements to the contrary.  Second, plaintiffs, in their affidavits, say that their duties and responsibilities have been transferred to new aides to the Regional Directors associated with the NPP. If this is true, it calls into question the Department's \"efficiency\" rationale, as the addition of new aides undercuts any argument that the positions were eliminated to save departmental resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, defendants' contention that plaintiffs' demotions were the result of a valid concern for departmental efficiency and regularity--even if political discrimination was a \"substantial factor\" in the decision--is a viable defense at trial.  To establish that defense, defendants must show that the allegedly bona fide reasons underlying the demotions were sufficient by themselves to justify the decisions.  After Rutan, it is clear that if defendants thought that plaintiffs' political beliefs alone would prevent them from carrying out the department's policy, that is not an acceptable reason for the demotions.  \"A government's interest in securing employees who will loyally implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or dismissing certain high-level employees on the basis of their political views.\"  Rutan, 497 U.S. at 74, 110 S.Ct. at 2738 (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On the other hand, if defendants can establish that plaintiffs opposed departmental policy and that they actively attempted in fact to thwart it, that could be sufficient to establish a Mount Healthy defense.  See Rutan, 497 U.S. at 74, 110 S.Ct. at 2737 (\"A government's interest in securing effective employees can be met by discharging, demoting or transferring staff members whose work is deficient.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There appears to be lurking in the wings of this case, but not on stage, a suggestion by the defendants that if the plaintiffs were removed for political reasons, and if their duties continued and were assigned to NPP members, that those duties nevertheless fall within the Elrod-Branti exception because those duties are sensitive enough to make a political affiliation requirement appropriate.  However, defendants did not raise the Elrod-Branti exception issue in their responsive pleading or in their motion for summary judgment.  The district court mentioned the Elrod-Branti exception despite the defendants' failure to articulate it, but did not resolve the issue.  Rather, the district court rested its decision on its view that plaintiffs had not established a prima facie case.  The issue has not been fairly briefed on appeal.  This court does not decide issues on appeal that have not been properly raised before the district court.  See McAleer v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196156\"><a href=\"/opinion/196156/mcaller-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 115 (1st Cir.1995).  Although the issue of the Elrod-Branti exception is somewhat related to the Secretary's contention that the positions were illegally created in part because they should have been classified as \"confidential\" positions under Puerto Rico law, it is by no means the same argument.  See Roldan-Plumey, 115 F.3d at 64-65 (rejecting government's claim that political affiliation requirement is permitted despite Puerto Rico's classification of position as \"confidential.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until the contours of the case are clear, we are reluctant, as we have been invited to do, to engage in further analysis of the effects of Rutan on the so-called \"changeover\" or \"reorganization\" defense as outlined in Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1220-22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that, if plaintiffs were originally classified appropriately as career civil service employees, their claims under the Due Process Clause and under the constitution and laws of Puerto Rico survive independently of their First Amendment claim.  If plaintiffs reported to the Regional Directors, as they claim, they were apparently classified appropriately as career employees and are therefore protected against political discharge under the civil service laws of Puerto Rico.  See 3 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 1301, 1331-1338.  The Puerto Rico legislature may, of course, establish a civil service system that provides greater protection against political discrimination than the First Amendment.  Plaintiffs may have claims under the Constitution of Puerto Rico as well.  Cf. Jimenez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 249-250 (Torruella, J., dissenting) (noting that Supreme Court of Puerto Rico grants broad protection against political discrimination, perhaps broader than this circuit's interpretation of the First Amendment);  Raffucci-Alvarado, 816 F.2d at 822-23 (Torruella, J., dissenting) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, because of plaintiffs' tenured status under Puerto Rico law, their summary demotions could raise a claim under the Due Process Clause if their appointments were proper.

There is no evidence that he considered another plausible explanation--that the alteration was a correction of a mistake in the original--and Cappas was unaware of plaintiffs' statements to Salivia in the field interviews that they had always reported to the Regional Directors.

See id. at 1218 n. 8. Thus we need not consider whether that doctrine survives the Supreme Court's extension of First Amendment protections against patronage dismissals to \"promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions.\"  Rutan, 497 U.S. at 79, 110 S.Ct. at 2739.  \"It is an interesting question whether some vestige of [the 'unreasonably inferior' rule] survives Rutan, thereby providing a sort of ... intermediate First Amendment haven for employees wounded by slings and arrows less damaging than those [official actions] described by the Rutan court.\"  Nereida-Gonzalez, 990 F.2d at 705.   That question must be answered another day</p>\n        <p>The Rutan Court suggested in dicta that any adverse action against a public employee, no matter how minor, violates the First Amendment if it is in retaliation for an employee's exercise of First Amendment rights.  See Rutan, 497 U.S. at 76 n. 8, 110 S.Ct. at 2738 n. 8 (\"The First Amendment ... protects state employees ... from even an act of retaliation as trivial as failing to hold a birthday party ... when intended to punish [them] for exercising [their] free speech rights.\"  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  We do not regard such colorful rhetoric as necessarily foreclosing something like the \"unreasonably inferior\" rule for personnel actions short of demotions or transfers.  The Rutan Court was concerned with \"deprivations less harsh than dismissal that nevertheless press state employees and applicants to conform their beliefs and associations to some state-selected orthodoxy,\" id. at 75, 110 S.Ct. at 2737, a formulation similar to Agosto-de-Feliciano 's standard that \"the new work conditions would place substantial pressure on even one of thick skin to conform to the prevailing political view.\"  Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1218.   We leave the resolution of any conflict in the standard for such adverse personnel actions to some future case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Of course, political diversity among the Managerial Coordinators would not doom plaintiffs' claim.  Defendants cannot prevail simply by showing that a desire to reward their political supporters, rather than a desire to punish their political opponents, underlay their decision.  Either motive may produce unlawful results.  The First Amendment condemns \"the coercion of belief that necessarily flows from the knowledge that one must have a sponsor in the dominant party in order to retain one's job.\"  Branti v. Finkel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 516, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110232\"><a href=\"/opinion/110232/branti-v-finkel/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span> (1980).  That coercion is equally unlawful when it is directed toward apolitical career employees as when it is directed towards a party's political opponents.  See Bennis v.

That a party chooses to reward its followers with good jobs inevitably affects those who are not followers and who see their upward mobility in the agency thwarted in very concrete ways.  Here, plaintiffs say their duties were assumed by NPP members.  Rutan expressly discussed the effect on First Amendment rights of employees left in such dead-end jobs.

However, we can say that, after Rutan, a public employer may not assign tasks to supporters of the party in power because it believes, solely on the basis of their party affiliation, that such employees will more loyally implement its policies--notwithstanding language in Agosto-de-Feliciano that might be read to support such a decision.
