ANDREW BATTINELLI,\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n          [Lawrence P. Cohen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Walace,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     David Duncan, with whom Zalkind, Rodriguez, Lunt & Duncan\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Ellen R. Meltzer, Special Counsel, Criminal Division,\nFraud Section, U.S. Department of Justice, with whom Robert F.\nAdams and Christopher L. Varner, Trial Attorneys, Fraud\nSection, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, were\non brief, for appellees.\n\n\n                       January 23, 2001\n\f* Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n\n\n         WALLACE, Circuit Judge.      Battinelli appeals from his\n\nconviction on four counts of bank fraud in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1344, and one count of wire fraud in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1343.   The district court had jurisdiction pursuant\n\nto 18 U.S.C. § 3231.     We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291.   We affirm.\n\n         Battinelli first contends that the district court\n\nerred in admitting part of Kearns's testimony, a deceased\n\nwitness, before the Office of Thrift Supervision under Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 804(b)(3).     Battinelli argues that the\n\nadmission of Kearns’s testimony violated his right under the\n\nConfrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.     We need not get\n\nto that question if our review of the entire record persuades\n\nus that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.      See\n\nUnited States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918, 927 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n         We review Confrontation Clause violations under the\n\nharmless error standard set forth in Chapman v. California,\n\n386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967), which requires that we reverse the\n\nconviction unless the government can prove that the\n\nconstitutional error complained of was \"harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"     United States v. Mulinelli-Navas, 111 F.3d\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f983, 992 (1st Cir. 1997).    \"Under this standard, we may not\n\ndeclare a constitutional error harmless if there is a\n\n‘reasonable possibility’ that the error influenced the\n\nverdict.\"    Id. (internal citation omitted).\n\n            In this case, Kearns’s testimony was not central to\n\nthe government's case, which would not have been significantly\n\nless persuasive had the Kearns evidence been excluded.       The\n\ntestimony was brief (less than two pages long), and was\n\ncumulative of Pitcher's more detailed and thorough testimony.\n\nThere was an abundance of documentary evidence introduced at\n\ntrial from which the jury could have inferred that Battinelli\n\nknew of and participated in the fraud against the banks,\n\nincluding falsified loan applications and employment and\n\nincome verifications.    Two officials from the banks that\n\nissued the loans testified that if certain information\n\nrevealed to Battinelli prior to submitting the loan\n\napplications had been disclosed to the banks as required, the\n\nloans would have been denied.    The government introduced the\n\ntestimony of a United States Secret Service document examiner,\n\nwho testified there was a strong probability that the false\n\ninformation contained in two of the loan applications\n\nsubmitted by Battinelli on behalf of Kearns and Pitcher was\n\nwritten in Battinelli's handwriting.    Finally, the government\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fdid not rely heavily on Kearns's testimony in its closing\n\nargument; rather, it primarily emphasized the documentary\n\nevidence, Pitcher's testimony, and the testimony of the bank\n\nofficials.   We hold that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury\n\n\"would have reached the same verdict without having received\n\nthe [Kearns] evidence.\"   Brennan, 994 F.2d at 927 (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted); see United States v.\n\nSalimonu, 182 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir. 1999) (harmless error when\n\nit is beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of\n\ndid not contribute to the verdict obtained).\n\n\n\n         Next, Battinelli contends that the district court\n\nerred in admitting Pitcher’s grand jury testimony under\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B).   Battinelli argues that\n\nthe grand jury testimony, admitted to rehabilitate Pitcher, is\n\ninadmissible as a prior consistent statement because the\n\ntestimony did not predate Pitcher’s motive to fabricate.\n\nUnfortunately for Battinelli, he did not object to the\n\nadmission of the grand jury testimony on this basis before the\n\ndistrict court.   Accordingly, our review is for plain error.\n\nMulinelli-Navas, 111 F.3d at 989.   Because the portions of the\n\ngrand jury testimony that were admitted were cumulative of\n\nPitcher’s testimony on direct examination and, therefore,\n\n\n                              -4-\n\fadded nothing new to the government’s case, the district court\n\ndid not commit error “so shocking that [it] seriously\n\naffect[ed] the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the\n\nproceedings below.”    Id.     We hold that there was no plain\n\nerror.\n\n           Lastly, Battinelli contends that the district court\n\nerred in instructing the jury on the intent required for a\n\nbank fraud conviction.       Because he failed to raise this\n\nobjection before the district court, we review for plain\n\nerror.    United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (en banc).    Relying on the panel decision in United\n\nStates v. Kenrick, No. 98-1282 (1st Cir. Feb. 22, 2000)\n\n(withdrawn), Battinelli argues that intent to defraud\n\nnecessarily includes an “intent to harm” the bank.       However,\n\nafter rehearing Kenrick en banc, we held that “the intent\n\nelement of bank fraud . . . is an intent to deceive the bank\n\nin order to obtain from it money or other property.       ‘Intent\n\nto harm’ is not required.”       Kenrick, 221 F.3d at 29 (emphasis\n\nadded).    The instructions given in this case are identical to\n\nthe instructions at issue in Kenrick.       Therefore, as we held\n\nen banc in Kenrick, there was no plain error in the district\n\ncourt’s jury instructions.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f-6-\n\f",
