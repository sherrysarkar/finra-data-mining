Luis A. Castro-Morales appeals his\n\nconviction for conspiring to defraud the United States\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), for aiding and abetting\n\nin the embezzlement or conversion of funds from the VA and for\n\naiding and abetting in the embezzlement or conversion of funds\n\nwhich came into his control as an employee of the VA.     18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2, 641, 654 (1994 & Supp. II 1996).     The sole claim\n\npresented by Castro-Morales on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt judge erred in not giving a multiple conspiracy\n\ninstruction, rather than a single conspiracy instruction, to\n\nthe jury.\n\n            Castro-Morales waived this argument by not proposing\n\nsuch an instruction to the trial judge, joining a request to\n\ndo so, or objecting to the trial court's refusal to give such\n\nan instruction.    Our decision is mandated by our prior holding\n\nin an appeal brought by Castro-Morales's two co-defendants.\n\nUnited States v. Leon-Delfis, 203 F.3d 103, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   In that case, we held that Castro-Morales's co-\n\ndefendant, Santiago-Sanchez, had waived his right to object to\n\n                                 -2-\n\fthe failure to give a multiple conspiracy instruction where a\n\nthird co-defendant, Leon-Delfis, had asked for the instruction\n\nand objected to the failure to give the instruction, but\n\nSantiago-Sanchez had not joined the instruction and there was\n\nno indication that the district court had stated that an\n\nobjection from one defendant would be considered an objection\n\nfor all defendants.    Castro-Morales is in the same situation\n\nas Santiago-Sanchez.   It is worth adding that the claim of\n\nerror as to the need for multiple conspiracy instruction is\n\nnot a strong one and there was certainly no plain error in the\n\ncourt's failure to give the instruction.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
