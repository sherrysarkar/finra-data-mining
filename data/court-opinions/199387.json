Stevens, was on brief, for appellant.\n      Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Margaret\nE. Curran, United States Attorney, and James H. Leavey, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           April 26, 2001\n\f-2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge. Appellant George Sacko pled guilty\n\nin 1997 to possession of firearms and silencer by a convicted felon, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d). His sentence\n\nwas enhanced pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e), based in part on a prior conviction for statutory\n\nrape.1 Sacko appealed, and this Court remanded so that the district\n\ncourt \"could take evidence on the issue whether the crime of sexual\n\npenetration of a fourteen-year-old by someone over the age of eighteen\n\ninvolves conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury\n\nto the former.\" United States v. Sacko, 178 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n[hereinafter Sacko I ]. The district court, after taking such evidence,\n\nconcluded that \"Sacko's sexual penetration of a 14-year-old girl in\n\nviolation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-6 was a 'violent felony' under ACCA\n\nand that Sacko properly was sentenced as an 'armed career criminal.'\"\n\nSacko II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 91.       This renewed appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n1  Sacko had been previously convicted in Rhode Island of \"carnal\nknowledge of a girl under the age of consent.\" Both parties agreed\nthat the offense in question was now covered by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-\n6, which criminalizes \"third degree sexual assault.\" United States v.\nSacko, 103 F. Supp. 2d 85, 87 n.1 (D.R.I. 2000) [hereinafter Sacko II].\nThe statute in question provides that \"[a] 'person' is guilty of third\ndegree sexual assault if he or she is over the age of eighteen years\nand is engaged in sexual penetration with another person over the age\nof fourteen years and under the age of consent, sixteen years.\" Id. at\n87 (citing § 11-37-6).\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          In Sacko I , we began by summarizing the \"formal categorical\n\napproach\"2 used to determine whether predicate offenses qualify as\n\n\"violent felonies\" under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).3 178 F.3d at 2-4.\n\nWe noted that when the relevant criminal statute encompasses both\n\nviolent felonies and non-violent felonies, a sentencing court may go\n\nbeyond the statutory language and evaluate charging documents or jury\n\ninstructions. Id. at 3. Because statutory rape is one such offense,\n\nwe explained that it was permissible for the district court to examine\n\nthe indictment to determine the ages of the defendant and the victim.\n\nId. at 4-5. We held that the district court had erred, however, in\n\naddressing the facts and circumstances of the predicate offense, as\n\ngleaned from the pre-sentence report.       Id. at 4.\n\n          We then evaluated whether, based on the statutory language\n\nof the predicate offense and the limited information of the indictment,\n\nwe could conclude that Sacko's conviction was for a \"violent felony.\"\n\n\n2 The \"formal categorical approach\" allows a sentencing court to\nexamine only the statute of conviction, rather than the underlying\nfacts and circumstances of the predicate offense. Sacko I, 178 F.3d at\n3 (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 597-602 (1990)).\n3  Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines a \"violent felony\" as \"any crime\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that (i)\nhas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\nforce against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or\nextortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\nWe are only concerned here with the scope of the \"otherwise\" clause in\n§ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Sacko I, 178 F.3d at 4.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fThis Court has held that the conviction of a thirty-six-year-old man\n\nfor statutory rape of a girl under the age of fourteen did so qualify,\n\nbased on the age of the girl, the large chronological gap between the\n\nvictim and the defendant, and medical literature evaluating the\n\nphysical injuries that may result from sexual intercourse under such\n\ncircumstances. United States v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, 884 (1st Cir.\n\n1997). The Seventh Circuit has held that sexual intercourse between a\n\nseventeen-year-old boy and thirteen-year-old girl is a crime of\n\nviolence. See United States v. Shannon, 110 F.3d 382, 387-88 (7th Cir.\n\n1998) (en banc). However, the Seventh Circuit has indicated that some\n\nstatutory rapes are not crimes of violence. United States v. Thomas,\n\n159 F.3d 296, 299 (7th Cir. 1998) (not extending Shannon to a statute\n\nprohibiting sex with a girl under the age of seventeen where the age of\n\nthe victim was not specified in the charging document).\n\n          Relying on Meader, Shannon, and Thomas, we were \"unprepared\n\nto say a priori that sex is not physically dangerous for a 14-year-old\n\ngirl.\" Sacko I , 178 F.3d at 6. But we also lacked any legal basis for\n\nthe opposite conclusion, as no studies or medical journals had been\n\nentered into the record. Id. Thus we remanded, noting that, upon\n\nremand, the district court could \"find the risks of physical injury\n\nduring penetration to be sufficient to meet the requisite 'serious\n\npotential risk of physical injury.'\" Id. (quoting § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)).\n\nIf such risks proved insufficient, we suggested that the district court\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fshould determine, in the first instance, whether the risk of physical\n\ninjury referred to in the statute must be confined to the act of\n\nintercourse or could include possible consequences of that act, such as\n\npregnancy or disease.     Id.; compare Shannon, 110 F.3d at 387-88\n\n(including such secondary consequences in the injury calculus), with\n\nid. at 390 (Manion, J., concurring) (confining risk of physical injury\n\nto that directly accruing from the act of intercourse).\n\n          On remand, the district court conducted an evidentiary\n\nhearing. It found that until an adolescent girl has reached Tanner\n\nStage 4,4 she \"may or may not experience physical injury from the act\n\nof intercourse.\" Sacko II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 88. It also found that\n\n12-33% of fourteen-year-old girls had not reached Tanner Stage 4. Id.\n\nBased on these two facts, the district court concluded that, \"given the\n\nmagnitude of immediate tissue injury and the likelihood that it will\n\noccur . . . the unadorned crime of third degree sexual assault\n\ninvolving penetration of a 14 year-old-girl by a man over the age of 18\n\n'presents a serious risk of physical injury' to the girl.\" Id. at 91.\n\n          The district court also held that a statutory rapist is\n\naccountable under § 924(e)(2)(B) for \"the consequences of future\n\ndiseases attributable to penetration.\" Id. (citing United States v.\n\n4 \"[Under the] Tanner system for measuring physical development, a\nfemale passes through five steps in progressing from a pre-pubertal\nchild to a fully developed adult woman. The stages are marked by\nchanges in breast and genital development.\" Sacko II, 103 F. Supp. 2d\nat 88.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fMarler, 756 F.2d 206, 216 (1st Cir. 1985), for the \"fundamental\n\nprinciple of criminal law\" that \"a person is held responsible for all\n\nconsequences proximately caused by his criminal conduct\"). Given that\n\nthe court had found that sexually active adolescent girls face an\n\nincreased risk (compared to mature women) of contracting chlamydia,\n\ngenital tract infections, AIDS, and cervical cancer, id. at 88-89, the\n\ncourt concluded that \"the consequences [of future disease attributable\n\nto statutory rape] are so severe that the risk of their occurrence\n\npresents an additional 'serious potential risk of physical injury,'\"\n\nid. at 91.5\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          For the most part, Sacko makes no challenge to the factual\n\nfindings of the district court, which we review for clear error, or to\n\nthe district court's legal conclusions, which we review de novo. New\n\nEngland Cleaning Servs., Inc. v. Services Employees Int'l Union, Local\n\n254, AFL-CIO, 199 F.3d 537, 539 (1st Cir. 1999). It is well-settled\n\nthat arguments not raised in an appellant's initial brief are waived.\n\nPuerto Rico Tel. Co. v. Telecomm. Regulatory Bd. of P.R., 189 F.3d 1,\n\n17 n.14 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n5 Our decision does not require us to determine whether it the district\ncourt was correct in considering these secondary consequences of\nstatutory rape in its calculus of the potential risk of physical\ninjury.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Appellant does suggest two ways in which the district court\n\nerred. First, he notes that Rhode Island does not include third degree\n\nsexual assault in its list of violent crimes. R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-\n\n2(2).   Although he had every incentive to do so, Sacko failed to\n\npresent this argument in his first appeal. He cannot raise it here for\n\nthe first time.\n\n          A defendant should not be held to have waived an\n          issue if he did not have a reason to raise it at\n          his original sentencing; but neither should a\n          defendant be able to raise an issue for the first\n          time upon resentencing if he did have reason but\n          failed nonetheless to raise it in the earlier\n          proceeding. Under our approach a defendant may\n          argue at resentencing that the court of appeals'\n          decision has breathed life into a previously\n          dormant issue, but he may not revive in the\n          second round an issue he allowed to die in the\n          first.\n\nUnited States v. Tichiarelli, 171 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 1999). Sacko\n\nhas not suggested that our remand \"breathed life\" into the relevance of\n\nRhode Island's categorization of third degree sexual assault; it has\n\ntherefore been waived in this second appeal.\n\n          At any rate, this Court has never held that the analysis of\n\nwhat constitutes a \"violent felony\" for purposes of the ACCA turns on\n\nstate law. Cf. United States v. DiPina, 230 F.3d 477, 484 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (delinquency may be considered conviction under federal law, even\n\nthough it is not a conviction under state law); United States v.\n\nCuevas, 75 F.3d 778, 780 ( nolo contendere plea considered conviction\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\funder federal law, even though it is not one under state law).6 Because\n\na state's classification of a crime generally reflects different policy\n\nconsiderations than the federal classification, it is simply not\n\nrelevant to the determination of whether a crime is a \"violent felony,\"\n\nwhich, under federal law, is based on an assessment of the risk of\n\nphysical injury associated with the typical conduct underlying that\n\ncrime.\n\n          Second, appellant argues that the district court failed to\n\ndetermine what percentage of fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls would\n\nnot face an enhanced risk of serious physical injury from intercourse\n\nwith a person over the age of eighteen.       We first note that for\n\npurposes of this case, only the percentage of fourteen-year-old girls\n\nwho would face such a risk is relevant. See Sacko I, 178 F.3d at 4-6\n\n(determining age of victim from the indictment, and explaining the\n\nrelevance of that modified age for the categorical test). The district\n\ncourt determined that 12-33% of fourteen-year-old girls had not reached\n\nTanner Stage 4, and that girls who had not reached Stage 4 faced either\n\na virtual certainty of physical damage or injury from intercourse (if\n\nat Stage 1 or 2), or at least a real possibility of injury (if at Stage\n\n\n\n\n6 In United States v. Sherwood, 156 F.3d 219, 222 n.3 (1st Cir. 1998),\nour discussion of whether a particular felony was a \"crime of violence\"\nnoted that the state had designated it as such. However, our analysis\nin Sherwood was wholly predicated on federal law, rather than the state\nclassification. Id. at 221-22.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f3). Sacko II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 88. In our view, these findings,\n\nwhich are supported by the evidence, meet the required legal standard.\n\n          In a personal letter to this Court, which we have chosen to\n\ntreat as a supplemental brief, appellant makes two additional claims.\n\nFirst, he argues that the district court's refusal to allow his expert\n\nto testify was prejudicial. This claim is without merit. Sacko's\n\ncounsel presented a written statement from the expert, which the\n\nGovernment accepted without objection or a request for cross-\n\nexamination. Under such circumstances, the decision not to solicit in-\n\ncourt testimony from the expert was well within the discretion of the\n\ndistrict court. United States v. Rodríguez, 162 F.3d 135, 149-50 (1st\n\nCir. 1998). Second, appellant argues that the court's refusal to allow\n\nhim to appear pro se was prejudicial. It is not clear that Sacko's\n\nrequest to appear pro se was actually denied; the district court\n\noffered him \"a chance to speak\" on the specific issue before the court\n\n(whether statutory rape is a crime of violence), but indicated that his\n\nattorney would also be asked to respond because Sacko appeared\n\nincapable of addressing the issue. Moreover, Sacko's statements at the\n\nhearing devolved into groundless attacks on his attorney. The district\n\ncourt exercised appropriate discretion on the matter. United States v.\n\nProctor, 166 F.3d 396, 401-02 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          For the reasons herein, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

His sentence  was enhanced pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18  U.S.C. &#167;924(e), based in part on a prior conviction for statutory  rape.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Sacko appealed, and this Court remanded so that the district  court \"could take evidence on the issue whether the crime of sexual  penetration of a fourteen-year-old by someone over the age of eighteen  involves conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury  to the former.\"  United States v.

The district court, after taking such evidence,  concluded that \"Sacko's sexual penetration of a 14-year-old girl in  violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;11-37-6 was a 'violent felony' under ACCA  and that Sacko properly was sentenced as an 'armed career criminal.'\" Sacko II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 91.  This renewed appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sacko I, we began by summarizing the \"formal categorical  approach\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> used to determine whether predicate offenses qualify as  \"violent felonies\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167;924(e)(2)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  178 F.3d at 2-4. We noted that when the relevant criminal statute encompasses both  violent felonies and non-violent felonies, a sentencing court may go  beyond the statutory language and evaluate charging documents or jury  instructions.  Id. at 3.  Because statutory rape is one such offense,  we explained that it was permissible for the district court to examine  the indictment to determine the ages of the defendant and the victim. Id. at 4-5.  We held that the district court had erred, however, in  addressing the facts and circumstances of the predicate offense, as  gleaned from the pre-sentence report.  Id. at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then evaluated whether, based on the statutory language  of the predicate offense and the limited information of the indictment,  we could conclude that Sacko's conviction was for a \"violent felony.\" This Court has held that the conviction of a thirty-six-year-old man  for statutory rape of a girl under the age of fourteen did so qualify,  based on the age of the girl, the large chronological gap between the  victim and the defendant, and medical literature evaluating the  physical injuries that may result from sexual intercourse under such  circumstances.  United States v. Meader, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197459\"><a href=\"/opinion/197459/united-states-v-meader/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span>, 884 (1st Cir.  1997).  The Seventh Circuit has held that sexual intercourse between a  seventeen-year-old boy and thirteen-year-old girl is a crime of  violence.  See United States v. Shannon, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></span>, 387-88 (7th Cir.  1998) (en banc).  However, the Seventh Circuit has indicated that some  statutory rapes are not crimes of violence. United States v. Thomas,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758756\"><a href=\"/opinion/758756/united-states-v-derrick-thomas-and-jason-a-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 299 (7th Cir. 1998) (not extending Shannon to a statute  prohibiting sex with a girl under the age of seventeen where the age of  the victim was not specified in the charging document).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on Meader, Shannon, and Thomas, we were \"unprepared  to say a priori that sex is not physically dangerous for a 14-year-old  girl.\"  Sacko I, 178 F.3d at 6.  But we also lacked any legal basis for  the opposite conclusion, as no studies or medical journals had been  entered into the record.  Id.  Thus we remanded, noting that, upon  remand, the district court could \"find the risks of physical injury  during penetration to be sufficient to meet the requisite 'serious  potential risk of physical injury.'\" Id. (quoting &#167;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)). If such risks proved insufficient, we suggested that the district court  should determine, in the first instance, whether the risk of physical  injury referred to in the statute must be confined to the act of  intercourse or could include possible consequences of that act, such as  pregnancy or disease.  Id.; compare Shannon, 110 F.3d at 387-88  (including such secondary consequences in the injury calculus), with id. at 390 (Manion, J., concurring) (confining risk of physical injury  to that directly accruing from the act of intercourse).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court conducted an evidentiary  hearing.  It found that until an adolescent girl has reached Tanner  Stage 4,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> she \"may or may not experience physical injury from the act  of intercourse.\"  Sacko II, 103 F. Supp. 2d at 88.  It also found that  12-33% of fourteen-year-old girls had not reached Tanner Stage 4.  Id. Based on these two facts, the district court concluded that, \"given the  magnitude of immediate tissue injury and the likelihood that it will  occur ... the unadorned crime of third degree sexual assault  involving penetration of a 14 year-old-girl by a man over the age of 18  'presents a serious risk of physical injury' to the girl.\"  Id. at 91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also held that a statutory rapist is  accountable under &#167;924(e)(2)(B) for \"the consequences of future  diseases attributable to penetration.\"  Id.

Given that  the court had found that sexually active adolescent girls face an  increased risk (compared to mature women) of contracting chlamydia,  genital tract infections, AIDS, and cervical cancer, id. at 88-89, the  court concluded that \"the consequences [of future disease attributable  to statutory rape] are so severe that the risk of their occurrence  presents an additional 'serious potential risk of physical injury,'\" id. at 91.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the most part, Sacko makes no challenge to the factual  findings of the district court, which we review for clear error, or to  the district court's legal conclusions, which we review de novo.
