Gen.\r\n\nL.  ch. 93A,   11.  For the  reasons stated herein, we affirm the\r\n\ndecision of the district court.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The   parties  stipulated   to  the   following  facts:\r\n\nDefendant  Sun Oil Company, Inc.  (R &amp; M)  (\"Sun\") owned property\r\n\nlocated  at  225  Brockton Ave.,  Abington,  Massachusetts,  (the\r\n\n\"property\") from 1971  to 1979.   In 1972, Sun  built a  gasoline\r\n\nstation  with  underground  storage  tanks on  the  property  and\r\n\noperated a  retail  gasoline station  thereafter  until  November\r\n\n1977.  On or about December 19, 1974, a leaking underground  pipe\r\n\nleading from the  underground storage tanks to the pumps released\r\n\napproximately 2,000 gallons of  gasoline.  Sun's regional manager\r\n\nof  operations,  Robert  Laubinger   (\"Laubinger\"),  was  on  the\r\n\nproperty  after the leak was  discovered.  On  November 21, 1979,\r\n\nthe plaintiffs, Roy Damon  (\"Damon\") and Eleanor Damon (together,\r\n\nthe  \"Damons\"), purchased the property from Sun for $90,000.  The\r\n\nplaintiffs had  a right to examine  the property by terms  of the\r\n\nAgreement of Sale.   The Damons  owned the property from  1979 to\r\n\nMarch  25,  1992 and  operated a  retail  service station  at the\r\n\nproperty from June 12, 1980 to January 31, 1991.\r\n\n          On January 31, 1991, the plaintiffs leased the property\r\n\nto K. Rooney, Inc. (\"Rooney\").  Since then, Rooney has operated a\r\n\nretail service station on the property.  In November 1991, Rooney\r\n\nbegan  upgrading the station by installing new pumps and Stage II\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof a vapor recovery  system.  As digging commenced,  the Abington\r\n\nFire Department observed petroleum product pooling in the surface\r\n\nexcavations,  shut  down   the  construction  and  notified   the\r\n\nMassachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\").  On\r\n\nDecember 19, 1991, the DEP sent a Notice of Responsibility to the\r\n\nplaintiffs and  Rooney, requiring  that a  Phase  I Limited  Site\r\n\nInvestigation  Report  and   Preliminary  Assessment  Report   be\r\n\ncompleted.  A company hired by Rooney performed the investigation\r\n\nand issued a report  dated October 1992.  As part  of the Phase I\r\n\ninvestigation,  monitoring  wells were  installed and  samples of\r\n\ngroundwater  were taken  and  analyzed.    As  a  result  of  the\r\n\ndiscovery  of the  pollution,  Rooney refused  to  pay rent  from\r\n\nNovember  1991  to March  1992.    The  lease  agreement  between\r\n\nplaintiffs  and Rooney granted  Rooney an option  to purchase the\r\n\nproperty for $600,000.  Rooney did not exercise its lease option.\r\n\nOn  March 25, 1992, Rooney purchased the property from the Damons\r\n\nby assuming  a first mortgage  in the  amount of  $275,000 and  a\r\n\nsecond  mortgage in  the amount of  $50,000.  Rooney  also made a\r\n\ncash payment of $20,000 to plaintiffs.\r\n\n          The  district  court's  additional  findings   of  fact\r\n\nincluded the following.  A rupture  of an elbow joint in the pipe\r\n\nwhich connects the  tanks and  the pumps caused  the 1974  spill,\r\n\nwhich closed the station for approximately six weeks.  In June or\r\n\nJuly 1979, Damon attempted  to reach Richard Bunzell (\"Bunzell\"),\r\n\nwhose name  was  given on  the \"For  Sale\" sign  at the  station.\r\n\nAfter  some  unsuccessful  attempts   to  reach  Bunzell,  a  Sun\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ntelephone operator  referred Damon  to Laubinger,  Sun's regional\r\n\nmanager  for service  station maintenance.   The  questions Damon\r\n\nasked Laubinger about the property included an inquiry concerning\r\n\nthe  age of  the building,  and whether  Sun had  experienced any\r\n\nproblems  with the  station,  particularly with  the  underground\r\n\ntanks.  Laubinger knew of the  1974 spill, but did not reveal it.\r\n\nRather,  he  answered that  it was  a  \"good station\"  which just\r\n\nneeded to be run by a good operator to  be successful.  After his\r\n\nphone conversation  with Laubinger, Damon contacted  Bunzell and,\r\n\nafter some negotiation, accepted  his offer of $90,000.   In late\r\n\nAugust 1979, Damon  and Bunzell met at  the property to view  the\r\n\nproperty.    Damon asked  about a  depression  he noticed  in the\r\n\nblacktop  near the pumps and  Bunzell explained it  was caused by\r\n\nthe installation of the  first stage of a vapor  recovery system.\r\n\nIn  response to  Damon's  question of  whether  Sun had  had  any\r\n\nproblems with the underground storage tanks, Bunzell stated, \"No,\r\n\nwe've had no problems with it.  It's all good.\"\r\n\n          In 1980  Damon had  the three 6,000  gallon underground\r\n\ngasoline  tanks tested for tightness by Getty Oil, Co., his first\r\n\ngasoline supplier: they tested tight, as they did in May 1984 and\r\n\nagain in January 1991.  In 1992, no holes were observed in any of\r\n\nthe underground gasoline tanks  or oil tanks.   The  southern end\r\n\nof  the pit  dug  around the  three  gasoline tanks  yielded  the\r\n\nhighest level  of contamination; 101 cubic  yards of contaminated\r\n\nsoil were  eventually removed  for off-site treatment.   Finally,\r\n\nsamples  of  contaminated water  collected  and  examined by  the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncompany  conducting  the 1992  Phase  I study  indicate  that the\r\n\ncontamination  contained  the  gasoline  additive  MTBE (\"MTBE\"),\r\n\nwhich was not added to Sunoco gasoline until 1984.\r\n\n          The  Damons brought suit  against Sun,  alleging common\r\n\nlaw  misrepresentation and violation of  chapter 93A,    11.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court,  after a  four day  bench  trial, found  for the\r\n\nDamons on both the misrepresentation and  the chapter 93A counts,\r\n\nawarding them $245,000 plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\nIn  its appeal,  Sun  now challenges  the  three rulings  of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  --  its denial  of  Sun's  motion  for entry  of\r\n\njudgment at the close  of plaintiffs' case in chief, see  Fed. R.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCiv.

See Bond\r                                                                           \r\n\nLeather Co.  v. Q.T. Shoe Mfg.

The elements of misrepresentation  are well established:\r\n\nin order to recover, plaintiff\r\n\n            must allege and prove that  the defendant\r\n            made a false representation of a material\r\n            fact  with knowledge  of its  falsity for\r\n            the purpose of inducing the  plaintiff to\r\n            act  thereon,  and  that   the  plaintiff\r\n            relied  upon  the representation  as true\r\n            and acted upon it to his [or her] damage.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nBarret  Assocs., Inc.  v.

Here, the\r               \r\n\nalleged false  representations are  the statements made  by Sun's\r\n\nrepresentatives that  it was a  \"good\" station, upon  which Damon\r\n\nrelied in his purchasing decision.  The alleged harm suffered was\r\n\nthat the Damons bought a gas station in 1979 that would have been\r\n\nworth more in 1992 if what the defendant's representatives stated\r\n\nhad in  fact  been  true.    The damages  were  measured  by  the\r\n\ndifference  between  the value  of the  property  if it  had been\r\n\nuncontaminated,  as the  defendant  represented,  and the  actual\r\n\nvalue of the property as contaminated.\r\n\n          Appellant  questions  the  district   court's  findings\r\n\nrelated to  two of these elements:   causation and  damages.  The\r\n\ncausation  element  requires  that  the  misrepresentation  be  a\r\n\nsubstantial  factor  in the  plaintiff's  actions,  such that  it\r\n\n\"tend[s]  along with  other  factors to  produce the  plaintiff's\r\n\n[harm].\"  O'Connor v.

Sun  argues  on  appeal that  the\r\n\nevidence  that the district court  relied on in  finding that Sun\r\n\nmore  probably   than  not  was   a  substantial  cause   of  the\r\n\ncontamination found in 1991  is insufficient as a matter  of law,\r\n\nfor  three reasons.  Upon review of  the record, however, we find\r\n\nthat the Damons met their burden of proof, such that the district\r\n\ncourt did not clearly  err in finding that the  causation element\r\n\nof misrepresentation has been met.  We address, and dismiss, each\r\n\nof Sun's arguments in turn.  \r\n\n          First, Sun notes that  the district court conceded that\r\n\n\"it is unclear how much of the 2,000 gallons [of  the 1974 spill]\r\n\nwas recovered,\" (District Court  Findings of Fact and Conclusions\r\n\nof Law, at 9), and concludes  from that statement that there  was\r\n\nno evidence of what (if any) contamination found in 1991 actually\r\n\ndated to  1974.  The fact that there was a release, without more,\r\n\nSun argues, is insufficient to impose liability.  \r\n\n          There is more, however:   the district court  found not\r\n\nonly that there was a release, but also that the clean-up efforts\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nat the time of the release were limited, at best.\r\n\n            Defendant's remedial efforts in 1974 were\r\n            not  conducted for the purpose of ridding\r\n            the  property  of contamination;  rather,\r\n            the goal was to make the [property] safe.\r\n            To  this end, the  focus was  on stopping\r\n            the flow of gasoline onto the neighboring\r\n            property --  no effort was  made to clean\r\n            or  remove  contaminated   soil  on   the\r\n            [property]  itself.    From the  Abington\r\n            Fire Department records it is unclear how\r\n            much  of the 2,000 gallons was recovered.\r\n            Presumably, the  company hired by  Sun to\r\n            pump  the trenches was  pumping a mixture\r\n            of gas  and water,  but no one  knows the\r\n            relative proportions or the  total amount\r\n            of mixture pumped.\r\n\n(District Court Findings of  Fact and Conclusions of Law,  at 9).\r\n\nTo  suggest  that  the district  court's  statement  that \"it  is\r\n\nunclear how  much of the 2,000 gallons was recovered\" can be read\r\n\nto imply that  it was all recovered is to  misread the context of\r\n\nthe statement.\r\n\n          Additional evidence the lower court found determinative\r\n\nin its finding of  causation included the sheer size of  the 1974\r\n\nspill (2,000 gallons); the  fact that Robert Cataldo (\"Cataldo\"),\r\n\nplaintiffs' expert, testified that the underground pipe which ran\r\n\nfrom  the pumps to  the tanks created  a channel  along which the\r\n\ngasoline  could flow from the rupture and settle under the tanks;\r\n\nand  that no gasoline spills  larger than 10  gallons occurred at\r\n\nthe property between 1974 and 1992, during which time the Damons'\r\n\ntanks periodically  tested tight.  Finally, the  court also noted\r\n\nthat \"Cataldo testified, albeit hesitatingly, that in his opinion\r\n\nthe  1974 spill  was  a substantial  factor  contributing to  the\r\n\ncontamination found at  the [property] in 1992.\"  (District Court\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nFindings  of Fact and Conclusions of Law,  at 10).   Clearly, the\r\n\nevidence the district  court relied on in  finding causation goes\r\n\nbeyond the  simple fact that  there was a  release in 1974.   Sun\r\n\ndoes not challenge  any of these  specific findings; indeed,  our\r\n\nreview of the record finds support for each.  \r\n\n          In  making its  argument,  Sun relies  on Providence  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nWorcester R.R. Co. v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 622 N.E.2d 262 (Mass.\r                                                    \r\n\n1993).  In  that case,  contamination was discovered  in 1988  on\r\n\nproperty  owned by  the plaintiff  railroad.   The railroad  sued\r\n\ndefendant  Chevron,  claiming  that  the 1988  contamination  was\r\n\ncaused  by  a 1972  leak of  12,000 gallons  of  fuel oil  from a\r\n\nstorage  facility defendant had maintained on  the property.  The\r\n\ncourt found no causal link between the spills, where there was no\r\n\nevidence  that the soil  was significantly saturated  by the 1972\r\n\nsurface  spill, which  had been  pumped out  the same  day, where\r\n\nsixteen  years had passed, and where the question whether the oil\r\n\nwould remain  in some form  was left  unanswered in  the face  of\r\n\nconflicting  evidence.   The  court specifically  noted that  the\r\n\nrailroad's  expert was not asked  to give an  opinion whether the\r\n\n1988 contamination was caused at least in part by the 1972 spill.\r\n\nId. at 264.  \r             \r\n\n          Sun draws  on Providence  &amp; Worcester  as demonstrating\r                                                         \r\n\nthat  evidence  of  the   1974  spill,  in  and  of   itself,  is\r\n\ninsufficient to impose liability.  That may be true, as far as it\r\n\ngoes.   The  evidence in  the present  case, however,  shows much\r\n\nmore.   As in Providence  &amp; Worcester, many  years passed between\r                                               \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  spills in the present case.   However,  the evidence is that\r\n\nthe 1974 spill was not cleaned up immediately, as in Providence &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nWorcester.    Rather,  the  fire department  logs  indicate  that\r                   \r\n\npumping  did not start until two days after discovery of the leak\r\n\non December  19, 1974:  as late as  February 4, 1975, more than a\r\n\nmonth after  the leak  was first  reported,  gasoline fumes  were\r\n\nstill being detected  in the  basement of  an adjacent  property.\r\n\nThus,  there  was  evidence  in  this  case  that  the  soil  was\r\n\ncontaminated by the 1974 spill.  What is more, plaintiffs' expert\r\n\nhere  did  state that  the 1974  spill  was a  substantial factor\r\n\ncontributing to the 1991 contamination, as we discuss below.\r\n\n          Sun's second attack on  the sufficiency of the evidence\r\n\nfocuses on  the soil.  In  the face of the  uncontested fact that\r\n\nthe 1974  spillage  was subsurface,  due to  a leaky  underground\r\n\npump, Sun contends that  no evidence was presented that  the soil\r\n\nwas contaminated  by Sun, or  that Sun's  failure to clean  up or\r\n\nremove soil was wrongful.  In support of its  position, Sun lists\r\n\nfour  pieces of  evidence regarding  soil testing.   Firstly,  it\r\n\nnotes  that  soil  samples  taken  in  1992  by  consultants were\r\n\nspoiled,  and never analyzed.   While it is  unfortunate that the\r\n\nsamples were not  analyzed, that fact simply shows we do not have\r\n\nall possible information:  it does not shed any light, one way or\r\n\nthe  other, on whether  the 1974 spillage  contaminated the soil.\r\n\nSecondly, Sun points out  that in 1979, Getty Oil  commissioned a\r\n\ncompany to dig around the fill area above  the storage tanks, and\r\n\nthat  the company never said anything to Damon about contaminated\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nsoil, but rather stated  that the area  was clean.  However,  Sun\r\n\npoints  to  no  evidence that  the  company  was asked  to  do an\r\n\nexamination  of the soil for  contamination:  it  was testing the\r\n\ntanks for  tightness.   Thus, the  third  fact Sun  looks to  for\r\n\nsupport, that Cataldo's environmental company found contamination\r\n\nin 1992 around  the same fill pipes that Getty  Oil, in 1980, had\r\n\ntold Damon  were clean, is not  as conclusive as  Sun would like.\r\n\nSet against  the Getty  results is Cataldo's  testimony that  the\r\n\n1974 release was a contributing factor in the 1991 contamination.\r\n\nFinally, Sun notes that Cataldo testified that there was not much\r\n\nthickness of soil, such that \"flushing\" of the soil by rising and\r\n\nfalling subsurface  groundwater elevations would  tend to  reduce\r\n\nany residual contamination.  However, Cataldo also testified that\r\n\nthe on-site testing he conducted  in four monitoring wells  found\r\n\nvolatile  organic compounds  (\"VOCs\") which  are constituents  of\r\n\ngasoline  in the groundwater.  The constituents found in 1991, he\r\n\nstated, were  similar to those of the 1974 release.  As he stated\r\n\nin his testimony:\r\n\n               Q.  .   .  .  .  And   based  on  your\r\n            examination of the underground conditions\r\n            at that [property] and the geology of the\r\n            [property],    and    based   upon    the\r\n            information of this 2,000 gallon spill in\r\n            1974,  would you expect  to find  VOCs in\r\n            the  areas where  you  did  find them  in\r\n            1992?\r\n               A.  Yes, I would.\r\n               Q.  Is the presence of VOCs consistent\r\n            with the  topography and geology  of that\r\n            [property] and a spill in 1974?\r\n               A.  Yes, it is.\r\n\n(Day 2, page 76).  On this  record, we find that the evidence was\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nsufficient to find causation.   The evidence to which  Sun points\r\n\ndoes not convince us otherwise, let alone that the district court\r\n\nclearly erred in making its finding.  \r\n\n          Sun's  third and  final argument  that the  evidence is\r\n\ninsufficient to  find causation focuses  on Cataldo's  testimony.\r\n\nIt is  fundamental that \"[e]xpert testimony must be predicated on\r\n\nfacts  legally  sufficient to  provide a  basis for  the expert's\r\n\nopinion.  \"  In  re Salvatore,  46 B.R. 247,  253 (D.R.I.  1984).\r                                       \r\n\nThus, \"[a]n expert  should not  be permitted to  give an  opinion\r\n\nthat is  based on conjecture or speculation  from an insufficient\r\n\nevidentiary foundation.\"   Van  Brode Group,  Inc. v.  Bowditch &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nDewey,  633 N.E.2d  424, 430  (Mass. App.  Ct. 1994).   Cataldo's\r               \r\n\ntestimony, Sun contends,  did not meet  this criteria.   Although\r\n\nCataldo testified that the 1974 spill was  a \"substantial factor\"\r\n\nin the 1991 contamination,  Sun argues that its cross-examination\r\n\nof  Cataldo  revealed  that he  had  no  factual  basis for  that\r\n\nconclusion:  indeed, he testified at one point that  he could not\r\n\nsay that the 1974 spill was \"more probably than not\" the cause of\r\n\nthe 1991 contamination.  \r\n\n          Sun points to a series  of perceived flaws in Cataldo's\r\n\ntestimony.   First, Cataldo attested that  although methods exist\r\n\nwhich would  quantify the  amount of  contaminants found in  1992\r\n\nwhich  were  representative  of   the  1974  release,  none  were\r\n\nperformed here.  He agreed that he did not know how much gas  was\r\n\nleft on the property after the 1974 release, and that none of the\r\n\nwork  performed by his  firm had to  do with aging  or dating the\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\npetroleum product found on  the property.   Nor did they test  to\r\n\ndetermine what percentage of  the gas found in 1991 was 1974 gas.\r\n\nAfter admitting that the ratios of the BTEX chemical constituents\r\n\nwere indicative of a more recent -- post-1980 -- release, Cataldo\r\n\ntestified that he could not  say \"one way or the other\"  that the\r\n\ngasoline constituents encountered in 1992 were more probably than\r\n\nnot  the result  of the 1974  release.  Thus,  Sun maintains, the\r\n\nbest Cataldo could testify to at  trial was that the property was\r\n\ninsufficiently investigated to allow him  to come to any ultimate\r\n\nconclusions concerning the  contaminate sources;  that since  the\r\n\n1974  release was the only  known release, it  at least partially\r\n\ncaused  the  1991 contamination;  and that  there  was no  way of\r\n\napportioning what amounts, if any, of the 1991 contamination were\r\n\nattributable to  Sun  based on  the  work  done to  date.    This\r\n\nopinion, Sun concludes, is insufficient as a matter of law.  \r\n\n          We  disagree.   The  issue is  not whether  Cataldo was\r\n\nright:  but, rather, whether he had sufficient factual grounds on\r\n\nwhich to draw conclusions.  See Van Brode Group, Inc., 633 N.E.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 430.   On the basis  of our review of the  record, we conclude\r\n\nthat Cataldo's  expert testimony was predicated  on facts legally\r\n\nsufficient to provide a basis for  his conclusions.  There is  no\r\n\ndoubt that more  testing could  have been done  on the  property,\r\n\nwhich  would  have  been  helpful to  the  factfinder.   However,\r\n\nCataldo  noted that  although  there are  methods  to attempt  to\r\n\nquantify  the amount of contaminants dating back to 1974, he does\r\n\nnot know \"if there's anything that really can say, yes or no, how\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nmuch  there is.\"  (Day 2, page  133).  He drew his conclusions on\r\n\nthe basis of his \"experience with dealing with gasoline stations,\r\n\nresidual  contamination,  [and]  the  knowledge   that  the  only\r\n\nsignificant or large release at the [property] was reportedly the\r\n\n2,000 gallons in 1974.\"   (Day 2, page 71).  He and his personnel\r\n\nvisited the  property, investigated its history,  and made tests,\r\n\nfrom which he drew  his conclusions.  His testimony  reflects his\r\n\nresearch:  asked  how gas spilled in 1974 could  still be present\r\n\nin 1992, he stated,\r\n\n               A.   Because  the  gasoline  tends  to\r\n            absorb and holds in  to some of the soil.\r\n            It  also fills up  the pores  between the\r\n            soil  and   clings  in  to  that.     The\r\n            [property]  was paved,  so  that all  the\r\n            rain  that  falls  in it  doesn't  get  a\r\n            chance to percolate through, so you don't\r\n            have that complete  flushing action  that\r\n            you would in an open field.   Most of the\r\n            rainwater  probably  channeled  off,  and\r\n            that's one  of the purposes  of blacktop.\r\n            So it's my opinion that there would still\r\n            be   some   remnants   of  the   gasoline\r\n            remaining.\r\n\n(Day 2, page 87).  He later noted that biodegradation alone would\r\n\nnot have removed contamination of the scale of 2,000 gallons over\r\n\n18  years, and that  there had  been a  reported release  of four\r\n\ngallons subsequent to 1980, which would  be sufficient to account\r\n\nfor the levels of MTBE  found.  As the district court  noted, his\r\n\nattribution of the contamination,  at least in part, to  the 1974\r\n\ncontamination,  \"has an  additional  earmark  of  trustworthiness\r\n\nbecause it was prepared for a third-party, Rooney, pursuant to an\r\n\norder of  the DEP,  and not  in any way  in anticipation  of this\r\n\nlitigation.\"  (District Court Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nLaw, at 11).   Cf. Venturelli v. Cincinnati,  Inc., 850 F.2d 825,\r                                                            \r\n\n832  (1st Cir.  1988)  (\"The decision  of  whether an  expert  is\r\n\nadequately  qualified  is a  matter  primarily  for the  district\r\n\ncourt.\").\r\n\n          In   arguing   that   Cataldo's    testimony   provides\r\n\ninsufficient basis, Sun also relies on Providence &amp; Worcester for\r                                                                       \r\n\nthe  proposition that the Damons were \"required to bring forth an\r\n\nexpert  opinion that the on-site activity on the subject property\r\n\nduring Sun's  operation of gasoline station  (1972-1977) was more\r\n\nprobably   than  not   a  substantial   factor  in   causing  the\r\n\ncontamination  found  on  the  property  in  1992.\"    (Brief  of\r\n\nAppellant,  at 19).  We disregard this argument, for two reasons.\r\n\nFirst,  in  Providence &amp;  Worcester,  although the  SJC  found it\r                                             \r\n\nsignificant that  the  railroad's expert  did not  testify as  to\r\n\ncausation, the  court specifically noted  that it \"[did]  not say\r\n\nthat expert testimony is required to establish causation in every\r\n\nsoil contamination case.\"   622  N.E.2d at 264  (noting that  the\r\n\nsubject \"is not one  that jurors would be expected  to understand\r\n\nin many circumstances without guidance from an expert\").  We will\r\n\nnot  create  such  a requirement  here.    Second,  even if  that\r\n\nrequirement  existed, plaintiff  met it.  Cataldo  explicitly, if\r\n\nreluctantly,  testified that  the 1974  spill was  \"a substantial\r\n\nfactor\"  in  the  contamination  detected  in  1991, a  fact  the\r\n\ndistrict court noted twice  in its finding of causation.  In sum,\r\n\nthen,  we find that  the district  court did  not clearly  err in\r\n\nfinding  that  Sun's acts  were a  substantial  cause of  the DEP\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\ndecision that  contamination sufficient to trigger  21E liability\r\n\nexisted at the property.  \r\n\n          We note  that the district court's  task of determining\r\n\ncausation  on  this record  was not  an  easy one.   Nonetheless,\r\n\n\"[w]hen   the  evidence  supports   conflicting  inferences,  the\r\n\ndistrict court's choice from  among the several inferences cannot\r\n\nbe clearly erroneous.\"  Dedham Water Co., 972 F.2d at  462.  Thus\r                                                  \r\n\nwe  uphold the district court, and reject Sun's argument that the\r\n\nevidence upon which the district court relied is insufficient.  \r\n\n               C.

Damages and the Burden of Proof\r                                                            \r\n\n          The  parties  dispute  who  bore the  burden  of  proof\r\n\nregarding  whether the harm was divisible.  The backdrop to their\r\n\ndialogue is the fact that the evidence indicates that Sun was not\r\n\nthe only  owner or operator of the property whose acts led to the\r\n\n1991 contamination.  As  the district court stated, the  presence\r\n\nof  MTBE  \"compel(s)  the  conclusion  that   there  had  been  a\r\n\nwidespread release of gasoline at the [property] after 1984, when\r\n\nMTBE  became  common.\"   (District  Court  Findings of  Fact  and\r\n\nConclusions of Law, at 10).  Thus, there was at least one release\r\n\nof  gasoline  when the  property was  operated  by Rooney  or the\r\n\nplaintiffs.   The Damons concede  that the evidence  and findings\r\n\nindicate that there was a post-1980 release  of gasoline.  At the\r\n\nsame  time, there  was no  evidence  of a  spill greater  than 10\r\n\ngallons, and  the district  court specifically found  that during\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nthe time  the Damons  owned  the property,  no significant  leaks\r\n\noccurred.1\r\n\n          The  Damons bear  the burden  of proving  that tortious\r\n\nconduct by Sun caused  them harm.  See Restatement  (2d) of Torts\r                                                \r\n\n  433B(1).  They  were required  to produce evidence  that it  is\r\n\nmore  likely than not that Sun's conduct was a substantial factor\r\n\nin bringing  about the  harm they  suffered.  See  id. comment  a\r                                                                \r\n\n(noting that  \"[a]  mere possibility  of  such causation  is  not\r\n\nenough\").   Sun argues that the Damons  did not meet their burden\r\n\nof showing that Sun's conduct substantially caused the harm  they\r\n\nsuffered.   Accordingly, it maintains, the  burden of identifying\r\n\nwhat  other  actors were  also responsible  for  the harm  and of\r\n\nallocating the harm (or showing that it was indivisible) remained\r\n\nwith the plaintiffs, who did not fulfill that  task.  However, we\r\n\nhave already  established above that  the district court  did not\r\n\nerr in finding that  Sun's conduct substantially caused  the harm\r\n\nthe  Damons suffered.  Therefore,  the burden shifted  to Sun, as\r\n\ndid the cost of not  meeting it.  See Restatement (2d) of Torts  \r                                               \r\n\n433B(2)  (\"Where the tortious conduct  of two or  more actors has\r\n\ncombined to bring about harm to the plaintiff, and one or more of\r\n\nthe actors seeks  to limit his liability  on the ground  that the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Sun  argues that  the district  court's factual  findings are\r\ninconsistent.  We disagree:  the evidence at trial indicated that\r\na spill as small as four  gallons could account for the amount of\r\nMTBE  present, and that Cataldo's research found no record of any\r\nspills over ten  gallons.   The evidence leads  to the  inference\r\nthat a  spill made  up of  less than ten  gallons, but  which was\r\nnonetheless spread  out (or  several such spills),  could account\r\nfor the MTBE found. \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nharm  is capable of apportionment among them, the burden of proof\r\n\nas  to the  apportionment is  upon each  such actor.\");  see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nO'Neil v.

To\r                        \r\n\ndemonstrate  that the Damons did not meet their burden of proving\r\n\nmisrepresentation by a preponderance of the evidence, Sun   \"must\r\n\nshow  that  the  verdict was  against  the  great  weight of  the\r\n\nevidence,  viewed in the light most favorable to [the Damons], or\r\n\nwould work a  clear miscarriage of  justice.\"  Cambridge  Plating\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo. v.

The distinction  is  a\r\n\ncrucial  one, as  it  is well  established  that the  latter  can\r\n\nordinarily be  the  basis of  a claim  of fraud,  but the  former\r\n\ncannot.  See, e.g.,  Briggs v. Carol Cars, Inc.,  553 N.E.2d 930,\r                                                         \r\n\n(Mass. 1990) (noting that a statement which is an opinion in form\r\n\n\"in  some  circumstances may  reasonably  be  interpreted by  the\r\n\nrecipient  to imply that the  maker of the  statement knows facts\r\n\nthat justify the opinion\"); Coe v. Ware, 171 N.E. 732, 734 (Mass.\r                                                 \r\n\n1930).  The determination of whether a statement is of opinion or\r\n\nfact is a factual one, see  id., and so we review only for  clear\r                                         \r\n\nerror.  \r\n\n          The district court held that\r\n\n            It  should have  been clear  from Damon's\r\n            questions [to  Sun's agents] that  he was\r\n            concerned  about  the  past   and  future\r\n            integrity of the  entire underground  gas\r\n            delivery  system;  as Damon  testified at\r\n            trial, \"the  only thing you've  got in  a\r\n            gas station  is tanks  and pumps  and the\r\n            lines.  I mean, what else is there?\"\r\n\n(District Court Findings  of Fact  and Conclusions of  Law, at  7\r\n\nn.1). Sun contends that  there is no evidentiary basis for such a\r\n\nfinding.   Seeking support,  it points  to  the district  court's\r\n\nstatement during closing arguments that\r\n\n            the testimony that [Damon] had, that they\r\n            told him  it was  a good station,  is not\r\n            significant  in  my  view because  that's\r\n            absolutely  an  opinion  rather   than  a\r\n            statement of fact.\r\n\n(Day 4,  page 15), and contends  that by making this  comment the\r\n\ndistrict court essentially conceded that there was no evidentiary\r\n\nbasis  to  find that  the statements  by  the Sun  employees were\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nopinion.  To the contrary, all this statement reveals is that the\r\n\ndistrict court changed  its mind  as to the  significance of  the\r\n\nstatements,  which  is  certainly  within  its  province  to  do.\r\n\nIndeed,  that is  the  very mission  of  closing arguments:    to\r\n\nconvince  the  factfinder that  a party's  view  of the  facts is\r\n\ncorrect. \r\n\n          Similarly,   that   Damon's    testimony   about    the\r\n\nconversations could be viewed as inconsistent, as Sun notes, is a\r\n\nquestion  that addresses  Damon's credibility,  not the  district\r\n\ncourt's finding.   Credibility, of  course, is an  issue for  the\r\n\nfactfinder, and Sun has  shown us no clear error in  the district\r\n\ncourt's judgment on the  matter.  See  O'Brien, 780 F.2d at  1076\r                                                        \r\n\n(\"No subject matter is more clearly within the exclusive province\r\n\nof the fact-finder than this.\").\r\n\n          Our  review of  the  record  leads  us  to  affirm  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's finding  that  the statements  were factual  in\r\n\nnature.   First, we note that the evidence supports the findings.\r\n\nThe  court found  that Damon  asked Bunzell  if  Sun had  had any\r\n\nproblems  with the  underground storage  tanks, to  which Bunzell\r\n\nresponded that Sun had had \"no problems with it.  It's all good.\"\r\n\n(District Court Findings of  Fact and Conclusions of Law,  at 5).\r\n\nThis is consistent  with Damon's testimony  at trial.   Bunzell's\r\n\ntestimony  did  not  contradict  him,  since  he  stated  in  his\r\n\naffidavit, entered  at trial, that he neither remembered the sale\r\n\nof the property nor recalled any discussion of it or the terms of\r\n\nthe  sale.  The district court also found that although Laubinger\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nknew about the  1974 spill -- indeed, he  visited the property at\r\n\nthe time -- he did not reveal the information to Damon.  Instead,\r\n\nhe  responded to  Damon's  questions about  whether  Sun had  any\r\n\nproblems with  the  station, particularly  with  the  underground\r\n\ntanks, by stating \"that it was a 'good station' which just needed\r\n\nto be run by a good  operator to be successful.\"  (District Court\r\n\nFindings  of Fact  and  Conclusions  of Law,  at  5).   This  was\r\n\nconsistent with Damon's testimony  at trial.  Laubinger testified\r\n\nthat he did not recall having a telephone conversation with Damon\r\n\nor  ever not telling anyone  about the release  in discussing the\r\n\nproperty, and the  trial court  was free to  credit Damon's  more\r\n\nspecific recollection.  \r\n\n          Next, in discussing  whether the Bunzell  and Laubinger\r\n\nstatements were opinions or fact,  the district court noted  that\r\n\nDamon's questions were not  just about the current conditions  on\r\n\nthe  property.  If they had been,  their statements that it was a\r\n\ngood station  would presumably  have been opinion.   Rather,  the\r\n\ndistrict court specified that the  questions also went to whether\r\n\nthere had been problems in the station in the past of which Damon\r\n\nshould be  aware, with  the underground  tanks specifically.   In\r\n\nthat context, reading the  record in the light most  favorable to\r\n\nthe  Damons,  we do  not find  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\nfinding  that the Sun  representatives' statements that  it was a\r\n\n\"good station\" were factual.  Indeed, we are hard put to see how,\r\n\nwhere there has been a spill of 2,000 gallons in  1974, which Sun\r\n\nknew of, statements five years later that it was a \"good station\"\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nand that Sun had had \"no problems with it\" in reply to a question\r\n\nregarding  the underground  tanks are  not misrepresentations  of\r\n\nfact.\r\n\n              B.  Evidence of the Elements of Fraud\r                        B.  Evidence of the Elements of Fraud\r                                                             \r\n\n          Sun's second contention is  that the record contains no\r\n\nevidence  of the key elements needed  to prove fraud.  First, Sun\r\n\nasserts that the  statements by  Bunzell and  Laubinger were  not\r\n\nmisrepresentations of material facts,  and thus the first element\r\n\nof the  tort has not been  shown.  See Barret  Assocs., Inc., 190\r                                                                      \r\n\nN.E.2d at 868 (noting  that the first element is  that \"defendant\r\n\nmade a false representation of a material fact\").  We   disagree.\r\n\nThere can be no doubt that the statements were misrepresentations\r\n\nin terms of the past history of the property:  stating that it is\r\n\na \"good station\" ignores the  fact that there was a 2,000  gallon\r\n\nspill.   It may have  been a \"good  station\" in 1979,  from Sun's\r\n\nperspective:   the spill had  been cleaned up  in accordance with\r\n\nthe  requirements of the time, and  there is no evidence of other\r\n\nproblems.  Nonetheless, there had been a problem in the past, and\r\n\nto omit that  was to  misrepresent the situation.   The  district\r\n\ncourt found that  the fact was  material, as it gave  credence to\r\n\nDamon's  testimony that  his  affiliation with  a car  dealership\r\n\nwhich sold gasoline gave  him a general awareness of  the growing\r\n\nimportance  of environmental issues,  and that he  would not have\r\n\nbought the  station had he  been aware of  the spill.   Thus, the\r\n\nstatements by the Sun representatives were certainly \"'one of the\r\n\nprincipal grounds,  though not necessarily the  sole ground, that\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\ncaused the  plaintiff[s] \"to take the particular  action that the\r\n\nwrongdoer  intended   he  would   take  as   a  result   of  such\r\n\nrepresentations.\"'\"   Bond Leather Co., 764  F.2d at 936 (quoting\r                                                \r\n\nNational  Car Rental Sys., Inc. v.

While this  testimony is\r                 \r\n\nundoubtedly in Damon's interest, the district court's credence in\r\n\nthat testimony has not been  shown to be in error.

In short,\r\n\nalthough the  district court  did not  spell out  every pertinent\r\n\npoint, it  is clear that it  has provided us with  more than mere\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Sun  contests that  the district  court's statement  that \"it\r\nshould have  been  clear  from  Damon's  questions  that  he  was\r\nconcerned  about  the past  and  future integrity  of  the entire\r\nunderground gas delivery system\" (District Court Findings of Fact\r\nand Conclusions  of Law, at 7  n.1), implies that Sun  did not in\r\nfact  know  what  Damon   asked  about,  and  so  no   intent  is\r\ndemonstrated on this record.  However, we refuse Sun's invitation\r\nto  read this  implication into  the district  court's statement,\r\nespecially  as,  in  its findings  of  fact,  the district  court\r\nspecifically   found   that  Damon   had   asked   each  of   the\r\nrepresentatives about past conditions, particularly regarding the\r\nunderground tanks. \r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nconclusions. \r\n\n                     C.

First, it states that the district court\r\n\nwas  silent on reasonable reliance.  To the contrary, although it\r\n\ndid not address the reasonableness  of the reliance, the district\r\n\ncourt  found that Damon \"would not have purchased the station for\r\n\n$90,000 if he had been aware of the 1974 spill.\"  (District Court\r\n\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, at 8).  \r\n\n          Sun points to the fact that the Damons had the right to\r\n\ninspect the property prior to sale and did not do so as vitiating\r\n\nany  argument of  reasonable reliance,  especially given  Damon's\r\n\nacknowledged awareness  of environmental issues.   However, it is\r\n\nwell  established  under  Massachusetts  law   that  \"failure  to\r\n\ninvestigate the veracity of  statements does not, as a  matter of\r\n\nlaw, bar recovery for misrepresentation.\"  Bond Leather Co.,  764\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at 936.

There, the Maloneys bought\r\n\nproperty,  and subsequently  discovered that  because of  a drain\r\n\nline  to a local reservoir, it could  not be built on.  Sargisson\r\n\nwas the attorney  with whom  they entered the  purchase and  sale\r\n\nagreement.    That  agreement was  made  contingent  on  the land\r\n\npassing a  percolation test and deep  hole test to  qualify for a\r\n\nbuilding  permit,  with  the tests  to  be  done  at the  buyers'\r\n\nexpense.   The tests were  done, indicated positive  results, and\r\n\nthe sale went  through.  Later, however,  it turned out  that the\r\n\ntests were done at the wrong time of year, and the results of the\r\n\nsecond  deep hole test were adverse.  The Maloneys sued Sargisson\r\n\nalleging, among  other things,  misrepresentation.   The  Appeals\r\n\nCourt  found  that  the  Maloneys   could  not  have  relied   on\r\n\nSargisson's  statements that \"he knew all there was to know about\r\n\nthe property,\" that they did not need to hire a  lawyer, and that\r\n\n\"the lot was a good building lot\": \r\n\n            Whatever those alleged statements  may be\r\n            taken to  mean,  the Maloneys  would  not\r\n            have  relied upon them to their detriment\r\n            so far  as they  might have borne  on the\r\n            capacity of the lot  to pass soil tests .\r\n            .  .  .  Concerning  that aspect  of  the\r\n            land's    character,   their    affidavit\r\n            discloses,  the  Maloneys made  their own\r\n            examination.\r\n\nId. at 301.\r             \r\n\n          Clearly,  Maloney is  distinguishable from  the present\r                                     \r\n\ncase.  There, the buyer specified in the  agreement that it would\r\n\nmake the  tests, and did  so.   A district court  had found  that\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nthere was no evidence Sargisson knew or should have known of  the\r\n\nexistence of the problem, a finding which carried weight as prima\r\n\nfacie  evidence in the superior  court and was  not questioned by\r\n\nthe  Appeals Court.   Id. at  300.   There is  no indication that\r                                   \r\n\nSargisson made a  representation as  to the status  of the  soil:\r\n\nrather, it is clear that the Maloneys relied on  their own tests.\r\n\nHere, the questions went to the past history of the property, not\r\n\njust the present condition.   In short, the reasoning  in Maloney\r                                                                           \r\n\nis based on a sufficiently different set of facts such that Sun's\r\n\nreliance  on  it fails.4   See  Roadmaster  Indus., Inc.,  893 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp.  at    1179  (holding that  plaintiff  buyer's  failure  to\r\n\ninvestigate contamination  of soil  at manufacturing plant  as to\r\n\nmatters of  public record  did not vitiate  its misrepresentation\r\n\nclaim).\r\n\n                     D.

The district  court stated during  closing arguments\r\n\nthat it also did  not consider that Damon  had made an  admission\r\n\nthat the property was clean.  \r\n\n          Sun  also argues that the  court had to  explain why it\r\n\nchose the \"version\" of his story  Damon told at trial, instead of\r\n\nwhat it  deems \"varying\" earlier versions  under oath, especially\r\n\nas regards what questions he put to the Sun representatives.  Our\r\n\nreview  of the record does not indicate that Damon's testimony at\r\n\ntrial  was  so inconsistent  with  his  earlier testimony  as  to\r\n\nconstitute \"'unsupported self-serving testimony that flies in the\r\n\nteeth  of  unimpeachable  contradicting  evidence  and  universal\r\n\nexperience.'\"  Venturelli, 850 F.2d at 833 (quoting Insurance Co.\r                                                                           \r\n\nof North  Am. v.

There  are  differences, there's  no\r\n\nquestion,  but  the  extent of  the  differences  is a  difficult\r\n\nquestion, it strikes me.\"  (Day 4, page 17).  \r\n\n          Lastly, Sun contends that the  court did not provide an\r\n\nevidentiary basis for  its conclusion, made  in a footnote,  that\r\n\n\"it  should  have been  clear\"  to Sun  what  Damon meant  in his\r\n\nquestioning.   The  findings  here,  however, are  not  like  the\r\n\ninconsistent  and  contradictory  findings  in  Lyles  v.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates,  759 F.2d 941,  944 (1st Cir.  1985), cited by  Sun.  The\r                \r\n\ncourt here specifically stated in its findings of fact that Damon\r\n\nasked  both  Laubinger  and  Bunzell  about past  problems.

I  mean, what else\r\n\nis there?\"  (District  Court Findings of Fact and  Conclusions of\r\n\nLaw,  at  7 n.1).

American Honda Motor Co.,  835 F.2d 389,  394 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1987).  The district court met its burden here.  \r\n\n                      CALCULATION OF DAMAGES\r                                CALCULATION OF DAMAGES\r\n\n          The district court calculated  the damages for the tort\r\n\nclaim as $245,000, the difference between the actual value of the\r\n\nDamon's property if it  was uncontaminated -- $600,000 --  as the\r\n\ndefendant's representatives  stated and  the actual value  of the\r\n\nproperty as  contaminated  -- $325,000  -- as  measured when  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  sold the property to  Rooney in 1992.7   Sun does not\r\n\ncontest the  district court's basic measurement,  but argues that\r\n\nit should  have  set off  specific  monies against  the  purchase\r\n\nprice, and  should have accounted  for the Damons'  obligation to\r\n\nmitigate damages.  We disagree, for the following reasons.  \r\n\n          First, Sun  contends the value of  the indemnity Rooney\r\n\ngave  the Damons  from and  against all  environmental liability,\r\n\nwhich it suggests is approximately $104,000, should have been set\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7    Adopting  the  sale  price  suggested  by  Rooney's gasoline\r\nsupplier, the district court  found the fair market value  of the\r\nproperty if it had been not been contaminated to be $600,000.  It\r\ntook the actual  sale price as  the measure of  the value of  the\r\nproperty as  contaminated:  Rooney  assumed the  $325,000 of  the\r\nDamons'  first and second mortgages, $10,000 in arrears, and made\r\na $20,000 cash payment, for a total of $355,000.\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\noff against the  purchase price.   However, as  the Damons  point\r\n\nout,  if Sun had not made the misrepresentation, the Damons would\r\n\nnot be responsible to clean up  the mess.  Had the Damons cleaned\r\n\nup   the  property   themselves,  they   would  be   entitled  to\r\n\nreimbursement, and,  presumably, the  sale price of  the property\r\n\nwould have been higher:  reducing the damages by the value of the\r\n\nindemnity  would virtually  reverse  this process.   Second,  Sun\r\n\nargues that $40,000 should be taken off the damage figure, as the\r\n\nDamons did not give Rooney $40,000, as they were required  to per\r\n\ntheir  agreement, to  defray costs of  contamination.   Again, if\r\n\nSun's  representatives  had  not  misrepresented  the  property's\r\n\ncondition, the Damons would  not have owed that money  to Rooney;\r\n\nif they had paid  it to Rooney, it would have  been added to, not\r\n\noffset against, the damages (and presumably would be reflected in\r\n\nthe actual sale price).   Third, Sun argues that  $29,000 in back\r\n\nrent  from  Rooney should  have been  offset  as well,  since the\r\n\nDamons  did not  seek  it from  him.   However,  once again,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs   would  not   have  lost   that  money   without  the\r\n\nmisrepresentation.    Also,  according  to  paragraph  9  of  the\r\n\nAgreement and Lease, Rooney was entitled to opt out of  his lease\r\n\nif a governmental authority prevented him from occupying or using\r\n\nthe property as  a gasoline station.   Thus,  it is unclear  that\r\n\nRooney did, in fact, owe the past rent.\r\n\n          Sun  also argues  that  the Damons  failed to  mitigate\r\n\ntheir  losses by not seeking back rent  from Rooney.  In light of\r\n\nthe  terms  of the  Agreement and  Lease  between Rooney  and the\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\nDamons, the fact  that the  Damons were obligated  to pay  Rooney\r\n\n$40,000,  which  they did  not, and  the  subsequent sale  of the\r\n\nproperty, we are hard put to accept their reasoning.\r\n\n          For   the   above   reasons,   the   district   court's\r\n\ndetermination of damages is affirmed.\r\n\n                        CHAPTER 93A CLAIMS\r                                  CHAPTER 93A CLAIMS\r\n\n          The  district  court  found  that  Sun's  actions  were\r\n\n\"unfair  or deceptive\"  and thus  violated Massachusetts  General\r\n\nLaws chapter 93A, section 11.   At the same time, the lower court\r\n\nrefused  to award multiple damages under section 11, on the basis\r\n\nthat  \"the evidence  of bad  faith or  willful intent  to deceive\r\n\n[was]  insufficient to merit a punitive  award.\"  (District Court\r\n\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, at 12).   See Mass.

Sun argues on appeal  that the court erred in finding\r\n\nit  violated chapter 93A, while the Damons contend that the court\r\n\nerred in  refusing multiple damages.   For the  reasons discussed\r\n\nbelow, we affirm the district court's finding that Sun was liable\r\n\nunder chapter 93A, as well as its refusal of multiple damages.\r\n\n              A.

Regardless of  the level of the parties'  sophistication,\r\nwe  apply  the well-developed  standard  for  section 11  actions\r\nbetween  two  persons  engaged in  business.    Of course,  their\r\nrelative levels  of sophistication may enter  into the fact-based\r\nanalysis  the court carries out in weighing whether a party's act\r\nwas unfair or deceptive.\r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\nthe level of rascality  necessary to find a violation  of chapter\r\n\n93A.\"   Id.   As we  have already  affirmed the district  court's\r                     \r\n\nfinding of misrepresentation, it is manifest that Sun's acts sink\r\n\nbelow the  level  of  \"simply neglecting  to  discuss\"  the  1974\r\n\ncontamination.  Winter Panel offers Sun no relief.\r                                      \r\n\n          Sun's  primary argument  against  the district  court's\r\n\nholding blurs the line between section  11 liability and multiple\r\n\ndamages.10   Specifically,  it contends  that since  the district\r\n\ncourt apparently found Sun's conduct was not willful and knowing,\r\n\nSun cannot have engaged in common law fraud.  Since  it could not\r\n\nhave engaged in fraud, it concludes, its  conduct did not rise to\r\n\nthe level  of intentional  misconduct, beyond mere  negligence or\r\n\ninadvertence, that section 11 demands.  \r\n\n          We  disagree.    As  noted above,  the  district  court\r\n\nrefused to award multiple damages here on the basis that \r\n\n            [m]ultiple damages are not  mandated when\r\n            misrepresentation occurs.   Only \"callous\r\n            and   intentional   violations\"   deserve\r\n            multiple  damages  treatment.    In  this\r\n            instance, we believe  the evidence of bad\r\n            faith or  willful  intent to  deceive  is\r\n            insufficient to merit a punitive award of\r\n            multiple damages.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10   Sun also  makes the  circular argument  that if  its conduct\r\namounts  to  negligence,  it  has  not  met  the  requirement  of\r\nrascality needed for  section 11, since negligence  cannot be the\r\nbasis  for a section 11  violation.  To  the contrary, negligence\r\ncan provide the basis for chapter 93A liability, so long as it is\r\npaired with an unfair  or deceptive act or  practice -- in  other\r\nwords, negligence  plus rascality equals liability.

As  Sun  itself  indicates, reading  the\r\n\ndistrict court opinion as finding that Sun was not at all knowing\r\n\nor  willful is inconsistent with the first element of the tort of\r\n\nmisrepresentation, i.e. that a  party make a false representation\r\n\nwith the knowledge of its falsity.

We understand  the  district court  opinion as\r\n\nindicating that  there  was evidence  of  bad faith  and  willful\r\n\nintent  to deceive, but that  some quantum of  knowing or willful\r\n\nviolation  must be  met before  a party  is entitled  to punitive\r\n\ndamages  under chapter  93A.

Our\r                                                 \r\n\nreading is consistent with  the district court's specific finding\r\n\nthat  when  Damon  asked Laubinger  if  Sun  had  experienced any\r\n\nproblems  with  the  station  and  underground  tanks,  Laubinger\r\n\nreplied  that it was a  \"good station,\" despite  his knowledge of\r\n\nthe  1974 contamination.

The court disagreed, finding\r\n\nthat  although VMArk's  misstatements  were made  with sufficient\r\n\nawareness of the facts for it to be liable  under the traditional\r\n\ntort  formula, \"they were not  made so 'knowingly'  as to warrant\r\n\nthe punitive sanctions  of double damages under c. 93A.\"   Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n595.

First, we note  that\r\n\nsection 9 is  by its terms  inapplicable to transactions  between\r\n\npersons engaged in business, and section 11 quite simply does not\r\n\ninclude  language   acting  as  a  counterpart   to  section  9's\r\n\nrequirement of multiple  damages where  a party does  not make  a\r\n\nwritten tender  of settlement.

Gen.\r\n\nL.  ch. 93A,   11.  For the  reasons stated herein, we affirm the\r\n\ndecision of the district court.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The   parties  stipulated   to  the   following  facts:\r\n\nDefendant  Sun Oil Company, Inc.  (R &amp; M)  (\"Sun\") owned property\r\n\nlocated  at  225  Brockton Ave.,  Abington,  Massachusetts,  (the\r\n\n\"property\") from 1971  to 1979.   In 1972, Sun  built a  gasoline\r\n\nstation  with  underground  storage  tanks on  the  property  and\r\n\noperated a  retail  gasoline station  thereafter  until  November\r\n\n1977.  On or about December 19, 1974, a leaking underground  pipe\r\n\nleading from the  underground storage tanks to the pumps released\r\n\napproximately 2,000 gallons of  gasoline.  Sun's regional manager\r\n\nof  operations,  Robert  Laubinger   (\"Laubinger\"),  was  on  the\r\n\nproperty  after the leak was  discovered.  On  November 21, 1979,\r\n\nthe plaintiffs, Roy Damon  (\"Damon\") and Eleanor Damon (together,\r\n\nthe  \"Damons\"), purchased the property from Sun for $90,000.  The\r\n\nplaintiffs had  a right to examine  the property by terms  of the\r\n\nAgreement of Sale.   The Damons  owned the property from  1979 to\r\n\nMarch  25,  1992 and  operated a  retail  service station  at the\r\n\nproperty from June 12, 1980 to January 31, 1991.\r\n\n          On January 31, 1991, the plaintiffs leased the property\r\n\nto K. Rooney, Inc. (\"Rooney\").  Since then, Rooney has operated a\r\n\nretail service station on the property.  In November 1991, Rooney\r\n\nbegan  upgrading the station by installing new pumps and Stage II\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nof a vapor recovery  system.  As digging commenced,  the Abington\r\n\nFire Department observed petroleum product pooling in the surface\r\n\nexcavations,  shut  down   the  construction  and  notified   the\r\n\nMassachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\").  On\r\n\nDecember 19, 1991, the DEP sent a Notice of Responsibility to the\r\n\nplaintiffs and  Rooney, requiring  that a  Phase  I Limited  Site\r\n\nInvestigation  Report  and   Preliminary  Assessment  Report   be\r\n\ncompleted.  A company hired by Rooney performed the investigation\r\n\nand issued a report  dated October 1992.  As part  of the Phase I\r\n\ninvestigation,  monitoring  wells were  installed and  samples of\r\n\ngroundwater  were taken  and  analyzed.    As  a  result  of  the\r\n\ndiscovery  of the  pollution,  Rooney refused  to  pay rent  from\r\n\nNovember  1991  to March  1992.    The  lease  agreement  between\r\n\nplaintiffs  and Rooney granted  Rooney an option  to purchase the\r\n\nproperty for $600,000.  Rooney did not exercise its lease option.\r\n\nOn  March 25, 1992, Rooney purchased the property from the Damons\r\n\nby assuming  a first mortgage  in the  amount of  $275,000 and  a\r\n\nsecond  mortgage in  the amount of  $50,000.  Rooney  also made a\r\n\ncash payment of $20,000 to plaintiffs.\r\n\n          The  district  court's  additional  findings   of  fact\r\n\nincluded the following.  A rupture  of an elbow joint in the pipe\r\n\nwhich connects the  tanks and  the pumps caused  the 1974  spill,\r\n\nwhich closed the station for approximately six weeks.  In June or\r\n\nJuly 1979, Damon attempted  to reach Richard Bunzell (\"Bunzell\"),\r\n\nwhose name  was  given on  the \"For  Sale\" sign  at the  station.\r\n\nAfter  some  unsuccessful  attempts   to  reach  Bunzell,  a  Sun\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ntelephone operator  referred Damon  to Laubinger,  Sun's regional\r\n\nmanager  for service  station maintenance.   The  questions Damon\r\n\nasked Laubinger about the property included an inquiry concerning\r\n\nthe  age of  the building,  and whether  Sun had  experienced any\r\n\nproblems  with the  station,  particularly with  the  underground\r\n\ntanks.  Laubinger knew of the  1974 spill, but did not reveal it.\r\n\nRather,  he  answered that  it was  a  \"good station\"  which just\r\n\nneeded to be run by a good operator to  be successful.  After his\r\n\nphone conversation  with Laubinger, Damon contacted  Bunzell and,\r\n\nafter some negotiation, accepted  his offer of $90,000.   In late\r\n\nAugust 1979, Damon  and Bunzell met at  the property to view  the\r\n\nproperty.    Damon asked  about a  depression  he noticed  in the\r\n\nblacktop  near the pumps and  Bunzell explained it  was caused by\r\n\nthe installation of the  first stage of a vapor  recovery system.\r\n\nIn  response to  Damon's  question of  whether  Sun had  had  any\r\n\nproblems with the underground storage tanks, Bunzell stated, \"No,\r\n\nwe've had no problems with it.  It's all good.\"\r\n\n          In 1980  Damon had  the three 6,000  gallon underground\r\n\ngasoline  tanks tested for tightness by Getty Oil, Co., his first\r\n\ngasoline supplier: they tested tight, as they did in May 1984 and\r\n\nagain in January 1991.  In 1992, no holes were observed in any of\r\n\nthe underground gasoline tanks  or oil tanks.   The  southern end\r\n\nof  the pit  dug  around the  three  gasoline tanks  yielded  the\r\n\nhighest level  of contamination; 101 cubic  yards of contaminated\r\n\nsoil were  eventually removed  for off-site treatment.   Finally,\r\n\nsamples  of  contaminated water  collected  and  examined by  the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncompany  conducting  the 1992  Phase  I study  indicate  that the\r\n\ncontamination  contained  the  gasoline  additive  MTBE (\"MTBE\"),\r\n\nwhich was not added to Sunoco gasoline until 1984.\r\n\n          The  Damons brought suit  against Sun,  alleging common\r\n\nlaw  misrepresentation and violation of  chapter 93A,    11.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court,  after a  four day  bench  trial, found  for the\r\n\nDamons on both the misrepresentation and  the chapter 93A counts,\r\n\nawarding them $245,000 plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\nIn  its appeal,  Sun  now challenges  the  three rulings  of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  --  its denial  of  Sun's  motion  for entry  of\r\n\njudgment at the close  of plaintiffs' case in chief, see  Fed. R.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCiv.  P.  52(c);  the  district  court's  judgment  and  findings\r\n\npursuant  to trial; and its denial of Sun's post-trial motions to\r\n\nalter  and amend the  judgment and findings and  for a new trial,\r\n\nsee Fed.

Here, the\r               \r\n\nalleged false  representations are  the statements made  by Sun's\r\n\nrepresentatives that  it was a  \"good\" station, upon  which Damon\r\n\nrelied in his purchasing decision.  The alleged harm suffered was\r\n\nthat the Damons bought a gas station in 1979 that would have been\r\n\nworth more in 1992 if what the defendant's representatives stated\r\n\nhad in  fact  been  true.    The damages  were  measured  by  the\r\n\ndifference  between  the value  of the  property  if it  had been\r\n\nuncontaminated,  as the  defendant  represented,  and the  actual\r\n\nvalue of the property as contaminated.\r\n\n          Appellant  questions  the  district   court's  findings\r\n\nrelated to  two of these elements:   causation and  damages.

Sun  argues  on  appeal that  the\r\n\nevidence  that the district court  relied on in  finding that Sun\r\n\nmore  probably   than  not  was   a  substantial  cause   of  the\r\n\ncontamination found in 1991  is insufficient as a matter  of law,\r\n\nfor  three reasons.  Upon review of  the record, however, we find\r\n\nthat the Damons met their burden of proof, such that the district\r\n\ncourt did not clearly  err in finding that the  causation element\r\n\nof misrepresentation has been met.  We address, and dismiss, each\r\n\nof Sun's arguments in turn.  \r\n\n          First, Sun notes that  the district court conceded that\r\n\n\"it is unclear how much of the 2,000 gallons [of  the 1974 spill]\r\n\nwas recovered,\" (District Court  Findings of Fact and Conclusions\r\n\nof Law, at 9), and concludes  from that statement that there  was\r\n\nno evidence of what (if any) contamination found in 1991 actually\r\n\ndated to  1974.  The fact that there was a release, without more,\r\n\nSun argues, is insufficient to impose liability.  \r\n\n          There is more, however:   the district court  found not\r\n\nonly that there was a release, but also that the clean-up efforts\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nat the time of the release were limited, at best.\r\n\n            Defendant's remedial efforts in 1974 were\r\n            not  conducted for the purpose of ridding\r\n            the  property  of contamination;  rather,\r\n            the goal was to make the [property] safe.\r\n            To  this end, the  focus was  on stopping\r\n            the flow of gasoline onto the neighboring\r\n            property --  no effort was  made to clean\r\n            or  remove  contaminated   soil  on   the\r\n            [property]  itself.    From the  Abington\r\n            Fire Department records it is unclear how\r\n            much  of the 2,000 gallons was recovered.\r\n            Presumably, the  company hired by  Sun to\r\n            pump  the trenches was  pumping a mixture\r\n            of gas  and water,  but no one  knows the\r\n            relative proportions or the  total amount\r\n            of mixture pumped.\r\n\n(District Court Findings of  Fact and Conclusions of Law,  at 9).\r\n\nTo  suggest  that  the district  court's  statement  that \"it  is\r\n\nunclear how  much of the 2,000 gallons was recovered\" can be read\r\n\nto imply that  it was all recovered is to  misread the context of\r\n\nthe statement.\r\n\n          Additional evidence the lower court found determinative\r\n\nin its finding of  causation included the sheer size of  the 1974\r\n\nspill (2,000 gallons); the  fact that Robert Cataldo (\"Cataldo\"),\r\n\nplaintiffs' expert, testified that the underground pipe which ran\r\n\nfrom  the pumps to  the tanks created  a channel  along which the\r\n\ngasoline  could flow from the rupture and settle under the tanks;\r\n\nand  that no gasoline spills  larger than 10  gallons occurred at\r\n\nthe property between 1974 and 1992, during which time the Damons'\r\n\ntanks periodically  tested tight.  Finally, the  court also noted\r\n\nthat \"Cataldo testified, albeit hesitatingly, that in his opinion\r\n\nthe  1974 spill  was  a substantial  factor  contributing to  the\r\n\ncontamination found at  the [property] in 1992.\"  (District Court\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nFindings  of Fact and Conclusions of Law,  at 10).   Clearly, the\r\n\nevidence the district  court relied on in  finding causation goes\r\n\nbeyond the  simple fact that  there was a  release in 1974.   Sun\r\n\ndoes not challenge  any of these  specific findings; indeed,  our\r\n\nreview of the record finds support for each.  \r\n\n          In  making its  argument,  Sun relies  on Providence  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nWorcester R.R.

In  that case,  contamination was discovered  in 1988  on\r\n\nproperty  owned by  the plaintiff  railroad.   The railroad  sued\r\n\ndefendant  Chevron,  claiming  that  the 1988  contamination  was\r\n\ncaused  by  a 1972  leak of  12,000 gallons  of  fuel oil  from a\r\n\nstorage  facility defendant had maintained on  the property.  The\r\n\ncourt found no causal link between the spills, where there was no\r\n\nevidence  that the soil  was significantly saturated  by the 1972\r\n\nsurface  spill, which  had been  pumped out  the same  day, where\r\n\nsixteen  years had passed, and where the question whether the oil\r\n\nwould remain  in some form  was left  unanswered in  the face  of\r\n\nconflicting  evidence.   The  court specifically  noted that  the\r\n\nrailroad's  expert was not asked  to give an  opinion whether the\r\n\n1988 contamination was caused at least in part by the 1972 spill.\r\n\nId. at 264.  \r             \r\n\n          Sun draws  on Providence  &amp; Worcester  as demonstrating\r                                                         \r\n\nthat  evidence  of  the   1974  spill,  in  and  of   itself,  is\r\n\ninsufficient to impose liability.  That may be true, as far as it\r\n\ngoes.   The  evidence in  the present  case, however,  shows much\r\n\nmore.   As in Providence  &amp; Worcester, many  years passed between\r                                               \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  spills in the present case.   However,  the evidence is that\r\n\nthe 1974 spill was not cleaned up immediately, as in Providence &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nWorcester.    Rather,  the  fire department  logs  indicate  that\r                   \r\n\npumping  did not start until two days after discovery of the leak\r\n\non December  19, 1974:  as late as  February 4, 1975, more than a\r\n\nmonth after  the leak  was first  reported,  gasoline fumes  were\r\n\nstill being detected  in the  basement of  an adjacent  property.\r\n\nThus,  there  was  evidence  in  this  case  that  the  soil  was\r\n\ncontaminated by the 1974 spill.  What is more, plaintiffs' expert\r\n\nhere  did  state that  the 1974  spill  was a  substantial factor\r\n\ncontributing to the 1991 contamination, as we discuss below.\r\n\n          Sun's second attack on  the sufficiency of the evidence\r\n\nfocuses on  the soil.  In  the face of the  uncontested fact that\r\n\nthe 1974  spillage  was subsurface,  due to  a leaky  underground\r\n\npump, Sun contends that  no evidence was presented that  the soil\r\n\nwas contaminated  by Sun, or  that Sun's  failure to clean  up or\r\n\nremove soil was wrongful.  In support of its  position, Sun lists\r\n\nfour  pieces of  evidence regarding  soil testing.   Firstly,  it\r\n\nnotes  that  soil  samples  taken  in  1992  by  consultants were\r\n\nspoiled,  and never analyzed.   While it is  unfortunate that the\r\n\nsamples were not  analyzed, that fact simply shows we do not have\r\n\nall possible information:  it does not shed any light, one way or\r\n\nthe  other, on whether  the 1974 spillage  contaminated the soil.\r\n\nSecondly, Sun points out  that in 1979, Getty Oil  commissioned a\r\n\ncompany to dig around the fill area above  the storage tanks, and\r\n\nthat  the company never said anything to Damon about contaminated\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nsoil, but rather stated  that the area  was clean.  However,  Sun\r\n\npoints  to  no  evidence that  the  company  was asked  to  do an\r\n\nexamination  of the soil for  contamination:  it  was testing the\r\n\ntanks for  tightness.   Thus, the  third  fact Sun  looks to  for\r\n\nsupport, that Cataldo's environmental company found contamination\r\n\nin 1992 around  the same fill pipes that Getty  Oil, in 1980, had\r\n\ntold Damon  were clean, is not  as conclusive as  Sun would like.\r\n\nSet against  the Getty  results is Cataldo's  testimony that  the\r\n\n1974 release was a contributing factor in the 1991 contamination.\r\n\nFinally, Sun notes that Cataldo testified that there was not much\r\n\nthickness of soil, such that \"flushing\" of the soil by rising and\r\n\nfalling subsurface  groundwater elevations would  tend to  reduce\r\n\nany residual contamination.  However, Cataldo also testified that\r\n\nthe on-site testing he conducted  in four monitoring wells  found\r\n\nvolatile  organic compounds  (\"VOCs\") which  are constituents  of\r\n\ngasoline  in the groundwater.  The constituents found in 1991, he\r\n\nstated, were  similar to those of the 1974 release.  As he stated\r\n\nin his testimony:\r\n\n               Q.  .   .  .  .  And   based  on  your\r\n            examination of the underground conditions\r\n            at that [property] and the geology of the\r\n            [property],    and    based   upon    the\r\n            information of this 2,000 gallon spill in\r\n            1974,  would you expect  to find  VOCs in\r\n            the  areas where  you  did  find them  in\r\n            1992?\r\n               A.  Yes, I would.\r\n               Q.  Is the presence of VOCs consistent\r\n            with the  topography and geology  of that\r\n            [property] and a spill in 1974?\r\n               A.  Yes, it is.\r\n\n(Day 2, page 76).  On this  record, we find that the evidence was\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nsufficient to find causation.   The evidence to which  Sun points\r\n\ndoes not convince us otherwise, let alone that the district court\r\n\nclearly erred in making its finding.  \r\n\n          Sun's  third and  final argument  that the  evidence is\r\n\ninsufficient to  find causation focuses  on Cataldo's  testimony.\r\n\nIt is  fundamental that \"[e]xpert testimony must be predicated on\r\n\nfacts  legally  sufficient to  provide a  basis for  the expert's\r\n\nopinion.  \"  In  re Salvatore,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  253 (D.R.I.  1984).\r                                       \r\n\nThus, \"[a]n expert  should not  be permitted to  give an  opinion\r\n\nthat is  based on conjecture or speculation  from an insufficient\r\n\nevidentiary foundation.\"   Van  Brode Group,  Inc. v.

App.  Ct. 1994).   Cataldo's\r               \r\n\ntestimony, Sun contends,  did not meet  this criteria.   Although\r\n\nCataldo testified that the 1974 spill was  a \"substantial factor\"\r\n\nin the 1991 contamination,  Sun argues that its cross-examination\r\n\nof  Cataldo  revealed  that he  had  no  factual  basis for  that\r\n\nconclusion:  indeed, he testified at one point that  he could not\r\n\nsay that the 1974 spill was \"more probably than not\" the cause of\r\n\nthe 1991 contamination.  \r\n\n          Sun points to a series  of perceived flaws in Cataldo's\r\n\ntestimony.   First, Cataldo attested that  although methods exist\r\n\nwhich would  quantify the  amount of  contaminants found in  1992\r\n\nwhich  were  representative  of   the  1974  release,  none  were\r\n\nperformed here.  He agreed that he did not know how much gas  was\r\n\nleft on the property after the 1974 release, and that none of the\r\n\nwork  performed by his  firm had to  do with aging  or dating the\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\npetroleum product found on  the property.   Nor did they test  to\r\n\ndetermine what percentage of  the gas found in 1991 was 1974 gas.\r\n\nAfter admitting that the ratios of the BTEX chemical constituents\r\n\nwere indicative of a more recent -- post-1980 -- release, Cataldo\r\n\ntestified that he could not  say \"one way or the other\"  that the\r\n\ngasoline constituents encountered in 1992 were more probably than\r\n\nnot  the result  of the 1974  release.  Thus,  Sun maintains, the\r\n\nbest Cataldo could testify to at  trial was that the property was\r\n\ninsufficiently investigated to allow him  to come to any ultimate\r\n\nconclusions concerning the  contaminate sources;  that since  the\r\n\n1974  release was the only  known release, it  at least partially\r\n\ncaused  the  1991 contamination;  and that  there  was no  way of\r\n\napportioning what amounts, if any, of the 1991 contamination were\r\n\nattributable to  Sun  based on  the  work  done to  date.    This\r\n\nopinion, Sun concludes, is insufficient as a matter of law.  \r\n\n          We  disagree.   The  issue is  not whether  Cataldo was\r\n\nright:  but, rather, whether he had sufficient factual grounds on\r\n\nwhich to draw conclusions.  See Van Brode Group, Inc., 633 N.E.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 430.   On the basis  of our review of the  record, we conclude\r\n\nthat Cataldo's  expert testimony was predicated  on facts legally\r\n\nsufficient to provide a basis for  his conclusions.  There is  no\r\n\ndoubt that more  testing could  have been done  on the  property,\r\n\nwhich  would  have  been  helpful to  the  factfinder.   However,\r\n\nCataldo  noted that  although  there are  methods  to attempt  to\r\n\nquantify  the amount of contaminants dating back to 1974, he does\r\n\nnot know \"if there's anything that really can say, yes or no, how\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nmuch  there is.\"  (Day 2, page  133).  He drew his conclusions on\r\n\nthe basis of his \"experience with dealing with gasoline stations,\r\n\nresidual  contamination,  [and]  the  knowledge   that  the  only\r\n\nsignificant or large release at the [property] was reportedly the\r\n\n2,000 gallons in 1974.\"   (Day 2, page 71).  He and his personnel\r\n\nvisited the  property, investigated its history,  and made tests,\r\n\nfrom which he drew  his conclusions.  His testimony  reflects his\r\n\nresearch:  asked  how gas spilled in 1974 could  still be present\r\n\nin 1992, he stated,\r\n\n               A.   Because  the  gasoline  tends  to\r\n            absorb and holds in  to some of the soil.\r\n            It  also fills up  the pores  between the\r\n            soil  and   clings  in  to  that.     The\r\n            [property]  was paved,  so  that all  the\r\n            rain  that  falls  in it  doesn't  get  a\r\n            chance to percolate through, so you don't\r\n            have that complete  flushing action  that\r\n            you would in an open field.   Most of the\r\n            rainwater  probably  channeled  off,  and\r\n            that's one  of the purposes  of blacktop.\r\n            So it's my opinion that there would still\r\n            be   some   remnants   of  the   gasoline\r\n            remaining.\r\n\n(Day 2, page 87).  He later noted that biodegradation alone would\r\n\nnot have removed contamination of the scale of 2,000 gallons over\r\n\n18  years, and that  there had  been a  reported release  of four\r\n\ngallons subsequent to 1980, which would  be sufficient to account\r\n\nfor the levels of MTBE  found.  As the district court  noted, his\r\n\nattribution of the contamination,  at least in part, to  the 1974\r\n\ncontamination,  \"has an  additional  earmark  of  trustworthiness\r\n\nbecause it was prepared for a third-party, Rooney, pursuant to an\r\n\norder of  the DEP,  and not  in any way  in anticipation  of this\r\n\nlitigation.\"  (District Court Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nLaw, at 11).

We disregard this argument, for two reasons.\r\n\nFirst,  in  Providence &amp;  Worcester,  although the  SJC  found it\r                                             \r\n\nsignificant that  the  railroad's expert  did not  testify as  to\r\n\ncausation, the  court specifically noted  that it \"[did]  not say\r\n\nthat expert testimony is required to establish causation in every\r\n\nsoil contamination case.\"   622  N.E.2d at 264  (noting that  the\r\n\nsubject \"is not one  that jurors would be expected  to understand\r\n\nin many circumstances without guidance from an expert\").  We will\r\n\nnot  create  such  a requirement  here.    Second,  even if  that\r\n\nrequirement  existed, plaintiff  met it.  Cataldo  explicitly, if\r\n\nreluctantly,  testified that  the 1974  spill was  \"a substantial\r\n\nfactor\"  in  the  contamination  detected  in  1991, a  fact  the\r\n\ndistrict court noted twice  in its finding of causation.  In sum,\r\n\nthen,  we find that  the district  court did  not clearly  err in\r\n\nfinding  that  Sun's acts  were a  substantial  cause of  the DEP\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\ndecision that  contamination sufficient to trigger  21E liability\r\n\nexisted at the property.  \r\n\n          We note  that the district court's  task of determining\r\n\ncausation  on  this record  was not  an  easy one.   Nonetheless,\r\n\n\"[w]hen   the  evidence  supports   conflicting  inferences,  the\r\n\ndistrict court's choice from  among the several inferences cannot\r\n\nbe clearly erroneous.\"  Dedham Water Co., 972 F.2d at  462.  Thus\r                                                  \r\n\nwe  uphold the district court, and reject Sun's argument that the\r\n\nevidence upon which the district court relied is insufficient.  \r\n\n               C.  Damages and the Burden of Proof\r                         C.  Damages and the Burden of Proof\r                                                            \r\n\n          The  parties  dispute  who  bore the  burden  of  proof\r\n\nregarding  whether the harm was divisible.  The backdrop to their\r\n\ndialogue is the fact that the evidence indicates that Sun was not\r\n\nthe only  owner or operator of the property whose acts led to the\r\n\n1991 contamination.  As  the district court stated, the  presence\r\n\nof  MTBE  \"compel(s)  the  conclusion  that   there  had  been  a\r\n\nwidespread release of gasoline at the [property] after 1984, when\r\n\nMTBE  became  common.\"   (District  Court  Findings of  Fact  and\r\n\nConclusions of Law, at 10).  Thus, there was at least one release\r\n\nof  gasoline  when the  property was  operated  by Rooney  or the\r\n\nplaintiffs.   The Damons concede  that the evidence  and findings\r\n\nindicate that there was a post-1980 release  of gasoline.  At the\r\n\nsame  time, there  was no  evidence  of a  spill greater  than 10\r\n\ngallons, and  the district  court specifically found  that during\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nthe time  the Damons  owned  the property,  no significant  leaks\r\n\noccurred.1\r\n\n          The  Damons bear  the burden  of proving  that tortious\r\n\nconduct by Sun caused  them harm.  See Restatement  (2d) of Torts\r                                                \r\n\n  433B(1).  They  were required  to produce evidence  that it  is\r\n\nmore  likely than not that Sun's conduct was a substantial factor\r\n\nin bringing  about the  harm they  suffered.  See  id. comment  a\r                                                                \r\n\n(noting that  \"[a]  mere possibility  of  such causation  is  not\r\n\nenough\").   Sun argues that the Damons  did not meet their burden\r\n\nof showing that Sun's conduct substantially caused the harm  they\r\n\nsuffered.   Accordingly, it maintains, the  burden of identifying\r\n\nwhat  other  actors were  also responsible  for  the harm  and of\r\n\nallocating the harm (or showing that it was indivisible) remained\r\n\nwith the plaintiffs, who did not fulfill that  task.  However, we\r\n\nhave already  established above that  the district court  did not\r\n\nerr in finding that  Sun's conduct substantially caused  the harm\r\n\nthe  Damons suffered.  Therefore,  the burden shifted  to Sun, as\r\n\ndid the cost of not  meeting it.  See Restatement (2d) of Torts  \r                                               \r\n\n433B(2)  (\"Where the tortious conduct  of two or  more actors has\r\n\ncombined to bring about harm to the plaintiff, and one or more of\r\n\nthe actors seeks  to limit his liability  on the ground  that the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Sun  argues that  the district  court's factual  findings are\r\ninconsistent.  We disagree:  the evidence at trial indicated that\r\na spill as small as four  gallons could account for the amount of\r\nMTBE  present, and that Cataldo's research found no record of any\r\nspills over ten  gallons.   The evidence leads  to the  inference\r\nthat a  spill made  up of  less than ten  gallons, but  which was\r\nnonetheless spread  out (or  several such spills),  could account\r\nfor the MTBE found. \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nharm  is capable of apportionment among them, the burden of proof\r\n\nas  to the  apportionment is  upon each  such actor.\");  see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nO'Neil v.

I mean, what else is there?\"\r\n\n(District Court Findings  of Fact  and Conclusions of  Law, at  7\r\n\nn.1). Sun contends that  there is no evidentiary basis for such a\r\n\nfinding.   Seeking support,  it points  to  the district  court's\r\n\nstatement during closing arguments that\r\n\n            the testimony that [Damon] had, that they\r\n            told him  it was  a good station,  is not\r\n            significant  in  my  view because  that's\r\n            absolutely  an  opinion  rather   than  a\r\n            statement of fact.\r\n\n(Day 4,  page 15), and contends  that by making this  comment the\r\n\ndistrict court essentially conceded that there was no evidentiary\r\n\nbasis  to  find that  the statements  by  the Sun  employees were\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nopinion.  To the contrary, all this statement reveals is that the\r\n\ndistrict court changed  its mind  as to the  significance of  the\r\n\nstatements,  which  is  certainly  within  its  province  to  do.\r\n\nIndeed,  that is  the  very mission  of  closing arguments:    to\r\n\nconvince  the  factfinder that  a party's  view  of the  facts is\r\n\ncorrect. \r\n\n          Similarly,   that   Damon's    testimony   about    the\r\n\nconversations could be viewed as inconsistent, as Sun notes, is a\r\n\nquestion  that addresses  Damon's credibility,  not the  district\r\n\ncourt's finding.   Credibility, of  course, is an  issue for  the\r\n\nfactfinder, and Sun has  shown us no clear error in  the district\r\n\ncourt's judgment on the  matter.  See  O'Brien, 780 F.2d at  1076\r                                                        \r\n\n(\"No subject matter is more clearly within the exclusive province\r\n\nof the fact-finder than this.\").\r\n\n          Our  review of  the  record  leads  us  to  affirm  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's finding  that  the statements  were factual  in\r\n\nnature.   First, we note that the evidence supports the findings.\r\n\nThe  court found  that Damon  asked Bunzell  if  Sun had  had any\r\n\nproblems  with the  underground storage  tanks, to  which Bunzell\r\n\nresponded that Sun had had \"no problems with it.  It's all good.\"\r\n\n(District Court Findings of  Fact and Conclusions of Law,  at 5).\r\n\nThis is consistent  with Damon's testimony  at trial.   Bunzell's\r\n\ntestimony  did  not  contradict  him,  since  he  stated  in  his\r\n\naffidavit, entered  at trial, that he neither remembered the sale\r\n\nof the property nor recalled any discussion of it or the terms of\r\n\nthe  sale.  The district court also found that although Laubinger\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nknew about the  1974 spill -- indeed, he  visited the property at\r\n\nthe time -- he did not reveal the information to Damon.  Instead,\r\n\nhe  responded to  Damon's  questions about  whether  Sun had  any\r\n\nproblems with  the  station, particularly  with  the  underground\r\n\ntanks, by stating \"that it was a 'good station' which just needed\r\n\nto be run by a good  operator to be successful.\"  (District Court\r\n\nFindings  of Fact  and  Conclusions  of Law,  at  5).   This  was\r\n\nconsistent with Damon's testimony  at trial.  Laubinger testified\r\n\nthat he did not recall having a telephone conversation with Damon\r\n\nor  ever not telling anyone  about the release  in discussing the\r\n\nproperty, and the  trial court  was free to  credit Damon's  more\r\n\nspecific recollection.  \r\n\n          Next, in discussing  whether the Bunzell  and Laubinger\r\n\nstatements were opinions or fact,  the district court noted  that\r\n\nDamon's questions were not  just about the current conditions  on\r\n\nthe  property.  If they had been,  their statements that it was a\r\n\ngood station  would presumably  have been opinion.   Rather,  the\r\n\ndistrict court specified that the  questions also went to whether\r\n\nthere had been problems in the station in the past of which Damon\r\n\nshould be  aware, with  the underground  tanks specifically.   In\r\n\nthat context, reading the  record in the light most  favorable to\r\n\nthe  Damons,  we do  not find  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\nfinding  that the Sun  representatives' statements that  it was a\r\n\n\"good station\" were factual.  Indeed, we are hard put to see how,\r\n\nwhere there has been a spill of 2,000 gallons in  1974, which Sun\r\n\nknew of, statements five years later that it was a \"good station\"\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nand that Sun had had \"no problems with it\" in reply to a question\r\n\nregarding  the underground  tanks are  not misrepresentations  of\r\n\nfact.\r\n\n              B.  Evidence of the Elements of Fraud\r                        B.  Evidence of the Elements of Fraud\r                                                             \r\n\n          Sun's second contention is  that the record contains no\r\n\nevidence  of the key elements needed  to prove fraud.  First, Sun\r\n\nasserts that the  statements by  Bunzell and  Laubinger were  not\r\n\nmisrepresentations of material facts,  and thus the first element\r\n\nof the  tort has not been  shown.  See Barret  Assocs., Inc., 190\r                                                                      \r\n\nN.E.2d at 868 (noting  that the first element is  that \"defendant\r\n\nmade a false representation of a material fact\").  We   disagree.\r\n\nThere can be no doubt that the statements were misrepresentations\r\n\nin terms of the past history of the property:  stating that it is\r\n\na \"good station\" ignores the  fact that there was a 2,000  gallon\r\n\nspill.   It may have  been a \"good  station\" in 1979,  from Sun's\r\n\nperspective:   the spill had  been cleaned up  in accordance with\r\n\nthe  requirements of the time, and  there is no evidence of other\r\n\nproblems.  Nonetheless, there had been a problem in the past, and\r\n\nto omit that  was to  misrepresent the situation.   The  district\r\n\ncourt found that  the fact was  material, as it gave  credence to\r\n\nDamon's  testimony that  his  affiliation with  a car  dealership\r\n\nwhich sold gasoline gave  him a general awareness of  the growing\r\n\nimportance  of environmental issues,  and that he  would not have\r\n\nbought the  station had he  been aware of  the spill.   Thus, the\r\n\nstatements by the Sun representatives were certainly \"'one of the\r\n\nprincipal grounds,  though not necessarily the  sole ground, that\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\ncaused the  plaintiff[s] \"to take the particular  action that the\r\n\nwrongdoer  intended   he  would   take  as   a  result   of  such\r\n\nrepresentations.\"'\"   Bond Leather Co., 764  F.2d at 936 (quoting\r                                                \r\n\nNational  Car Rental Sys., Inc. v.

While this  testimony is\r                 \r\n\nundoubtedly in Damon's interest, the district court's credence in\r\n\nthat testimony has not been  shown to be in error.

Concerning  that aspect  of  the\r\n            land's    character,   their    affidavit\r\n            discloses,  the  Maloneys made  their own\r\n            examination.\r\n\nId. at 301.\r             \r\n\n          Clearly,  Maloney is  distinguishable from  the present\r                                     \r\n\ncase.  There, the buyer specified in the  agreement that it would\r\n\nmake the  tests, and did  so.   A district court  had found  that\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nthere was no evidence Sargisson knew or should have known of  the\r\n\nexistence of the problem, a finding which carried weight as prima\r\n\nfacie  evidence in the superior  court and was  not questioned by\r\n\nthe  Appeals Court.   Id. at  300.   There is  no indication that\r                                   \r\n\nSargisson made a  representation as  to the status  of the  soil:\r\n\nrather, it is clear that the Maloneys relied on  their own tests.\r\n\nHere, the questions went to the past history of the property, not\r\n\njust the present condition.

Specifically,  it argues  that it\r\n\nshould  be   provided  with  an  explanation  of  why  the  court\r\n\n\"disregarded the  uncontroverted testimony of Mr.  Damon that the\r\n\nstation,  the underground tanks, and the soil was '100% clean' in\r\n\n1980  when Getty  examined the  station.\" (Appellant's  Brief, at\r\n\n40).   Sun's phrasing twists the testimony:  Damon testified that\r\n\nGetty told  him the  soil was clean,  not that  he knew it  to be\r\n\ntrue.    As we  have  already  noted, Sun  has  not provided  any\r\n\nevidence that Getty was  in fact testing the soil:   the district\r\n\ncourt  specifically found that  Getty was  testing the  tanks for\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Two of  Sun's contentions, that the district  court's findings\r\nare insufficient as to intent  and reliance, and that it did  not\r\nadequately address the factual  basis for Cataldo's exert opinion\r\non the property's condition, have been addressed elsewhere in the\r\nopinion.\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\ntightness.   The district  court stated during  closing arguments\r\n\nthat it also did  not consider that Damon  had made an  admission\r\n\nthat the property was clean.  \r\n\n          Sun  also argues that the  court had to  explain why it\r\n\nchose the \"version\" of his story  Damon told at trial, instead of\r\n\nwhat it  deems \"varying\" earlier versions  under oath, especially\r\n\nas regards what questions he put to the Sun representatives.  Our\r\n\nreview  of the record does not indicate that Damon's testimony at\r\n\ntrial  was  so inconsistent  with  his  earlier testimony  as  to\r\n\nconstitute \"'unsupported self-serving testimony that flies in the\r\n\nteeth  of  unimpeachable  contradicting  evidence  and  universal\r\n\nexperience.'\"  Venturelli, 850 F.2d at 833 (quoting Insurance Co.\r                                                                           \r\n\nof North  Am. v.

The district court met its burden here.  \r\n\n                      CALCULATION OF DAMAGES\r                                CALCULATION OF DAMAGES\r\n\n          The district court calculated  the damages for the tort\r\n\nclaim as $245,000, the difference between the actual value of the\r\n\nDamon's property if it  was uncontaminated -- $600,000 --  as the\r\n\ndefendant's representatives  stated and  the actual value  of the\r\n\nproperty as  contaminated  -- $325,000  -- as  measured when  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  sold the property to  Rooney in 1992.7   Sun does not\r\n\ncontest the  district court's basic measurement,  but argues that\r\n\nit should  have  set off  specific  monies against  the  purchase\r\n\nprice, and  should have accounted  for the Damons'  obligation to\r\n\nmitigate damages.  We disagree, for the following reasons.  \r\n\n          First, Sun  contends the value of  the indemnity Rooney\r\n\ngave  the Damons  from and  against all  environmental liability,\r\n\nwhich it suggests is approximately $104,000, should have been set\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7    Adopting  the  sale  price  suggested  by  Rooney's gasoline\r\nsupplier, the district court  found the fair market value  of the\r\nproperty if it had been not been contaminated to be $600,000.  It\r\ntook the actual  sale price as  the measure of  the value of  the\r\nproperty as  contaminated:  Rooney  assumed the  $325,000 of  the\r\nDamons'  first and second mortgages, $10,000 in arrears, and made\r\na $20,000 cash payment, for a total of $355,000.\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\noff against the  purchase price.   However, as  the Damons  point\r\n\nout,  if Sun had not made the misrepresentation, the Damons would\r\n\nnot be responsible to clean up  the mess.  Had the Damons cleaned\r\n\nup   the  property   themselves,  they   would  be   entitled  to\r\n\nreimbursement, and,  presumably, the  sale price of  the property\r\n\nwould have been higher:  reducing the damages by the value of the\r\n\nindemnity  would virtually  reverse  this process.   Second,  Sun\r\n\nargues that $40,000 should be taken off the damage figure, as the\r\n\nDamons did not give Rooney $40,000, as they were required  to per\r\n\ntheir  agreement, to  defray costs of  contamination.   Again, if\r\n\nSun's  representatives  had  not  misrepresented  the  property's\r\n\ncondition, the Damons would  not have owed that money  to Rooney;\r\n\nif they had paid  it to Rooney, it would have  been added to, not\r\n\noffset against, the damages (and presumably would be reflected in\r\n\nthe actual sale price).   Third, Sun argues that  $29,000 in back\r\n\nrent  from  Rooney should  have been  offset  as well,  since the\r\n\nDamons  did not  seek  it from  him.   However,  once again,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs   would  not   have  lost   that  money   without  the\r\n\nmisrepresentation.    Also,  according  to  paragraph  9  of  the\r\n\nAgreement and Lease, Rooney was entitled to opt out of  his lease\r\n\nif a governmental authority prevented him from occupying or using\r\n\nthe property as  a gasoline station.   Thus,  it is unclear  that\r\n\nRooney did, in fact, owe the past rent.\r\n\n          Sun  also argues  that  the Damons  failed to  mitigate\r\n\ntheir  losses by not seeking back rent  from Rooney.  In light of\r\n\nthe  terms  of the  Agreement and  Lease  between Rooney  and the\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\nDamons, the fact  that the  Damons were obligated  to pay  Rooney\r\n\n$40,000,  which  they did  not, and  the  subsequent sale  of the\r\n\nproperty, we are hard put to accept their reasoning.\r\n\n          For   the   above   reasons,   the   district   court's\r\n\ndetermination of damages is affirmed.\r\n\n                        CHAPTER 93A CLAIMS\r                                  CHAPTER 93A CLAIMS\r\n\n          The  district  court  found  that  Sun's  actions  were\r\n\n\"unfair  or deceptive\"  and thus  violated Massachusetts  General\r\n\nLaws chapter 93A, section 11.   At the same time, the lower court\r\n\nrefused  to award multiple damages under section 11, on the basis\r\n\nthat  \"the evidence  of bad  faith or  willful intent  to deceive\r\n\n[was]  insufficient to merit a punitive  award.\"  (District Court\r\n\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, at 12).

Sun argues on appeal  that the court erred in finding\r\n\nit  violated chapter 93A, while the Damons contend that the court\r\n\nerred in  refusing multiple damages.   For the  reasons discussed\r\n\nbelow, we affirm the district court's finding that Sun was liable\r\n\nunder chapter 93A, as well as its refusal of multiple damages.\r\n\n              A.

As we  have already  affirmed the district  court's\r                     \r\n\nfinding of misrepresentation, it is manifest that Sun's acts sink\r\n\nbelow the  level  of  \"simply neglecting  to  discuss\"  the  1974\r\n\ncontamination.  Winter Panel offers Sun no relief.\r                                      \r\n\n          Sun's  primary argument  against  the district  court's\r\n\nholding blurs the line between section  11 liability and multiple\r\n\ndamages.10   Specifically,  it contends  that since  the district\r\n\ncourt apparently found Sun's conduct was not willful and knowing,\r\n\nSun cannot have engaged in common law fraud.  Since  it could not\r\n\nhave engaged in fraud, it concludes, its  conduct did not rise to\r\n\nthe level  of intentional  misconduct, beyond mere  negligence or\r\n\ninadvertence, that section 11 demands.  \r\n\n          We  disagree.    As  noted above,  the  district  court\r\n\nrefused to award multiple damages here on the basis that \r\n\n            [m]ultiple damages are not  mandated when\r\n            misrepresentation occurs.   Only \"callous\r\n            and   intentional   violations\"   deserve\r\n            multiple  damages  treatment.    In  this\r\n            instance, we believe  the evidence of bad\r\n            faith or  willful  intent to  deceive  is\r\n            insufficient to merit a punitive award of\r\n            multiple damages.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10   Sun also  makes the  circular argument  that if  its conduct\r\namounts  to  negligence,  it  has  not  met  the  requirement  of\r\nrascality needed for  section 11, since negligence  cannot be the\r\nbasis  for a section 11  violation.  To  the contrary, negligence\r\ncan provide the basis for chapter 93A liability, so long as it is\r\npaired with an unfair  or deceptive act or  practice -- in  other\r\nwords, negligence  plus rascality equals liability.

We understand  the  district court  opinion as\r\n\nindicating that  there  was evidence  of  bad faith  and  willful\r\n\nintent  to deceive, but that  some quantum of  knowing or willful\r\n\nviolation  must be  met before  a party  is entitled  to punitive\r\n\ndamages  under chapter  93A.

Our\r                                                 \r\n\nreading is consistent with  the district court's specific finding\r\n\nthat  when  Damon  asked Laubinger  if  Sun  had  experienced any\r\n\nproblems  with  the  station  and  underground  tanks,  Laubinger\r\n\nreplied  that it was a  \"good station,\" despite  his knowledge of\r\n\nthe  1974 contamination.

Nonetheless, we  do not\r               \r\n\nhesitate in refusing the Damons' argument.   First, we note  that\r\n\nsection 9 is  by its terms  inapplicable to transactions  between\r\n\npersons engaged in business, and section 11 quite simply does not\r\n\ninclude  language   acting  as  a  counterpart   to  section  9's\r\n\nrequirement of multiple  damages where  a party does  not make  a\r\n\nwritten tender  of settlement.

Thus, even if we were to weigh Sun's failure to tender\r\n\nan  offer into our analysis, the Damons' challenge to the court's\r\n\ndamage award would fail.\r\n\n          Our  decision  today  does  not clash  with  the  SJC's\r\n\ndecision in International Fidelity  Ins.

There,  the SJC  weighed the goal  of promoting\r\n\nreasonable  settlements in both sections 9 and 11, and found that\r\n\nit would  be appropriate to impose  independent liability against\r\n\nthe multiple defendants  in that case, as to do  so would promote\r\n\nsettlements.  443 N.E.2d at 1318.
