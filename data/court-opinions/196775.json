We   affirm  the  judgments   in  these\r                            \r\r\n\nconsolidated appeals substantially for the reasons recited by\r\n\nthe district court.  We add only the following comments. \r\n\n     1.  The Government of Taiwan  is amenable to suit in the\r\n\nUnited  States only  in  accordance  with  the terms  of  the\r\n\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1602-11.   See,  e.g.,  Millen Indus.,  Inc. v.  Coordination\r                                                                         \r\n\nCouncil  for North American Affairs,  855 F.2d 879, 883 (D.C.\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1988)  (\"all  laws,  including  the  FSIA,  [that  are]\r\n\napplicable to  nations also apply to  Taiwan\"); see generally\r                                                                         \r\n\nArgentine Republic  v. Amerada Hess Shipping  Corp., 488 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n428,  443 (1989) (FSIA \"provides the sole basis for obtaining\r\n\njurisdiction  over a  foreign  state in  the  courts of  this\r\n\ncountry\").  Plaintiff is mistaken in arguing that the  FSIA's\r\n\napplicability  to Taiwan  is  affected by     4(b)(7) of  the\r\n\nTaiwan Relations Act, 22  U.S.C.   3303(b)(7), which provides\r\n\nsimply that the  capacity of Taiwan \"to  sue and be  sued\" in\r\n\nUnited  States  courts  is  not altered  \"by  the  absence of\r\n\ndiplomatic relations or recognition.\"  His further suggestion\r\n\nthat Taiwan's amenability to suit is  affected by the Torture\r\n\nVictim Protection Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-256, 106 Stat.\r\n\n73  (set  forth  in note  following  28  U.S.C.    1350),  is\r\n\nlikewise misplaced. \r\n\n     2.    For the  reasons  enumerated  in Saudi  Arabia  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nNelson, 507  U.S. 349  (1993), plaintiff's attempt  to invoke\r                  \r\n\nthe  \"commercial  activity\"  exception  to  the  FSIA  proves\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nunavailing.  In particular, because  the governmental conduct\r\n\nof which  he complains  is \"peculiarly sovereign  in nature,\"\r\n\nid. at 361,  his action cannot be regarded as  one \"based ...\r               \r\n\nupon an act  outside the  territory of the  United States  in\r\n\nconnection with  a commercial  activity of the  foreign state\r\n\nelsewhere ....\"  28 U.S.C.   1605(a)(2).  \r\n\n     3.   Finally, we reject the  procedural objection voiced\r\n\nby  plaintiff in  Nos.  95-1573 &amp;  95-1629.   Inasmuch  as  a\r\n\nfrivolous complaint can properly be dismissed under 28 U.S.C.\r\n\n   1915(d) on  a  sua sponte  basis,  see, e.g.,  Neitzke  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nWilliams,  490 U.S. 319, 324,  330 (1989), the  court did not\r                    \r\n\nerr in dismissing  these actions in advance  of its indicated\r\n\ntwenty-day deadline.  Plaintiff, we note, has made no  effort\r\n\nto  buttress  his substantive  arguments  in  this regard  on\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
