Shane Devine, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              Kravitch, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Gordon R. Blakeney, Jr. for appellant.\r\n   Peter E. Papps, First Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJune 17, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Scott N. Rogers appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's denial of his motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2255 to vacate his sentence and set aside his conviction. The\r\ncourt held that his motion was untimely under the limitations\r\nperiod imposed in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\r\nof 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24,\r\n1996), which allows prisoners one year from the date on which their\r\nconvictions became final to file motions under  2255. As\r\ninterpreted by the district court (following the model of several\r\nother circuit courts of appeals), AEDPA allows prisoners such as\r\nRogers whose convictions became final before AEDPA's effective date\r\nto file motions under  2255 within one year of that date.\r\nNonetheless, even on this standard, the court held that Rogers'\r\nmotion was untimely. Rogers therefore challenges on appeal the\r\nvalidity of this interpretation of AEDPA, allowing filing only\r\nwithin a one year \"grace period\" from AEDPA's effective date.\r\nPrior to denial of the original  2255 motion, Rogers had\r\nmoved to amend it by adding a claim based on newly discovered facts\r\nregarding the execution of his sentence. The court denied this\r\nmotion to amend as moot in light of its denial of the original\r\n2255 motion. Rogers then moved to have the court reconsider the\r\ntimeliness issue as to the new claims on the basis that the motion\r\nto amend was filed within one year of Rogers' discovery of new\r\nfacts. The district court denied the motion. Rogers contests this\r\ndecision as well on appeal. The district court issued a certificate\r\nof appealability limited to the sentencing issues. We ordered\r\nbriefing on all issues, and now affirm.\r\nI. Background\r\nOn April 4, 1989, Manchester, New Hampshire police\r\narrested Scott N. Rogers, a convicted felon who had escaped from\r\nthe New Hampshire House of Corrections in January of that year. At\r\nthe time of his capture, Rogers was in constructive possession of\r\na handgun. Rogers was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury\r\nas a convicted felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C.\r\n922(g)(1), and was convicted on May 20, 1990 after a jury trial.\r\nHe was sentenced on July 16, 1990 to a mandatory fifteen year\r\nsentence as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C.  924(e)(1).\r\nThroughout the federal proceedings, Rogers was housed in the New\r\nHampshire State Prison. The district court's 1990 judgment has no\r\nentry in the space reserved for \"recommendations to the Bureau of\r\nPrisons,\" and there is no record that the district court either\r\nordered or recommended that the New Hampshire State Prison should\r\nbe the place of confinement for Rogers' federal sentence. There is\r\nalso no indication of the court's intent as to whether the federal\r\nsentence should run concurrently with any future sentences for\r\nrelated pending state charges. The district court's judgment and\r\nsentence indicates that Rogers was \"remanded to the custody of the\r\nUnited States Marshal,\" but according to the terms of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus ad prosequendum, Rogers was to be returned to the\r\nwarden of the New Hampshire State Prison upon completion of the\r\nfederal court proceedings. The record does not indicate that Rogers\r\nwas transferred to federal prison at any point.\r\nRogers' prosecution on related state charges followed.\r\nThrough new counsel, Rogers pleaded guilty to all remaining state\r\nfelony charges on August 8, 1990. According to the records of the\r\nCounty Attorney, the New Hampshire Superior Court Judge had\r\nindicated to the parties prior to the plea agreement that, in light\r\nof the long federal sentence, he would not give any \"consecutive\r\ntime\" - that is, he would not sentence Rogers to any time to be\r\nserved after the federal sentence. Accordingly, the parties agreed\r\nthat Rogers' sentences for eight of his nine state felony charges\r\nshould run concurrent to each other and to the federal sentence.\r\nRogers was thus sentenced to 3 to 7 years imprisonment on each of\r\nfour of the state felony counts and 7 to 15 years imprisonment on\r\neach of the other four; all these sentences were to run concurrent\r\nto each other and to the federal sentence. Finally, Rogers received\r\na suspended sentence of 7 to 15 years for the remaining charge of\r\ntheft of a firearm. This suspended sentence was to run consecutive\r\nto the 15 year federal sentence. Following these state convictions,\r\nRogers continued to be confined in the New Hampshire State Prison.\r\nRogers filed a timely notice of appeal from the federal\r\nconvictions, but direct appeal was stayed to allow Rogers to\r\nconsider the merits of filing a  2255 motion (on ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel grounds). Although successor counsel was\r\nappointed, a  2255 motion was never filed. We lifted the stay on\r\nFebruary 18, 1994 and Rogers proceeded with his direct appeal\r\nbefore this court. We affirmed the federal conviction on December\r\n8, 1994, see United States v. Rogers, 41 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 1994),\r\nand Rogers' sentence became final with the Supreme Court's denial\r\nof certiorari on June 5, 1995. See 515 U.S. 1126 (June 5, 1995).\r\nAfter another long delay following the denial of\r\ncertiorari, Rogers filed a  2255 motion in the district court on\r\nJune 16, 1997. This motion, predicated entirely on ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel grounds, sought to have the sentence vacated\r\nand the conviction set aside. The government filed a motion to\r\ndismiss the  2255 motion as untimely. On May 7, 1998, Rogers filed\r\na motion to amend the  2255 motion (hereinafter the \"Motion to\r\nAmend\") by adding a request \"to Correct Sentence Nunc Pro Tunc to\r\nEffect Concurrent Running of Sentences by Ordering, or in the\r\nAlternative by Recommending, Designation of State Facility as Place\r\nof Confinement for Federal Sentence.\" On May 13, 1998, the district\r\ncourt denied the original  2255 motion as untimely in light of the\r\nprevailing judicial interpretation of the AEDPA and denied as moot\r\nall other pending motions. Rogers then filed a \"Motion to Alter or\r\nAmend Judgment under Rule 59(e) or Alternatively for Partial Relief\r\nfrom Judgment under Rule 60(b).\" Dkt. 21, May 26, 1998. He argued\r\nin his motion that the May 7th Motion to Amend derived \"from facts\r\narising within the one-year statute of limitations imposed by the\r\n[AEDPA].\" Section 2255 provides:\r\n  A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a\r\nmotion under this section. The limitation\r\nperiod shall run from the latest of \r\n                           * * *\r\n  (4) the date on which the facts supporting the\r\nclaim or claims presented could have been\r\ndiscovered through the exercise of due\r\ndiligence.\r\n\nRogers claimed that he had \"newly discovered\" that federal\r\nauthorities intended that his federal sentence should begin running\r\nupon completion of his state sentence, i.e. consecutively to the\r\nstate sentences. Since the government had not filed a responsive\r\npleading, Rogers maintained he had a right to amend the  2255\r\nmotion \"once as a matter of course\" under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)\r\n(governing amendment of pleadings), as he attempted to do with his\r\nMay 7th Motion to Amend. The district court denied this motion on\r\nAugust 13, 1998, on the ground that the  2255 motion as amended\r\nwould have effectively sought a reduction in an otherwise lawful\r\nsentence.\r\nRogers filed a motion in support of his request for a\r\ncertificate of appealability on October 13, 1998. A limited\r\ncertificate of appealability issued from the district court on\r\nOctober 28, 1998. The court's order stated that Rogers was \"not\r\nentitled to a [certificate of appealability] on the issue of the\r\ntimeliness of filing of his initial section 2255 petition,\" but\r\nthat he was entitled to a certificate of appealability \"limited to\r\nthe issue of whether his federal sentence should be adjusted to run\r\nconcurrently rather than consecutively\" with the state sentences.\r\nWe ordered all issues briefed, irrespective of the certificate of\r\nappealability. See Order (1st Cir. Nov. 30, 1998).\r\n\nII. Dismissal of the initial  2255 motion\r\nOn April 24, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the\r\nAEDPA, which instituted a limitation period for filing motions\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  2255, as follows:\r\n    A 1-year period of limitation shall\r\napply to a motion under this section. The\r\nlimitation period shall run from the latest\r\nof \r\n    (1) the date on which the judgment of\r\nconviction becomes final;\r\n    (2) the date on which the impediment to\r\nmaking a motion created by governmental action\r\nin violation of the Constitution or laws of\r\nthe United States is removed, if the movant\r\nwas prevented from making a motion by such\r\ngovernmental action;\r\n    (3) the date on which the right\r\nasserted was initially recognized by the\r\nSupreme Court, if that right has been newly\r\nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made\r\nretroactively applicable to cases on\r\ncollateral review;  or\r\n    (4) the date on which the facts\r\nsupporting the claim or claims presented could\r\nhave been discovered through the exercise of\r\ndue diligence.\r\n\nRogers' conviction became final on June 5, 1995. In dismissing\r\nRogers'  2255 motion, the district court stated that AEDPA\r\n\"clearly applies here, where the [ 2255] motion was not filed\r\nuntil June 16, 1997,\" more than a year after the date on which\r\nRogers' judgment of conviction became final. The court continued:\r\n\"The date of filing is beyond the 12-month grace period ([from the\r\neffective date of AEDPA, April 24, 1996] to April 24, 1997), which\r\nhas been generally granted in cases of this type.\" See Order, Dkt.\r\n19, No. 97-300-SD, at 3 (D.N.H. May 13, 1998). The court's\r\nreference to the general adoption of a grace period was correct.\r\nReasoning that it is impermissible to bar the filing of a  2255\r\nmotion (or a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C.  2254, governed by\r\nthe similar limitations provisions AEDPA added to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2244(d)(1)) before the claimant has had a reasonable opportunity\r\nto bring it, all of the circuits which have addressed the issue\r\nhave now concluded that a one year grace period (running from the\r\neffective date of AEDPA) in which to file a  2255 motion (or a\r\npetition under  2254) constitutes a reasonable opportunity.\r\nWe now join those circuits by holding that the district\r\ncourt properly applied a one-year grace period in reviewing the\r\ntimeliness of Rogers'  2255 motion. There are compelling reasons\r\nfor doing so:\r\n  When application of a new limitation period\r\nwould wholly eliminate claims for substantive\r\nrights or remedial actions considered timely\r\nunder the old law, the application is\r\n\"impermissibly retroactive.\" . . . The\r\nlegislature cannot extinguish an existing\r\ncause of action by enacting a new limitation\r\nperiod without first providing a reasonable\r\ntime after the effective date of the new\r\nlimitation period in which to initiate the\r\naction. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated\r\nthat newly-enacted \"statutes of limitations\r\nmust allow a reasonable time after they take\r\neffect for the commencement of suits upon\r\nexisting causes of action.\" Block v. North\r\nDakota, 461 U.S. 273, 286 n.23 . . . (1983)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\nBrown v. Angelone, 150 F.3d 370, 373 (4th Cir. 1998). Where a\r\nshortened limitations period would bar previously-accrued claims,\r\nand where the legislature itself has not specified a grace period,\r\ncourts traditionally have provided that a \"reasonable time\" shall\r\nbe the shorter of: (1) the original limitation period, commencing\r\nat the time the action accrued, or (2) the new, shortened\r\nlimitation period, commencing from the date the statute became\r\neffective. See Flores, 135 F.3d at 1002-06 (applying such a\r\nstandard in holding that one year is \"reasonable period\" for\r\npurposes of  2255); Kelly v. Burlington Northern R.R., 896 F.2d\r\n1194, 1199 (9th Cir. 1990) (labor context); Hanner v. Mississippi,\r\n833 F.2d 55, 58 (5th Cir. 1987) (section 1983 context); Usher v.\r\nCity of Los Angeles, 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987) (section\r\n1983 context); Anton v. Lehpamer, 787 F.2d 1141, 1146 (7th Cir.\r\n1986) (section 1983 context); see also Sohn v. Waterson, 84 U.S.\r\n(17 Wall.) 596 (1873) (applying new limitations period, running\r\nfrom effective date, to previously-accrued claims).\r\nSince there was formerly no time limitation on filing\r\nunder  2255, \"application of this approach results in the holding\r\nthat petitioners attacking convictions or sentences which became\r\nfinal prior to the AEDPA's effective date will be accorded the one-\r\nyear post-AEDPA period, commencing on [AEDPA's] effective date,\r\nwithin which to file for section 2255 relief.\" Flores, 135 F.3d at\r\n1006. All the circuits which have addressed the issue have now held\r\nthat one year is a \"reasonable time\" after the effective date of\r\nAEDPA for allowing suits to commence upon pre-existing causes of\r\naction. See, e.g., Brown, 150 F.3d at 375 (holding that the\r\n\"reasonable time\" required and the one-year statutory period\r\n\"coalesce\" (citing Lindh v. Murphy, 96 F.3d 856, 866 (7th Cir.\r\n1996) (en banc))); Ross v. Artuz, 150 F.3d 97, 101-02 (2d Cir.\r\n1998) (citing possibility of prisoner reliance on Lindh,\r\nstatistical evidence of high rate of filings immediately prior to\r\nApril 24, 1997, Department of Justice's \"official position\" that it\r\nwould not seek to enforce new limitations period until April 24,\r\n1997, and desirability of announcing bright-line rule setting a\r\nfixed period of time for petitioners to develop evidence and legal\r\ntheories, in rejecting ad hoc \"reasonable time\" rule put forth in\r\ndicta in Peterson v. Demskie, 107 F.3d 92, 93 (2d Cir. 1997)).\r\nTherefore, for causes of action accruing before AEDPA's effective\r\ndate, the grace period for filing a  2255 motion ended on April\r\n24, 1997, well before Rogers filed his original  2255 motion on\r\nJune 16, 1997.\r\n\nIII. Denial of the Motion to Amend based on newly discovered\r\ninformation\r\nRogers has a separate argument for preserving the claims\r\nraised in his Motion to Amend the original  2255 motion: namely,\r\nhis contention that these claims, based on newly discovered facts,\r\nare governed by the one year limitation period of AEDPA measured\r\nfrom the time of first possible discovery in the exercise of due\r\ndiligence:\r\n    A 1-year period of limitation shall\r\napply to a motion under this section. The\r\nlimitation period shall run from the latest\r\nof \r\n                           * * *\r\n    (4) the date on which the facts\r\nsupporting the claim or claims presented could\r\nhave been discovered through the exercise of\r\ndue diligence.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2255. In his motion to amend the court's May 13, 1998\r\njudgment, Rogers stated that his May 7th \"Motion to Amend does not\r\narise from his original conviction, nor (primarily) from his\r\nsentence, but from facts arising within the one-year statute of\r\nlimitations imposed by\" AEDPA. Specifically, Rogers claims that he\r\nonly recently was informed by the United States Marshal's Office\r\nthat, during his time in the New Hampshire State Prison, Rogers was\r\n\"considered to be in State of New Hampshire custody, and [would]\r\nnot be processed for service of his federal sentence until his\r\nparole by state authorities.\" Motion to Amend, 12 at 6. Rogers\r\ndoes not indicate when this fact became known to him (presumably he\r\nclaims he learned it between his June 16, 1997 original  2255\r\nmotion and the May 7, 1998 Motion to Amend), and, regardless of\r\nwhen his actual discovery occurred, Rogers gives no indication that\r\nthis information could not have been discovered through the\r\nexercise of due diligence at some earlier point in time.\r\nWe need not resolve the due diligence/timeliness issue to\r\ndispose of the claims raised in the Motion to Amend. Instead, we\r\nassume arguendo that Rogers could not have discovered through the\r\nexercise of due diligence that his sentences would run\r\nconsecutively until less than a year prior to the filing of his\r\nMotion to Amend. We also assume (without deciding) the correctness\r\nof his claim that he was entitled to amend his  2255 motion by\r\nright. Even so, the new claims in Rogers' Motion to Amend are\r\nimproperly brought. He first claims that the district court should\r\nhave ordered or recommended designation of the state prison as the\r\nplace of confinement for the federal sentence imposed on July 16,\r\n1990; second, assuming the federal sentence properly commenced only\r\non his release from New Hampshire State Prison, he claims credit\r\nfor time already served in state prison against the federal\r\nsentence under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2). We analyze these claims in\r\nturn.\r\n\nA. Ordering or recommending designation of the state prison as the\r\nplace of confinement for the federal sentence\r\nRogers' Motion to Amend asks that the district court make\r\na \"correction to its sentence whereby the court orders, or in the\r\nalternative recommends that [New Hampshire State Prison] be\r\ndesignated as the place of confinement for [Rogers'] federal\r\nsentence.\" Motion to Amend, at 26. There is authority for the\r\nnotion that the Bureau of Prisons may make such a designation in\r\nnunc pro tunc fashion where the federal sentencing court is silent\r\nas to whether a federal sentence should run concurrently with \"a\r\nnot-yet-imposed state sentence.\" McCarthy v. Doe, 146 F.3d 118, 119\r\n(2d Cir. 1998); see also Barden v. Keohane, 921 F.2d 476, 483 (3d\r\nCir. 1991) (Bureau has authority to make such a designation).\r\nTherefore, prisoners similarly situated to Rogers may request that\r\nthe Bureau of Prisons make such a designation. On similar facts,\r\nother courts of appeals have held that the Bureau must consider\r\nsuch a request. See id. at 478. Once administrative remedies under\r\nthe Bureau of Prisons' Administrative Remedies Program are\r\nexhausted, see 28 C.F.R.  542.10-542.16, prisoners may then seek\r\njudicial review of the request for designation by filing a habeas\r\npetition under 28 U.S.C.  2241. See United States v. Pineyro, 112\r\nF.3d 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 1997) (prisoner must exhaust administrative\r\nremedies before seeking review of designation of facility); Barden,\r\n921 F.2d at 478-79 (petition under  2241 is proper mode of\r\nchallenge to Bureau of Prisons' refusal to consider designating\r\nstate prison as place of confinement); United States v. Jalili, 925\r\nF.2d 889, 893 (6th Cir. 1991) (challenge to designation of facility\r\nproperly cognizable under  2241). Here, Rogers has failed to raise\r\nthe matter before the Bureau of Prisons in the first instance. Even\r\nif he had exhausted administrative remedies, his  2255 motion\r\nwould not be the appropriate vehicle for a challenge to an\r\nadministrative denial of a request for designation of place of\r\nconfinement. See id. (district court lacked jurisdiction under\r\n2255 to challenge Bureau of Prisons' designation of facility for\r\notherwise lawful sentence).\r\n\nB. Credit for time under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2)\r\nAssuming that his federal sentence does begin running\r\nupon his parole from state prison, Rogers nonetheless claims that\r\nthe district court has power to award him credit for time served in\r\nstate prison under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2). See Motion to Amend,\r\n22, 28. Section 3585 reads as follows:\r\n  3585. Calculation of a term of imprisonment\r\n    (a) Commencement of sentence.--A\r\nsentence to a term of imprisonment commences\r\non the date the defendant is received in\r\ncustody awaiting transportation to, or arrives\r\nvoluntarily to commence service of sentence\r\nat, the official detention facility at which\r\nthe sentence is to be served.\r\n    (b) Credit for prior custody.--A\r\ndefendant shall be given credit toward the\r\nservice of a term of imprisonment for any time\r\nhe has spent in official detention prior to\r\nthe date the sentence commences--\r\n           (1) as a result of the offense for\r\n  which the sentence was imposed; or\r\n           (2) as a result of any other\r\n  charge for which the defendant was\r\n  arrested after the commission of the\r\n  offense for which the sentence was\r\n  imposed;\r\n  that has not been credited against another\r\nsentence.\r\n\nRogers' arrest for the state charges was subsequent to his\r\npossession of the firearm, the offense for which his federal\r\nsentence was imposed. Arguably, then, he would qualify for credit\r\nfor prior custody under the literal terms of 18 U.S.C.\r\n3585(b)(2). However, it is well-established that a request for\r\ncredit for prior custody under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2) must be made,\r\nin the first instance, to the Attorney General through the Bureau\r\nof Prisons upon imprisonment after sentencing. See United States v.\r\nWilson, 503 U.S. 329, 334 (1992) (\"[Section] 3585(b) does not\r\nauthorize a district court to compute the [presentence detention]\r\ncredit at sentencing.\"). Once administrative remedies are\r\nexhausted, see 28 C.F.R.  542.10-542.16, prisoners may then seek\r\njudicial review of any jail-time credit determination, see Wilson,\r\n503 U.S. at 335, by filing a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C.\r\n2241. See McClain v. Bureau of Prisons, 9 F.3d 503, 505 (6th\r\nCir. 1993). Rogers has not exhausted his administrative remedies,\r\nand even if he had, his  2255 motion would once again not be the\r\nappropriate vehicle for a challenge to an administrative denial of\r\ncredit for time served.\r\n\nWe therefore conclude that the district court did not err\r\nin dismissing Rogers'  2255 motion as untimely, and in dismissing\r\nhis Motion to Amend and his Motion to Amend Judgment.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Blakeney, Jr. for appellant.\r\n   Peter E. Papps, First Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJune 17, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Scott N. Rogers appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's denial of his motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2255 to vacate his sentence and set aside his conviction. The\r\ncourt held that his motion was untimely under the limitations\r\nperiod imposed in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\r\nof 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24,\r\n1996), which allows prisoners one year from the date on which their\r\nconvictions became final to file motions under  2255. As\r\ninterpreted by the district court (following the model of several\r\nother circuit courts of appeals), AEDPA allows prisoners such as\r\nRogers whose convictions became final before AEDPA's effective date\r\nto file motions under  2255 within one year of that date.\r\nNonetheless, even on this standard, the court held that Rogers'\r\nmotion was untimely. Rogers therefore challenges on appeal the\r\nvalidity of this interpretation of AEDPA, allowing filing only\r\nwithin a one year \"grace period\" from AEDPA's effective date.\r\nPrior to denial of the original  2255 motion, Rogers had\r\nmoved to amend it by adding a claim based on newly discovered facts\r\nregarding the execution of his sentence. The court denied this\r\nmotion to amend as moot in light of its denial of the original\r\n2255 motion. Rogers then moved to have the court reconsider the\r\ntimeliness issue as to the new claims on the basis that the motion\r\nto amend was filed within one year of Rogers' discovery of new\r\nfacts. The district court denied the motion. Rogers contests this\r\ndecision as well on appeal. The district court issued a certificate\r\nof appealability limited to the sentencing issues. We ordered\r\nbriefing on all issues, and now affirm.\r\nI. Background\r\nOn April 4, 1989, Manchester, New Hampshire police\r\narrested Scott N. Rogers, a convicted felon who had escaped from\r\nthe New Hampshire House of Corrections in January of that year. At\r\nthe time of his capture, Rogers was in constructive possession of\r\na handgun. Rogers was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury\r\nas a convicted felon in possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C.\r\n922(g)(1), and was convicted on May 20, 1990 after a jury trial.\r\nHe was sentenced on July 16, 1990 to a mandatory fifteen year\r\nsentence as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C.  924(e)(1).\r\nThroughout the federal proceedings, Rogers was housed in the New\r\nHampshire State Prison. The district court's 1990 judgment has no\r\nentry in the space reserved for \"recommendations to the Bureau of\r\nPrisons,\" and there is no record that the district court either\r\nordered or recommended that the New Hampshire State Prison should\r\nbe the place of confinement for Rogers' federal sentence. There is\r\nalso no indication of the court's intent as to whether the federal\r\nsentence should run concurrently with any future sentences for\r\nrelated pending state charges. The district court's judgment and\r\nsentence indicates that Rogers was \"remanded to the custody of the\r\nUnited States Marshal,\" but according to the terms of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus ad prosequendum, Rogers was to be returned to the\r\nwarden of the New Hampshire State Prison upon completion of the\r\nfederal court proceedings. The record does not indicate that Rogers\r\nwas transferred to federal prison at any point.\r\nRogers' prosecution on related state charges followed.\r\nThrough new counsel, Rogers pleaded guilty to all remaining state\r\nfelony charges on August 8, 1990. According to the records of the\r\nCounty Attorney, the New Hampshire Superior Court Judge had\r\nindicated to the parties prior to the plea agreement that, in light\r\nof the long federal sentence, he would not give any \"consecutive\r\ntime\" - that is, he would not sentence Rogers to any time to be\r\nserved after the federal sentence. Accordingly, the parties agreed\r\nthat Rogers' sentences for eight of his nine state felony charges\r\nshould run concurrent to each other and to the federal sentence.\r\nRogers was thus sentenced to 3 to 7 years imprisonment on each of\r\nfour of the state felony counts and 7 to 15 years imprisonment on\r\neach of the other four; all these sentences were to run concurrent\r\nto each other and to the federal sentence. Finally, Rogers received\r\na suspended sentence of 7 to 15 years for the remaining charge of\r\ntheft of a firearm. This suspended sentence was to run consecutive\r\nto the 15 year federal sentence. Following these state convictions,\r\nRogers continued to be confined in the New Hampshire State Prison.\r\nRogers filed a timely notice of appeal from the federal\r\nconvictions, but direct appeal was stayed to allow Rogers to\r\nconsider the merits of filing a  2255 motion (on ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel grounds). Although successor counsel was\r\nappointed, a  2255 motion was never filed. We lifted the stay on\r\nFebruary 18, 1994 and Rogers proceeded with his direct appeal\r\nbefore this court. We affirmed the federal conviction on December\r\n8, 1994, see United States v. Rogers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195768\"><a href=\"/opinion/195768/united-states-v-scott-n-rogers/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1994),\r\nand Rogers' sentence became final with the Supreme Court's denial\r\nof certiorari on June 5, 1995. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (June 5, 1995).\r\nAfter another long delay following the denial of\r\ncertiorari, Rogers filed a  2255 motion in the district court on\r\nJune 16, 1997. This motion, predicated entirely on ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel grounds, sought to have the sentence vacated\r\nand the conviction set aside. The government filed a motion to\r\ndismiss the  2255 motion as untimely. On May 7, 1998, Rogers filed\r\na motion to amend the  2255 motion (hereinafter the \"Motion to\r\nAmend\") by adding a request \"to Correct Sentence Nunc Pro Tunc to\r\nEffect Concurrent Running of Sentences by Ordering, or in the\r\nAlternative by Recommending, Designation of State Facility as Place\r\nof Confinement for Federal Sentence.\" On May 13, 1998, the district\r\ncourt denied the original  2255 motion as untimely in light of the\r\nprevailing judicial interpretation of the AEDPA and denied as moot\r\nall other pending motions. Rogers then filed a \"Motion to Alter or\r\nAmend Judgment under Rule 59(e) or Alternatively for Partial Relief\r\nfrom Judgment under Rule 60(b).\" Dkt. 21, May 26, 1998. He argued\r\nin his motion that the May 7th Motion to Amend derived \"from facts\r\narising within the one-year statute of limitations imposed by the\r\n[AEDPA].\" Section 2255 provides:\r\n  A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a\r\nmotion under this section. The limitation\r\nperiod shall run from the latest of \r\n                           * * *\r\n  (4) the date on which the facts supporting the\r\nclaim or claims presented could have been\r\ndiscovered through the exercise of due\r\ndiligence.\r\n\nRogers claimed that he had \"newly discovered\" that federal\r\nauthorities intended that his federal sentence should begin running\r\nupon completion of his state sentence, i.e. consecutively to the\r\nstate sentences. Since the government had not filed a responsive\r\npleading, Rogers maintained he had a right to amend the  2255\r\nmotion \"once as a matter of course\" under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)\r\n(governing amendment of pleadings), as he attempted to do with his\r\nMay 7th Motion to Amend. The district court denied this motion on\r\nAugust 13, 1998, on the ground that the  2255 motion as amended\r\nwould have effectively sought a reduction in an otherwise lawful\r\nsentence.\r\nRogers filed a motion in support of his request for a\r\ncertificate of appealability on October 13, 1998. A limited\r\ncertificate of appealability issued from the district court on\r\nOctober 28, 1998. The court's order stated that Rogers was \"not\r\nentitled to a [certificate of appealability] on the issue of the\r\ntimeliness of filing of his initial section 2255 petition,\" but\r\nthat he was entitled to a certificate of appealability \"limited to\r\nthe issue of whether his federal sentence should be adjusted to run\r\nconcurrently rather than consecutively\" with the state sentences.\r\nWe ordered all issues briefed, irrespective of the certificate of\r\nappealability. See Order (1st Cir. Nov. 30, 1998).\r\n\nII. Dismissal of the initial  2255 motion\r\nOn April 24, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the\r\nAEDPA, which instituted a limitation period for filing motions\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  2255, as follows:\r\n    A 1-year period of limitation shall\r\napply to a motion under this section. The\r\nlimitation period shall run from the latest\r\nof \r\n    (1) the date on which the judgment of\r\nconviction becomes final;\r\n    (2) the date on which the impediment to\r\nmaking a motion created by governmental action\r\nin violation of the Constitution or laws of\r\nthe United States is removed, if the movant\r\nwas prevented from making a motion by such\r\ngovernmental action;\r\n    (3) the date on which the right\r\nasserted was initially recognized by the\r\nSupreme Court, if that right has been newly\r\nrecognized by the Supreme Court and made\r\nretroactively applicable to cases on\r\ncollateral review;  or\r\n    (4) the date on which the facts\r\nsupporting the claim or claims presented could\r\nhave been discovered through the exercise of\r\ndue diligence.\r\n\nRogers' conviction became final on June 5, 1995. In dismissing\r\nRogers'  2255 motion, the district court stated that AEDPA\r\n\"clearly applies here, where the [ 2255] motion was not filed\r\nuntil June 16, 1997,\" more than a year after the date on which\r\nRogers' judgment of conviction became final. The court continued:\r\n\"The date of filing is beyond the 12-month grace period ([from the\r\neffective date of AEDPA, April 24, 1996] to April 24, 1997), which\r\nhas been generally granted in cases of this type.\" See Order, Dkt.\r\n19, No. 97-300-SD, at 3 (D.N.H. May 13, 1998). The court's\r\nreference to the general adoption of a grace period was correct.\r\nReasoning that it is impermissible to bar the filing of a  2255\r\nmotion (or a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C.  2254, governed by\r\nthe similar limitations provisions AEDPA added to 28 U.S.C.\r\n2244(d)(1)) before the claimant has had a reasonable opportunity\r\nto bring it, all of the circuits which have addressed the issue\r\nhave now concluded that a one year grace period (running from the\r\neffective date of AEDPA) in which to file a  2255 motion (or a\r\npetition under  2254) constitutes a reasonable opportunity.\r\nWe now join those circuits by holding that the district\r\ncourt properly applied a one-year grace period in reviewing the\r\ntimeliness of Rogers'  2255 motion. There are compelling reasons\r\nfor doing so:\r\n  When application of a new limitation period\r\nwould wholly eliminate claims for substantive\r\nrights or remedial actions considered timely\r\nunder the old law, the application is\r\n\"impermissibly retroactive.\" . . . The\r\nlegislature cannot extinguish an existing\r\ncause of action by enacting a new limitation\r\nperiod without first providing a reasonable\r\ntime after the effective date of the new\r\nlimitation period in which to initiate the\r\naction. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated\r\nthat newly-enacted \"statutes of limitations\r\nmust allow a reasonable time after they take\r\neffect for the commencement of suits upon\r\nexisting causes of action.\" Block v. North\r\nDakota, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110923\"><a href=\"/opinion/110923/block-v-north-dakota-ex-rel-board-of-univ-and-school-lands/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286 n.23 . . .

All the circuits which have addressed the issue have now held\r\nthat one year is a \"reasonable time\" after the effective date of\r\nAEDPA for allowing suits to commence upon pre-existing causes of\r\naction. See, e.g., Brown, 150 F.3d at 375 (holding that the\r\n\"reasonable time\" required and the one-year statutory period\r\n\"coalesce\" (citing Lindh v.

Denial of the Motion to Amend based on newly discovered\r\ninformation\r\nRogers has a separate argument for preserving the claims\r\nraised in his Motion to Amend the original  2255 motion: namely,\r\nhis contention that these claims, based on newly discovered facts,\r\nare governed by the one year limitation period of AEDPA measured\r\nfrom the time of first possible discovery in the exercise of due\r\ndiligence:\r\n    A 1-year period of limitation shall\r\napply to a motion under this section. The\r\nlimitation period shall run from the latest\r\nof \r\n                           * * *\r\n    (4) the date on which the facts\r\nsupporting the claim or claims presented could\r\nhave been discovered through the exercise of\r\ndue diligence.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2255. In his motion to amend the court's May 13, 1998\r\njudgment, Rogers stated that his May 7th \"Motion to Amend does not\r\narise from his original conviction, nor (primarily) from his\r\nsentence, but from facts arising within the one-year statute of\r\nlimitations imposed by\" AEDPA. Specifically, Rogers claims that he\r\nonly recently was informed by the United States Marshal's Office\r\nthat, during his time in the New Hampshire State Prison, Rogers was\r\n\"considered to be in State of New Hampshire custody, and [would]\r\nnot be processed for service of his federal sentence until his\r\nparole by state authorities.\" Motion to Amend, 12 at 6. Rogers\r\ndoes not indicate when this fact became known to him (presumably he\r\nclaims he learned it between his June 16, 1997 original  2255\r\nmotion and the May 7, 1998 Motion to Amend), and, regardless of\r\nwhen his actual discovery occurred, Rogers gives no indication that\r\nthis information could not have been discovered through the\r\nexercise of due diligence at some earlier point in time.\r\nWe need not resolve the due diligence/timeliness issue to\r\ndispose of the claims raised in the Motion to Amend. Instead, we\r\nassume arguendo that Rogers could not have discovered through the\r\nexercise of due diligence that his sentences would run\r\nconsecutively until less than a year prior to the filing of his\r\nMotion to Amend. We also assume (without deciding) the correctness\r\nof his claim that he was entitled to amend his  2255 motion by\r\nright. Even so, the new claims in Rogers' Motion to Amend are\r\nimproperly brought. He first claims that the district court should\r\nhave ordered or recommended designation of the state prison as the\r\nplace of confinement for the federal sentence imposed on July 16,\r\n1990; second, assuming the federal sentence properly commenced only\r\non his release from New Hampshire State Prison, he claims credit\r\nfor time already served in state prison against the federal\r\nsentence under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2). We analyze these claims in\r\nturn.\r\n\nA. Ordering or recommending designation of the state prison as the\r\nplace of confinement for the federal sentence\r\nRogers' Motion to Amend asks that the district court make\r\na \"correction to its sentence whereby the court orders, or in the\r\nalternative recommends that [New Hampshire State Prison] be\r\ndesignated as the place of confinement for [Rogers'] federal\r\nsentence.\" Motion to Amend, at 26. There is authority for the\r\nnotion that the Bureau of Prisons may make such a designation in\r\nnunc pro tunc fashion where the federal sentencing court is silent\r\nas to whether a federal sentence should run concurrently with \"a\r\nnot-yet-imposed state sentence.\" McCarthy v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755153\"><a href=\"/opinion/755153/john-j-mccarthy-v-john-doe-director-of-the-federal-bureau-of-prisons/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119\r\n(2d Cir. 1998); see also Barden v.

Once administrative remedies under\r\nthe Bureau of Prisons' Administrative Remedies Program are\r\nexhausted, see 28 C.F.R.  542.10-542.16, prisoners may then seek\r\njudicial review of the request for designation by filing a habeas\r\npetition under 28 U.S.C.  2241.

Here, Rogers has failed to raise\r\nthe matter before the Bureau of Prisons in the first instance. Even\r\nif he had exhausted administrative remedies, his  2255 motion\r\nwould not be the appropriate vehicle for a challenge to an\r\nadministrative denial of a request for designation of place of\r\nconfinement. See id. (district court lacked jurisdiction under\r\n2255 to challenge Bureau of Prisons' designation of facility for\r\notherwise lawful sentence).\r\n\nB. Credit for time under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2)\r\nAssuming that his federal sentence does begin running\r\nupon his parole from state prison, Rogers nonetheless claims that\r\nthe district court has power to award him credit for time served in\r\nstate prison under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2). See Motion to Amend,\r\n22, 28. Section 3585 reads as follows:\r\n  3585. Calculation of a term of imprisonment\r\n    (a) Commencement of sentence.--A\r\nsentence to a term of imprisonment commences\r\non the date the defendant is received in\r\ncustody awaiting transportation to, or arrives\r\nvoluntarily to commence service of sentence\r\nat, the official detention facility at which\r\nthe sentence is to be served.\r\n    (b) Credit for prior custody.--A\r\ndefendant shall be given credit toward the\r\nservice of a term of imprisonment for any time\r\nhe has spent in official detention prior to\r\nthe date the sentence commences--\r\n           (1) as a result of the offense for\r\n  which the sentence was imposed; or\r\n           (2) as a result of any other\r\n  charge for which the defendant was\r\n  arrested after the commission of the\r\n  offense for which the sentence was\r\n  imposed;\r\n  that has not been credited against another\r\nsentence.\r\n\nRogers' arrest for the state charges was subsequent to his\r\npossession of the firearm, the offense for which his federal\r\nsentence was imposed. Arguably, then, he would qualify for credit\r\nfor prior custody under the literal terms of 18 U.S.C.\r\n3585(b)(2). However, it is well-established that a request for\r\ncredit for prior custody under 18 U.S.C.  3585(b)(2) must be made,\r\nin the first instance, to the Attorney General through the Bureau\r\nof Prisons upon imprisonment after sentencing. See United States v.\r\nWilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112711\"><a href=\"/opinion/112711/united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 334 (1992) (\"[Section] 3585(b) does not\r\nauthorize a district court to compute the [presentence detention]\r\ncredit at sentencing.\"). Once administrative remedies are\r\nexhausted, see 28 C.F.R.  542.10-542.16, prisoners may then seek\r\njudicial review of any jail-time credit determination, see Wilson,\r\n503 U.S. at 335, by filing a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C.\r\n2241. See McClain v. Bureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"657198\"><a href=\"/opinion/657198/david-h-mcclain-v-bureau-of-prisons-jj-clark-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (6th\r\nCir. 1993). Rogers has not exhausted his administrative remedies,\r\nand even if he had, his  2255 motion would once again not be the\r\nappropriate vehicle for a challenge to an administrative denial of\r\ncredit for time served.\r\n\nWe therefore conclude that the district court did not err\r\nin dismissing Rogers'  2255 motion as untimely, and in dismissing\r\nhis Motion to Amend and his Motion to Amend Judgment.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
