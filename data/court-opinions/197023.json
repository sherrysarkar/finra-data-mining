Josleyn  for conspiring to  defraud their\r\n\nformer  employer,  American  Honda  Motor  Company (\"Honda\"),  by\r\n\naccepting money and other valuable consideration from prospective\r\n\nHonda  dealers in  exchange for  lucrative dealership  rights and\r\n\nsundry advantage.  See 18 U.S.C.    371 (conspiracy) &amp; 1341 (mail\r                                \r\n\nfraud) (1994).   Verdicts were returned also against  Josleyn for\r\n\nracketeering, conspiracy, and mail fraud, see id.    1962(c), 371\r                                                           \r\n\n&amp; 1341, relating, inter alia, to kickbacks received in connection\r                                      \r\n\nwith national  sales  training seminars  and  dealer  advertising\r\n\nprograms  for Honda  dealers.   On  appeal, Billmyer  and Josleyn\r\n\nprincipally contend that  New Hampshire was an improper venue for\r\n\nthe  franchise conspiracy charge in  Count II and  that there was\r\n\ninsufficient evidence  to support the guilty verdicts.  We affirm\r\n\nthe district court judgments in all respects.  \r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND1\r                                     BACKGROUND\r                                               \r\n\n          Following the second OPEC oil embargo in 1979, American\r\n\nconsumer demand for the energy-efficient automobiles manufactured\r\n\nby  Honda skyrocketed, and remained strong  for a decade thereaf-\r\n\nter.  Just  as demand in the  United States surged, the  Japanese\r\n\ngovernment imposed export restraints  on its carmakers, and Honda\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1We recite  the background  facts the jury  reasonably could\r\nhave found, viewing the  evidence in the light most  favorable to\r\nthe  verdicts.  See United  States v. Bello-Perez,  977 F.2d 664,\r                                                           \r\n666 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwas unable to  meet the demand for its  automobiles in the United\r\n\nStates.   These  uncommonly favorable  market conditions  endured\r\n\nthroughout much of the 1980s, causing enterprising car dealers in\r\n\nthe United  States to  compete fiercely (and  sometimes unfairly)\r\n\nfor exclusive Honda franchises  in anticipation of the extraordi-\r\n\nnarily  large  profit margins  available  on  such popular  Honda\r\n\nmodels as the Civic, Prelude, and Accord.\r\n\n          Appellant  John Billmyer  joined  Honda  as a  district\r\n\nsales representative in  1970, and rose rapidly  through all four\r\n\nmanagement  levels  in  its  field  sales  division.2    By 1977,\r\n\nBillmyer  had  been  appointed  regional sales  manager  for  the\r\n\neastern United  States.   By 1980, he  held the  top field  sales\r\n\nposition at Honda     national  sales manager     and soon  moved\r\n\nfrom its New Jersey  office to headquarters in California.   When\r\n\nHonda  launched a  line of  luxury automobiles in  1985, Billmyer\r\n\nbecame national sales manager for the new Acura Division as well.\r\n\nHe  remained  the top  Honda field  sales  manager in  the United\r\n\nStates until he retired on March 31, 1988.\r\n\n          After Billmyer  retired, he was  succeeded as  national\r\n\nsales manager by S. James Cardiges, his closest associate at Hon-\r\n\nda.  Billmyer had hired Cardiges  as the Honda sales manager  for\r\n\nthe  Baltimore/Washington  D.C.  district in  1977,  and  rapidly\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2At Honda,  district sales managers in  the field maintained\r\nday-to-day  contact  with their  dealers  and  reported to  their\r\nrespective zone sales managers.   Each zone manager was responsi-\r\nble  for Honda sales  in several states.   Zone  managers in turn\r\nreported to  their respective regional  sales managers.   The two\r\nregional  managers each supervised  Honda sales in  the field for\r\nroughly one-half the country.  \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\npromoted him through  the ranks:  from zone  manager for the mid-\r\n\nAtlantic states in 1979,  to zone manager for the west coast (the\r\n\nlargest and  most prestigious zone)  in 1981,  to regional  sales\r\n\nmanager  for the  western  United States  in  late 1982.    While\r\n\nwestern  regional sales  manager,  Cardiges worked  closely  with\r\n\nBillmyer.    The two  often traveled  to  work together  and took\r\n\nbusiness trips within the  United States and overseas.   Finally,\r\n\nCardiges succeeded  Billmyer as  national sales manager  in 1988.\r\n\nHe  resigned in April 1992  by \"mutual agreement\"  with Honda, to\r\n\nforfend termination.\r\n\n          Appellant Dennis  R.  Josleyn joined  Honda in  January\r\n\n1983, and followed a  similar path:  assistant sales  manager for\r\n\nthe mid-Atlantic zone in 1985; mid-Atlantic zone manager in March\r\n\n1987; and zone manager  for the west coast, resident  in Califor-\r\n\nnia, in  early 1991, a  position he held  until he resigned  from\r\n\nHonda in April 1992.\r\n\n          Throughout  appellants'  tenure  with Honda,  corporate\r\n\npolicy and procedures for awarding new Honda dealerships were set\r\n\nforth  in the  \"Honda  Automobile Dealer  Appointment  Procedures\r\n\nManual.\"   The first step was to  identify a geographic area ripe\r\n\nfor a new dealership    in  Honda terminology an \"open point\"    \r\n\nthrough  reference to  marketing  and  demographic studies,  data\r\n\nrelating to competition, and  an assortment of other information.\r\n\nNext, the district  and zone  sales managers for  the area  under\r\n\nconsideration were to \"prospect\"  for a qualified dealer  to fill\r\n\nthe  \"open point,\" then compose a slate of three or more suitable\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ncandidates.   Honda policy directed that  sales managers evaluate\r\n\ncandidates according to their experience in automobile retailing,\r\n\navailable capital, personal reputation,  and the quality of their\r\n\nlocation and  facilities, all  with the  ultimate aim that  Honda\r\n\ndealerships be awarded to the best candidates. \r\n\n          Honda sales managers at  each level, see supra note  2,\r                                                                  \r\n\nwere required to participate in recommending and approving candi-\r                                                                           \r\n\ndates  for  any \"open  point.\"   With  the possible  exception of\r                                      \r\n\nBillmyer and Cardiges, in their respective capacities as national\r\n\nsales manager, no sales manager at any level possessed unilateral\r                                                                           \r\n\nauthority to award  a new dealership.   Furthermore, approval was\r                                              \r\n\nrequired  from  managers  representing  the  parts,  service, and\r\n\nmarket-representation departments as well.  \r\n\n          Once selected for an  \"open point\" dealership, with the\r\n\napproval of sales managers  at the district, zone, regional,  and\r\n\nnational levels, a successful candidate received a \"Letter of In-\r\n\ntent\"  (\"LOI\") from Honda via United States mail, authorizing the\r\n\nprospective  dealer to  open the  new, exclusive  dealership upon\r\n\ncertain  conditions, such  as  constructing a  facility within  a\r\n\nspecified time.   Until the  franchise itself was  issued to  the\r\n\nprospective  dealer,  however,  these  LOI  rights  remained  the\r\n\nproperty  of Honda.  Like  its competitors, Honda  exacted no fee\r\n\nfor its dealership franchises.  Nor were  Honda personnel allowed\r\n\nto accept money or  other consideration of significant value  for\r\n\nassistance in obtaining a Honda franchise.  \r\n\n          In addition  to Honda policy  and procedures  governing\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nnew  dealerships, its  \"conflict of  interest\" policy  prohibited\r\n\nemployees  from accepting  anything of  significant value  from a\r\n\nHonda  dealer and  from acquiring  or holding  any interest  in a\r\n\nHonda or Acura dealership.  The \"conflict of interest\" policy was\r\n\ndisseminated among all Honda sales managers, who were required to\r\n\nsign disclosure  forms  indicating  ongoing  compliance.    Sales\r\n\nmanagers  at  every level  were duty-bound  to ensure  that their\r\n\nrespective subordinates honored the policy  prohibiting conflicts\r\n\nof interest, and report all violations to their senior manager or\r\n\nthe Human Resources Department.\r\n\n          Notwithstanding  these  rigorous  internal  procedures,\r\n\nhowever,  there  were numerous  violations  of  the \"conflict  of\r\n\ninterest\" policy.  From  the late 1970s through the  early 1990s,\r\n\nsales managers at every level  commonly accepted money and  valu-\r\n\nable  gifts, including  Rolex  watches,  furniture, and  business\r\n\nsuits, from prospective dealers  vying for \"open points\"  or from\r\n\ndealers  seeking  increased Honda  automobile  allocations.   Yet\r\n\ntheir illicit activities apparently escaped notice by nonpartici-\r\n\npating sales managers and dealers for years.  \r\n\n          Finally,  in 1991  an internal investigation  was trig-\r\n\ngered by an uninvolved  district sales representative in Arkansas\r\n\nwho provided  a Honda  executive vice-president with  evidence of\r\n\npayoffs involving Cardiges, then  the national sales manager, and\r\n\na zone manager.   By early 1992, Honda had begun \"cleaning house\"\r\n\nand Cardiges had resigned.  An  extensive federal criminal inves-\r\n\ntigation ensued.    \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          On  March 11, 1994, a  federal grand jury  in New Hamp-\r\n\nshire returned an indictment  against Billmyer, Josleyn, Cardiges\r\n\nand two lower-level Honda sales managers responsible for  the New\r\n\nEngland  region,  David  L.  Pedersen  and  Damien  C.  Budnick.3\r\n\nSuperseding indictments were returned against  Billmyer, Josleyn,\r\n\nand  Cardiges in  October  1994 and  January  1995.   Ultimately,\r\n\nBudnick, Cardiges, and Pedersen  entered into plea agreements and\r\n\ncooperated with the  government.  Cardiges and Pedersen  were key\r\n\ngovernment witnesses at trial.  \r\n\n          The second superseding  indictment charged Josleyn  and\r\n\nCardiges, in Count I, with a pattern of racketeering in violation\r\n\nof the  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations Act (\"RI-\r\n\nCO\"), 18  U.S.C.    1962(c) (1994).   As  Racketeering Act 1,  it\r\n\nalleged that Josleyn and Cardiges had persuaded Honda to select a\r\n\nparticular outside vendor (from which the defendants had received\r\n\nkickbacks) to conduct sales training seminars for Honda salespeo-\r\n\nple employed in New Hampshire and elsewhere in the United States.\r\n\nRacketeering  Acts 2  through 8  related to  regional advertising\r\n\nassociations  which pooled  monies  advanced by  individual Honda\r\n\ndealers to defray  their local Honda advertising  costs.  Josleyn\r\n\nand Cardiges were charged with causing Honda to match the contri-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Pedersen  had joined Honda in July 1979 as a district sales\r\nmanager for Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and  upstate New York.\r\nWithin a year he was transferred to Minnesota.  Around June 1982,\r\nhe  became a district sales manager in  northern Ohio; in 1985, a\r\ndistrict sales manager in the new Acura Division, responsible for\r\na  territory  extending from  Maine to  Minnesota; and,  in March\r\n1987,  an assistant zone manager, responsible  for the area which\r\nincluded New Hampshire.   Budnick, a district sales  manager also\r\nresponsible for New Hampshire, reported directly to Pedersen. \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nbutions made  by the Honda dealers to  these regional advertising\r\n\nassociations, on the condition  that the advertising associations\r\n\nhire  a particular  vendor (controlled  by Josleyn's  brother) to\r\n\nprovide the advertising services.   After receiving payments from\r\n\nthe regional advertising associations, the vendor allegedly  made\r\n\nkickbacks  to  Josleyn and  Cardiges.    Other Racketeering  Acts\r\n\ndescribed  in  Count  I alleged,  inter  alia,  that Josleyn  and\r                                                       \r\n\nCardiges received kickbacks for awarding numerous LOIs to various\r\n\ndealership  candidates in  California,  Maryland,  New York,  and\r\n\nother states.\r\n\n          Count  II charged Billmyer,  Cardiges, and Josleyn with\r\n\nconspiring  to  defraud Honda  by  accepting  payments and  other\r\n\nvaluable  consideration from  dealers and prospective  dealers in\r\n\nexchange  for  LOIs  or  other preferred  treatment.    Count III\r\n\n(conspiracy)  and  Count  IV  (mail fraud)  charged  Josleyn  and\r\n\nCardiges  with accepting  kickbacks  from 1989  through 1992,  in\r\n\nrelation  to the sales  training seminars.   Overall, Josleyn was\r\n\ncharged in all four counts, whereas Billmyer was charged with the\r\n\nCount II \"dealer franchise\" conspiracy only.\r\n\n          Trial  began on  February 7,  1995, before  Chief Judge\r\n\nJoseph A. DiClerico, Jr.4   After presenting thirty-five witness-\r\n\nes,  including Cardiges and Pedersen  and many Honda dealers from\r\n\naround the country,  the government  rested its case  on May  10,\r\n\n1995.   Billmyer opted  to present  no  witnesses, while  Josleyn\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Three  weeks into the trial, we were called upon to resolve\r\na  discovery dispute. See United  States v. Billmyer,  57 F.3d 31\r                                                              \r\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nmounted  a defense based on  the theory that  top Japanese execu-\r\n\ntives in Honda had condoned the activities alleged in the indict-\r\n\nment.

We conclude that any misjoinder was\r\n\nharmless.  \r\n\n          Not  only did  the  parties  marshal their  evidentiary\r\n\npresentations to  minimize prejudicial spillover,  but throughout\r\n\nthe trial  the district  court prudently and  carefully cautioned\r\n\nthe  jury to consider the evidence against each individual defen-\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ndant.   No  less importantly,  Billmyer's retirement  from Honda,\r\n\nprior to the time Josleyn launched the dealer advertising associ-\r\n\nation and sales training schemes,  unquestionably facilitated the\r\n\nindividualized factfinding  focus  to which  each  defendant  was\r\n\nentitled from the jury.

Only one  overt act in  furtherance of the\r\nfranchise  conspiracy  alleged  in Count  II  took  place  in the\r\nDistrict  of New Hampshire.  It alleged that David Pedersen, then\r\nan assistant  zone sales  manager responsible for  New Hampshire,\r\nhad  recommended one Thomas Bohlander for  an Acura dealership in\r\nNashua,  New Hampshire,  in return  for approximately  $18,000 in\r\ncollege tuition payments for Pedersen's son.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nact was committed in  furtherance of the conspiracy.

Billmyer\r                         a.   Billmyer\r                                      \r\n\n          As  early  as  1979,  while Billmyer  was  the  eastern\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nregional sales manager,  Cardiges, as zone  manager for the  mid-\r\n\nAtlantic states, accepted  a $10,000 payment from  a Honda dealer\r\n\nin  Philadelphia, and split  it with Billmyer.   In  late 1979 or\r\n\nearly  1980, Cardiges presented Billmyer  with a gold Rolex watch\r\n\nworth as much as $15,000  from a large Honda dealer in  the Wash-\r\n\nington,  D.C. area.  Beginning  with the 1984  holiday season and\r\n\ncontinuing  through 1992,  Cardiges received  $20,000  to $25,000\r\n\neach year  from John Rosatti,  a Honda  dealer in New  York City.\r\n\nRosatti told Cardiges that he  was paying Billmyer also, because,\r\n\nas Cardiges testified at trial, like other dealers Rosatti wanted\r\n\n\"favorable  treatment, wanted more  automobiles, more franchises,\r\n\nand wanted the ability to have the ear of the  people who were in\r\n\npower at Honda.\"   \r\n\n          Cardiges and  Billmyer both helped a  dealer named Rick\r\n\nHendrick acquire approximately thirty  Honda and Acura franchises\r\n\nin various  states, including Texas, Georgia,  and the Carolinas.\r\n\nIn return,  Hendrick helped  Cardiges buy a  California residence\r\n\nfrom which Cardiges later realized  a $250,000 gain.  Thereafter,\r\n\nHendrick defrayed approximately $150,000 in interest payments  on\r\n\na loan Cardiges  had obtained to  buy a $700,000  home in  Laguna\r\n\nHills, California.  During this same 1989-92 time frame, Hendrick\r\n\nintimated  to   Cardiges  that  he  was   involved  in  financing\r\n\nBillmyer's home in Palm  Springs as well.  Cardiges  also learned\r\n\nfrom Billmyer  that Hendrick had provided Billmyer with a top-of-\r\n\nthe-line BMW. \r\n\n          Cardiges  described  periodic  payoffs  from  one Marty\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nLuftgarten, who  owned dealerships  in New  Jersey, Philadelphia,\r\n\nand southern California.   For example, at the grand opening of a\r\n\nLuftgarten dealership  during the mid-1980s,  Billmyer, Cardiges,\r\n\nand two  other  Honda  sales managers,  Bill  Kutchera  and  Jeff\r\n\nConway,  gathered in  a conference  room where  Luftgarten handed\r\n\neach an envelope containing  $5,000 in cash.  Around  the holiday\r\n\nseason,  another  dealer  customarily sent  Cardiges  $5,000 gift\r\n\ncertificates from  Neiman-Marcus for both Cardiges  and Billmyer.\r\n\nSee Boylan, 898 F.2d at 242 (noting that defendants often cooper-\r                    \r\n\nated with one  another by  collecting payments).   The record  is\r\n\nreplete with  other evidence  of cash  payments from  dealers and\r\n\nlavish shopping trips to Hong Kong. \r\n\n               b.   Josleyn\r                         b.   Josleyn\r                                     \r\n\n          Similarly, there was ample  evidence to enable a ratio-\r\n\nnal jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Josleyn conspired\r\n\nwith  Cardiges and others to defraud Honda in connection with the\r\n\nHonda dealership franchises.   In early 1991, while  zone manager\r\n\nfor  the west coast, Josleyn  arranged for a  \"friend\" back east,\r\n\nJoe Pope,  to pay  $150,000 for  the \"open  point\" in  Elk Grove,\r\n\nCalifornia.  Josleyn approached Cardiges, national sales manager,\r\n\nand  Robert  Rivers,  regional  manager for  the  western  United\r\n\nStates, and  advised that there would  be money in it  for all of\r\n\nthem if Pope were to receive the Elk Grove dealership.   Thereaf-\r\n\nter, Cardiges,  Rivers, and Josleyn, in direct violation of Honda\r\n\nprocedure,  decided  not  to  prospect  for  suitable  dealership\r\n\ncandidates, and awarded the Elk Grove franchise outright to Pope.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nAs  promised,  Pope issued  a $150,000  check  payable to  Gary &amp;\r\n\nAssociates, a company controlled by Josleyn and his brother Gary.\r\n\nJosleyn in turn gave Cardiges and Rivers each $50,000 in cash. \r\n\n          Cardiges testified that Ed  Temple, a former Honda zone\r\n\nmanager, approached  him in the summer  of 1991 in behalf  of Bob\r\n\nFrink,  a  dealer interested  in  the  Folsom, California  point.\r\n\nTemple had accepted payoffs from dealers while employed by Honda,\r\n\nand  after  leaving the  company in  1989  established a  firm   \r\n\nBlakely Consultants    to facilitate payments to Honda executives\r\n\nfrom dealers seeking  new Honda franchises.   Simply put,  Temple\r\n\ntold  Cardiges that Frink was willing to pay Cardiges and Josleyn\r\n\nfor  the Folsom dealership.   On August 5,  1991, Cardiges signed\r\n\nthe Folsom LOI, and  on the same day  Frink paid Blakely  Consul-\r\n\ntants $500,000 for services rendered.   Three days later,  Temple\r\n\nwrote  a $166,666 check to  Magnum Marketing, a  company owned by\r\n\nJosleyn.  Cardiges reported  $166,666 from Blakely Consultants on\r\n\nhis own 1991  income tax  return, although Temple  had agreed  to\r\n\nhold Cardiges' one-third share until Cardiges left Honda.  \r\n\n          We need  belabor the  point  no further,  as there  was\r\n\nample evidence to enable the  jury reasonably to conclude, beyond\r\n\na reasonable  doubt, that  Josleyn was a  member of the  Count II\r\n\ndealership franchise conspiracy.

The  government\r\n\nacknowledges that venue was  proper in the District of  New Hamp-\r\n\nshire only if  there was enough evidence  for a rational  jury to\r\n\nfind  it more likely than not that Pedersen, Josleyn and Billmyer\r\n\nbelonged to the Count II conspiracy.  \r\n\n          Upon joining Honda  as a district sales manager in July\r\n\n1979, see supra notes 2  &amp; 3, Pedersen learned that Honda  policy\r                         \r\n\nprohibited sales executives from  awarding LOIs for personal gain\r\n\nand  from accepting gifts valued  at more than  $25 from dealers.\r\n\nIn  keeping with Honda policy, Pedersen objected in December 1979\r\n\nwhen Bill  Lia, a dealer in upstate New York, stuffed an envelope\r\n\ncontaining  cash  into  Pedersen's  pocket.    Although  Pedersen\r\n\nthreatened  to report the incident, he relented when Lia told him\r\n\nnot to worry because Lia had  \"already handled the zone.\"   More-\r\n\nover,  Pedersen knew at the time that both his immediate supervi-\r\n\nsor, Northeast Zone Manager Bill Kutchera, and Billmyer, regional\r\n\nmanager  for the  eastern  United States,  as  well as  Cardiges,\r\n\nworked  at Honda  headquarters  in New  Jersey.   In  fact,  when\r\n\nPedersen  told Kutchera  about the  cash  bribe tendered  by Lia,\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nKutchera  advised Pedersen to ask for a gift certificate in place\r\n\nof the  cash.  Accordingly,  Pedersen ultimately accepted  a $300\r\n\ngift  certificate  from Lia  with  Kutchera's  explicit approval.\r\n\nAround this same  time, Kutchera also  told Pedersen that  during\r\n\nthe course of the previous year  he had received two Rolex watch-\r\n\nes, a cruise, furniture, and other gifts, valued at $13,000, from\r\n\nvarious dealers.\r\n\n          Pedersen testified that he frequently  discussed dealer\r\n\npayoffs with Roger  Novelly and Larry Finley,  his Honda supervi-\r\n\nsors in Ohio.  Novelly, the assistant zone manager,  specifically\r\n\ntold Pedersen that  Billmyer and Cardiges were  being \"taken care\r\n\nof\" by dealers, and  Finley, the zone manager, admitted  that Tom\r\n\nBohlander  had paid  him for  the Honda  \"open  point\" dealership\r\n\nfranchise in West Cleveland.9  See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 243\r                                                          \r\n\n(noting that tacit accord among alleged conspirators is permissi-\r\n\nbly inferred from evidence that defendants  \"often spoke to their\r\n\nvictims  about other victims  or other defendants  in words which\r\n\nplainly revealed that the crimes were interdependent\").  Based on\r\n\nthis  evidence,  and there  was more,  the  jury would  have been\r\n\npermitted to draw the reasonable  inference that Pedersen and his\r\n\nvarious supervisors over the years had developed a  shared under-\r                                                                    \r\n\nstanding of an \"unwritten  policy\" at Honda:  dealers had  to pay\r\n\nBillmyer and Cardiges, as  well as other sales executives  in the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9Significantly,  Cardiges  identified  Finley, Novelly,  and\r\nKutchera as fellow conspirators.  In addition, Pedersen testified\r\nthat he  subsequently received $5,000  from John  Rosatti, a  New\r\nYork Honda dealer who admittedly paid both Cardiges and Billmyer.\r\nSee supra Section II.B.3(a).\r                   \r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nchain of command, in order to receive a Honda or Acura  franchise\r\n\nor other favorable treatment.  Id.\r                                           \r\n\n          John Orsini,  a Honda and Acura  dealer in Connecticut,\r\n\nprovided  corroborative  testimony at  trial,  characterizing the\r\n\nkickbacks he had made to Billmyer, Pedersen,  and Damien Budnick,\r\n\nPedersen's subordinate,  as a \"way of doing business\" with Honda.\r\n\nAt Budnick's  suggestion, Orsini  met with Billmyer  in September\r\n\n1987  to discuss obtaining another Acura dealership.  A few weeks\r\n\nlater, Billmyer offered  Orsini a franchise in  Nanuet, New York,\r\n\nif Orsini created a \"no-show\" job for Billmyer's friend,  Douglas\r\n\nT.  Richert, at  $1,000  per week.    After Orsini  accepted  the\r\n\nBillmyer proposal, he received the Nanuet LOI.   \r\n\n          Around the same time, Orsini discussed with Budnick and\r\n\nPedersen the possibility that Orsini  might obtain a new  dealer-\r\n\nship franchise in Salem,  New Hampshire.  According to  Pedersen,\r\n\nOrsini  and other  dealers routinely  and unilaterally  mentioned\r\n\nBillmyer's  name in conversation, as a means of \"impress[ing]\" on\r\n\nPedersen the  dealers' established connections  with higher-level\r\n\nHonda  sales managers.   Orsini  told Pedersen  that he  would be\r\n\nwilling  to  pay for  the Salem  franchise,  but not  the $50,000\r\n\ndemanded by Budnick.   After  agreeing to help  secure the  Salem\r\n\ndealership for Orsini in February 1988, Pedersen received between\r\n\n$2,000 and $4,000  in cash from Orsini.   Thus, given the circum-\r\n\nstantial evidence that both Billmyer and Pedersen shared a common\r\n\ngoal or plan to defraud Honda  by accepting illicit consideration\r\n\nfor awarding new dealership franchises, the jury reasonably could\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\ninfer, by  a preponderance  of  the evidence,  that Billmyer  and\r\n\nPedersen  defrauded  Honda  in  connection with  the  Salem,  New\r\n\nHampshire LOI by accepting payoffs from a common  source, Orsini.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Brandon,  17 F.3d at  450 (finding single  conspiracy,\r                            \r\n\ndespite variations in details  and tactics, where main objective,\r\n\nstructure,  intended  victim, and  modus  operandi remained  con-\r\n\nstant); supra Section I. \r                       \r\n\n          In addition to accepting  illicit payments from Lia and\r\n\nOrsini,  the  record  demonstrates,  by a  preponderance  of  the\r\n\nevidence, that  Pedersen committed an overt act  in New Hampshire\r\n\nin  furtherance of the Count  II conspiracy, by  accepting a free\r\n\nAcura Integra  from Bohlander's West  Cleveland, Ohio, dealership\r\n\nin  1986.  After Bohlander  and Pedersen became friends, Pedersen\r\n\nagreed  to  help  Bohlander  acquire more  Acura  dealerships  in\r\n\nexchange for a silent  ownership interest in a Nashua,  New Hamp-\r\n\nshire, dealership.   Pedersen  recommended Bohlander for  the new\r\n\nNashua  franchise,  and  in  due course  Bohlander  received  it.\r\n\nAlthough  Pedersen later  declined an  ownership interest  in the\r\n\nNashua  dealership,  he  nonetheless  let  Bohlander  pay roughly\r\n\n$18,000  in college tuition fees  for Pedersen's son.   Thus, the\r\n\nevidence sufficed to demonstrate,  by a preponderance, that venue\r\n\nwas proper in the District of New Hampshire.  See Uribe, 890 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 558.\r\n\n          Finally, there was evidence  from which a rational jury\r\n\nreasonably could have  inferred, by a  preponderance of the  evi-\r\n\ndence,  that Bohlander  routinely paid  Billmyer and  Cardiges as\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nwell.   Pedersen described  a  card game  at Bohlander's  Florida\r\n\ncondominium  in February  1991,  during which  Bohlander and  Lou\r\n\nTecco, a  dealer associated  with Marty Luftgarten,  talked about\r\n\npaying  bribes as a \"way of doing business\" with Honda, and noted\r\n\nthat Billmyer and Cardiges had to be paid in order to get dealer-\r\n\nships  and other  favorable treatment.   Along with  the evidence\r\n\nthat Bohlander had paid Finley for  the West Cleveland dealership\r\n\nand that dealers commonly bribed sales executives at each succes-\r\n\nsive level, see  supra p. 22, Pedersen's  testimony permitted the\r                                \r\n\njury reasonably to conclude that it was more likely than not that\r\n\nBohlander  had paid Billmyer, the Acura Division head, as well as\r\n\nPedersen, in return for the Nashua dealership in 1987.  Thus, the\r\n\nsimilarity in the pattern  of fraudulent transactions relating to\r\n\nnew dealership franchises, the  common core of \"insider\" partici-\r\n\npants, and  the temporal  overlap would  enable  a rational  jury\r\n\nreasonably to infer, under the applicable preponderance standard,\r\n\nthat Pedersen,  Billmyer, Josleyn, and Cardiges  agreed, at least\r\n\ntacitly, to defraud Honda by accepting illicit consideration from\r\n\ncandidates for  new Honda dealership franchises  in direct viola-\r\n\ntion  of established Honda policy and procedures.

This  claim fails as\r\n\nwell. \r\n\n          In United  States v.

Given that  the proper\r                       \r\n\ninquiry under Allard is whether  Josleyn intended to defraud  the\r                              \r\n\ndealers  and advertising  associations  into  parting with  their\r\n\nmoney, there  was ample  evidence, particularly the  testimony of\r\n\nCardiges,  to support  the  jury verdicts  against Josleyn  under\r\n\nCounts I, III, and IV.             2.

Ordinarily, a  defendant is entitled to an  instruction on\r\n\nhis theory of  the case as long as it is  legally valid and there\r\n\nis sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n\ndefendant, to permit a reasonable juror to credit the defendant's\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\ntheory.

The government does not dispute that the evidence adduced\r\n\nat  trial would  have  permitted the  jury  to find  that  native\r\n\nJapanese  executives at  the highest  levels of  Honda implicitly\r\n\ncondoned the  acceptance of bribes and  kickbacks.  Nevertheless,\r\n\nthe trial court need not adopt the precise instructional language\r\n\nproposed by the defendant.   United States v. DeStefano,  59 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995).  \r\n\n          Viewed as a  whole, we think  the instruction given  by\r\n\nthe district court fairly summarized Josleyn's defense theory: \r\n\n          Since  the  essential  element of  the  crime\r\n          charged is intent to defraud, it follows that\r\n          good faith on  the part of the defendant is a\r\n          complete defense to  a charge of mail  fraud.\r\n          A defendant,  however has no burden to estab-\r\n          lish a defense of good faith.  The burden  is\r\n          on the government  to prove fraudulent intent\r\n          and the consequent lack of good faith  beyond\r\n          a reasonable doubt. \r\n               . . . .\r\n\n               It  is the defendant Josleyn's theory of\r\n          the case that American Honda knew of and con-\r\n          doned; that  is, gave  tacit approval  to the\r\n          activities  of its  employees alleged  in the\r\n          indictment  that  were  in violation  of  its\r\n          policies.  American Honda's knowledge or con-\r\n          donation of the commission of an offense does\r\n          not  by  itself  constitute a  defense  or an\r                                   \r\n          excuse.

Mr.  Josleyn contends  that\r                                  \r\n          because  he believed  American Honda  knew of\r\n          and condoned the  activities in question,  he\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\n          did not possess the required intent to commit\r\n          the offenses with which he is charged. \r\n               The  defendant  has no  obligation what-\r\n          soever  to prove  to you  that his  theory is\r\n          correct, but rather  the burden is always  on\r\n          the government to prove  all of the  material\r\n          elements  of  each offense  charged  beyond a\r\n          reasonable doubt[,] including the  element of\r\n          intent with  respect to each  offense[,] as I\r\n          have  already  explained to  you.   (Emphasis\r\n          added.) \r\n\n          The  charge  given  by  the  trial  judge  unmistakably\r\n\npermitted  the jury to  consider all the  condonation evidence in\r\n\ndetermining whether  Josleyn had  formed the requisite  intent to\r\n\ndefraud Honda.   No more was required.  See generally New England\r                                                                           \r\n\nEnters.,  Inc. v.

Cardiges  testified that he  neither autho-\r\n\nrized the press statements,  nor knew their basis.   On redirect,\r\n\nthe prosecutor  elicited testimony  that though Cardiges  and his\r\n\nattorney  had been  afforded  \"open access\"  to the  government's\r\n\nfile, Cardiges had  seen \"no documents  that either indicated  or\r\n\nshow[ed] that the Japanese knew anything about kickbacks or gifts\r\n\nor anything like that.\"  In response, Josleyn's counsel sought to\r\n\nconfront Cardiges with several  FBI interview reports    obtained\r\n\nfrom the government's file    which contained statements by Honda\r\n\nemployees to the effect  that the Japanese knew about  the bribes\r\n\nand kickbacks.  \r\n\n          The district court permitted defense counsel to use the\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nFBI reports for impeachment purposes, i.e., to show that Cardiges\r                                                    \r\n\neither did not  tell the  truth, or had  not reviewed the  entire\r                                                                           \r\n\ncontents  of the government  file.  But the  court ruled that the\r\n\nFBI interview  reports were  inadmissible hearsay if  offered for\r\n\ntheir truth.   See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 480-81;  Fed. R. Evid.\r                                       \r\n\n801(c) (defining  hearsay).  On  appeal, Josleyn argues  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  impermissibly restricted  recross-examination by\r\n\nrefusing  to allow the jury to consider all hearsay statements in\r                                                     \r\n\nthe FBI interview reports.  \r\n\n          Our review  of the trial transcripts  satisfies us that\r\n\nthe district court  accorded Josleyn ample leeway  to explore the\r\n\nFBI interview  reports in sufficient  detail to  enable the  jury\r\n\nfairly to weigh Cardiges'  testimony relating to the government's\r\n\nfile.   For  example, Cardiges  admitted on  recross that  he had\r\n\nnever seen the FBI  interview reports, and was \"quite  sure\" that\r\n\nhe was  not able to get  through the \"thousands and  thousands of\r\n\ndocuments\"  during the  four-hour period  he spent  reviewing the\r\n\ngovernment file.  The district  court did sustain several hearsay\r\n\nobjections when  defense counsel  attempted to delve  more deeply\r\n\ninto  the  contents of  the  FBI interview  reports.   It  did so\r\n\nproperly,  however, since  Josleyn  proffered  no  relevant  non-\r\n\nhearsay purpose  for  probing  further.   Cf.  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHudson,  970 F.2d 948,  956-57 (1st  Cir. 1992)  (defense counsel\r                \r\n\nresponded to  hearsay objection  with impeachment proffer).

The government produced some of the Proulx\r\n\nmaterials before trial, including a summary of his FBI interview,\r\n\nbut found and  unseasonably produced  additional material  months\r\n\nlater    upon learning that Josleyn intended  to call Proulx as a\r\n\nwitness     tending to show  that Honda's  Japanese managers  had\r\n\ncondoned  the illegal activities in  its sales division.

Due to its\r                      \r\n\ngreater  familiarity with the dynamics  of the case,  we will not\r\n\nreverse a district court's ruling on delayed disclosure unless it\r\n\namounts to a demonstrable abuse  of discretion.

We discern\r                                                              \r\n\nno abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          First, a principal concern  in delayed disclosure cases\r\n\n    whether the failure to supply the information in a seasonable\r\n\nfashion  caused the defense to change its trial strategy, see id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 290    is not significantly implicated in this case.   Josleyn\r\n\nconsistently  pursued the  same  defense theory  both before  and\r\n\nafter  the Proulx materials  were provided,  by arguing  that the\r\n\nJapanese  managers at  Honda  had condoned  the charged  conduct.\r\n\nSecondly, even though the Proulx materials unquestionably provid-\r\n\ned additional support  for the condonation \"defense,\" we  are not\r\n\npersuaded  that the  delay in  disclosure adversely  affected the\r\n\ndefense in any important respect.  In fact, while Cardiges was on\r\n\nthe   witness  stand,   Josleyn's  counsel  observed   that  \"the\r\n\ngovernment's file is like 100,000 pages  or so.\"  See also  infra\r                                                                           \r\n\nnote  10.   The defense  took full  advantage of  the condonation\r\n\nevidence  by using it  in its own  case, even before  the tardily\r\n\nproduced Proulx materials were  made available, then featured the\r\n\n                                32\r\r\n\ngovernment's delayed disclosure in its closing argument.10  \r\n\n          On  this record,  we think  the district  court soundly\r\n\nconcluded that the Proulx materials added little to  the evidence\r\n\npreviously  produced by  the government,  and therefore  its late\r\n\ndisclosure  had not  impeded Josleyn's  defense to  a significant\r\n\ndegree.  See United States v.  Catano, 65 F.3d 219, 227 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1995)   (noting   cumulativeness   of   impeachment   materials);\r\n\nSepulveda, 15  F.3d  at 1179  (holding  that failure  to  produce\r                   \r\n\n\"incremental information\" caused no prejudice).   We note as well\r\n\nthat Josleyn makes no claim that the prosecutor intentionally de-\r\n\nlayed disclosure.  \r\n\n          Furthermore,  and by  no  means least  importantly, the\r\n\nonly  relief Josleyn requested was  the outright dismissal of the\r\n\nindictment.  The district court  has broad discretion to  redress\r\n\ndiscovery  violations  in  light  of their  seriousness  and  any\r\n\nprejudice occasioned the defendant.

The important  precept that  the prosecutor  may not\r\n\nvouch  for  the credibility  of  a government  witness  is deeply\r\n\nrooted in American law.

I call it disgusting.\"  Later, he\r\nadded:   \"You want to see  mail fraud?  Stick  this indictment in\r\nthe mail and you'll see a mail fraud.\"  Josleyn's counsel made an\r\nimproper appeal for jury  nullification as well:   \"People aren't\r\nborn and  the Almighty says  you may be  a prosecutor.   That's a\r\nright that's given by  the people.  It's a trust.   And when it's\r\nabused, somebody's got to do something about it.\"  \r\n\n                                35\r\r\n\nprosecutor  places  the  credibility  of counsel  at  issue,  the\r\n\nadvantage lies with the government . . . .\") (citations omitted).\r\n\nThus, a prosecutor may not lend the prestige of the government to\r\n\nbuttress a  witness, nor  indicate to  the jury that  information\r\n\nknown to the prosecutor, but  not admitted in evidence,  supports\r\n\nthe government's theory of the case.

As Billmyer acknowledges a sound factual basis for the   \r\n\n3B1.3  enhancement, we  need only  apply the  pertinent guideline\r\n\nlanguage. \r\n\n          If the defendant abused a position  of public\r\n          or private trust, or used a special skill, in\r\n          a manner that  significantly facilitated  the\r\n          commission  or  concealment  of the  offense,\r\n          increase  by 2  levels.  This  adjustment may\r                                 2                               \r\n          not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill\r                                                                 \r\n          is  included  in  the base  offense  level or\r                                                                 \r\n          specific offense characteristic.   \r                                                   \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.3 (Nov. 1995) (emphasis added).  \r\n\n          The district court applied U.S.S.G.   2B4.1 (commercial\r\n\nbribery) to  determine Billmyer's BOL.   As the  specific offense\r\n\ncharacteristics  listed in   2B4.1(b) are  not germane,13 we must\r\n\nconsider  whether the  BOL prescribed  in    2B4.1  \"included\" an\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13Section 2B4.1(b) provides:\r\n\n     Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n\n     (1)  If  the greater of the  value of the  bribe or the\r\n          improper  benefit  conferred exceeded  $2,000, in-\r\n          crease  the  offense  level by  the  corresponding\r\n          number  of levels  from the  table in   2F1.1 [of-\r\n          fense-conduct   guideline   for   fraud  and   de-\r\n          ceit/forgery].\r\n\n     (2)  If the offense --\r\n\n          (A)  substantially  jeopardizes   the  safety  and\r\n               soundness of a financial institution; or \r\n\n          (B)  affected  a  financial  institution  and  the\r\n               defendant  derived  more  than $1,000,000  in\r\n               gross receipts from the offense,\r\n\n          increase by  4 levels.

Thus,  in its  main thrust the  present challenge  at-\r\n\ntempts  to  equate  Billmyer's commercial  bribery  offense  with\r\n\nbribery  of a public official.   According to  Billmyer, the same\r\n\ngeneral  rule  must  apply  because public  bribery  and  private\r\n\nbribery are \"virtually identical\" offenses.   We are not persuad-\r\n\ned. \r\n\n          The  absence of  an explicit provision  restricting the\r                                                \r\n\napplication  of  the  abuse-of-trust  enhancement  in  commercial\r\n\nbribery cases  severely undercuts the analogy  urged by Billmyer.\r\n\nSee United States v.

For example, in\r\n\nUnited States  v. Butt, 955  F.2d 77  (1st Cir. 1992),  the court\r                                \r\n\nprovided  clear explication  of  its rationale  for upholding  an\r\n\nabuse-of-trust  enhancement  in  the  case of  a  police  officer\r\n\nconvicted on a RICO charge, even though the underlying racketeer-\r\n\ning activity included extortion under color of right.  \r\n\n          The  base offense  level  prescribed  by  the\r\n          guidelines for a particular  crime presumably\r\n          reflects,  or \"includes,\"  those characteris-\r\n          tics considered by Congress  to inhere in the\r\n          crime  at issue.   In  the case  of extortion\r\n          under color of right, abuse of trust would be\r\n          one such characteristic, since Congress could\r\n          reasonably have determined  that every act of\r\n          extortion  under color  of right  involves an\r\n          abuse of  public  trust.   Because  the  RICO\r\n          statute,  by  contrast,  can be  violated  in\r\n          innumerable ways, there are, arguably, no of-\r\n          fense  characteristics  common  to  all  RICO\r\n          offenses.\r\n\nId. at 89.  The same holds true here.  \r             \r\n\n          Billmyer  was convicted  of  mail  fraud conspiracy  in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   371.  As not every mail fraud conspiracy\r\n\ninvolves an abuse of  trust, we cannot conclude that  the BOL for\r\n\ncommercial bribery necessarily includes an abuse-of-trust element\r\n\nso as to preclude an enhancement pursuant to   3B1.3.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Yet the court\r\n\nnoted that the statute did  not define a single crime, see  id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n215(a)(1) (prohibiting  person from offering bribe  to bank offi-\r                                                      \r\n\ncer), and  reasoned that  it would be  wrong to require  that the\r                                                                 \r\n\nbriber,  who did  not  necessarily breach  a  position of  trust,\r\n\nreceive  the   same  sentence  as   the  bank-officer  recipient.\r\n\nSinclair, 74 F.3d at 763.  Similarly, we think Billmyer's greater\r                  \r\n\nculpability, relative to other defendants who need not necessari-\r\n\nly  have abused a position of trust in the course of a mail fraud\r\n\nconspiracy, entitled the  district court  to impose  the    3B1.3\r\n\nadjustment in this case.

Just as demand in the United States surged, the Japanese government imposed export restraints on its carmakers, and Honda was unable to meet the demand for its automobiles in the United States.  These uncommonly favorable market conditions endured throughout much of the 1980s, causing enterprising car dealers in the United States to compete fiercely (and sometimes unfairly) for exclusive Honda franchises in anticipation of the extraordinarily large profit margins available on such popular Honda models as the Civic, Prelude, and Accord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant John Billmyer joined Honda as a district sales representative in 1970, and rose rapidly through all four management levels in its field sales division.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  By 1977, Billmyer had been appointed regional sales manager for the eastern United States.  By 1980, he held the top field sales position at Honda--national sales manager--and soon moved from its New Jersey office to headquarters in California.  When Honda launched a line of luxury automobiles in 1985, Billmyer became national sales manager for the new Acura Division as well.  He remained the top Honda field sales manager in the United States until he retired on March 31, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Billmyer retired, he was succeeded as national sales manager by S. James Cardiges, his closest associate at Honda.  Billmyer had hired Cardiges as the Honda sales manager for the Baltimore/Washington D.C. district in 1977, and rapidly promoted him through the ranks:  from zone manager for the mid-Atlantic states in 1979, to zone manager for the west coast (the largest and most prestigious zone) in 1981, to regional sales manager for the western United States in late 1982.  While western regional sales manager, Cardiges worked closely with Billmyer.  The two often traveled to work together and took business trips within the United States and overseas.  Finally, Cardiges succeeded Billmyer as national sales manager in 1988.  He resigned in April 1992 by \"mutual agreement\" with Honda, to forfend termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Dennis R.

Next, the district and zone sales managers for the area under consideration were to \"prospect\" for a qualified dealer to fill the \"open point,\" then compose a slate of three or more suitable candidates.  Honda policy directed that sales managers evaluate candidates according to their experience in automobile retailing, available capital, personal reputation, and the quality of their location and facilities, all with the ultimate aim that Honda dealerships be awarded to the best candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Honda sales managers at each level, see supra note 2, were required to participate in recommending and approving candidates for any \"open point.\"   With the possible exception of Billmyer and Cardiges, in their respective capacities as national sales manager, no sales manager at any level possessed unilateral authority to award a new dealership.   Furthermore, approval was required from managers representing the parts, service, and market-representation departments as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once selected for an \"open point\" dealership, with the approval of sales managers at the district, zone, regional, and national levels, a successful candidate received a \"Letter of Intent\" (\"LOI\") from Honda via United States mail, authorizing the prospective dealer to open the new, exclusive dealership upon certain conditions, such as constructing a facility within a specified time.  Until the franchise itself was issued to the prospective dealer, however, these LOI rights remained the property of Honda.  Like its competitors, Honda exacted no fee for its dealership franchises.  Nor were Honda personnel allowed to accept money or other consideration of significant value for assistance in obtaining a Honda franchise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Honda policy and procedures governing new dealerships, its \"conflict of interest\" policy prohibited employees from accepting anything of significant value from a Honda dealer and from acquiring or holding any interest in a Honda or Acura dealership.  The \"conflict of interest\" policy was disseminated among all Honda sales managers, who were required to sign disclosure forms indicating ongoing compliance.  Sales managers at every level were duty-bound to ensure that their respective subordinates honored the policy prohibiting conflicts of interest, and report all violations to their senior manager or the Human Resources Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding these rigorous internal procedures, however, there were numerous violations of the \"conflict of interest\" policy.  From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, sales managers at every level commonly accepted money and valuable gifts, including Rolex watches, furniture, and business suits, from prospective dealers vying for \"open points\" or from dealers seeking increased Honda automobile allocations.  Yet their illicit activities apparently escaped notice by nonparticipating sales managers and dealers for years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in 1991 an internal investigation was triggered by an uninvolved district sales representative in Arkansas who provided a Honda executive vice-president with evidence of payoffs involving Cardiges, then the national sales manager, and a zone manager.  By early 1992, Honda had begun \"cleaning house\" and Cardiges had resigned.  An extensive federal criminal investigation ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 1994, a federal grand jury in New Hampshire returned an indictment against Billmyer, Josleyn, Cardiges and two lower-level Honda sales managers responsible for the New England region, David L. Pedersen and Damien C. Budnick.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Superseding indictments were returned against Billmyer, Josleyn, and Cardiges in October 1994 and January 1995.  Ultimately, Budnick, Cardiges, and Pedersen entered into plea agreements and cooperated with the government.  Cardiges and Pedersen were key government witnesses at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second superseding indictment charged Josleyn and Cardiges, in Count I, with a pattern of racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) (1994).  As Racketeering Act 1, it alleged that Josleyn and Cardiges had persuaded Honda to select a particular outside vendor (from which the defendants had received kickbacks) to conduct sales training seminars for Honda salespeople employed in New Hampshire and elsewhere in the United States.  Racketeering Acts 2 through 8 related to regional advertising associations which pooled monies advanced by individual Honda dealers to defray their local Honda advertising costs.  Josleyn and Cardiges were charged with causing Honda to match the contributions made by the Honda dealers to these regional advertising associations, on the condition that the advertising associations hire a particular vendor (controlled by Josleyn's brother) to provide the advertising services.  After receiving payments from the regional advertising associations, the vendor allegedly made kickbacks to Josleyn and Cardiges.  Other Racketeering Acts described in Count I alleged, inter alia, that Josleyn and Cardiges received kickbacks for awarding numerous LOIs to various dealership candidates in California, Maryland, New York, and other states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count II charged Billmyer, Cardiges, and Josleyn with conspiring to defraud Honda by accepting payments and other valuable consideration from dealers and prospective dealers in exchange for LOIs or other preferred treatment.  Count III (conspiracy) and Count IV (mail fraud) charged Josleyn and Cardiges with accepting kickbacks from 1989 through 1992, in relation to the sales training seminars.  Overall, Josleyn was charged in all four counts, whereas Billmyer was charged with the Count II \"dealer franchise\" conspiracy only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on February 7, 1995, before Chief Judge Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  After presenting thirty-five witnesses, including Cardiges and Pedersen and many Honda dealers from around the country, the government rested its case on May 10, 1995.  Billmyer opted to present no witnesses, while Josleyn mounted a defense based on the theory that top Japanese executives in Honda had condoned the activities alleged in the indictment.  At the close of the evidence, the district court denied appellants' renewed Rule 29 motions for judgments of acquittal.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case went to the jury on May 19.  Seven days into the deliberations, guilty verdicts were returned against both Billmyer and Josleyn.  After denying their motions for judgments of acquittal, the district court sentenced Billmyer to a five-year prison term and a $125,000 fine;  and Josleyn to six and one-half years in prison on Count I and a five-year prison term on each of the three remaining counts, all to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Joinder of Defendants</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in the district court, Josleyn and Billmyer contend on appeal that their joint indictment and trial violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 8.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal courts have long recognized that consolidated trials tend to promote judicial economy, conserve prosecutorial resources, and foster the consistent resolution of factual disputes common to properly joined defendants.  See, e.g., United States v. MacDonald &amp; Watson Waste Oil Co., 933 F.2d 35, 60 (1st Cir.1991).  In resolving a Rule 8(b) misjoinder claim, the trial court must examine the indictment to determine whether there is a factual basis for joining the defendants.  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 245 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990).  While Rule 8 harbors the potential for unfair prejudice in consolidated trials, see King v. United States, 355 F.2d 700, 703-04 (1st Cir.1966) (Aldrich, C.J.)  (noting risk that jury may infer guilt by association), the rule nonetheless may be generously construed in favor of joinder, given the protective discretion vested in the trial court under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court apparently concluded that the Count II dealer franchise conspiracy charge against Billmyer and Josleyn warranted their joinder under Rule 8(b).  Its conclusion plainly would have been unexceptionable had the indictment contained only Count II, see United States v. Morrow, 39 F.3d 1228, 1237-38 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1421, 131 L.Ed.2d 304 (1995), or had the conspiracy alleged in Count II clearly encompassed all substantive offenses alleged in the indictment.  See United States v. Arruda, 715 F.2d 671, 678 (1st Cir.1983).  Otherwise, joinder under Rule 8(b) was problematic unless the criminal acts alleged in all counts were part of the same series of acts or transactions.  See United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 895 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A misjoinder of defendants requires a reversal only if the resulting prejudice \" 'had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.' \"  United States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 449, 106 S.Ct. 725, 732, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (mandating \"harmless error\" review of Rule 8(b) misjoinder) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).  As it would be incumbent upon this court in all events to conduct the \"harmless error\" analysis mandated in Lane were we to conclude that a misjoinder occurred, see id., and since the misjoinder question itself is far from clear, we will assume, without deciding, that the misjoinder occurred as claimed by Billmyer, and proceed directly to the \"harmless error\" inquiry.  See United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d 499, 504 (1st Cir.)  (bypassing misjoinder question where any error ultimately would prove harmless),  cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 184, 136 L.Ed.2d 123 (1996).   We conclude that any misjoinder was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did the parties marshal their evidentiary presentations to minimize prejudicial spillover, but throughout the trial the district court prudently and carefully cautioned the jury to consider the evidence against each individual defendant.  No less importantly, Billmyer's retirement from Honda, prior to the time Josleyn launched the dealer advertising association and sales training schemes, unquestionably facilitated the individualized factfinding focus to which each defendant was entitled from the jury.  Cf. Morrow, 39 F.3d at 1235-36 (erroneous admission of hearsay under coconspirator exception held to be \"harmless\" given distinctiveness of two fraudulent schemes).  Finally, at the close of all the evidence, the trial judge gave a careful cautionary instruction, once again reminding the jury to consider the evidence against each defendant individually. See Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (limiting instructions mitigate prejudice from misjoinder).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these safeguards may not have sufficed in another case, the evidence against both Billmyer and Josleyn can only be described as overwhelming.  See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 628.   An army of former Honda executives, including Cardiges, Billmyer's protege and eventual successor, as well as numerous Honda dealers, presented a wealth of telling evidence against appellants.  See Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (noting overwhelming evidence of guilt);  see infra Section II.B.3.  Consequently, we are persuaded that no aspect of the jury's decision was substantially influenced by any misjoinder.  See O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 995, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence and Venue (Franchise Conspiracy Count )</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found that both appellants participated in the dealership franchise conspiracy alleged in Count II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Neither appellant seriously disputes that he conspired with Cardiges.  Rather, their principal contention is that there was insufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that they both participated in the same conspiracy with Pedersen, which, they maintain, was essential to establish both the substantive conspiracy charge in Count II and proper venue in New Hampshire.  As their contention confuses the standards of proof applicable to these two distinct issues, and the record demonstrates that the government readily met both, appellants' convictions under Count II must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standard of Proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unchallenged instructions apprised the jury that the government was required to prove four elements, beyond a reasonable doubt, in order to prevail on Count II:  (i) two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged in the indictment;  (ii) the particular defendant, knowing the purpose of the agreement, knowingly and willfully became a member of the conspiracy;  (iii) some member of the conspiracy knowingly committed at least one alleged overt act;  and (iv) at least one overt act was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See, e.g., United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 714 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 653 (1st Cir.1996));  United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 428 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 820, 115 S.Ct. 80, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994).  Thus, the jury need only have found beyond a reasonable doubt that each appellant conspired with at least one other person (e.g., Cardiges), and not necessarily with Pedersen as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside for the moment the question of guilt, see infra Section II.B.3, it is clear that adequate evidence of Pedersen's role in the dealer franchise conspiracy was essential to establish New Hampshire as a proper venue for Count II.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Without objection, the district court instructed the jury that the government must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence (rather than beyond a reasonable doubt), that Pedersen, Billmyer and Josleyn joined the Count II conspiracy and that Pedersen committed the alleged overt act involving the Acura dealership in Nashua, New Hampshire.  See United States v. Cordero, 668 F.2d 32, 45 n. 18 (1st Cir.1981) (applying preponderance standard, as venue is not an element of conspiracy offense);  supra note 6.  Thus, consistent with the unchallenged jury instructions on conspiracy and venue, as well as applicable law, the government could establish venue in New Hampshire by only a preponderance of the evidence, but it was required to prove each appellant's participation in the conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will uphold the verdicts under Count II if a rational juror could have found each substantive element of the alleged conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, United States v. DiMarzo, 80 F.3d 656, 660 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 259, 136 L.Ed.2d 185 (1996), and proper venue by a preponderance of the evidence, Cordero, 668 F.2d at 45 n. 18.   All credibility issues are to be resolved, and every reasonable inference drawn, in the light most favorable to the verdict.  DiMarzo, 80 F.3d at 660;  United States v. Lam Kwong-Wah, 924 F.2d 298, 301 (D.C.Cir.1991) (venue).  A thorough review of the entire record discloses ample evidentiary support for the verdicts against each appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Guilt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Count II conspiracy charge required proof that the particular defendant and at least one other person expressly or tacitly agreed to commit a federal offense.  DiMarzo, 80 F.3d at 660.   The government must have shown that the defendant voluntarily participated to promote a criminal objective.  Brandon, 17 F.3d at 428.   When, as in this case, mail fraud is an alleged goal of the conspiracy, the government must prove either the intent to use the mails or that such use was reasonably foreseeable.  Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 890;  see also United States v. Dray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1137 (1st Cir.)  (noting that intent element in conspiracy differs from substantive mail fraud), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 895, 111 S.Ct. 245, 112 L.Ed.2d 204 (1990).  A particular defendant need not have been familiar with all the details of the conspiracy or with the identities of all other conspirators.  United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 470 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1120, 114 S.Ct. 1072, 1073, 127 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994);  United States v.

Billmyer</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as 1979, while Billmyer was the eastern regional sales manager, Cardiges, as zone manager for the mid-Atlantic states, accepted a $10,000 payment from a Honda dealer in Philadelphia, and split it with Billmyer.  In late 1979 or early 1980, Cardiges presented Billmyer with a gold Rolex watch worth as much as $15,000 from a large Honda dealer in the Washington, D.C. area.  Beginning with the 1984 holiday season and continuing through 1992, Cardiges received $20,000 to $25,000 each year from John Rosatti, a Honda dealer in New York City.  Rosatti told Cardiges that he was paying Billmyer also, because, as Cardiges testified at trial, like other dealers Rosatti wanted \"favorable treatment, wanted more automobiles, more franchises, and wanted the ability to have the ear of the people who were in power at Honda.\"Cardiges and Billmyer both helped a dealer named Rick Hendrick acquire approximately thirty Honda and Acura franchises in various states, including Texas, Georgia, and the Carolinas.  In return, Hendrick helped Cardiges buy a California residence from which Cardiges later realized a $250,000 gain.  Thereafter, Hendrick defrayed approximately $150,000 in interest payments on a loan Cardiges had obtained to buy a $700,000 home in Laguna Hills, California.  During this same 1989-92 time frame, Hendrick intimated to Cardiges that he was involved in financing Billmyer's home in Palm Springs as well.  Cardiges also learned from Billmyer that Hendrick had provided Billmyer with a top-of-the-line BMW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardiges described periodic payoffs from one Marty Luftgarten, who owned dealerships in New Jersey, Philadelphia, and southern California.  For example, at the grand opening of a Luftgarten dealership during the mid-1980s, Billmyer, Cardiges, and two other Honda sales managers, Bill Kutchera and Jeff Conway, gathered in a conference room where Luftgarten handed each an envelope containing $5,000 in cash.  Around the holiday season, another dealer customarily sent Cardiges $5,000 gift certificates from Neiman-Marcus for both Cardiges and Billmyer.  See Boylan, 898 F.2d at 242 (noting that defendants often cooperated with one another by collecting payments).  The record is replete with other evidence of cash payments from dealers and lavish shopping trips to Hong Kong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>b. Josleyn</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, there was ample evidence to enable a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Josleyn conspired with Cardiges and others to defraud Honda in connection with the Honda dealership franchises.  In early 1991, while zone manager for the west coast, Josleyn arranged for a \"friend\" back east, Joe Pope, to pay $150,000 for the \"open point\" in Elk Grove, California.  Josleyn approached Cardiges, national sales manager, and Robert Rivers, regional manager for the western United States, and advised that there would be money in it for all of them if Pope were to receive the Elk Grove dealership.  Thereafter, Cardiges, Rivers, and Josleyn, in direct violation of Honda procedure, decided not to prospect for suitable dealership candidates, and awarded the Elk Grove franchise outright to Pope.  As promised, Pope issued a $150,000 check payable to Gary &amp; Associates, a company controlled by Josleyn and his brother Gary.  Josleyn in turn gave Cardiges and Rivers each $50,000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardiges testified that Ed Temple, a former Honda zone manager, approached him in the summer of 1991 in behalf of Bob Frink, a dealer interested in the Folsom, California point.  Temple had accepted payoffs from dealers while employed by Honda, and after leaving the company in 1989 established a firm--Blakely Consultants--to facilitate payments to Honda executives from dealers seeking new Honda franchises.  Simply put, Temple told Cardiges that Frink was willing to pay Cardiges and Josleyn for the Folsom dealership.  On August 5, 1991, Cardiges signed the Folsom LOI, and on the same day Frink paid Blakely Consultants $500,000 for services rendered.  Three days later, Temple wrote a $166,666 check to Magnum Marketing, a company owned by Josleyn.  Cardiges reported $166,666 from Blakely Consultants on his own 1991 income tax return, although Temple had agreed to hold Cardiges' one-third share until Cardiges left Honda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need belabor the point no further, as there was ample evidence to enable the jury reasonably to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Josleyn was a member of the Count II dealership franchise conspiracy.  See Boylan, 898 F.2d at 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Venue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, venue in a conspiracy case depends upon whether an overt act in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy occurred in the trial district.  United States v. Uribe, 890 F.2d 554, 558 (1st Cir.1989);  see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3237(a) (1994).  The defendant need not have been physically present in the trial district during the conspiracy.  United States v. Santiago, 83 F.3d 20, 24-25 (1st Cir.1996);  see, e.g., Cordero, 668 F.2d at 43-44 (furthering drug importation conspiracy with phone calls to undercover DEA agent in Puerto Rico);  cf. United States v. Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d 1289, 1294 (1st Cir.1993) (contrasting venue for \"group\" and \"individual\" crimes).  The government acknowledges that venue was proper in the District of New Hampshire only if there was enough evidence for a rational jury to find it more likely than not that Pedersen, Josleyn and Billmyer belonged to the Count II conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon joining Honda as a district sales manager in July 1979, see supra notes 2 &amp; 3, Pedersen learned that Honda policy prohibited sales executives from awarding LOIs for personal gain and from accepting gifts valued at more than $25 from dealers.  In keeping with Honda policy, Pedersen objected in December 1979 when Bill Lia, a dealer in upstate New York, stuffed an envelope containing cash into Pedersen's pocket.  Although Pedersen threatened to report the incident, he relented when Lia told him not to worry because Lia had \"already handled the zone.\"   Moreover, Pedersen knew at the time that both his immediate supervisor, Northeast Zone Manager Bill Kutchera, and Billmyer, regional manager for the eastern United States, as well as Cardiges, worked at Honda headquarters in New Jersey.  In fact, when Pedersen told Kutchera about the cash bribe tendered by Lia, Kutchera advised Pedersen to ask for a gift certificate in place of the cash.  Accordingly, Pedersen ultimately accepted a $300 gift certificate from Lia with Kutchera's explicit approval.  Around this same time, Kutchera also told Pedersen that during the course of the previous year he had received two Rolex watches, a cruise, furniture, and other gifts, valued at $13,000, from various dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pedersen testified that he frequently discussed dealer payoffs with Roger Novelly and Larry Finley, his Honda supervisors in Ohio.  Novelly, the assistant zone manager, specifically told Pedersen that Billmyer and Cardiges were being \"taken care of\" by dealers, and Finley, the zone manager, admitted that Tom Bohlander had paid him for the Honda \"open point\" dealership franchise in West Cleveland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 243 (noting that tacit accord among alleged conspirators is permissibly inferred from evidence that defendants \"often spoke to their victims about other victims or other defendants in words which plainly revealed that the crimes were interdependent\").  Based on this evidence, and there was more, the jury would have been permitted to draw the reasonable inference that Pedersen and his various supervisors over the years had developed a shared understanding of an \"unwritten policy\" at Honda:  dealers had to pay Billmyer and Cardiges, as well as other sales executives in the chain of command, in order to receive a Honda or Acura franchise or other favorable treatment.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Orsini, a Honda and Acura dealer in Connecticut, provided corroborative testimony at trial, characterizing the kickbacks he had made to Billmyer, Pedersen, and Damien Budnick, Pedersen's subordinate, as a \"way of doing business\" with Honda.  At Budnick's suggestion, Orsini met with Billmyer in September 1987 to discuss obtaining another Acura dealership.  A few weeks later, Billmyer offered Orsini a franchise in Nanuet, New York, if Orsini created a \"no-show\" job for Billmyer's friend, Douglas T. Richert, at $1,000 per week.  After Orsini accepted the Billmyer proposal, he received the Nanuet LOI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the same time, Orsini discussed with Budnick and Pedersen the possibility that Orsini might obtain a new dealership franchise in Salem, New Hampshire.  According to Pedersen, Orsini and other dealers routinely and unilaterally mentioned Billmyer's name in conversation, as a means of \"impress[ing]\" on Pedersen the dealers' established connections with higher-level Honda sales managers.  Orsini told Pedersen that he would be willing to pay for the Salem franchise, but not the $50,000 demanded by Budnick.  After agreeing to help secure the Salem dealership for Orsini in February 1988, Pedersen received between $2,000 and $4,000 in cash from Orsini.  Thus, given the circumstantial evidence that both Billmyer and Pedersen shared a common goal or plan to defraud Honda by accepting illicit consideration for awarding new dealership franchises, the jury reasonably could infer, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Billmyer and Pedersen defrauded Honda in connection with the Salem, New Hampshire LOI by accepting payoffs from a common source, Orsini.  See, e.g., Brandon, 17 F.3d at 450 (finding single conspiracy, despite variations in details and tactics, where main objective, structure, intended victim, and modus operandi remained constant);  supra Section I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to accepting illicit payments from Lia and Orsini, the record demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Pedersen committed an overt act in New Hampshire in furtherance of the Count II conspiracy, by accepting a free Acura Integra from Bohlander's West Cleveland, Ohio, dealership in 1986.  After Bohlander and Pedersen became friends, Pedersen agreed to help Bohlander acquire more Acura dealerships in exchange for a silent ownership interest in a Nashua, New Hampshire, dealership.  Pedersen recommended Bohlander for the new Nashua franchise, and in due course Bohlander received it.  Although Pedersen later declined an ownership interest in the Nashua dealership, he nonetheless let Bohlander pay roughly $18,000 in college tuition fees for Pedersen's son.  Thus, the evidence sufficed to demonstrate, by a preponderance, that venue was proper in the District of New Hampshire.  See Uribe, 890 F.2d at 558.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there was evidence from which a rational jury reasonably could have inferred, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bohlander routinely paid Billmyer and Cardiges as well.  Pedersen described a card game at Bohlander's Florida condominium in February 1991, during which Bohlander and Lou Tecco, a dealer associated with Marty Luftgarten, talked about paying bribes as a \"way of doing business\" with Honda, and noted that Billmyer and Cardiges had to be paid in order to get dealerships and other favorable treatment.  Along with the evidence that Bohlander had paid Finley for the West Cleveland dealership and that dealers commonly bribed sales executives at each successive level, see supra at p. 1192, Pedersen's testimony permitted the jury reasonably to conclude that it was more likely than not that Bohlander had paid Billmyer, the Acura Division head, as well as Pedersen, in return for the Nashua dealership in 1987.  Thus, the similarity in the pattern of fraudulent transactions relating to new dealership franchises, the common core of \"insider\" participants, and the temporal overlap would enable a rational jury reasonably to infer, under the applicable preponderance standard, that Pedersen, Billmyer, Josleyn, and Cardiges agreed, at least tacitly, to defraud Honda by accepting illicit consideration from candidates for new Honda dealership franchises in direct violation of established Honda policy and procedures.  See Morrow, 39 F.3d at 1233-34;  Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d at 668 (noting that conspirators need not know all co-conspirators);  see also United States v. Richerson, 833 F.2d 1147, 1152-54 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Claims By Josleyn</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Sufficiency of the Evidence (Counts I, III &amp; IV )</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the government rested its case, Josleyn moved for acquittal under Counts I, III, and IV, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Honda dealers and their dealer advertising associations had been victimized by the alleged mail fraud since the dealers and advertising associations had received the sales training and advertising services for which they paid.  This claim fails as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237 (1st Cir.1991), we explained that it is no \"defense that the victim received something in exchange even if it was equivalent in value to what the victim was deceived into relinquishing.\"  Id. at 1242 (citing United States v. King, 860 F.2d 54, 55 (2d Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1065, 109 S.Ct. 2062, 104 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989)).  Given that the proper inquiry under Allard is whether Josleyn intended to defraud the dealers and advertising associations into parting with their money, there was ample evidence, particularly the testimony of Cardiges, to support the jury verdicts against Josleyn under Counts I, III, and IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Jury Instructions on Condonation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Josleyn's proposed jury instruction that the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Honda had not condoned Josleyn's fraudulent activities.  Ordinarily, a defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of the case as long as it is legally valid and there is sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, to permit a reasonable juror to credit the defendant's theory.  United States v. Flores, 968 F.2d 1366, 1368-69 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Shenker, 933 F.2d 61, 65 (1st Cir.1991).  The government does not dispute that the evidence adduced at trial would have permitted the jury to find that native Japanese executives at the highest levels of Honda implicitly condoned the acceptance of bribes and kickbacks.  Nevertheless, the trial court need not adopt the precise instructional language proposed by the defendant.  United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed as a whole, we think the instruction given by the district court fairly summarized Josleyn's defense theory:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>Since the essential element of the crime charged is intent to defraud, it follows that good faith on the part of the defendant is a complete defense to a charge of mail fraud.  A defendant, however has no burden to establish a defense of good faith.  The burden is on the government to prove fraudulent intent and the consequent lack of good faith beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the defendant Josleyn's theory of the case that American Honda knew of and condoned;  that is, gave tacit approval to the activities of its employees alleged in the indictment that were in violation of its policies.  American Honda's knowledge or condonation of the commission of an offense does not by itself constitute a defense or an excuse.  However, any evidence of American Honda's actions or omissions, or evidence of deficiencies in the manner in which it implemented and enforced its policies and procedures, may be considered by you to the extent that such evidence bears on the issue of whether or not Mr. Josleyn formed the required intent to commit the crimes with which he is charged.   Mr. Josleyn contends that because he believed American Honda knew of and condoned the activities in question, he did not possess the required intent to commit the offenses with which he is charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant has no obligation whatsoever to prove to you that his theory is correct, but rather the burden is always on the government to prove all of the material elements of each offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt[,] including the element of intent with respect to each offense[,] as I have already explained to you.  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge given by the trial judge unmistakably permitted the jury to consider all the condonation evidence in determining whether Josleyn had formed the requisite intent to defraud Honda.  No more was required.  See generally New England Enters., Inc. v. United States, 400 F.2d 58, 71-72 (1st Cir.1968) (discussing \"good faith\" defense to mail fraud), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1036, 89 S.Ct. 654, 21 L.Ed.2d 581 (1969).  Since Josleyn neither cites authority, nor demonstrates, that any condonation by Honda was relevant to an element of the charged offenses other than intent, see Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 890-91 (listing elements of mail fraud conspiracy and substantive mail fraud);  see also Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1558-60 (1st Cir.1994) (RICO), we conclude that the jury instruction given by the district court was adequate.  See DeStefano, 59 F.3d at 3;  Shenker, 933 F.2d at 65-66 (rejecting proposed instruction predicated on impermissibly broad defense);  cf. United States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 464 (2d Cir.1991) (mail fraud statute protects property interests of shareholders and corporation against officers' schemes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Impeachment of Cardiges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Josleyn contends that though the prosecutor was responsible for deliberately suborning false testimony from Cardiges, the district court unduly impeded Josleyn's efforts to impeach Cardiges on cross-examination.  These claims are meritless.  See generally United States v. Osorio, 929 F.2d 753, 759-60 (1st Cir.1991) (approving reasonable restrictions by trial court on repetitive, harassing, unduly prejudicial, irrelevant, or otherwise improper cross-examination);  cf. United States v. Tavares, 93 F.3d 10, 14-15 (1st Cir.1996) (rejecting baseless perjury allegation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Cardiges to explain two newspaper articles in which his lawyer reportedly stated that the government had evidence that the top Japanese managers at Honda knew about the alleged criminal activities in its sales division.  Cardiges testified that he neither authorized the press statements, nor knew their basis.  On redirect, the prosecutor elicited testimony that though Cardiges and his attorney had been afforded \"open access\" to the government's file, Cardiges had seen \"no documents that either indicated or show[ed] that the Japanese knew anything about kickbacks or gifts or anything like that.\"   In response, Josleyn's counsel sought to confront Cardiges with several FBI interview reports--obtained from the government's file--which contained statements by Honda employees to the effect that the Japanese knew about the bribes and kickbacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court permitted defense counsel to use the FBI reports for impeachment purposes, i.e., to show that Cardiges either did not tell the truth, or had not reviewed the entire contents of the government file.  But the court ruled that the FBI interview reports were inadmissible hearsay if offered for their truth.  See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 480-81;  Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay).  On appeal, Josleyn argues that the district court impermissibly restricted recross-examination by refusing to allow the jury to consider all hearsay statements in the FBI interview reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the trial transcripts satisfies us that the district court accorded Josleyn ample leeway to explore the FBI interview reports in sufficient detail to enable the jury fairly to weigh Cardiges' testimony relating to the government's file.  For example, Cardiges admitted on recross that he had never seen the FBI interview reports, and was \"quite sure\" that he was not able to get through the \"thousands and thousands of documents\" during the four-hour period he spent reviewing the government file.  The district court did sustain several hearsay objections when defense counsel attempted to delve more deeply into the contents of the FBI interview reports.  It did so properly, however, since Josleyn proffered no relevant non-hearsay purpose for probing further.  Cf. United States v. Hudson, 970 F.2d 948, 956-57 (1st Cir.1992) (defense counsel responded to hearsay objection with impeachment proffer).  Nor does Josleyn now challenge these hearsay rulings.  Accordingly, we find no error.  See Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Delayed Disclosure of Condonation Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Josleyn claims that he was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine Cardiges and other prosecution witnesses due to the government's delayed disclosure of certain letters written to the government by Cecil Proulx, a former Honda executive, outlining his efforts in the late 1980s to bring the pervasive bribes and kickbacks to the attention of Honda's top Japanese executives.  The government produced some of the Proulx materials before trial, including a summary of his FBI interview, but found and unseasonably produced additional material months later--upon learning that Josleyn intended to call Proulx as a witness--tending to show that Honda's Japanese managers had condoned the illegal activities in its sales division.  Josleyn unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the indictment on due process grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the specific discovery request for condonation evidence, the government plainly had an obligation to furnish Josleyn with the Proulx materials in a more timely fashion.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1178 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1223, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(C) (discovery relating to documents material to defense);  16(c) (continuing duty to disclose).  Since the government failed seasonably to disclose evidence \"material to guilt or punishment,\" United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 289 (1st Cir.1990) (citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)), which includes both exculpatory and impeachment evidence, we inquire whether as a consequence of the delayed disclosure defense counsel was unable to use the material \"effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant's case.\"  Id. (quoting United States v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 411-12 (1st Cir.1986)).  Due to its greater familiarity with the dynamics of the case, we will not reverse a district court's ruling on delayed disclosure unless it amounts to a demonstrable abuse of discretion.  Id.  We discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a principal concern in delayed disclosure cases--whether the failure to supply the information in a seasonable fashion caused the defense to change its trial strategy, see id. at 290--is not significantly implicated in this case.  Josleyn consistently pursued the same defense theory both before and after the Proulx materials were provided, by arguing that the Japanese managers at Honda had condoned the charged conduct.  Secondly, even though the Proulx materials unquestionably provided additional support for the condonation \"defense,\" we are not persuaded that the delay in disclosure adversely affected the defense in any important respect.  In fact, while Cardiges was on the witness stand, Josleyn's counsel observed that \"the government's file is like 100,000 pages or so.\"   See also infra note 10.  The defense took full advantage of the condonation evidence by using it in its own case, even before the tardily produced Proulx materials were made available, then featured the government's delayed disclosure in its closing argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we think the district court soundly concluded that the Proulx materials added little to the evidence previously produced by the government, and therefore its late disclosure had not impeded Josleyn's defense to a significant degree.  See United States v. Catano, 65 F.3d 219, 227 (1st Cir.1995) (noting cumulativeness of impeachment materials);  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1179 (holding that failure to produce \"incremental information\" caused no prejudice).  We note as well that Josleyn makes no claim that the prosecutor intentionally delayed disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, and by no means least importantly, the only relief Josleyn requested was the outright dismissal of the indictment.  The district court has broad discretion to redress discovery violations in light of their seriousness and any prejudice occasioned the defendant.  Osorio, 929 F.2d at 762-63;  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2) (authorizing district court to \"permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing the evidence not disclosed, or ... enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances\").  On the other hand, the draconian relief demanded by Josleyn was grossly disproportionate both to the prosecution's nonfeasance and any prejudice to the defense.  See Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d at 670 (favoring continuance over dismissal);  accord Devin, 918 F.2d at 290-91.   As Josleyn eschewed various alternative remedies more consonant with the government's culpability and any prejudice to the defense, see, e.g., Osorio, 929 F.2d at 762-63 (noting, as alternative remedies, recalling witness for additional cross-examination, affording defense greater leeway with witnesses, and instructing jury that government failed to meet discovery obligations), we find no abuse of discretion in refusing to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5. Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Josleyn claims that the lead prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of government witnesses, and Cardiges in particular, during rebuttal.  Absent contemporaneous objection, we may notice only \"plain error.\"  United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d 771, 776-77 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995);  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  Viewed in the context of the entire trial, United States v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 682 (1st Cir.1993), the prosecutor's remarks, though plainly inappropriate, did not undermine the fundamental fairness of Josleyn's trial.  See United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 16, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although at times it may be difficult to distinguish improper vouching from zealous advocacy, there can be no doubt that the statements at issue here constituted improper rebuttal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p>Now there was a lot of suggestion of false play in this case.

See United States v. Rosales, 19 F.3d 763, 767 (1st Cir.1994) (prosecutor denied fabricating evidence against defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There should be no need to remind federal prosecutors that they are not free to disregard the bounds of proper argument even in response to perceived provocation.  See Young, 470 U.S. at 18-19, 105 S.Ct. at 1047-48.   The important precept that the prosecutor may not vouch for the credibility of a government witness is deeply rooted in American law.  See Rosales, 19 F.3d at 767 (\"When the prosecutor places the credibility of counsel at issue, the advantage lies with the government ....\") (citations omitted).  Thus, a prosecutor may not lend the prestige of the government to buttress a witness, nor indicate to the jury that information known to the prosecutor, but not admitted in evidence, supports the government's theory of the case.  Young, 470 U.S. at 18-19, 105 S.Ct. at 1047-48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriate response for the prosecutor in these circumstances is to lodge a contemporaneous objection and request an appropriate curative instruction.  See id. at 13, 105 S.Ct. at 1045.   Failing that, the prosecutor is constrained to a fair discussion of the evidence.  But for the brief passage challenged on appeal, see supra at p. 1189, the prosecution adhered to the appropriate standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the \"plain error\" standard, appellants bear the burden of showing that the prosecutor's remarks resulted in prejudice, i.e., affected their substantial rights.  See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  Even then, however, we will not notice error unless it caused \"a miscarriage of justice\" or seriously undermined \"the integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Id.  We must consider the likely impact the prosecutor's remarks had on the jury in light of the entire record, including the closing argument presented by the defense.  Young, 470 U.S. at 16-17, 105 S.Ct. at 1046-47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Compared with defense counsel's attack against the integrity of the prosecuting attorneys throughout closing argument, see supra note 11, their rebuttal was moderate.  See United States v. Oreto, 37 F.3d 739, 746 (1st Cir.1994) (tolerating measured response to repeated attempts to magnify government misconduct), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1161, 130 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1995).  In all events, the district court prudently countered the risk of serious residual prejudice by promptly cautioning the jury that counsel's arguments are not evidence, and directing the jury to base its verdicts solely on the evidence.  See United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.1987).  Given the overwhelming evidence against Josleyn, see supra Section II.B.3(b), the provocative excesses in the closing argument presented by his own counsel, and the timely jury instructions by the district court, the improper remarks by the prosecutor in rebuttal did not rise to the level of plain error.

See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.3 (1995).  We review the &#167; 3B1.3 ruling de novo.  United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1289 (1st Cir.1992).  As Billmyer acknowledges a sound factual basis for the &#167; 3B1.3 enhancement, we need only apply the pertinent guideline language.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p>If the defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense, increase by 2 levels.  This adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in the base offense level or specific offense characteristic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.3 (Nov. 1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court applied U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B4.1 (commercial bribery) to determine Billmyer's BOL.  As the specific offense characteristics listed in &#167; 2B4.1(b) are not germane,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> we must consider whether the BOL prescribed in &#167; 2B4.1 \"included\" an abuse-of-trust component which would render the offense level enhancement invalid under the second sentence in &#167; 3B1.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines prohibit the sentencing court from imposing an abuse-of-trust enhancement in a public bribery case, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2C1.1, comment.  (n. 3), unless special circumstances require reference to other offense guidelines, see id.  &#167; 2C1.1(c).  Thus, in its main thrust the present challenge attempts to equate Billmyer's commercial bribery offense with bribery of a public official.  According to Billmyer, the same general rule must apply because public bribery and private bribery are \"virtually identical\" offenses.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of an explicit provision restricting the application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement in commercial bribery cases severely undercuts the analogy urged by Billmyer.  See United States v. Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 673-74 (1st Cir.1992) (applying expressio unius est exclusio alterius principle in this sentencing context), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 812, 114 S.Ct. 59, 126 L.Ed.2d 28 (1993).  Furthermore, the Sentencing Commission took pains throughout the Guidelines to specify the circumstances in which courts should not impose enhancements for abuse of trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  In sum, the overall structure of the Guidelines simply does not warrant the categorical ban advocated by Billmyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, not only does Billmyer cite no supporting case law, but our research discloses ample authority for imposing an abuse-of-trust enhancement in such a case.  For example, in United States v. Butt, 955 F.2d 77 (1st Cir.1992), the court provided clear explication of its rationale for upholding an abuse-of-trust enhancement in the case of a police officer convicted on a RICO charge, even though the underlying racketeering activity included extortion under color of right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>The base offense level prescribed by the guidelines for a particular crime presumably reflects, or \"includes,\" those characteristics considered by Congress to inhere in the crime at issue.  In the case of extortion under color of right, abuse of trust would be one such characteristic, since Congress could reasonably have determined that every act of extortion under color of right involves an abuse of public trust.  Because the RICO statute, by contrast, can be violated in innumerable ways, there are, arguably, no offense characteristics common to all RICO offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 89.   The same holds true here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Billmyer was convicted of mail fraud conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.  As not every mail fraud conspiracy involves an abuse of trust, we cannot conclude that the BOL for commercial bribery necessarily includes an abuse-of-trust element so as to preclude an enhancement pursuant to &#167; 3B1.3.  See United States v. Kummer, 89 F.3d 1536, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1996) (rejecting similar argument under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2E5.1 (bribe affecting employee benefit plan));  cf. United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 199 (1st Cir.1992) (finding that BOL applicable to currency reporting violations did not encompass stockbroker's special skill).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Sinclair, 74 F.3d 753, 762-63 (7th Cir.1996), likewise demonstrates that the commercial bribery guideline does not take into account an abuse of trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Sinclair, a bank officer, was convicted of accepting a bribe in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 215(a)(2), a crime that would seem almost invariably to entail an abuse of trust.  Yet the court noted that the statute did not define a single crime, see id. &#167; 215(a)(1) (prohibiting person from offering bribe to bank officer), and reasoned that it would be wrong to require that the briber, who did not necessarily breach a position of trust, receive the same sentence as the bank-officer recipient.  Sinclair, 74 F.3d at 763.   Similarly, we think Billmyer's greater culpability, relative to other defendants who need not necessarily have abused a position of trust in the course of a mail fraud conspiracy, entitled the district court to impose the &#167; 3B1.3 adjustment in this case.  Accordingly, we affirm the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no reversible error, the district court judgments are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We recite the background facts the jury reasonably could have found, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdicts.

Just as demand in the United States surged, the Japanese government imposed export restraints on its carmakers, and Honda was unable to meet the demand for its automobiles in the United States.  These uncommonly favorable market conditions endured throughout much of the 1980s, causing enterprising car dealers in the United States to compete fiercely (and sometimes unfairly) for exclusive Honda franchises in anticipation of the extraordinarily large profit margins available on such popular Honda models as the Civic, Prelude, and Accord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant John Billmyer joined Honda as a district sales representative in 1970, and rose rapidly through all four management levels in its field sales division.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  By 1977, Billmyer had been appointed regional sales manager for the eastern United States.  By 1980, he held the top field sales position at Honda--national sales manager--and soon moved from its New Jersey office to headquarters in California.  When Honda launched a line of luxury automobiles in 1985, Billmyer became national sales manager for the new Acura Division as well.  He remained the top Honda field sales manager in the United States until he retired on March 31, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Billmyer retired, he was succeeded as national sales manager by S. James Cardiges, his closest associate at Honda.  Billmyer had hired Cardiges as the Honda sales manager for the Baltimore/Washington D.C. district in 1977, and rapidly promoted him through the ranks:  from zone manager for the mid-Atlantic states in 1979, to zone manager for the west coast (the largest and most prestigious zone) in 1981, to regional sales manager for the western United States in late 1982.  While western regional sales manager, Cardiges worked closely with Billmyer.  The two often traveled to work together and took business trips within the United States and overseas.  Finally, Cardiges succeeded Billmyer as national sales manager in 1988.  He resigned in April 1992 by \"mutual agreement\" with Honda, to forfend termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Dennis R.

Next, the district and zone sales managers for the area under consideration were to \"prospect\" for a qualified dealer to fill the \"open point,\" then compose a slate of three or more suitable candidates.  Honda policy directed that sales managers evaluate candidates according to their experience in automobile retailing, available capital, personal reputation, and the quality of their location and facilities, all with the ultimate aim that Honda dealerships be awarded to the best candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Honda sales managers at each level, see supra note 2, were required to participate in recommending and approving candidates for any \"open point.\"   With the possible exception of Billmyer and Cardiges, in their respective capacities as national sales manager, no sales manager at any level possessed unilateral authority to award a new dealership.   Furthermore, approval was required from managers representing the parts, service, and market-representation departments as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once selected for an \"open point\" dealership, with the approval of sales managers at the district, zone, regional, and national levels, a successful candidate received a \"Letter of Intent\" (\"LOI\") from Honda via United States mail, authorizing the prospective dealer to open the new, exclusive dealership upon certain conditions, such as constructing a facility within a specified time.  Until the franchise itself was issued to the prospective dealer, however, these LOI rights remained the property of Honda.  Like its competitors, Honda exacted no fee for its dealership franchises.  Nor were Honda personnel allowed to accept money or other consideration of significant value for assistance in obtaining a Honda franchise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Honda policy and procedures governing new dealerships, its \"conflict of interest\" policy prohibited employees from accepting anything of significant value from a Honda dealer and from acquiring or holding any interest in a Honda or Acura dealership.  The \"conflict of interest\" policy was disseminated among all Honda sales managers, who were required to sign disclosure forms indicating ongoing compliance.  Sales managers at every level were duty-bound to ensure that their respective subordinates honored the policy prohibiting conflicts of interest, and report all violations to their senior manager or the Human Resources Department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding these rigorous internal procedures, however, there were numerous violations of the \"conflict of interest\" policy.  From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, sales managers at every level commonly accepted money and valuable gifts, including Rolex watches, furniture, and business suits, from prospective dealers vying for \"open points\" or from dealers seeking increased Honda automobile allocations.  Yet their illicit activities apparently escaped notice by nonparticipating sales managers and dealers for years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in 1991 an internal investigation was triggered by an uninvolved district sales representative in Arkansas who provided a Honda executive vice-president with evidence of payoffs involving Cardiges, then the national sales manager, and a zone manager.  By early 1992, Honda had begun \"cleaning house\" and Cardiges had resigned.  An extensive federal criminal investigation ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 11, 1994, a federal grand jury in New Hampshire returned an indictment against Billmyer, Josleyn, Cardiges and two lower-level Honda sales managers responsible for the New England region, David L. Pedersen and Damien C. Budnick.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Superseding indictments were returned against Billmyer, Josleyn, and Cardiges in October 1994 and January 1995.  Ultimately, Budnick, Cardiges, and Pedersen entered into plea agreements and cooperated with the government.  Cardiges and Pedersen were key government witnesses at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second superseding indictment charged Josleyn and Cardiges, in Count I, with a pattern of racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) (1994).  As Racketeering Act 1, it alleged that Josleyn and Cardiges had persuaded Honda to select a particular outside vendor (from which the defendants had received kickbacks) to conduct sales training seminars for Honda salespeople employed in New Hampshire and elsewhere in the United States.  Racketeering Acts 2 through 8 related to regional advertising associations which pooled monies advanced by individual Honda dealers to defray their local Honda advertising costs.  Josleyn and Cardiges were charged with causing Honda to match the contributions made by the Honda dealers to these regional advertising associations, on the condition that the advertising associations hire a particular vendor (controlled by Josleyn's brother) to provide the advertising services.  After receiving payments from the regional advertising associations, the vendor allegedly made kickbacks to Josleyn and Cardiges.  Other Racketeering Acts described in Count I alleged, inter alia, that Josleyn and Cardiges received kickbacks for awarding numerous LOIs to various dealership candidates in California, Maryland, New York, and other states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count II charged Billmyer, Cardiges, and Josleyn with conspiring to defraud Honda by accepting payments and other valuable consideration from dealers and prospective dealers in exchange for LOIs or other preferred treatment.  Count III (conspiracy) and Count IV (mail fraud) charged Josleyn and Cardiges with accepting kickbacks from 1989 through 1992, in relation to the sales training seminars.  Overall, Josleyn was charged in all four counts, whereas Billmyer was charged with the Count II \"dealer franchise\" conspiracy only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial began on February 7, 1995, before Chief Judge Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  After presenting thirty-five witnesses, including Cardiges and Pedersen and many Honda dealers from around the country, the government rested its case on May 10, 1995.  Billmyer opted to present no witnesses, while Josleyn mounted a defense based on the theory that top Japanese executives in Honda had condoned the activities alleged in the indictment.  At the close of the evidence, the district court denied appellants' renewed Rule 29 motions for judgments of acquittal.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case went to the jury on May 19.  Seven days into the deliberations, guilty verdicts were returned against both Billmyer and Josleyn.  After denying their motions for judgments of acquittal, the district court sentenced Billmyer to a five-year prison term and a $125,000 fine;  and Josleyn to six and one-half years in prison on Count I and a five-year prison term on each of the three remaining counts, all to be served concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

(noting risk that jury may infer guilt by association), the rule nonetheless may be generously construed in favor of joinder, given the protective discretion vested in the trial court under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court apparently concluded that the Count II dealer franchise conspiracy charge against Billmyer and Josleyn warranted their joinder under Rule 8(b).  Its conclusion plainly would have been unexceptionable had the indictment contained only Count II, see United States v.

No less importantly, Billmyer's retirement from Honda, prior to the time Josleyn launched the dealer advertising association and sales training schemes, unquestionably facilitated the individualized factfinding focus to which each defendant was entitled from the jury.  Cf. Morrow, 39 F.3d at 1235-36 (erroneous admission of hearsay under coconspirator exception held to be \"harmless\" given distinctiveness of two fraudulent schemes).  Finally, at the close of all the evidence, the trial judge gave a careful cautionary instruction, once again reminding the jury to consider the evidence against each defendant individually. See Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (limiting instructions mitigate prejudice from misjoinder).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these safeguards may not have sufficed in another case, the evidence against both Billmyer and Josleyn can only be described as overwhelming.  See Randazzo, 80 F.3d at 628.   An army of former Honda executives, including Cardiges, Billmyer's protege and eventual successor, as well as numerous Honda dealers, presented a wealth of telling evidence against appellants.  See Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732 (noting overwhelming evidence of guilt);  see infra Section II.B.3.

Billmyer</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As early as 1979, while Billmyer was the eastern regional sales manager, Cardiges, as zone manager for the mid-Atlantic states, accepted a $10,000 payment from a Honda dealer in Philadelphia, and split it with Billmyer.  In late 1979 or early 1980, Cardiges presented Billmyer with a gold Rolex watch worth as much as $15,000 from a large Honda dealer in the Washington, D.C. area.  Beginning with the 1984 holiday season and continuing through 1992, Cardiges received $20,000 to $25,000 each year from John Rosatti, a Honda dealer in New York City.  Rosatti told Cardiges that he was paying Billmyer also, because, as Cardiges testified at trial, like other dealers Rosatti wanted \"favorable treatment, wanted more automobiles, more franchises, and wanted the ability to have the ear of the people who were in power at Honda.\"Cardiges and Billmyer both helped a dealer named Rick Hendrick acquire approximately thirty Honda and Acura franchises in various states, including Texas, Georgia, and the Carolinas.  In return, Hendrick helped Cardiges buy a California residence from which Cardiges later realized a $250,000 gain.  Thereafter, Hendrick defrayed approximately $150,000 in interest payments on a loan Cardiges had obtained to buy a $700,000 home in Laguna Hills, California.  During this same 1989-92 time frame, Hendrick intimated to Cardiges that he was involved in financing Billmyer's home in Palm Springs as well.  Cardiges also learned from Billmyer that Hendrick had provided Billmyer with a top-of-the-line BMW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardiges described periodic payoffs from one Marty Luftgarten, who owned dealerships in New Jersey, Philadelphia, and southern California.  For example, at the grand opening of a Luftgarten dealership during the mid-1980s, Billmyer, Cardiges, and two other Honda sales managers, Bill Kutchera and Jeff Conway, gathered in a conference room where Luftgarten handed each an envelope containing $5,000 in cash.  Around the holiday season, another dealer customarily sent Cardiges $5,000 gift certificates from Neiman-Marcus for both Cardiges and Billmyer.  See Boylan, 898 F.2d at 242 (noting that defendants often cooperated with one another by collecting payments).  The record is replete with other evidence of cash payments from dealers and lavish shopping trips to Hong Kong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>b. Josleyn</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, there was ample evidence to enable a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Josleyn conspired with Cardiges and others to defraud Honda in connection with the Honda dealership franchises.  In early 1991, while zone manager for the west coast, Josleyn arranged for a \"friend\" back east, Joe Pope, to pay $150,000 for the \"open point\" in Elk Grove, California.  Josleyn approached Cardiges, national sales manager, and Robert Rivers, regional manager for the western United States, and advised that there would be money in it for all of them if Pope were to receive the Elk Grove dealership.  Thereafter, Cardiges, Rivers, and Josleyn, in direct violation of Honda procedure, decided not to prospect for suitable dealership candidates, and awarded the Elk Grove franchise outright to Pope.  As promised, Pope issued a $150,000 check payable to Gary &amp; Associates, a company controlled by Josleyn and his brother Gary.  Josleyn in turn gave Cardiges and Rivers each $50,000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardiges testified that Ed Temple, a former Honda zone manager, approached him in the summer of 1991 in behalf of Bob Frink, a dealer interested in the Folsom, California point.  Temple had accepted payoffs from dealers while employed by Honda, and after leaving the company in 1989 established a firm--Blakely Consultants--to facilitate payments to Honda executives from dealers seeking new Honda franchises.  Simply put, Temple told Cardiges that Frink was willing to pay Cardiges and Josleyn for the Folsom dealership.  On August 5, 1991, Cardiges signed the Folsom LOI, and on the same day Frink paid Blakely Consultants $500,000 for services rendered.  Three days later, Temple wrote a $166,666 check to Magnum Marketing, a company owned by Josleyn.  Cardiges reported $166,666 from Blakely Consultants on his own 1991 income tax return, although Temple had agreed to hold Cardiges' one-third share until Cardiges left Honda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need belabor the point no further, as there was ample evidence to enable the jury reasonably to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Josleyn was a member of the Count II dealership franchise conspiracy.

Venue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, venue in a conspiracy case depends upon whether an overt act in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy occurred in the trial district.  United States v. Uribe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532755\"><a href=\"/opinion/532755/united-states-v-nestor-uribe-united-states-of-america-v-leon-alberior/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 558 (1st Cir.1989);  see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3237(a) (1994).  The defendant need not have been physically present in the trial district during the conspiracy.  United States v. Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196737\"><a href=\"/opinion/196737/united-states-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.1996);  see, e.g., Cordero, 668 F.2d at 43-44 (furthering drug importation conspiracy with phone calls to undercover DEA agent in Puerto Rico);  cf. United States v. Georgacarakos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602802\"><a href=\"/opinion/602802/united-states-v-peter-n-georgacarakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1294 (1st Cir.1993) (contrasting venue for \"group\" and \"individual\" crimes).  The government acknowledges that venue was proper in the District of New Hampshire only if there was enough evidence for a rational jury to find it more likely than not that Pedersen, Josleyn and Billmyer belonged to the Count II conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon joining Honda as a district sales manager in July 1979, see supra notes 2 &amp; 3, Pedersen learned that Honda policy prohibited sales executives from awarding LOIs for personal gain and from accepting gifts valued at more than $25 from dealers.  In keeping with Honda policy, Pedersen objected in December 1979 when Bill Lia, a dealer in upstate New York, stuffed an envelope containing cash into Pedersen's pocket.  Although Pedersen threatened to report the incident, he relented when Lia told him not to worry because Lia had \"already handled the zone.\"   Moreover, Pedersen knew at the time that both his immediate supervisor, Northeast Zone Manager Bill Kutchera, and Billmyer, regional manager for the eastern United States, as well as Cardiges, worked at Honda headquarters in New Jersey.  In fact, when Pedersen told Kutchera about the cash bribe tendered by Lia, Kutchera advised Pedersen to ask for a gift certificate in place of the cash.  Accordingly, Pedersen ultimately accepted a $300 gift certificate from Lia with Kutchera's explicit approval.  Around this same time, Kutchera also told Pedersen that during the course of the previous year he had received two Rolex watches, a cruise, furniture, and other gifts, valued at $13,000, from various dealers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pedersen testified that he frequently discussed dealer payoffs with Roger Novelly and Larry Finley, his Honda supervisors in Ohio.  Novelly, the assistant zone manager, specifically told Pedersen that Billmyer and Cardiges were being \"taken care of\" by dealers, and Finley, the zone manager, admitted that Tom Bohlander had paid him for the Honda \"open point\" dealership franchise in West Cleveland.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 243 (noting that tacit accord among alleged conspirators is permissibly inferred from evidence that defendants \"often spoke to their victims about other victims or other defendants in words which plainly revealed that the crimes were interdependent\").  Based on this evidence, and there was more, the jury would have been permitted to draw the reasonable inference that Pedersen and his various supervisors over the years had developed a shared understanding of an \"unwritten policy\" at Honda:  dealers had to pay Billmyer and Cardiges, as well as other sales executives in the chain of command, in order to receive a Honda or Acura franchise or other favorable treatment.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Orsini, a Honda and Acura dealer in Connecticut, provided corroborative testimony at trial, characterizing the kickbacks he had made to Billmyer, Pedersen, and Damien Budnick, Pedersen's subordinate, as a \"way of doing business\" with Honda.  At Budnick's suggestion, Orsini met with Billmyer in September 1987 to discuss obtaining another Acura dealership.  A few weeks later, Billmyer offered Orsini a franchise in Nanuet, New York, if Orsini created a \"no-show\" job for Billmyer's friend, Douglas T. Richert, at $1,000 per week.  After Orsini accepted the Billmyer proposal, he received the Nanuet LOI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the same time, Orsini discussed with Budnick and Pedersen the possibility that Orsini might obtain a new dealership franchise in Salem, New Hampshire.  According to Pedersen, Orsini and other dealers routinely and unilaterally mentioned Billmyer's name in conversation, as a means of \"impress[ing]\" on Pedersen the dealers' established connections with higher-level Honda sales managers.  Orsini told Pedersen that he would be willing to pay for the Salem franchise, but not the $50,000 demanded by Budnick.  After agreeing to help secure the Salem dealership for Orsini in February 1988, Pedersen received between $2,000 and $4,000 in cash from Orsini.  Thus, given the circumstantial evidence that both Billmyer and Pedersen shared a common goal or plan to defraud Honda by accepting illicit consideration for awarding new dealership franchises, the jury reasonably could infer, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Billmyer and Pedersen defrauded Honda in connection with the Salem, New Hampshire LOI by accepting payoffs from a common source, Orsini.  See, e.g., Brandon, 17 F.3d at 450 (finding single conspiracy, despite variations in details and tactics, where main objective, structure, intended victim, and modus operandi remained constant);  supra Section I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to accepting illicit payments from Lia and Orsini, the record demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Pedersen committed an overt act in New Hampshire in furtherance of the Count II conspiracy, by accepting a free Acura Integra from Bohlander's West Cleveland, Ohio, dealership in 1986.  After Bohlander and Pedersen became friends, Pedersen agreed to help Bohlander acquire more Acura dealerships in exchange for a silent ownership interest in a Nashua, New Hampshire, dealership.  Pedersen recommended Bohlander for the new Nashua franchise, and in due course Bohlander received it.  Although Pedersen later declined an ownership interest in the Nashua dealership, he nonetheless let Bohlander pay roughly $18,000 in college tuition fees for Pedersen's son.  Thus, the evidence sufficed to demonstrate, by a preponderance, that venue was proper in the District of New Hampshire.  See Uribe, 890 F.2d at 558.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there was evidence from which a rational jury reasonably could have inferred, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bohlander routinely paid Billmyer and Cardiges as well.  Pedersen described a card game at Bohlander's Florida condominium in February 1991, during which Bohlander and Lou Tecco, a dealer associated with Marty Luftgarten, talked about paying bribes as a \"way of doing business\" with Honda, and noted that Billmyer and Cardiges had to be paid in order to get dealerships and other favorable treatment.  Along with the evidence that Bohlander had paid Finley for the West Cleveland dealership and that dealers commonly bribed sales executives at each successive level, see supra at p. 1192, Pedersen's testimony permitted the jury reasonably to conclude that it was more likely than not that Bohlander had paid Billmyer, the Acura Division head, as well as Pedersen, in return for the Nashua dealership in 1987.  Thus, the similarity in the pattern of fraudulent transactions relating to new dealership franchises, the common core of \"insider\" participants, and the temporal overlap would enable a rational jury reasonably to infer, under the applicable preponderance standard, that Pedersen, Billmyer, Josleyn, and Cardiges agreed, at least tacitly, to defraud Honda by accepting illicit consideration from candidates for new Honda dealership franchises in direct violation of established Honda policy and procedures.

Given that the proper inquiry under Allard is whether Josleyn intended to defraud the dealers and advertising associations into parting with their money, there was ample evidence, particularly the testimony of Cardiges, to support the jury verdicts against Josleyn under Counts I, III, and IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Jury Instructions on Condonation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Josleyn's proposed jury instruction that the government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Honda had not condoned Josleyn's fraudulent activities.  Ordinarily, a defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of the case as long as it is legally valid and there is sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, to permit a reasonable juror to credit the defendant's theory.  United States v. Flores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586808\"><a href=\"/opinion/586808/united-states-v-joyce-lee-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1366</span></a></span>, 1368-69 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v.

The government does not dispute that the evidence adduced at trial would have permitted the jury to find that native Japanese executives at the highest levels of Honda implicitly condoned the acceptance of bribes and kickbacks.  Nevertheless, the trial court need not adopt the precise instructional language proposed by the defendant.  United States v.

American Honda's knowledge or condonation of the commission of an offense does not by itself constitute a defense or an excuse.  However, any evidence of American Honda's actions or omissions, or evidence of deficiencies in the manner in which it implemented and enforced its policies and procedures, may be considered by you to the extent that such evidence bears on the issue of whether or not Mr. Josleyn formed the required intent to commit the crimes with which he is charged.   Mr. Josleyn contends that because he believed American Honda knew of and condoned the activities in question, he did not possess the required intent to commit the offenses with which he is charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant has no obligation whatsoever to prove to you that his theory is correct, but rather the burden is always on the government to prove all of the material elements of each offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt[,] including the element of intent with respect to each offense[,] as I have already explained to you.

No more was required.  See generally New England Enters., Inc. v.

Impeachment of Cardiges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Josleyn contends that though the prosecutor was responsible for deliberately suborning false testimony from Cardiges, the district court unduly impeded Josleyn's efforts to impeach Cardiges on cross-examination.  These claims are meritless.  See generally United States v.

Cardiges testified that he neither authorized the press statements, nor knew their basis.  On redirect, the prosecutor elicited testimony that though Cardiges and his attorney had been afforded \"open access\" to the government's file, Cardiges had seen \"no documents that either indicated or show[ed] that the Japanese knew anything about kickbacks or gifts or anything like that.\"   In response, Josleyn's counsel sought to confront Cardiges with several FBI interview reports--obtained from the government's file--which contained statements by Honda employees to the effect that the Japanese knew about the bribes and kickbacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court permitted defense counsel to use the FBI reports for impeachment purposes, i.e., to show that Cardiges either did not tell the truth, or had not reviewed the entire contents of the government file.  But the court ruled that the FBI interview reports were inadmissible hearsay if offered for their truth.  See Innamorati, 996 F.2d at 480-81;  Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay).  On appeal, Josleyn argues that the district court impermissibly restricted recross-examination by refusing to allow the jury to consider all hearsay statements in the FBI interview reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the trial transcripts satisfies us that the district court accorded Josleyn ample leeway to explore the FBI interview reports in sufficient detail to enable the jury fairly to weigh Cardiges' testimony relating to the government's file.  For example, Cardiges admitted on recross that he had never seen the FBI interview reports, and was \"quite sure\" that he was not able to get through the \"thousands and thousands of documents\" during the four-hour period he spent reviewing the government file.  The district court did sustain several hearsay objections when defense counsel attempted to delve more deeply into the contents of the FBI interview reports.  It did so properly, however, since Josleyn proffered no relevant non-hearsay purpose for probing further.  Cf. United States v. Hudson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587568\"><a href=\"/opinion/587568/united-states-v-richard-b-hudson-sr/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span>, 956-57 (1st Cir.1992) (defense counsel responded to hearsay objection with impeachment proffer).  Nor does Josleyn now challenge these hearsay rulings.  Accordingly, we find no error.

The government produced some of the Proulx materials before trial, including a summary of his FBI interview, but found and unseasonably produced additional material months later--upon learning that Josleyn intended to call Proulx as a witness--tending to show that Honda's Japanese managers had condoned the illegal activities in its sales division.  Josleyn unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the indictment on due process grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the specific discovery request for condonation evidence, the government plainly had an obligation to furnish Josleyn with the Proulx materials in a more timely fashion.

(quoting United States v. Ingraldi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471758\"><a href=\"/opinion/471758/united-states-v-peter-f-ingraldi/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 411-12 (1st Cir.1986)).  Due to its greater familiarity with the dynamics of the case, we will not reverse a district court's ruling on delayed disclosure unless it amounts to a demonstrable abuse of discretion.  Id.  We discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a principal concern in delayed disclosure cases--whether the failure to supply the information in a seasonable fashion caused the defense to change its trial strategy, see id. at 290--is not significantly implicated in this case.  Josleyn consistently pursued the same defense theory both before and after the Proulx materials were provided, by arguing that the Japanese managers at Honda had condoned the charged conduct.  Secondly, even though the Proulx materials unquestionably provided additional support for the condonation \"defense,\" we are not persuaded that the delay in disclosure adversely affected the defense in any important respect.  In fact, while Cardiges was on the witness stand, Josleyn's counsel observed that \"the government's file is like 100,000 pages or so.\"   See also infra note 10.  The defense took full advantage of the condonation evidence by using it in its own case, even before the tardily produced Proulx materials were made available, then featured the government's delayed disclosure in its closing argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we think the district court soundly concluded that the Proulx materials added little to the evidence previously produced by the government, and therefore its late disclosure had not impeded Josleyn's defense to a significant degree.  See United States v. Catano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196298\"><a href=\"/opinion/196298/united-states-v-catano/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 227 (1st Cir.1995) (noting cumulativeness of impeachment materials);  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1179 (holding that failure to produce \"incremental information\" caused no prejudice).  We note as well that Josleyn makes no claim that the prosecutor intentionally delayed disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, and by no means least importantly, the only relief Josleyn requested was the outright dismissal of the indictment.  The district court has broad discretion to redress discovery violations in light of their seriousness and any prejudice occasioned the defendant.  Osorio, 929 F.2d at 762-63;  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2) (authorizing district court to \"permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing the evidence not disclosed, or ... enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances\").  On the other hand, the draconian relief demanded by Josleyn was grossly disproportionate both to the prosecution's nonfeasance and any prejudice to the defense.  See Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d at 670 (favoring continuance over dismissal);  accord Devin, 918 F.2d at 290-91.   As Josleyn eschewed various alternative remedies more consonant with the government's culpability and any prejudice to the defense, see, e.g., Osorio, 929 F.2d at 762-63 (noting, as alternative remedies, recalling witness for additional cross-examination, affording defense greater leeway with witnesses, and instructing jury that government failed to meet discovery obligations), we find no abuse of discretion in refusing to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">5.

See Rosales, 19 F.3d at 767 (\"When the prosecutor places the credibility of counsel at issue, the advantage lies with the government ....\") (citations omitted).  Thus, a prosecutor may not lend the prestige of the government to buttress a witness, nor indicate to the jury that information known to the prosecutor, but not admitted in evidence, supports the government's theory of the case.

Sinclair, 74 F.3d at 763.   Similarly, we think Billmyer's greater culpability, relative to other defendants who need not necessarily have abused a position of trust in the course of a mail fraud conspiracy, entitled the district court to impose the &#167; 3B1.3 adjustment in this case.
