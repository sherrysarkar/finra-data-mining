Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n David Wooler on brief pro se.\r\n Marc DeSisto, Kathleen M. Powers, and DeSisto Law Offices on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\n               Entered: November 4, 1998\r\n\n                                 Per Curiam. Plaintiff David Wooler appeals pro sefrom the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Scott\r\nHancock, the former town manager for the Town of Narragansett,\r\nRhode Island.  The underlying case is a diversity action in the\r\nDistrict of Rhode Island for alleged tortious interference with\r\na (prospective) contractual relation.  We conclude that summary\r\njudgment was improperly granted.  \r\n          On or about May 2, 1994, Wooler was hired by Betty\r\nCotter to work for Wilson Publishing Company as a reporter for\r\nthe Narragansett Times (the \"Times\").  Wooler's job was to\r\ncover the Town of Narragansett.  Frederick Wilson, III, was the\r\npublisher of Wilson Publishing Company.  Cotter was the editor\r\nfor the Times.  Cotter was also Wooler's direct supervisor from\r\nthe time he was hired until sometime later that same year when\r\nCotter went on maternity leave.    \r\n   Shortly after Cotter went on leave, Hancock (and\r\npossibly one or two other town officials) had a meeting with\r\nWilson about Wooler.    At the meeting, Hancock complained that\r\nWooler's coverage of the Town was too \"negative.\"  He also\r\ncomplained that he and Wooler had a personality conflict, and\r\nhe suggested that Wooler be transferred to another beat. \r\nSometime within the next two months, Hancock had lunch with\r\nWilson.  At this second meeting, Hancock stated that he would\r\nlike more \"positive\" stories about Narragansett.  On March 3,\r\n1995, Wilson fired Wooler.\r\n   Almost one year later, Wooler filed the instant\r\ncomplaint against Hancock alleging tortious interference with\r\nhis employment \"contract.\"    Hancock moved for summary\r\njudgment, and the matter was referred to a magistrate judge. \r\nThe magistrate judge issued a report recommending that summary\r\njudgment be granted in favor of Hancock on the ground that\r\nWooler failed to produce any evidence demonstrating that\r\nHancock played a causal role in his termination.  Wooler filed\r\ntimely objections to the magistrate's report.  Upon review, the\r\ndistrict judge adopted the magistrate's recommendation.  This\r\nappeal followed.\r\n   We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. \r\nHinchey v. NYNEX Corp., 144 F.3d 134, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  In\r\ndoing so, we view all disputed facts and reasonable inferences\r\nfavorable to the nonmoving party.  Perez-Trujillo v. Volvo Car\r\nCorp., 137 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 1998).   Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any\r\nmaterial fact\" and \"the moving party is entitled to a judgment\r\nas a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The moving party\r\nbears the initial burden of demonstrating that there are no\r\ngenuine issues of material fact for trial.  Hinchey, 144 F.3d\r\nat 140.  After that, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party\r\nwith respect to each issue on which he bears the burden of\r\nproof. Id.\r\n   Under Rhode Island law, the elements of a cause of\r\naction for interference with a prospective contractual relation\r\nare:\r\n   (1) the existence of a business\r\n   relationship or expectancy, (2) knowledge\r\n   by the interferor of the relationship or\r\n   expectancy, (3) an intentional act of\r\n   interference, (4) proof that the\r\n   interference caused the harm sustained,\r\n   and (5) damages to the plaintiff.\r\nMesolella v. City of Providence, 508 A.2d 661, 669 (R.I.\r\n1986).    Thus, Wooler bears the burden of proof on the issue of\r\ncausation.\r\n   The evidence proffered by Hancock to negate an\r\ninference of causation is strong.  This evidence includes the\r\ndeposition testimony of Wilson.  Wilson testified that he was\r\nthe person who made the termination decision, and that Wooler\r\nwas terminated because of his job performance.  According to\r\nWilson, Wooler was not producing enough articles.    In\r\nparticular, Wilson testified that a reporter in Wooler's\r\nposition is expected to produce five or six stories an issue\r\nand that Wooler was not meeting this requirement.    Wilson Dep.\r\nat 33.  Wilson further testified, unequivocally, that Hancock\r\nhad no impact on the termination decision except, perhaps, to\r\nprolong Wooler's employment.  \r\n   However, there is also evidence in the record tending\r\nto support Wooler's version of events.  Although, as noted\r\nabove, the evidence is conflicting on this point, a fact-finder\r\ncould conclude that Hancock's complaints to Wilson were made\r\nduring the last two months of Wooler's employment.  Such a\r\nconclusion lends some support to an inference that Hancock's\r\ncomplaints caused Wooler's termination.  Cf. Oliver v. Digital\r\nEquip. Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 110 (1st Cir. 1988) (observing that\r\na showing of discharge \"soon after\" the employee engages in\r\nprotected activity is indirect proof of a causal connection). \r\nThe possible inference is further strengthened by Cotter's\r\ndeposition testimony that Wilson seemed upset about Hancock's\r\ncomplaints.    There is also evidence, in the form of a notice\r\nof decision concerning Wooler's unemployment benefits, which\r\ncould be interpreted as demonstrating a link between Hancock's\r\ncomplaints and Wooler's termination.   \r\n   In addition, there is evidence based on which a jury\r\ncould question the credibility of Wilson's explanation for the\r\nfiring.  Among other things, there is evidence from which a\r\njury could conclude that Wooler was, in fact, producing the\r\nrequisite number of articles.    Moreover, Wooler submitted\r\ncopies of many of these articles.  More than one view of these\r\narticles is possible, and a fact-finder might conclude that,\r\ncontrary to Wilson's suggestion, Wooler actually covered a\r\nfairly broad range of non-controversial topics.  Finally,\r\nWooler proffered deposition testimony of Wilson to the effect\r\nthat he, Wilson, had heard that Hancock threatened to \"freeze\"\r\nWooler \"out of town hall.\"    Although Wilson denied that the\r\nthreat concerned him or that it posed a problem for the\r\nnewspaper, a fact-finder might be skeptical of this denial. \r\nFor much the same reason, a fact-finder might be skeptical of\r\nWilson's emphatic statement that his decision to terminate\r\nWooler was not \"in any way\" affected by Scott Hancock.\r\n   We recognize that Wooler faces a formidable obstacle\r\nin proving causation.  The issue turns on Wilson's state of\r\nmind, and the most direct evidence of Wilson's state of mind\r\nare his own statements.  It is not obvious what motive Wilson,\r\na non-party, would have to dissemble.\r\n   Nonetheless, the weighing of alternative factual\r\nscenarios should ordinarily be left to the finder of fact after\r\ntrial.  Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 172\r\n(1st Cir. 1998); see also Greenburg v. Puerto Rico Maritime\r\nShipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"The\r\nprecincts patrolled by Rule 56 admit of no room for credibility\r\ndeterminations, no room for the measured weighing of\r\nconflicting evidence . . . , no room for the judge to\r\nsuperimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood (no\r\nmatter how reasonable those ideas may be) upon the carapace of\r\nthe cold record.\").  Although Wooler's evidence may be thin, we\r\ndo not think that this is a case in which the evidence is \"so\r\none-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\"  Id.(citation omitted).  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and\r\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  \r\n   Vacated and remanded.\r\n",
