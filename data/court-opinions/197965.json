Berros-Hernndez, with whom Caparrs, Catal &amp;\r\nBerros was on brief, for appellee Continental Insurance Co.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                     May 26, 1998\r\n                                                DICLERICO, District Judge.  This action arises from a\r\ndispute between the plaintiff-appellant, Electric Machinery\r\nEnterprises of Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"EME\"), and the defendant-\r\nappellees, Fraya, S. E. (\"Fraya\") and Continental Insurance Company\r\n(\"CIC\"), concerning a construction project for the United States\r\nNavy.  CIC filed a motion for summary judgment which the district\r\ncourt granted before EME filed its response.  EME's request for\r\npost-judgment relief was then denied.  Because EME appears to have\r\nrun afoul of a combination of factors, the most material of which\r\nis an ambiguity in the Local Rules of the United States District\r\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico (\"Local Rules\") as to what\r\ndate should have served as EME's deadline to respond, the court\r\nvacates the district court's order granting summary judgment and\r\nremands the matter to the district court so that it may reconsider\r\nCIC's motion for summary judgment in light of EME's objection to\r\nthat motion.\r\nFactual and Procedural Background\r\nEME worked as a subcontractor on a construction project\r\nfor the United States Navy on which Fraya was the general\r\ncontractor.  CIC was Fraya's surety.  EME brought this action under\r\nthe Miller Act, 40 U.S.C.  270(b), against Fraya and CIC when\r\nFraya failed to pay EME $74,831.22, plus interest, costs, and\r\nattorney's fees, that EME alleges it is owed for work performed\r\nunder the subcontract.  Fraya brought a counterclaim against EME\r\nfor $248,234.59 in damages allegedly caused by EME's performance\r\nunder the subcontract.  CIC, on behalf of Fraya, contested\r\nliability for the debt and alleged that EME had not complied with\r\nthe jurisdictional requirements of the Miller Act because it had\r\nnot filed its claim within one year of the date it last performed\r\non the subcontract.\r\nAfter several delays at the outset of the case, the\r\ndistrict court required CIC to file any summary judgment motions by\r\nNovember 18, 1996.  On November 6, CIC sought an extension of time\r\nin which to file for summary judgment until December 15, 1996,\r\nwhich the court denied.  On November 18, CIC filed a timely motion\r\nfor summary judgment, alleging that EME's claim was filed outside\r\nthe one year statute of limitations.  In addition, it requested\r\nthat it be allowed to file several documents in Spanish in support\r\nof its summary judgment motion.\r\nLocal Rule 108.1, concerning translations, provides in\r\npertinent part as follows:\r\n     All documents not in the English language\r\nwhich are presented to or filed in this Court,\r\nwhether as evidence or otherwise, shall be\r\naccompanied at the time of presentation or\r\nfiling by an English translation thereof,\r\nunless the Court shall otherwise order.\r\n\n     Whenever a case is removed to this Court,\r\nthere shall be filed with the record, an\r\nEnglish translation of all papers. . . . \r\nUnless such translation accompanies the\r\nrecord, the Clerk shall refuse to receive and\r\nfile the record.\r\n\nThe court denied CIC's request to file documents in Spanish on\r\nDecember 3 and ordered CIC to file certified translations of the\r\ndocuments by December 9.  On December 6, EME received a copy of the\r\ndistrict court's December 3 order denying CIC's motion to file\r\ndocuments in Spanish and ordering that the English translations be\r\nfiled by December 9.\r\nLocal Rule 311.5, concerning responses to motions,\r\nprovides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n     If the respondent opposes a motion, he or\r\nshe shall file a response within ten (10) days\r\nafter service of the motion, including brief\r\nand such supporting documents as are then\r\navailable. . . .  For good cause appearing\r\ntherefor, a respondent may be required to file\r\na response and supporting documents, including\r\nbrief, within such shorter period of time as\r\nthe Court may specify, or may be given\r\nadditional time to file a response as provided\r\nin subsection .6 of this Rule, including\r\ndocuments and brief.\r\n\nBased on Local Rule 311.5, if CIC's filing were considered complete\r\non November 18 when it filed the motion for summary judgment, EME's\r\nresponse would have been due on December 2.  On December 2, EME's\r\ncounsel drafted a request for an extension of time to reply to the\r\nmotion for summary judgment.  It was signed on December 3 but,\r\nbecause of a clerical error at counsel's firm, it was not filed\r\nuntil December 6.  Once filed, the motion was not docketed until\r\nDecember 11.\r\nIn the meantime, on December 11, without knowledge that\r\nEME had filed a request for an extension of time to answer, the\r\ndistrict court granted CIC's motion for summary judgment.  It found\r\nthat CIC's unopposed request for summary judgment supported the\r\nallegation that more than one year had passed between the time that\r\nEME last performed under the subcontract and the time it filed the\r\naction seeking to recover on the subcontract.  \r\nOn December 16, having previously granted summary\r\njudgment to CIC, the district court denied EME's request for an\r\nextension of time to respond.  The district court ruled that EME\r\nshould have sought an extension of time before December 2, which it\r\nviewed as the deadline for EME's response.  On December 17, EME\r\nfiled a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of\r\nCivil Procedure 60, claiming, inter alia, excusable neglect for its\r\nfailure to file its response or request for extension of time\r\nwithin the deadline.  In an order filed February 10, 1997, the\r\ndistrict court denied the motion.\r\nEME then filed this timely appeal, contesting the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment and denial of post-\r\njudgment relief.  EME asserts that, if allowed, it is able to file\r\nan immediate response to the motion for summary judgment setting\r\nforth a meritorious defense to the statute of limitations bar.\r\n                      Discussion\r\nEME raises several contentions on appeal, but the court\r\nneed only consider in detail its assertion that the district court\r\nerred in calculating the proper time period for EME to respond to\r\nCIC's motion for summary judgment.  EME asserts that the ten-day\r\nperiod within which it was required to reply to the motion for\r\nsummary judgment should have begun running, not on November 18 when\r\nthe motion for summary judgment was filed, but on December 9, the\r\ndate that CIC, in accordance with the court's order, filed its\r\ncertified translations of Spanish-language documents supporting the\r\nmotion for summary judgment.  The district court rejected EME's\r\nargument, stating the following:\r\n     Plaintiff also argues that [CIC's] motion\r\nfor summary judgment was not complete until it\r\nfiled certified translations of the documents\r\nin support thereof on December 9, and\r\ntherefore plaintiff's motion requesting an\r\nextension of time was not tardy.  Although\r\nLocal Rule 108.1 requires that any document\r\nfiled with this Court in a language other than\r\nEnglish be accompanied by a certified\r\ntranslation, it does not state -- nor does\r\nplaintiff point to any case law so holding --\r\nthat a motion for summary judgment is not\r\nconsidered filed until such translations are\r\nprovided.  More importantly, plaintiff does\r\nnot suggest that failure to provide\r\ntranslations hindered its ability to oppose\r\nthe motion for summary judgment.  Indeed, it\r\ncannot so suggest since the three untranslated\r\nexhibits were demand letters plaintiff's\r\ncounsel had written on behalf of his client. \r\nPlaintiff can hardly assert that it did not\r\nunderstand the nature of Continental's motion\r\nfor summary judgment because of Continental's\r\nfailure to translate the exhibits.  If such\r\nwere the case, the Court might be more\r\nreceptive to plaintiff's arguments.  Absent\r\nsuch a showing, plaintiff's arguments raise\r\nunimportant technicalities.  Clearly,\r\nplaintiff's attorney is bilingual and\r\ndefendant's delay in providing the\r\ntranslations did not hinder his ability to\r\noppose the motion for summary judgment.\r\n\nOrder of February 8, 1997, at 7-8.\r\nAlthough the district court concluded that EME's argument\r\namounted only to an \"unimportant technicality,\" id., Local Rules\r\n311.5 and 108.1 undoubtedly created an ambiguity as to the proper\r\ndate by which to respond to CIC's motion.  Rule 311.5 fixes a ten\r\nday response time for motions.  Rule 108.1 provides that all\r\ndocuments not in English \"shall be accompanied at the time of\r\npresentation or filing by an English translation thereof, unless\r\nthe Court shall otherwise order.\"  Although Rule 108.1 makes clear\r\nthe consequences of failure to file translations when a case is\r\nremoved, it is silent as to the effect that failure to file\r\ntranslations has on other filings.  See Local Rule 108.1 (\"Unless\r\n. . . [a translation of documents in removed cases] accompanies the\r\nrecord, the Clerk shall refuse to receive and file the record.\"). \r\nIt is reasonable to infer, based on the Rule's construction, that\r\nthe district court has discretion to refuse to accept a motion when\r\nthe filer fails to include required translations of supporting\r\ndocuments.  Local Rule 114, concerning penalties for failure to\r\ncomply with the provisions of the Local Rules, is also broad enough\r\nto countenance such discretion.\r\nIn this case, the district court neither refused to\r\naccept CIC's filing in toto nor excused the requirements of Rule\r\n108.1, both of which it could have done within the exercise of its\r\ndiscretion.  Instead, it set a deadline for filing the translated\r\ndocuments.  With a filing that could reasonably be seen as\r\nincomplete, the applicable deadline for EME's response was\r\nambiguous under the Local Rules.  Under these circumstances, it was\r\nnot unreasonable for EME to conclude that, by granting CIC\r\nadditional time to comply with the requirements of Rule 108.1, the\r\ndistrict court would not consider CIC's initial filing complete\r\nuntil CIC cured the initial defect in its filing by submitting the\r\nrequired certified translations.\r\nAs the First Circuit stated in a similar context:\r\n     A district court possesses great leeway in\r\nthe application and enforcement of its local\r\nrules.  This discretion, though broad, is not\r\nunbridled. . . .\r\n\n     In making discretionary judgments, a\r\ndistrict court abuses its discretion when a\r\nrelevant factor deserving of significant\r\nweight is overlooked, or when an improper\r\nfactor is accorded significant weight, or when\r\nthe court considers the appropriate mix of\r\nfactors, but commits a palpable error of\r\njudgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\r\n\nUnited States v. Roberts, 978 F.2d 17, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(citations omitted).  In Roberts, the court overturned a district\r\ncourt's grant of a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal trial\r\nthat the district court granted without consideration of the\r\ngovernment's response.  See id. at 18-19.  It did so in part\r\nbecause \"the interlocking rules that govern computation of time in\r\nthis situation are freighted with ambiguity.\"  Id. at 22.  In this\r\ncase, EME not only ran afoul of an ambiguity in the Local Rules\r\nmade manifest by CIC's failure to comply with the translation\r\nrequirement but also suffered from inadvertent delays both in its\r\ncounsel's filing and the district court's docketing of a request\r\nfor an extension of time in which to respond.  The court holds\r\nthat, under these circumstances, the district court should have\r\ngranted EME post-judgment relief when the confusion became\r\napparent.\r\n                      Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the court vacates the\r\ndecision of the district court and remands the case for\r\nreconsideration of CIC's motion for summary judgment in light of\r\nEME's objection.  The court recommends that the District of Puerto\r\nRico reexamine and clarify its Local Rules to prevent recurrence of\r\nthis issue in the future.  Costs of the appeal are awarded to the\r\nplaintiff.\n",

Local Rule 114, concerning penalties for failure to\r\ncomply with the provisions of the Local Rules, is also broad enough\r\nto countenance such discretion.\r\nIn this case, the district court neither refused to\r\naccept CIC's filing in toto nor excused the requirements of Rule\r\n108.1, both of which it could have done within the exercise of its\r\ndiscretion.  Instead, it set a deadline for filing the translated\r\ndocuments.  With a filing that could reasonably be seen as\r\nincomplete, the applicable deadline for EME's response was\r\nambiguous under the Local Rules.  Under these circumstances, it was\r\nnot unreasonable for EME to conclude that, by granting CIC\r\nadditional time to comply with the requirements of Rule 108.1, the\r\ndistrict court would not consider CIC's initial filing complete\r\nuntil CIC cured the initial defect in its filing by submitting the\r\nrequired certified translations.\r\nAs the First Circuit stated in a similar context:\r\n     A district court possesses great leeway in\r\nthe application and enforcement of its local\r\nrules.  This discretion, though broad, is not\r\nunbridled. . . .\r\n\n     In making discretionary judgments, a\r\ndistrict court abuses its discretion when a\r\nrelevant factor deserving of significant\r\nweight is overlooked, or when an improper\r\nfactor is accorded significant weight, or when\r\nthe court considers the appropriate mix of\r\nfactors, but commits a palpable error of\r\njudgment in calibrating the decisional scales.\r\n\nUnited States v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593292\"><a href=\"/opinion/593292/united-states-v-leslie-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(citations omitted).  In Roberts, the court overturned a district\r\ncourt's grant of a motion to suppress evidence in a criminal trial\r\nthat the district court granted without consideration of the\r\ngovernment's response.  See id. at 18-19.  It did so in part\r\nbecause \"the interlocking rules that govern computation of time in\r\nthis situation are freighted with ambiguity.\"  Id. at 22.  In this\r\ncase, EME not only ran afoul of an ambiguity in the Local Rules\r\nmade manifest by CIC's failure to comply with the translation\r\nrequirement but also suffered from inadvertent delays both in its\r\ncounsel's filing and the district court's docketing of a request\r\nfor an extension of time in which to respond.  The court holds\r\nthat, under these circumstances, the district court should have\r\ngranted EME post-judgment relief when the confusion became\r\napparent.\r\n                      Conclusion\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the court vacates the\r\ndecision of the district court and remands the case for\r\nreconsideration of CIC's motion for summary judgment in light of\r\nEME's objection.  The court recommends that the District of Puerto\r\nRico reexamine and clarify its Local Rules to prevent recurrence of\r\nthis issue in the future.  Costs of the appeal are awarded to the\r\nplaintiff.\n</pre>",
