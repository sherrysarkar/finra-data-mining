Patricia and Richard Piester appeal from\r\nthe district court's award of costs to International Business\r\nMachines, Inc. (\"IBM\"), the prevailing party in a personal\r\ninjury suit alleging that Patricia Piester had developed\r\n\"repetitive stress injury\" (\"RSI\") from her workplace use of an\r\nIBM computer keyboard.  Following a hearing on IBM's\r\napplication for costs in the amount of $95,458.47, the district\r\ncourt granted the request but reduced the amount of costs to\r\n$37,431.06.  On appeal, the Piesters ask this court to further\r\nreduce the cost award to $6,520.\r\n  I. Standard of Review\r\n  Absent a specific statutory provision or rule to the\r\ncontrary, \"costs other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as\r\nof course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise\r\ndirects.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1).  The district court's\r\ndiscretion to deny recovery of costs that fall within the Rule\r\n54(d) categories \"operates in the long shadow of a background\r\npresumption favoring cost recovery for prevailing parties.\"  In\r\nre San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litigation, 994 F.2d 956,\r\n962 (1st Cir. 1993).  \"The award of costs is a matter given to\r\nthe discretion of the district court, which this court will\r\nreview only to ensure that no abuse of discretion occurred.\" \r\nRodriguez-Garcia v. Davila, 904 F.2d 90, 100 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\nSee 10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane,\r\nFederal Practice and Procedure (hereinafter \"10 Wright &amp;\r\nMiller\")  2668 (1983).\r\n  II. Discussion\r\n  Based upon our careful review of the complete record\r\nand consideration of the parties' briefs, we conclude that\r\nthere was no abuse of discretion in the district court's award\r\nof costs.  We address each of the specific categories of costs\r\ndisputed by the Piesters.\r\n  A. Transcript\r\n  The district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nawarding the cost of preparing the transcript from the first\r\ntrial.  \"Whether the transcript was 'necessarily obtained'\r\n[under  1920(2)] is a finding of fact by the district court\r\nthat will not be disturbed absent clear error.\" 10 James Wm.\r\nMoore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice (hereinafter \"10\r\nMoore's\")  54.103[3][e] (3d ed. 1998)).  The district court's\r\nfinding that the preparation of the transcript of the first\r\ntrial was necessary for use in the second trial was supported\r\nby the record and not clearly erroneous.  The Piesters'\r\nargument that because the court granted its motion for a new\r\ntrial, IBM was not the prevailing party at the first trial and,\r\ntherefore, not entitled to costs thereof is also unavailing.\r\nSee 10 Wright &amp; Miller,  2667, pp. 188-89 (\"the prevailing\r\nparty at a second trial is usually awarded the costs of both\r\ntrials\"); see also Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co., 379 U.S.\r\n227 (1964); Meder v. Everest &amp; Jennings, Inc., 553 F. Supp.\r\n149, 150 (E.D.Mo. 1982).\r\n  2. Depositions\r\n  \"It is within the discretion of the district court to\r\ntax deposition costs if special circumstances warrant it, even\r\nthough the depositions were not put in evidence or used at the\r\ntrial.\" Templeman v. Chris Craft Corp., 770 F.2d 245, 249 (1st\r\nCir. 1985); see also Riofrio Anda v. Ralston Purina Co., 772 F.\r\nSupp. 46, 55 (D.P.R. 1991) (noting that  1920(2) \"does not mean\r\nthat depositions must be used at trial in order to be taxed as\r\ncosts\"); 10 Moore's  54.103[3][c], p. 54-181 (\"that a\r\nparticular deposition was not actually used does not bar an\r\naward of costs\").  The district court's finding that the\r\ndeposition of witnesses listed by the Piesters was a necessary\r\npart of IBM's trial preparation was not a clear abuse of its\r\ndiscretion.  The court adequately addressed the Piesters'\r\nconcern that they not be taxed for the costs of depositions\r\ntaken in other cases by limiting the award of costs to\r\n\"depositions taken in this case, not in other cases.\"  The\r\nPiesters have failed to show that the award was not so limited. \r\nNor do the Piesters dispute the court's finding that IBM had a\r\nright to subpoena Patricia Piester's medical records from the\r\nmedical providers directly.  Accordingly, there was no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the district court's award of deposition costs.\r\n  C. Copying\r\n  Under  1920, the district court may tax as costs\r\n\"[f]ees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily\r\nobtained for use in the case.\"  1920(4).  \"The copies made . .\r\n. may be deemed necessary even if not actually used at trial.\" \r\n10 Moore's  54.103[3][d], p. 54-192.  The court's\r\ndetermination on the necessity issue should be reversed only if\r\nclearly erroneous.  Id.  The district court made a specific\r\nfinding that the internal copying was \"necessary\" within the\r\nmeaning of  1920.  That finding is supported by the record\r\nwhich includes a detailed explanation of the copying costs. \r\nThere was no clear error.\r\n  D. Expert Witness Fees\r\n  The Piesters argument that costs for IBM's expert\r\nwitnesses should only have been awarded for the days that a\r\nwitness actually testified is unavailing.  The district court\r\ndid not err in awarding fees to Dr. Hirsch even though he did\r\nnot actually testify.  \"Although courts do not ordinarily allow\r\nfees for witnesses who have not testified at trial, a court may\r\naward such a fee if the witness was ready to testify but\r\nextrinsic circumstances rendered his testimony unnecessary.\" \r\nNissho-Iwai Co., Ltd. v. Occidental Crude Sales, 729 F.2d 1530,\r\n1553 (5th Cir. 1984); see also Spanish Action Comm. of Chicagov. City of Chicago, 811 F.2d 1129, 1138 (7th Cir. 1987)\r\n(district court abused its discretion by denying costs for\r\nwitnesses who were available to testify but were not called to\r\ntestify).  The record fully supports a finding that IBM\r\nreasonably expected to call Dr. Hirsch as an expert.  Under\r\nthose circumstances, the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in awarding costs.\r\n  Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in\r\nawarding costs for the days that Dr. Nathan was present and\r\navailable to testify.  The court specifically found that there\r\nhad been a time lag during the trial which justified keeping\r\nDr. Nathan in Providence for the intervening time.  Section\r\n1821 authorizes witnesses to be compensated for the days that\r\nthey are available to testify as well as for the days that they\r\nactually testify.  See Hurtado v. United States, 410 U.S. 578,\r\n584-85 (1973) (\"witnesses are compensated under [1821] for the\r\ndays on which they have made themselves available to testify\r\nbut on which their physical presence in the courtroom is not\r\nrequired\").\r\n  The district court's Order Awarding Costs and Including\r\nCosts in the Judgment, dated September 15, 1997, is affirmed. \r\nSee Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
