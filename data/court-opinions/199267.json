Appellee\n\nCraig Roberts challenged these policies as unconstitutional. The\n\ndistrict court agreed that the policies were unconstitutional, holding\n\nthat this Court's decision in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), required that corrections officers have a reasonable suspicion\n\nthat an individual was concealing contraband prior to conducting a\n\nstrip and visual body cavity search. Roberts v. Rhode Island, No. 99-\n\n259ML, slip op. at 13-17 (D.R.I. March 16, 2000). Rhode Island now\n\nappeals. Because we find that the Rhode Island policy does not meet\n\nthe reasonableness test of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979),\n\nwe affirm the holding of the district court.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n          On April 20, 1999, Roberts was a passenger in a car stopped\n\nfor expired registration stickers. After a computer check revealed\n\nthat Roberts was the subject of an \"outstanding body attachment,\"2 the\n\n\n1 A \"strip search\" involves a visual inspection of the naked body of\nan inmate. A \"visual body cavity search\" is a strip search that\nincludes the visual examination of the anal and genital areas.\nSecurity & Law Enforcement Employees v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 192 (2d\nCir. 1984).\n2 Under R.I. Gen. Laws § 8-10-3.1(c)(8), a magistrate has the power to\nissue a \"body attachment\" upon the failure of a party to appear for a\njudicial proceeding. Such a writ allows officers to take the defendant\n\n                                 -3-\n\fofficers performed a pat-down frisk and placed him in custody.\n\nAlthough Roberts produced a September 1, 1998 order withdrawing the\n\nattachment, he was not released. Instead, he was transported to the\n\nIntake Services Center (\"Intake\") at the Adult Correctional Institution\n\n(\"ACI\") in Cranston, Rhode Island.\n\n          Upon   reaching    Intake,   Roberts    was   photographed,\n\nfingerprinted, and asked to submit to a blood test, which he refused.\n\nOfficers then performed a strip search and visual bodily cavity search,\n\npursuant to two DOC policies.3 As part of the search, corrections\n\n\ninto custody if the family court is not in session. See Roberts, slip.\nop. at 3.\n3 The first policy, Operational Memorandum 5.15.05-2 Part V.B. (dated\nJune 15, 1984), provides (in relevant part) that:\n\n          Each new commitment's person, clothing, and personal\n     belongings shall be thoroughly searched for contraband.\n\n     1. The commitment officer shall thoroughly search the\n     inmate's body to include examination of hair, arms, hands,\n     ears, mouth, nose; visual examination of groin and rectum;\n     toes and soles of feet.\n\n          (a) Any artificial limbs, dentures, or bandages shall\n          be carefully examined.\n\n     2. The new commitment's clothing and belongings shall be\n     thoroughly searched to include examination of all pockets,\n     cuffs, seams, hat bands, waistbands, zippers, and collars;\n     all clothing shall be turned inside-out and linings checked;\n     soles, heels, socks, and inside of all shoes shall be\n     examined; the contents of any and all luggage, packages,\n     bags, etc. shall be thoroughly examined.\n\n     The second policy, Policy and Procedure 9.14-1 Part III.B.2.\n(dated January 27, 1997), provides that:\n\n                                 -4-\n\fofficers inspected the inside of Roberts' mouth and nose and the soles\n\nof his feet. Roberts was also ordered to spread his buttocks, at which\n\ntime officers visually inspected his body cavity. At no time during\n\n\n     a. Strip searches of inmates will always be conducted for\n     objective purposes only and will always be carried out in an\n     expeditious and efficient manner. They will never be done\n     for punitive purposes or as a form of harassment.\n\n     (1) Strip searches shall be conducted under the direction of\n     the Shift Supervisor or other Superior Officer, or as\n     required by policy.\n\n     (2) Two Correctional Officers shall be assigned to conduct\n     a strip search.\n\n     (3) Strip searches shall be conducted by officers of the\n     same sex as the inmates being searched, except during\n     emergencies.\n\n     (4) The following search plan shall be followed when\n     conducting a strip search. The officer will examine:\n\n          (a) All pockets;\n          (b) Run fingers over linings, seams, collars, cuffs,\n          waistbands and fly;\n          (c) Shoes, inside soles and heels;\n          (d) Socks, turning them inside out;\n          (e) False teeth, artificial limbs, plaster casts;\n          (f) Inmates will run their fingers through their hair.\n          Officers will check for wigs and hairpieces;\n          (g) Inmates ears [sic] will be checked inside and out;\n          (h) The officer will look inside the inmate's nose;\n          (i) Inmates will open their mouths, lift their tongues,\n          and roll each lip, for the officer's view;\n          (j) Inmates will lift their penises and testicles on\n          the officer's command to provide a clear view of the\n          groin area;\n          (k) Inmates will then lift their feet so that the\n          officer can clearly see between the toes and the soles;\n          (l) Inmate's hands will be visually inspected;\n          (m) Inmates will be required to bend over and spread\n          the rectum to provide a clear view of the area.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe search did an officer touch Roberts. No contraband was found on\n\nRoberts' person. Roberts was subjected to a second similar search the\n\nsame day before being transferred and ultimately released from police\n\ncustody.\n\n           Appellants argue that the strip and visual body cavity search\n\nis necessary because of the unique nature of the Intake facility.\n\nUnlike many jurisdictions, Rhode Island does not have regional\n\nfacilities to house pretrial detainees prior to trial and sentencing.\n\nIntake acts as the receiving facility for all male inmates committed to\n\nthe care and custody of the DOC, including those arrested on an\n\noutstanding warrant, ordered held without bail, or unable to post bail.4\n\nBecause Rhode Island has a unified prison system, pretrial detainees\n\nheld at Intake mix with the general prison population. Intake is\n\nitself considered a maximum security prison.\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n           Both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees retain\n\nconstitutional rights despite their incarceration, including basic\n\nFourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nBell, 441 U.S. at 545.     However, those rights may be subject to\n\nrestrictions and limitations based on the fact of confinement, the\n\nlegitimate goals and policies of the penal institution, and the need of\n\n4 No inmate is sent to Intake without judicial authority, i.e., without\nan outstanding warrant or other judicial action. Most arrestees\ncharged with minor offenses are committed briefly to local jails.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe institution to maintain security and internal order. Id. at 545-\n\n46.   \"When an institutional restriction infringes a specific\n\nconstitutional guarantee,\" - here, the Fourth Amendment right against\n\nunreasonable searches, - \"the practice must be evaluated in the light\n\nof the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding\n\ninstitutional security.\" Id. at 546. This evaluation is a deferential\n\none, giving due regard to the \"professional expertise of corrections\n\nofficials,\" id. at 548 (citing Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827\n\n(1974)), and the limited role of the judiciary in operating and\n\nsupervising correctional facilities, see id. (citing Procunier v.\n\nMartínez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974)).\n\n          In Bell, the Supreme Court specifically addressed a strip and\n\nvisual body cavity search conducted of all inmates after every contact\n\nwith an outside visitor. Id. at 558. Although the Court admitted that\n\nthe practice of examining inmates' body cavities \"instinctively [gave\n\nit] the most pause,\" the Court upheld the search. Id. In determining\n\nthat the search was reasonable, the Court balanced \"the need for the\n\nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the\n\nsearch entails.\" Id. at 559. More specifically, the Court instructed\n\ncourts to \"consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner\n\nin which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\n\nplace in which it is conducted.\"        Id.    After weighing these\n\nconsiderations, the Court found that \"visual body cavity searches [in\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe prison context] can 'be conducted on less than probable cause.'\"\n\nSwain, 117 F.3d at 6 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 560).\n\n           This Court held in Swain that, at least in the context of\n\nprisoners held in local jails for minor offenses, the Bell balance\n\nrequires officers to have a reasonable suspicion that a particular\n\ndetainee harbors contraband prior to conducting a strip or visual body\n\ncavity search.     Swain, 117 F.3d at 7.   Appellants argue that the\n\nheightened security concerns of the Intake facility allow for per se\n\nsearches of committed inmates even absent individualized suspicion.\n\nAppellants also suggest that the requirement of judicial intervention\n\n(i.e., either an outstanding warrant or a judicial order) to commit an\n\ninmate to Intake changes the Bell calculation. We reconsider the Bell\n\nfactors in light of these distinctions to determine if the Rhode Island\n\npolicies are unreasonable searches prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.\n\n           We begin with the \"scope of the particular intrusion.\" Bell,\n\n441 U.S. at 559.    In Swain, we recognized that visual body cavity\n\nsearches \"impinge seriously upon\" Fourth Amendment values. 117 F.3d at\n\n7.   We had previously termed such searches a \"severe if not gross\n\ninterference with a person's privacy.\" Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886,\n\n887 (1st Cir. 1983).     And although our language has not been as\n\nstrident as that of the Seventh Circuit, see Mary Beth G. v. City of\n\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983) (describing such searches\n\nas, among other things, \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified,\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fembarrassing and repulsive\"), we consider such searches an \"extreme\n\nintrusion\" on personal privacy and \"an offense to the dignity of the\n\nindividual,\" Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir. 1996). The\n\nsearch required by Rhode Island DOC policy is no exception: although\n\nRoberts was admittedly not touched by corrections officials, he was\n\nforced to display his genitals, as well as to spread his legs so that\n\nofficials could observe his body cavity.\n\n          We next turn to the government interest at stake here, that\n\nis, the \"justification for initiating\" the search. Bell, 441 U.S. at\n\n559.   In this case, that interest is primarily a concern for\n\ninstitutional security. This Court has recognized that institutional\n\nsecurity is a legitimate need of law enforcement, and may provide a\n\ncompelling reason for a warrantless strip search absent reasonable\n\nsuspicion of individual wrongdoing. Swain, 117 F.3d at 7. Indeed, in\n\nBell, the Supreme Court allowed searches of all inmates who had\n\nentertained visitors, even if there was no suspicion that an individual\n\ninmate had received contraband from a visitor. In Arruda, we upheld a\n\nsearch of all inmates returning from the law library and infirmary, as\n\nwell as those inmates receiving visitors. 710 F.2d at 888. We focused\n\non the fact that the prison was a maximum-security one, that the inmate\n\nin question had been confined to a \"special security area\" for\n\nparticularly dangerous inmates, and that the \"record [contained] a\n\nlengthy history of prison contraband problems.\" Id.   In contrast, we\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fwere unconvinced by institutional security concerns in Swain, because\n\nthe arrestee there was held in a local jail and posed \"no risk\" of\n\ncontact with other prisoners.      117 F.3d at 8.\n\n          The institutional security concerns in play here fall\n\nsomewhere between those exhibited in Swain, which were insufficient to\n\nsupport a search, and those in Arruda and Bell, which made broad-based\n\nsearches without individual suspicion reasonable. For the reasons\n\ndetailed below, we think that the Rhode Island policies fall on the\n\nSwain side of the constitutional line.\n\n          First, unlike in Bell or Arruda, Rhode Island does not limit\n\nits searches to prisoners who have had contact with outside visitors.\n\nCourts have given prisons far more leeway in conducting searches of\n\ninmates with outside contact than in searching everyone, simply because\n\nsuch visits often allow smuggling of contraband. See Bell, 441 U.S. at\n\n558; Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing the\n\n\"obvious risk\" that visits may be used to introduce contraband);\n\nArruda, 710 F.2d at 888. Although inmates such as Roberts certainly\n\nhave the opportunity to introduce contraband to the prison, and may\n\nhave even done so in the past, it is far less likely that smuggling of\n\ncontraband will occur subsequent to an arrest (when the detainee is\n\nnormally in handcuffed custody) than during a contact visit that may\n\nhave been arranged solely for the purpose of introducing contraband to\n\nthe prison population. Furthermore, after an arrest the Rhode Island\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fauthorities should be able to detect contraband on the person of a\n\ndetainee without the need for a body cavity inspection. In addition,\n\nthe deterrent rationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant\n\ngiven the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest and subsequent\n\nincarceration. See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir.\n\n1984).\n\n          Second, although the Intake facility is maximum security, it\n\nis not a \"prison within a prison\" like that where Arruda was held.\n\nArruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Prison officials had no reason to believe\n\nthat Roberts was one of the \"most dangerous inmates . . . whose\n\ncontinued retention in the general institution population is\n\ndetrimental to the program of the institution,\" id. at 887 (quoting\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 127 § 39), nor did Rhode Island differentiate its\n\nsearch to focus on such inmates. Unlike in Arruda, everyone at Intake\n\nwas searched upon admission to the facility. While it is a reasonable\n\napproach to safeguarding institutional security to engage in extra\n\nefforts to ensure that the most dangerous inmates do not have access to\n\nweapons or contraband, the extension of the intrusion to far less\n\ndangerous inmates (such as Roberts) is a severe incursion on privacy\n\nfrowned upon by the Bell balancing test. The fact that it requires\n\nsome type of judicial order for an inmate to be committed to Intake\n\ndoes not change this assessment: the temporary incarceration of Roberts\n\nfor his failure to appear indicates that both highly dangerous and\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\frelatively harmless offenders may be incarcerated with judicial\n\napproval.5\n\n          Third, courts have given prisons latitude to premise searches\n\non the type of crime for which an inmate is convicted or arrested. The\n\nreasonable suspicion standard may be met simply by the fact that the\n\ninmate was charged with a violent felony. See Dufrin v. Spreen, 712\n\nF.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir. 1983). However, when the inmate has been\n\ncharged with only a misdemeanor involving minor offenses or traffic\n\nviolations, crimes not generally associated with weapons or contraband,\n\ncourts have required that officers have a reasonable suspicion that the\n\nindividual inmate is concealing contraband. See Weber v. Dell, 804\n\nF.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986) (misdemeanors); Stewart v. County of\n\nLubbock, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985) (misdemeanors); Giles,\n\n746 F.2d at 617 (traffic violations and other minor offenses); Hill v.\n\nBogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir. 1984) (traffic violations); Mary\n\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (misdemeanors); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d\n\n1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981) (DWI).       Roberts was picked up on an\n\noutstanding warrant from a family court; no evidence was adduced to\n\nindicate that his offense was the type normally associated with weapons\n\nor contraband. Moreover, Rhode Island has made no effort to engage in\n\n\n\n\n5 Moreover, this assessment does not even account for the fact that in\nRoberts' specific case, the body attachment had been revoked and his\nincarceration was apparently unwarranted.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fthis sort of particularized approach, preferring to search all entrants\n\nto Intake.\n\n          Fourth, a policy of searching all inmates is more reasonable\n\nwhen the record indicates a \"lengthy history of contraband problems.\"\n\nArruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Although the record here does indicate a\n\nlengthy history of contraband problems, a close examination of that\n\nrecord indicates that a body cavity search was (with possibly one\n\nexception) entirely unnecessary to discover that contraband.6 Cf. Mary\n\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (only a few items recovered from body\n\ncavities). The lack of specific instances where a body cavity search\n\nwas necessary to discover contraband supports a finding that the policy\n\nof searching all inmates is an unreasonable one. Furthermore, the\n\nrecord indicates that less invasive (and less constitutionally\n\nproblematic) searches would have been equally as effective in revealing\n\ncontraband.   For example, lacking reasonable suspicion that an\n\nindividual is hiding contraband, Rhode Island could still search that\n\nperson's clothes, a far less intrusive procedure than a full-scale\n\nstrip and body cavity search.      See id. at 1271.\n\n\n\n\n6 Attached to the Affidavit of A. T. Wall II, the Interim Director of\nthe Rhode Island DOC, are numerous incident reports of contraband\ndiscovery during the Intake admission process. With only one exception\n(where the inmate had hidden cocaine in his mouth), all the contraband\nwas found in the inmate's clothing. Appellants have adduced no\nevidence of contraband that would not have been discovered without the\nvisual body cavity search.\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          In short, although appellants have cited \"institutional\n\nsecurity\" as a sufficient reason not to require reasonable suspicion\n\nfor inmate body cavity searches, their only justification for this\n\nsevere invasion is that Intake is a maximum security facility where\n\narrestees mingle with the general population. Intermingling of inmates\n\nis a serious security concern that weighs in favor of the\n\nreasonableness, and constitutionality, of the search. See Dobrowolskyj\n\nv. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 959 (6th Cir. 1987) (upholding \"a\n\nmore narrowly drawn policy\" of searching those to be moved into the\n\ngeneral jail population); Dufrin, 712 F.2d at 1087 (inmate would come\n\ninto contact with general population); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (noting\n\nlack of intermingling).    Several courts, however, have held that\n\nintermingling alone is insufficient to justify a search without\n\nreasonable suspicion. Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 396 (10th Cir.\n\n1993); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254. Another has noted that intermingling\n\nis a dubious reason for a strip search because it is inherently\n\n\"limited and avoidable.\" Giles, 746 F.2d at 619 (citing Smith v.\n\nMontgomery County, 547 F. Supp. 592, 598-99 (D. Md. 1982)). We agree\n\nwith these courts that the unified nature of the Rhode Island prison\n\nsystem is not, in itself, dispositive of the reasonableness of the\n\nsearch.   To place so much weight on one (potentially alterable)\n\ncharacteristic of the state prison system would gut the balancing\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fapproach endorsed by the Supreme Court in Bell and applied by this\n\nCourt in Swain and Arruda.\n\n          The Bell balancing test also instructs us to consider the\n\nplace in which the search is conducted and the manner in which it is\n\nconducted.     441 U.S. at 559.   Neither aspect of this search is\n\nproblematic.    The policy requires the search to be conducted by\n\nofficers of the same sex of the inmate. It appears from the record\n\nthat the search is generally conducted in private.7 Moreover, the\n\nsearch is entirely visual and there have been no accusations of abuse.\n\nGiven the intrusive nature of a strip and visual body cavity search,\n\nRhode Island has endeavored to perform these searches in a relatively\n\nprivate manner. See Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188,\n\n193 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n          \"Bell has not been read as holding that the security\n\ninterests of a detention facility will always outweigh the privacy\n\ninterests of the detainees.\" Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 957.        Our\n\nprevious decisions have also indicated that the Fourth Amendment\n\nbalance cannot be shifted so quickly. See Swain, 117 F.3d at 7-8.\n\nThis is not to say that prison officials are hamstrung in their efforts\n\nto protect the security of penal institutions.

Appellee Craig Roberts challenged these policies as unconstitutional. The district court agreed that the policies were unconstitutional, holding that this Court's decision in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997), required that corrections officers have a reasonable suspicion that an individual was concealing contraband prior to conducting a strip and visual body cavity search. Roberts v. Rhode Island, No. 99-259ML, slip op. at 13-17 (D.R.I. March 16, 2000). Rhode Island now appeals. Because we find that the Rhode Island policy does not meet the reasonableness test of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979), we affirm the holding of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, 1999, Roberts was a passenger in a car stopped for expired registration stickers. After a computer check revealed that Roberts was the subject of an \"outstanding body attachment,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the officers performed a pat-down frisk and placed him in custody. Although Roberts produced a September 1, 1998 order withdrawing the attachment, he was not released. Instead, he was transported to the Intake Services Center (\"Intake\") at the Adult Correctional Institution (\"ACI\") in Cranston, Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon reaching Intake, Roberts was photographed, fingerprinted, and asked to submit to a blood test, which he refused. Officers then performed a strip search and visual bodily cavity search, pursuant to two DOC policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As part of the search, corrections officers inspected the inside of Roberts' mouth and nose and the soles of his feet. Roberts was also ordered to spread his buttocks, at which time officers visually inspected his body cavity. At no time during the search did an officer touch Roberts. No contraband was found on Roberts' person. Roberts was subjected to a second similar search the same day before being transferred and ultimately released from police custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the strip and visual body cavity search is necessary because of the unique nature of the Intake facility. Unlike many jurisdictions, Rhode Island does not have regional facilities to house pretrial detainees prior to trial and sentencing. Intake acts as the receiving facility for all male inmates committed to the care and custody of the DOC, including those arrested on an outstanding warrant, ordered held without bail, or unable to post bail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because Rhode Island has a unified prison system, pretrial detainees held at Intake mix with the general prison population. Intake is itself considered a maximum security prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees retain constitutional rights despite their incarceration, including basic Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Bell, 441 U.S. at 545. However, those rights may be subject to restrictions and limitations based on the fact of confinement, the legitimate goals and policies of the penal institution, and the need of the institution to maintain security and internal order. Id. at 545-46. \"When an institutional restriction infringes a specific constitutional guarantee,\" - here, the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches, - \"the practice must be evaluated in the light of the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.\" Id. at 546. This evaluation is a deferential one, giving due regard to the \"professional expertise of corrections officials,\" id. at 548 (citing Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827 (1974)), and the limited role of the judiciary in operating and supervising correctional facilities, see id. (citing Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bell, the Supreme Court specifically addressed a strip and visual body cavity search conducted of all inmates after every contact with an outside visitor. Id. at 558. Although the Court admitted that the practice of examining inmates' body cavities \"instinctively [gave it] the most pause,\" the Court upheld the search. Id. In determining that the search was reasonable, the Court balanced \"the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Id. at 559. More specifically, the Court instructed courts to \"consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id. After weighing these considerations, the Court found that \"visual body cavity searches [in the prison context] can 'be conducted on less than probable cause.'\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 6 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 560).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court held in Swain that, at least in the context of prisoners held in local jails for minor offenses, the Bell balance requires officers to have a reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee harbors contraband prior to conducting a strip or visual body cavity search. Swain, 117 F.3d at 7. Appellants argue that the heightened security concerns of the Intake facility allow for per se searches of committed inmates even absent individualized suspicion. Appellants also suggest that the requirement of judicial intervention (i.e., either an outstanding warrant or a judicial order) to commit an inmate to Intake changes the Bell calculation. We reconsider the Bell factors in light of these distinctions to determine if the Rhode Island policies are unreasonable searches prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the \"scope of the particular intrusion.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. In Swain, we recognized that visual body cavity searches \"impinge seriously upon\" Fourth Amendment values. 117 F.3d at 7. We had previously termed such searches a \"severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy.\" Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (1st Cir. 1983). And although our language has not been as strident as that of the Seventh Circuit, see Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983) (describing such searches as, among other things, \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, embarrassing and repulsive\"), we consider such searches an \"extreme intrusion\" on personal privacy and \"an offense to the dignity of the individual,\" Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir. 1996). The search required by Rhode Island DOC policy is no exception: although Roberts was admittedly not touched by corrections officials, he was forced to display his genitals, as well as to spread his legs so that officials could observe his body cavity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the government interest at stake here, that is, the \"justification for initiating\" the search. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. In this case, that interest is primarily a concern for institutional security. This Court has recognized that institutional security is a legitimate need of law enforcement, and may provide a compelling reason for a warrantless strip search absent reasonable suspicion of individual wrongdoing. Swain, 117 F.3d at 7. Indeed, in Bell, the Supreme Court allowed searches of all inmates who had entertained visitors, even if there was no suspicion that an individual inmate had received contraband from a visitor. In Arruda, we upheld a search of all inmates returning from the law library and infirmary, as well as those inmates receiving visitors. 710 F.2d at 888. We focused on the fact that the prison was a maximum-security one, that the inmate in question had been confined to a \"special security area\" for particularly dangerous inmates, and that the \"record [contained] a lengthy history of prison contraband problems.\" Id. In contrast, we were unconvinced by institutional security concerns in Swain, because the arrestee there was held in a local jail and posed \"no risk\" of contact with other prisoners. 117 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The institutional security concerns in play here fall somewhere between those exhibited in Swain, which were insufficient to support a search, and those in Arruda and Bell, which made broad-based searches without individual suspicion reasonable. For the reasons detailed below, we think that the Rhode Island policies fall on the Swain side of the constitutional line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, unlike in Bell or Arruda, Rhode Island does not limit its searches to prisoners who have had contact with outside visitors. Courts have given prisons far more leeway in conducting searches of inmates with outside contact than in searching everyone, simply because such visits often allow smuggling of contraband. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558; Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing the \"obvious risk\" that visits may be used to introduce contraband); Arruda, 710 F.2d at 888. Although inmates such as Roberts certainly have the opportunity to introduce contraband to the prison, and may have even done so in the past, it is far less likely that smuggling of contraband will occur subsequent to an arrest (when the detainee is normally in handcuffed custody) than during a contact visit that may have been arranged solely for the purpose of introducing contraband to the prison population. Furthermore, after an arrest the Rhode Island authorities should be able to detect contraband on the person of a detainee without the need for a body cavity inspection. In addition, the deterrent rationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant given the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest and subsequent incarceration. See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although the Intake facility is maximum security, it is not a \"prison within a prison\" like that where Arruda was held. Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Prison officials had no reason to believe that Roberts was one of the \"most dangerous inmates .a.a.awhose continued retention in the general institution population is detrimental to the program of the institution,\" id. at 887 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127 &#167; 39), nor did Rhode Island differentiate its search to focus on such inmates. Unlike in Arruda, everyone at Intake was searched upon admission to the facility. While it is a reasonable approach to safeguarding institutional security to engage in extra efforts to ensure that the most dangerous inmates do not have access to weapons or contraband, the extension of the intrusion to far less dangerous inmates (such as Roberts) is a severe incursion on privacy frowned upon by the Bell balancing test. The fact that it requires some type of judicial order for an inmate to be committed to Intake does not change this assessment: the temporary incarceration of Roberts for his failure to appear indicates that both highly dangerous and relatively harmless offenders may be incarcerated with judicial approval.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, courts have given prisons latitude to premise searches on the type of crime for which an inmate is convicted or arrested. The reasonable suspicion standard may be met simply by the fact that the inmate was charged with a violent felony. See Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir. 1983). However, when the inmate has been charged with only a misdemeanor involving minor offenses or traffic violations, crimes not generally associated with weapons or contraband, courts have required that officers have a reasonable suspicion that the individual inmate is concealing contraband. See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986) (misdemeanors); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985) (misdemeanors); Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (traffic violations and other minor offenses); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir. 1984) (traffic violations); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (misdemeanors); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981) (DWI). Roberts was picked up on an outstanding warrant from a family court; no evidence was adduced to indicate that his offense was the type normally associated with weapons or contraband. Moreover, Rhode Island has made no effort to engage in this sort of particularized approach, preferring to search all entrants to Intake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, a policy of searching all inmates is more reasonable when the record indicates a \"lengthy history of contraband problems.\" Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Although the record here does indicate a lengthy history of contraband problems, a close examination of that record indicates that a body cavity search was (with possibly one exception) entirely unnecessary to discover that contraband.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Cf. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (only a few items recovered from body cavities). The lack of specific instances where a body cavity search was necessary to discover contraband supports a finding that the policy of searching all inmates is an unreasonable one. Furthermore, the record indicates that less invasive (and less constitutionally problematic) searches would have been equally as effective in revealing contraband. For example, lacking reasonable suspicion that an individual is hiding contraband, Rhode Island could still search that person's clothes, a far less intrusive procedure than a full-scale strip and body cavity search. See id. at 1271.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, although appellants have cited \"institutional security\" as a sufficient reason not to require reasonable suspicion for inmate body cavity searches, their only justification for this severe invasion is that Intake is a maximum security facility where arrestees mingle with the general population. Intermingling of inmates is a serious security concern that weighs in favor of the reasonableness, and constitutionality, of the search. See Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 959 (6th Cir. 1987) (upholding \"a more narrowly drawn policy\" of searching those to be moved into the general jail population); Dufrin, 712 F.2d at 1087 (inmate would come into contact with general population); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (noting lack of intermingling). Several courts, however, have held that intermingling alone is insufficient to justify a search without reasonable suspicion. Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 396 (10th Cir. 1993); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254. Another has noted that intermingling is a dubious reason for a strip search because it is inherently \"limited and avoidable.\" Giles, 746 F.2d at 619 (citing Smith v. Montgomery County, 547 F. Supp. 592, 598-99 (D. Md. 1982)). We agree with these courts that the unified nature of the Rhode Island prison system is not, in itself, dispositive of the reasonableness of the search. To place so much weight on one (potentially alterable) characteristic of the state prison system would gut the balancing approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in Bell and applied by this Court in Swain and Arruda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bell balancing test also instructs us to consider the place in which the search is conducted and the manner in which it is conducted. 441 U.S. at 559. Neither aspect of this search is problematic. The policy requires the search to be conducted by officers of the same sex of the inmate. It appears from the record that the search is generally conducted in private.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Moreover, the search is entirely visual and there have been no accusations of abuse. Given the intrusive nature of a strip and visual body cavity search, Rhode Island has endeavored to perform these searches in a relatively private manner. See Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Bell has not been read as holding that the security interests of a detention facility will always outweigh the privacy interests of the detainees.\" Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 957. Our previous decisions have also indicated that the Fourth Amendment balance cannot be shifted so quickly. See Swain, 117 F.3d at 7-8. This is not to say that prison officials are hamstrung in their efforts to protect the security of penal institutions. Both the Supreme Court in Bell and this Court in Arruda have suggested that an individualized reasonable suspicion is not necessary to search certain groups of inmates, such as those who receive visitors; other circuits have suggested that broad-based strip search policies may be appropriate in other circumstances. See, e.g., Giles, 746 F.2d at 617. Of course, officers may meet the reasonable suspicion standard based on their observations of a particular inmate during a less invasive pat-down frisk and clothing search, or based on contraband found during that search. However, \"[a]n indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied .a.a.acan not be justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\" Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013. Standing alone, the security concerns of the Intake facility cannot support the search policy here as it applies to minor offenses. The policy is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A \"strip search\" involves a visual inspection of the naked body of an inmate.

Appellee Craig Roberts challenged these policies as unconstitutional. The district court agreed that the policies were unconstitutional, holding that this Court's decision in Swain v.

Roberts v. Rhode Island, No. 99-259ML, slip op. at 13-17 (D.R.I. March 16, 2000). Rhode Island now appeals. Because we find that the Rhode Island policy does not meet the reasonableness test of Bell v.

After a computer check revealed that Roberts was the subject of an \"outstanding body attachment,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the officers performed a pat-down frisk and placed him in custody. Although Roberts produced a September 1, 1998 order withdrawing the attachment, he was not released. Instead, he was transported to the Intake Services Center (\"Intake\") at the Adult Correctional Institution (\"ACI\") in Cranston, Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon reaching Intake, Roberts was photographed, fingerprinted, and asked to submit to a blood test, which he refused. Officers then performed a strip search and visual bodily cavity search, pursuant to two DOC policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As part of the search, corrections officers inspected the inside of Roberts' mouth and nose and the soles of his feet. Roberts was also ordered to spread his buttocks, at which time officers visually inspected his body cavity. At no time during the search did an officer touch Roberts. No contraband was found on Roberts' person. Roberts was subjected to a second similar search the same day before being transferred and ultimately released from police custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the strip and visual body cavity search is necessary because of the unique nature of the Intake facility. Unlike many jurisdictions, Rhode Island does not have regional facilities to house pretrial detainees prior to trial and sentencing. Intake acts as the receiving facility for all male inmates committed to the care and custody of the DOC, including those arrested on an outstanding warrant, ordered held without bail, or unable to post bail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because Rhode Island has a unified prison system, pretrial detainees held at Intake mix with the general prison population. Intake is itself considered a maximum security prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees retain constitutional rights despite their incarceration, including basic Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Bell, 441 U.S. at 545. However, those rights may be subject to restrictions and limitations based on the fact of confinement, the legitimate goals and policies of the penal institution, and the need of the institution to maintain security and internal order. Id. at 545-46. \"When an institutional restriction infringes a specific constitutional guarantee,\" - here, the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches, - \"the practice must be evaluated in the light of the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.\" Id. at 546. This evaluation is a deferential one, giving due regard to the \"professional expertise of corrections officials,\" id. at 548 (citing Pell v. Procunier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109079\"><a href=\"/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 827 (1974)), and the limited role of the judiciary in operating and supervising correctional facilities, see id. (citing Procunier v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109016\"><a href=\"/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span>, 405 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bell, the Supreme Court specifically addressed a strip and visual body cavity search conducted of all inmates after every contact with an outside visitor. Id. at 558. Although the Court admitted that the practice of examining inmates' body cavities \"instinctively [gave it] the most pause,\" the Court upheld the search. Id. In determining that the search was reasonable, the Court balanced \"the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Id. at 559. More specifically, the Court instructed courts to \"consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id. After weighing these considerations, the Court found that \"visual body cavity searches [in the prison context] can 'be conducted on less than probable cause.'\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 6 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 560).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court held in Swain that, at least in the context of prisoners held in local jails for minor offenses, the Bell balance requires officers to have a reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee harbors contraband prior to conducting a strip or visual body cavity search. Swain, 117 F.3d at 7. Appellants argue that the heightened security concerns of the Intake facility allow for per se searches of committed inmates even absent individualized suspicion. Appellants also suggest that the requirement of judicial intervention (i.e., either an outstanding warrant or a judicial order) to commit an inmate to Intake changes the Bell calculation. We reconsider the Bell factors in light of these distinctions to determine if the Rhode Island policies are unreasonable searches prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the \"scope of the particular intrusion.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. In Swain, we recognized that visual body cavity searches \"impinge seriously upon\" Fourth Amendment values. 117 F.3d at 7. We had previously termed such searches a \"severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy.\" Arruda v. Fair, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420906\"><a href=\"/opinion/420906/paulo-arruda-v-michael-v-fair-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 887 (1st Cir. 1983). And although our language has not been as strident as that of the Seventh Circuit, see Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></span>, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983) (describing such searches as, among other things, \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, embarrassing and repulsive\"), we consider such searches an \"extreme intrusion\" on personal privacy and \"an offense to the dignity of the individual,\" Wood v. Clemons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196882\"><a href=\"/opinion/196882/wood-v-mcc-superintendant/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 928 (1st Cir. 1996). The search required by Rhode Island DOC policy is no exception: although Roberts was admittedly not touched by corrections officials, he was forced to display his genitals, as well as to spread his legs so that officials could observe his body cavity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the government interest at stake here, that is, the \"justification for initiating\" the search. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. In this case, that interest is primarily a concern for institutional security. This Court has recognized that institutional security is a legitimate need of law enforcement, and may provide a compelling reason for a warrantless strip search absent reasonable suspicion of individual wrongdoing. Swain, 117 F.3d at 7. Indeed, in Bell, the Supreme Court allowed searches of all inmates who had entertained visitors, even if there was no suspicion that an individual inmate had received contraband from a visitor. In Arruda, we upheld a search of all inmates returning from the law library and infirmary, as well as those inmates receiving visitors. 710 F.2d at 888. We focused on the fact that the prison was a maximum-security one, that the inmate in question had been confined to a \"special security area\" for particularly dangerous inmates, and that the \"record [contained] a lengthy history of prison contraband problems.\" Id. In contrast, we were unconvinced by institutional security concerns in Swain, because the arrestee there was held in a local jail and posed \"no risk\" of contact with other prisoners. 117 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The institutional security concerns in play here fall somewhere between those exhibited in Swain, which were insufficient to support a search, and those in Arruda and Bell, which made broad-based searches without individual suspicion reasonable. For the reasons detailed below, we think that the Rhode Island policies fall on the Swain side of the constitutional line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, unlike in Bell or Arruda, Rhode Island does not limit its searches to prisoners who have had contact with outside visitors. Courts have given prisons far more leeway in conducting searches of inmates with outside contact than in searching everyone, simply because such visits often allow smuggling of contraband. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558; Masters v. Crouch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521919\"><a href=\"/opinion/521919/karen-b-masters-v-bobby-g-crouch/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span>, 1253 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing the \"obvious risk\" that visits may be used to introduce contraband); Arruda, 710 F.2d at 888. Although inmates such as Roberts certainly have the opportunity to introduce contraband to the prison, and may have even done so in the past, it is far less likely that smuggling of contraband will occur subsequent to an arrest (when the detainee is normally in handcuffed custody) than during a contact visit that may have been arranged solely for the purpose of introducing contraband to the prison population. Furthermore, after an arrest the Rhode Island authorities should be able to detect contraband on the person of a detainee without the need for a body cavity inspection. In addition, the deterrent rationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant given the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest and subsequent incarceration. See Giles v. Ackerman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443066\"><a href=\"/opinion/443066/julie-ann-giles-v-richard-dick-j-ackerman-sheriff-of-bonneville-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 617 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although the Intake facility is maximum security, it is not a \"prison within a prison\" like that where Arruda was held. Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Prison officials had no reason to believe that Roberts was one of the \"most dangerous inmates .a.a.awhose continued retention in the general institution population is detrimental to the program of the institution,\" id. at 887 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127 &#167; 39), nor did Rhode Island differentiate its search to focus on such inmates. Unlike in Arruda, everyone at Intake was searched upon admission to the facility. While it is a reasonable approach to safeguarding institutional security to engage in extra efforts to ensure that the most dangerous inmates do not have access to weapons or contraband, the extension of the intrusion to far less dangerous inmates (such as Roberts) is a severe incursion on privacy frowned upon by the Bell balancing test. The fact that it requires some type of judicial order for an inmate to be committed to Intake does not change this assessment: the temporary incarceration of Roberts for his failure to appear indicates that both highly dangerous and relatively harmless offenders may be incarcerated with judicial approval.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, courts have given prisons latitude to premise searches on the type of crime for which an inmate is convicted or arrested. The reasonable suspicion standard may be met simply by the fact that the inmate was charged with a violent felony. See Dufrin v. Spreen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421867\"><a href=\"/opinion/421867/caroline-dufrin-v-oakland-county-sheriff-johannes-spreen/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span>, 1087 (6th Cir. 1983). However, when the inmate has been charged with only a misdemeanor involving minor offenses or traffic violations, crimes not generally associated with weapons or contraband, courts have required that officers have a reasonable suspicion that the individual inmate is concealing contraband. See Weber v. Dell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478949\"><a href=\"/opinion/478949/ann-weber-and-gary-j-weber-v-elizabeth-dell-officer-janssen-rembert/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span>, 802 (2d Cir. 1986) (misdemeanors); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454822\"><a href=\"/opinion/454822/paulette-stewart-v-lubbock-county-texas-barbara-wilkerson-on-behalf-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985) (misdemeanors); Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (traffic violations and other minor offenses); Hill v. Bogans, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"436169\"><a href=\"/opinion/436169/craig-hill-v-robert-bogans-and-the-city-and-county-of-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 394 (10th Cir. 1984) (traffic violations); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (misdemeanors); Logan v. Shealy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"395191\"><a href=\"/opinion/395191/lucy-n-logan-v-norris-shealy-earl-l-johnson-jr-william-f-vance-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981) (DWI). Roberts was picked up on an outstanding warrant from a family court; no evidence was adduced to indicate that his offense was the type normally associated with weapons or contraband. Moreover, Rhode Island has made no effort to engage in this sort of particularized approach, preferring to search all entrants to Intake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, a policy of searching all inmates is more reasonable when the record indicates a \"lengthy history of contraband problems.\" Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Although the record here does indicate a lengthy history of contraband problems, a close examination of that record indicates that a body cavity search was (with possibly one exception) entirely unnecessary to discover that contraband.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Cf. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (only a few items recovered from body cavities). The lack of specific instances where a body cavity search was necessary to discover contraband supports a finding that the policy of searching all inmates is an unreasonable one. Furthermore, the record indicates that less invasive (and less constitutionally problematic) searches would have been equally as effective in revealing contraband. For example, lacking reasonable suspicion that an individual is hiding contraband, Rhode Island could still search that person's clothes, a far less intrusive procedure than a full-scale strip and body cavity search. See id. at 1271.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, although appellants have cited \"institutional security\" as a sufficient reason not to require reasonable suspicion for inmate body cavity searches, their only justification for this severe invasion is that Intake is a maximum security facility where arrestees mingle with the general population. Intermingling of inmates is a serious security concern that weighs in favor of the reasonableness, and constitutionality, of the search. See Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491509\"><a href=\"/opinion/491509/jaroslaw-dobrowolskyj-v-jefferson-county-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 959 (6th Cir. 1987) (upholding \"a more narrowly drawn policy\" of searching those to be moved into the general jail population); Dufrin, 712 F.2d at 1087 (inmate would come into contact with general population); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (noting lack of intermingling). Several courts, however, have held that intermingling alone is insufficient to justify a search without reasonable suspicion. Chapman v. Nichols, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602915\"><a href=\"/opinion/602915/julie-chapman-v-doug-nichols-and-board-of-county-commissioners-of-creek/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 396 (10th Cir. 1993); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254. Another has noted that intermingling is a dubious reason for a strip search because it is inherently \"limited and avoidable.\" Giles, 746 F.2d at 619 (citing Smith v. Montgomery County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1479428\"><a href=\"/opinion/1479428/smith-v-montgomery-county-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 598-99 (D. Md. 1982)). We agree with these courts that the unified nature of the Rhode Island prison system is not, in itself, dispositive of the reasonableness of the search. To place so much weight on one (potentially alterable) characteristic of the state prison system would gut the balancing approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in Bell and applied by this Court in Swain and Arruda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bell balancing test also instructs us to consider the place in which the search is conducted and the manner in which it is conducted. 441 U.S. at 559. Neither aspect of this search is problematic. The policy requires the search to be conducted by officers of the same sex of the inmate. It appears from the record that the search is generally conducted in private.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Moreover, the search is entirely visual and there have been no accusations of abuse. Given the intrusive nature of a strip and visual body cavity search, Rhode Island has endeavored to perform these searches in a relatively private manner. See Justice v. City of Peachtree City, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580968\"><a href=\"/opinion/580968/charles-justice-as-next-friend-of-james-justice-keith-simon-as-next/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 193 (11th Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Bell has not been read as holding that the security interests of a detention facility will always outweigh the privacy interests of the detainees.\" Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 957. Our previous decisions have also indicated that the Fourth Amendment balance cannot be shifted so quickly. See Swain, 117 F.3d at 7-8. This is not to say that prison officials are hamstrung in their efforts to protect the security of penal institutions. Both the Supreme Court in Bell and this Court in Arruda have suggested that an individualized reasonable suspicion is not necessary to search certain groups of inmates, such as those who receive visitors; other circuits have suggested that broad-based strip search policies may be appropriate in other circumstances. See, e.g., Giles, 746 F.2d at 617. Of course, officers may meet the reasonable suspicion standard based on their observations of a particular inmate during a less invasive pat-down frisk and clothing search, or based on contraband found during that search. However, \"[a]n indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied .a.a.acan not be justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\" Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013. Standing alone, the security concerns of the Intake facility cannot support the search policy here as it applies to minor offenses. The policy is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A \"strip search\" involves a visual inspection of the naked body of an inmate.

The officer will examine:</p>\n        <p>(a) All pockets;</p>\n        <p>(b) Run fingers over linings, seams, collars, cuffs, waistbands and fly;</p>\n        <p>(c) Shoes, inside soles and heels;</p>\n        <p>(d) Socks, turning them inside out;</p>\n        <p>(e) False teeth, artificial limbs, plaster casts;</p>\n        <p>(f) Inmates will run their fingers through their hair. Officers will check for wigs and hairpieces;</p>\n        <p>(g) Inmates ears [sic] will be checked inside and out;</p>\n        <p>(h) The officer will look inside the inmate's nose;</p>\n        <p>(i) Inmates will open their mouths, lift their tongues, and roll each lip, for the officer's view;</p>\n        <p>(j) Inmates will lift their penises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear view of the groin area;</p>\n        <p>(k) Inmates will then lift their feet so that the officer can clearly see between the toes and the soles;</p>\n        <p>(l) Inmate's hands will be visually inspected;</p>\n        <p>(m) Inmates will be required to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear view of the area.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> No inmate is sent to Intake without judicial authority, i.e., without an outstanding warrant or other judicial action.

T. Wall II, the Interim Director of the Rhode Island DOC, are numerous incident reports of contraband discovery during the Intake admission process. With only one exception (where the inmate had hidden cocaine in his mouth), all the contraband was found in the inmate's clothing. Appellants have adduced no evidence of contraband that would not have been discovered without the visual body cavity search.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The DOC policy provides for searches to be \"conducted in a private area, away from public view.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
