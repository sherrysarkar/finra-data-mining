The district  court\r\n\ndenied  the  Guild's  request for  (i)  an  order compelling  the\r\n\nPublisher to submit to arbitration grievances arising under their\r\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreement   concerning  the   Publisher's\r\n\nobligations  to bargain  a successor agreement  and to  honor the\r\n\nterms  of  their  present  agreement  until   those  negotiations\r\n\nconcluded  and (ii) an order enjoining  the Publisher from laying\r\n\noff  members  of the  Guild,  pending resolution  of  the Guild's\r\n\ngrievances.   For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal in\r\n\npart as moot, and affirm in all other respects.\r\n\n                FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                                                           \r\n\n          This case  stems from  the merger and  consolidation of\r\n\nthree  newspapers.      Essex  County   Newspapers  (\"ECN\"),   an\r\n\nunincorporated  division of  Ottaway Newspapers,  Inc., publishes\r\n\nThe Beverly Times  and The Peabody Times,  daily newspapers, from\r                                                  \r\n\nits  plant in Beverly, Massachusetts.   Effective March 15, 1995,\r\n\nECN  completed its acquisition of The Salem Evening News, a daily\r                                                                  \r\n\nnewspaper, published  in Salem, Massachusetts.   This acquisition\r\n\nwas  completed through the merger  of the prior  owner, the Salem\r\n\nNews Publishing Company, into  the Salem News Publishing Company,\r\n\nInc.,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ottaway Newspapers, Inc.  ECN\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nis consolidating the three newspapers into one publication to  be\r\n\ncalled The Salem Evening  News.  This consolidated daily is to be\r                                        \r\n\npublished from  ECN's Beverly facility,  which is less  than five\r\n\nmiles from the less modern Salem plant.\r\n\n          The district  court noted that  this consolidation  was\r\n\nthe principal reason for ECN's acquisition and that it required a\r\n\nreduction in the work force  in order to avoid duplication.   For\r\n\nover  fifty years, the  Guild has been  the collective bargaining\r\n\nrepresentative for  the employees of  the publisher of  The Salem\r                                                                           \r\n\nEvening News.   The  most recent collective  bargaining agreement\r                      \r\n\nbetween the Guild and  the former publisher of The  Salem Evening\r                                                                           \r\n\nNews  expired  on  March  31,  1995  (the  \"Agreement\").1   Under\r              \r\n\nArticle 15 of the  Agreement, its terms and conditions  remain in\r\n\neffect during negotiations for a successor agreement.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1    By  its  original  terms, the  Agreement  was  to  expire on\r\nSeptember 30, 1994; but, it was extended until March 31, 1995, by\r\nagreement  of the parties.  The Guild contends that the Agreement\r\nwas  extended because of the then pending acquisition and due, in\r\npart, to  the Publisher's representations that  a \"new Agreement\"\r\nwould  contain  enhancements  or  improvements  of  the  existing\r\nAgreement.\r\n\n2  ARTICLE 15.  Duration and Renewal\r\n\n            15.1  This Agreement shall  commence on the\r\n          9th day of November,  1993, and expire on the\r\n          30th day of September, 1994, and  shall inure\r\n          to the  benefits of  and be binding  upon the\r\n          successors and assigns of the Publisher.\r\n\n            15.2  Within eighty (80) days, and not less\r\n          than   thirty   (30)   days  prior   to   the\r\n          termination of this Agreement,  the Publisher\r\n          or the Guild may initiate negotiations  for a\r\n          new Agreement  to take effect April  1, 1995,\r\n          the new contract shall be made retroactive to\r\n          September 30, 1994.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          In   January   1995,   the   Guild   timely   initiated\r\n\nnegotiations for a successor agreement, and the first substantive\r\n\nbargaining session occurred on March 30, 1995.  At that time, the\r\n\nPublisher began  negotiations with  all of the  unions, including\r\n\nthe Guild, at  the Salem  facility and presented  the same  basic\r\n\nproposal  to each:    elimination of  jobs  in Salem  due to  the\r\n\nconsolidation, and  layoff severance packages for those employees\r\n\nnot offered  employment  in the  consolidated  operation.   In  a\r\n\nletter dated  April 14, 1995,  the Publisher communicated  to the\r\n\nGuild \"that [its] proposal is to negotiate a merger/consolidation\r\n\nagreement  and not  a  long-term contract  which [it]  believe[s]\r\n\nwould not be appropriate because a question of representation may\r\n\nbe  presented.\"   (Appellant's  Appendix,  p.  143).    The  next\r\n\nbargaining  session took place  on May 5,  1995.   Seventeen days\r\n\nlater, in a letter dated May 22, the Guild notified the Publisher\r\n\nof its grievance that  the Publisher was violating Article  15 of\r\n\nthe Agreement \"by  its refusal to bargain a  successor Agreement,\r\n\nby its failure to honor  all terms and conditions of  the current\r\n\nAgreement during  the course of negotiations, and  by its related\r\n\nconduct  . .  . .\"  (Appellant's Appendix,  p. 202).   Subsequent\r\n\nbargaining  sessions occurred  on  May 25, June  7, and  June 13,\r\n\n1995.\r\n\n          Soon thereafter, on June 21,  the Guild filed a  Demand\r\n\nfor  Arbitration  with   the  American  Arbitration  Association,\r\n\ndemanding that the Publisher  arbitrate the Guild's grievance and\r\n\nthat the  Publisher  be ordered  to  \"bargain a  'new  Agreement'\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwithin the meaning of  Article 15.2, restore all status  quo ante\r                                                                           \r\n\nconditions  pending  such  negotiations  and  make  all  affected\r\n\nemployees  whole.\"   (Appellant's  Appendix, p.  234).   Two days\r\n\nlater, on June  23, 1995, the  Guild launched a  double-barrelled\r\n\nattack.  First, the  Guild filed a Complaint pursuant  to Section\r\n\n301 of the Labor-Management  Relations Act (\"LMRA\"), 29 U.S.C.   \r\n\n185, as amended,3 in the  U.S. District Court of the  District of\r\n\nMassachusetts,  seeking injunctive relief in the form of an order\r\n\ncompelling the  Publisher to submit grievances  arising under the\r\n\nAgreement  to  arbitration  as  well as  a  permanent  injunction\r\n\nagainst layoffs of Guild employees in violation of Article 4.5 of\r\n\nthe Agreement.4    Second,  it  filed an  unfair  labor  practice\r\n\ncharge  with the  National  Labor Relations  Board (the  \"NLRB\"),\r\n\npursuant  to  Section  8  of  the  National Labor  Relations  Act\r\n\n(\"NLRA\"),  29 U.S.C.    158,  as amended, asserting,  inter alia,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthat  the   Publisher  breached   its  obligations   \"to  bargain\r\n\ncollectively  in good  faith  . .  .  by  refusing to  bargain  a\r\n\nsuccessor  agreement . . . and by insisting instead on bargaining\r\n\nonly a 'merger/consolidation' agreement.\"  (Appellant's Appendix,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3    Section 301(a)  of the  Labor  Management Relations  Act, 29\r\nU.S.C.    185(a),  provides:  \"Suits for  violation of  contracts\r\nbetween  an  employer  and   a  labor  organization  representing\r\nemployees in  an industry affecting  commerce as defined  in this\r\nchapter, or between any such labor organizations,  may be brought\r\nin any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of\r\nthe parties,  without respect  to the  amount  in controversy  or\r\nwithout regard to the citizenship of the parties.\"\r\n\n4  Article  4.5 provides that  \"[t]here shall be no  dismissal of\r\nemployees in the Guild jurisdiction for economy or as a result of\r\nnew or modified processes or equipment.\"\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\np. 247).   The Guild requested essentially the  same relief as in\r\n\nits  Complaint,  including a  request  that  the NLRB  pursue  an\r\n\ninjunction against layoffs.  (Appellant's Appendix, pp. 301-03).\r\n\n          After a hearing, the  district court denied the Guild's\r\n\nmotion  for injunctive  relief on  July 24,  1995.   The district\r\n\ncourt   ruled  that   the  grievance   regarding  the   scope  of\r\n\nnegotiations   was  expressly   excepted  from   the  Agreement's\r\n\narbitration  provision, Article  12,  which the  Guild sought  to\r\n\nenforce.   The district court,  finding that no  employee layoffs\r\n\nhad  occurred  during  the  negotiations, held  that  should  any\r\n\nlayoffs occur  during negotiations  it would entertain  a renewed\r\n\npetition  to enjoin  them.   The district  court also  noted that\r\n\n\"[i]f  any  layoffs should  occur  after  negotiations have  been\r                                                  \r\n\nconcluded,  any  unfair  labor  practice  would  lie  within  the\r\n\njurisdiction of  the [NLRB], before  which body a  case involving\r\n\nthe same issues is presently pending.\"5\r\n\n          On July  28, 1995,  the Guild filed  this interlocutory\r\n\nappeal.   A week later, on  August 2, the  Publisher notified the\r\n\nGuild  that negotiations  were at  an impasse  and that  it would\r\n\nimplement its  final proposals unless  the Guild was  prepared to\r\n\nmeet again or respond with counterproposals before noon on August\r\n\n7.  Having had  no response, the Publisher notified the  Guild on\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  In  a letter  dated August 1,  1995, the American  Arbitration\r\nAssociation  notified   the  parties  that  \"[g]iven  the  courts\r\nposition regarding the arbitrability  of the matter as  stated in\r\ntheir  opinion dated  July  25, 1995,  the  Association will  not\r\nproceed with administration of this matter without the consent of\r\nthe parties or a court order.\"  (Appellant's Appendix, p. 293).\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nAugust 7 that negotiations  for a merger/consolidation  agreement\r\n\nwere concluded and that layoffs would be effective August 21.  On\r\n\nAugust  9, 1995, the Guild filed an amended unfair labor practice\r\n\ncharge  with  the  NLRB,  challenging, among  other  things,  the\r\n\nPublisher's unilateral declaration of impasse, conclusion of  the\r\n\nnegotiations and implementation of  the layoffs.  The Guild  then\r\n\nfiled an emergency motion  with the district court on  August 14,\r\n\n1995,  seeking  an  injunction prohibiting  any  layoffs  pending\r\n\nresolution  of this appeal.   The emergency motion  was denied on\r\n\nAugust 16,  1995.   Two days later,  the Guild filed  two motions\r\n\nwith this court  seeking an injunction pending  resolution of the\r\n\nappeal  and for  an  expedited appeal.    This court  denied  the\r\n\nformer6 and granted the latter.\r\n\n          Before us, then, is the Guild's appeal  of the district\r\n\ncourt's July 24, 1995, order.  The Guild argues that the district\r\n\ncourt erred by not applying the mandatory presumption in favor of\r\n\narbitration  and by failing to compel the Publisher to proceed to\r\n\narbitration.   It  requests that  the district  court's order  be\r\n\nreversed.  The Guild  also argues that the district  court abused\r\n\nits  discretion by refusing to enjoin the layoff of Guild members\r\n\nand requests  that the  status quo  ante be  restored.   We  have\r                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6    The  record  shows  that  of  the  seventy-five  (75)  Guild\r\nemployees, thirty-seven (37) have  been fully integrated into the\r\nnew consolidated The Salem  Evening News.  (Appellant's Appendix,\r                                                  \r\npp.  273 &amp; 296).   The Publisher  states, and the  Guild does not\r\ndispute,  that  of  the  thirty-eight  (38) that  were  laid  off\r\neffective August 21,  thirty-two (32)  executed full  releases of\r\nall  claims  relating  to  their employment  and  termination  in\r\nconsideration for severance packages.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\njurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1292(a).\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n                                I\r\n\n          As  a  threshold  matter,  we must  first  address  the\r\n\nPublisher's motion  to dismiss  this interlocutory appeal  on the\r\n\ngrounds that  it is moot.  The Publisher argues that both aspects\r\n\nof  the Guild's  appeal --  regarding compelling  arbitration and\r\n\nenjoining layoffs --  has been rendered moot  due to developments\r\n\nsince  the  district court's  decision;  namely,  the Publisher's\r\n\ndeclaration  of   impasse,   the  conclusion   of  the   parties'\r\n\nnegotiations, and  the implementation of layoffs  which the Guild\r\n\nsought to enjoin.\r\n\n          We address  the  layoffs first.    An appeal  from  the\r\n\ndenial of  a motion for  preliminary injunction is  rendered moot\r\n\nwhen the act sought to be enjoined has occurred.   See, e.g., CMM\r                                                                           \r\n\nCable  Rep., Inc. v.

Contrary  to the  Guild's\r                  \r\n\nargument,  the denial of the injunction  against the layoffs does\r\n\nnot fall within this exception.\r\n\n          We need not determine whether the second  prong of this\r\n\ntest is met  because the first is not.7   While the Publisher may\r\n\ndetermine  that additional  layoffs  are necessary  in its  post-\r\n\nconsolidation operation, \"there is no  demonstrated probability,\"\r\n\nWeinstein, 423 U.S. at 149, that additional layoffs are likely or\r                   \r\n\nthat Guild members  would be among those targeted.   Based on the\r\n\nrecord  before  us, implementation  of  the  layoffs due  to  the\r\n\nconsolidation is a one-time occurrence.  See, e.g., Railway Labor\r                                                                           \r\n\nExec. Assoc. v. Chesapeake W.

The  Publisher  also  argues  that  the  Guild's  appeal\r\n\nregarding  the district court's denial of an arbitration order is\r\n\nsimilarly moot due to the  Publisher's declaration of impasse and\r\n\nthe  conclusion of  the parties'  negotiations.   As there  is no\r\n\ndispute that  the terms and  conditions of the  Agreement expired\r\n\nupon the  parties'  reaching  impasse  or a  new  agreement,  the\r\n\nPublisher contends that the Guild can no longer obtain the relief\r\n\nsought in its motion --  i.e., to compel the Publisher \"to  honor\r                                       \r\n\nthe  terms of  the  collective bargaining  agreement until  those\r                                                                           \r\n\nnegotiations  are  completed.\"    (Appellant's  Appendix,  p.  38\r                                      \r\n\n(emphasis added)).   In  response, the Guild  argues convincingly\r\n\nthat,  if it prevails in its contention that the Publisher failed\r\n\nto enter  into the contractually required  negotiations, then the\r\n\nPublisher's unilateral declaration of impasse is without meaning.\r\n\nBecause the Guild makes a colorable  argument that it was and  is\r\n\nentitled  to  seek some  relief  through arbitration,  we  do not\r\n\nbelieve that its arbitration request is mooted by the Publisher's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  Because we have  dismissed this aspect of the appeal  as moot,\r\nwe  do not need  to address the Publisher's  claim that the Guild\r\nwithdrew  its request  for a  preliminary injunction  against the\r\nlayoffs nor resolve whether  or not the denial of  the injunction\r\nagainst the layoffs is properly before us. \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nunilateral declaration  of impasse.

In making this determination, the Supreme Court has\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nestablished  four  principles  to  guide  courts  in  determining\r\n\nwhether a labor dispute is arbitrable:9\r\n\n            Under  the  first principle,  the parties\r\n            must  have  contracted   to  submit   the\r\n            grievance  to  arbitration.   The  second\r\n            principle   requires   that   the   court\r\n            determine  whether the  contract provides\r\n            for   arbitration   of   the   particular\r\n            grievance   in   question.     The  third\r\n            principle  demands  that  the  court  not\r\n            decide  the merits of the grievance while\r\n            determining  the   arbitrability  of  the\r\n            dispute.    Finally,   if  the   contract\r\n            contains   an   arbitration   clause,   a\r\n            presumption of arbitrability arises.\r\n\nCumberland Typographical Union  244 v.

A  party's agreement  to arbitrate  is a\r\n\nmatter  of  contract  construction   and  whether  a  dispute  is\r\n\narbitrable under a collective  bargaining agreement is a question\r\n\nof law for the  court, AT &amp;  T Techs., 475 U.S.  at 649, and  the\r                                               \r\n\ncourt should not decline  to order arbitration \"unless it  may be\r\n\nsaid with positive assurance  that the arbitration clause  is not\r\n\nsusceptible  of  an  interpretation  that   covers  the  asserted\r\n\ndispute.\"  Warrior &amp; Gulf,  363 U.S. at 582-583, quoted in AT &amp; T\r                                                                           \r\n\nTechs.  , 465 U.S. at 650.

Even assuming that\r\n\nthe Publisher  was bound, we  find that  as a matter  of law  the\r\n\nGuild's  grievance is  not  arbitrable and  that, therefore,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  properly  denied  the Guild's  request  for  the\r\n\ninjunction.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          We  turn, then,  to  the arbitrability  of the  Guild's\r\n\ngrievance and to our  reasons for not finding it arbitrable.  The\r\n\nGuild's grievance is as follows:\r\n\n            The Publisher has violated  and continues\r\n            to violate  the Agreement by  its refusal\r\n            to bargain a successor Agreement,  by its\r\n            failure to honor all terms and conditions\r\n            of  the  current  Agreement   during  the\r\n            course  of  negotiations,   and  by   its\r\n            related conduct, all in violation of Art.\r\n            15   and   related   provisions  of   the\r\n            collective bargaining agreement.\r\n\n(Appellant's  Appendix,  pp. 202  &amp; 234).    Article 15.2  of the\r\n\nAgreement provides, in relevant part, that \"the Publisher or  the\r\n\nGuild  may initiate  negotiations  for a  new  Agreement to  take\r\n\neffect April 1,  1995\" and  that \"[t]he terms  and conditions  of\r\n\nthis Agreement shall remain  in effect during such negotiations.\"\r\n\n(Appellant's Appendix, p. 202).   In its Demand for  Arbitration,\r\n\nthe   relief   the   Guild    requests   is   to   \"[o]rder   the\r\n\nEmployer/Publisher  to  bargain  a  \"new  agreement\"  within  the\r\n\nmeaning of Article  15.2, restore all status quo  ante conditions\r                                                                \r\n\npending such  bargaining and make all  affected employees whole.\"\r\n\n(Appellant's Appendix,  p. 234).

Those\r\n\nprovisions provide, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\n            ARTICLE 12.  Grievance Committee\r\n\n            12.1    The   Guild  shall  designate   a\r\n            committee  .  . .  to  take  up with  the\r\n            Publisher  or  its  authorized agent  any\r\n            matter  arising  from the  application of\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n            this Agreement or affecting the relations\r\n            of the employees and the Publisher.\r\n\n            12.2   Any such matter, except renewal of\r                                                               \r\n            this contract, not satisfactorily settled\r                                   \r\n            within  a reasonable period  of its first\r\n            consideration may be  submitted to  final\r\n            and binding arbitration  by either  party\r\n            . . . .\r\n\n(Appellant's  Appendix, p.  61).   The Publisher argues  that the\r\n\nGuild's request is directly related to contract renewal and, when\r\n\nunveiled,    is    essentially    a    request    for   \"interest\r\n\narbitration.\"10   The district court  did not err  in denying the\r\n\nGuild's  request,  the   Publisher  concludes,   because  it   is\r\n\nexplicitly prohibited by the terms of the Agreement.\r\n\n          While the Guild concedes that \"interest arbitration\" is\r\n\nprohibited by  Article  12.2's  contract  renewal  exclusion,  it\r\n\nnonetheless  insists  that  it  is  not  seeking  to  compel  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  Two categories of  labor arbitration have been distinguished:\r\n(i)  \"grievance arbitration\"  which  concerns  disputes over  the\r\nterms of existing contracts and (ii) \"interest\" or \"new contract\"\r\narbitration  which allows for arbitration  of the terms  of a new\r\nagreement.

The  Guild  explains  that  the\r\n\narbitrator would  not be  dictating the  terms  of the  successor\r\n\nagreement; instead, it would be determining \"whether Article 15.2\r\n\nimposes an obligation on the Publisher to negotiate in good faith\r\n\non a  broader range of topics.\" (Appellant's  Brief, p. 26).  The\r\n\nGuild contends  that the district court's critical  error was its\r\n\nfailure to distinguish between the  obligation to bargain in good\r\n\nfaith and the  obligation to agree to specific  terms.  The Guild\r\n\nclaims that  the district court, while  properly recognizing that\r\n\nthe Guild only sought to have an arbitrator require the Publisher\r\n\nto  enter  into  bargaining  for  a  new  agreement,  erroneously\r                                     \r\n\nconcluded  that  \"[s]uch a  request is  beyond  the scope  of the\r\n\narbitration  clause  in  the  old  agreement  which  specifically\r\n\nexcludes contract renewal as a proper issue for arbitration.\"  In\r\n\nturn, the  Publisher contends  that the Guild's  \"distinction\" is\r\n\nbut a  \"semantic dance\" when the case is put in its full context.\r\n\nThe  Publisher contends that for  an arbitrator to  rule that the\r\n\nPublisher must engage in negotiations that are broader in scope -\r\n\n- i.e., renewal -- effectively amounts to the arbitrator deciding\r                \r\n\nthe \"renewal of the  contract\" which is expressly excluded  under\r\n\nArticle  12.    Because  the  term  or  length  of  a  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement  is one of the  more substantive provisions,\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nthe Publisher claims this is nothing less than a form of interest\r\n\narbitration.\r\n\n          We  agree with  the Publisher  and, thus,  find neither\r\n\nmistake  of law nor abuse  of discretion in  the district court's\r\n\nconclusion.  Not  only is the plain language of  Article 12 clear\r\n\nand  unambiguous  in  stating that  contract  renewal  is  not an\r\n\narbitral matter, we  are also  unpersuaded by  the Guild's  claim\r\n\nthat it asks  not for  \"interest arbitration\" but  rather for  an\r\n\narbitrator  to  merely decide  its  rights  under the  Agreement.\r\n\nWithout  deciding whether  a meaningful  distinction can  ever be\r\n\nmade between  the terms of a  new agreement and the  scope of the\r\n\nnegotiations  thereto,  or  whether  this distinction  is  but  a\r\n\n\"semantic  dance\" performed  by the  Guild,11 we  find  that here\r\n\nthere is none.   In this case, as  a practical matter, it is  not\r\n\npossible for an arbitrator  to issue an award defining  the scope\r\n\nof  the negotiations  for  a new  contract without  substantively\r\n\nimpacting the new contract and its terms and conditions.  Because\r\n\nthe  scope of the negotiations is part of the negotiating process\r\n\ntowards  a new  agreement,  the arbitrator  would necessarily  be\r\n\nmaking a determination involving  \"renewal of this contract\" were\r\n\nit to   define the  scope.  Thus,  although interest  arbitration\r\n\ngoes  only  to the  terms  of the  agreement rather  than  to the\r                                   \r\n\nnegotiations itself, the district  court neither erred nor abused\r                      \r\n\nits  discretion  when it  concluded  that  the Guild's  grievance\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n11  We also note that the Guild's argument may not necessarily be\r\na \"semantic dance\"  given that the parties could  have negotiated\r\nthe impasse and be where they are today. \r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\namounted  to \"interest  arbitration\" and  was, therefore,  a non-\r\n\narbitral  grievance  under the  plain  language  of Article  12's\r\n\nexclusion.\r\n\n          In  this regard, we find  the Guild's reliance on Inner\r                                                                           \r\n\nCity Broadcasting  Corp.  v.

Central to the court's\r                                                   \r\n\nholding  was its  finding  that AFTRA's  grievance fell  squarely\r\n\nwithin  the  arbitration  provision   at  issue  which  expressly\r\n\nprovided that \"any controversy or dispute arising with respect to\r\n\nthis contract or the interpretation or breach thereof . . . shall\r\n\nbe  settled by  arbitration.\"   Id.    In contrast,  the  Guild's\r                                             \r\n\ngrievance  and  the  relief  it  seeks  --  \"to  bargain  a  'new\r\n\nagreement'  within the meaning of Article  15.2\" -- goes directly\r\n\nto renewal of  the collective bargaining agreement and thus falls\r\n\noutside the  scope of  the arbitration provision  which expressly\r\n\nexcludes contract renewal as a proper issue for arbitration.\r\n\n          Second, in  Cumberland,  the court  upheld the  union's\r                                          \r\n\nright to  arbitrate  a dispute  which  arose under  the  parties'\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nexpired   collective   bargaining   agreement   concerning   that\r\n\nagreement's  lifetime job  guaranty provision.   The  dispute was\r\n\nabout  whether  the lifetime  job  guarantee  provision at  issue\r\n\nprevented   dramatic  wage  decreases   during  the  pendency  of\r\n\nnegotiations  for  a  new  agreement.    Central to  the  court's\r\n\ndecision  was the fact that  \"the 'new contract'  provision has a\r\n\ndirect and  substantial effect  upon a vested  arbitrable right,\"\r\n\nCumberland,  943 F.2d  at  407, and  that  the union  \"[was]  not\r                    \r\n\nseeking  a  'future   collective  bargaining  agreement'  through\r\n\narbitration  . . . ,  but enforcement of  the existing continuing\r\n\njob guarantee agreement.\"   Id. at 406.   In contrast, here,  the\r                                         \r\n\nGuild's  grievance  about  the  Publisher's  alleged  closed mind\r\n\nregarding negotiating  a successor  agreement does not  involve a\r\n\nvested  arbitrable   right  as  contract  renewal  is  explicitly\r                            \r\n\nexcluded under the plain language of Article 12.  In other words,\r\n\nwhen  unveiled, the  Guild's grievance  is essentially  concerned\r\n\nwith  the  acquisition of  future  rights  --  through a  renewed\r\n\nagreement  -- and is, thus, but a form of \"interest arbitration.\"\r\n\nAccordingly,  were we to grant  the Guild's request,  we would be\r\n\ncompelling  matters  of contract  renewal  to  arbitration --  in\r\n\nblatant contradiction of the Agreement's plain language.\r\n\n          Indeed,  because  renewal of  the  agreement  is not  a\r\n\npermissible topic for arbitration,  we fail to see what  there is\r\n\nfor  the  arbitrator  to  determine  other  than,  as  the  Guild\r\n\nsuggests, whether the Publisher came to  the negotiating table in\r\n\ngood faith  or with a  closed mind.   While this question,  which\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nstems from the  Publisher's refusal to  negotiate renewal of  the\r\n\nagreement after negotiations were  timely initiated by the Guild,\r\n\nmay  involve a  question of  unfair labor  practice, it  does not\r\n\ninvolve  a  vested arbitral  right  under the  plain  language of\r                                     \r\n\nArticle  12.    Cf.

Thus, because we  find \"with positive assurance that\r\n\nthe arbitration  clause is  not susceptible of  an interpretation\r\n\nthat covers the  asserted dispute,\"  Warrior &amp; Gulf,  363 U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n582-83,  and because there are no  doubts to be resolved in favor\r\n\nof  arbitration,12 we  find no  error or  abuse of  discretion in\r\n\nthe  district  court's  denial  of  the  Guild's  request  for  a\r\n\npermanent    injunction    compelling    arbitration    regarding\r\n\nnegotiations  for a successor agreement, and  affirm its order in\r\n\nthis respect.\r\n\n          Finally,  we address  the Guild's  claim that  \"certain\r\n\naspects of its Article  15 grievance do not depend on a predicate\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12  Because we find the Guild's grievance not arbitrable, we need\r\nnot address the remaining  two prongs that it had  to demonstrate\r\nin order to obtain an injunction.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nfinding that  the Publisher has refused to  negotiate a successor\r\n\nagreement,  and  therefore  cannot even  arguably  implicate  the\r\n\n\"contract  renewal\" exception to the  arbitration clause .  . . .\r\n\n[and that,] [t]herefore, the Publisher must at least be compelled\r\n\nto   arbitrate  those   aspects   of  the   arbitration  demand.\"\r\n\n(Appellant's Brief, p.  34 n.12).   After careful  review of  the\r\n\nrecord, however, we find that these issues which the Guild claims\r\n\nwere part of its  grievance were never squarely presented  to the\r\n\ndistrict  court.13   Because  they  were  not squarely  presented\r\n\nbelow,  the Guild may not raise them  for the first time in their\r\n\ninterlocutory appeal.

The district  court\r\n\ndenied  the  Guild's  request for  (i)  an  order compelling  the\r\n\nPublisher to submit to arbitration grievances arising under their\r\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreement   concerning  the   Publisher's\r\n\nobligations  to bargain  a successor agreement  and to  honor the\r\n\nterms  of  their  present  agreement  until   those  negotiations\r\n\nconcluded  and (ii) an order enjoining  the Publisher from laying\r\n\noff  members  of the  Guild,  pending resolution  of  the Guild's\r\n\ngrievances.   For the following reasons, we dismiss the appeal in\r\n\npart as moot, and affirm in all other respects.\r\n\n                FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                                                           \r\n\n          This case  stems from  the merger and  consolidation of\r\n\nthree  newspapers.      Essex  County   Newspapers  (\"ECN\"),   an\r\n\nunincorporated  division of  Ottaway Newspapers,  Inc., publishes\r\n\nThe Beverly Times  and The Peabody Times,  daily newspapers, from\r                                                  \r\n\nits  plant in Beverly, Massachusetts.   Effective March 15, 1995,\r\n\nECN  completed its acquisition of The Salem Evening News, a daily\r                                                                  \r\n\nnewspaper, published  in Salem, Massachusetts.   This acquisition\r\n\nwas  completed through the merger  of the prior  owner, the Salem\r\n\nNews Publishing Company, into  the Salem News Publishing Company,\r\n\nInc.,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ottaway Newspapers, Inc.  ECN\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nis consolidating the three newspapers into one publication to  be\r\n\ncalled The Salem Evening  News.  This consolidated daily is to be\r                                        \r\n\npublished from  ECN's Beverly facility,  which is less  than five\r\n\nmiles from the less modern Salem plant.\r\n\n          The district  court noted that  this consolidation  was\r\n\nthe principal reason for ECN's acquisition and that it required a\r\n\nreduction in the work force  in order to avoid duplication.   For\r\n\nover  fifty years, the  Guild has been  the collective bargaining\r\n\nrepresentative for  the employees of  the publisher of  The Salem\r                                                                           \r\n\nEvening News.   The  most recent collective  bargaining agreement\r                      \r\n\nbetween the Guild and  the former publisher of The  Salem Evening\r                                                                           \r\n\nNews  expired  on  March  31,  1995  (the  \"Agreement\").1   Under\r              \r\n\nArticle 15 of the  Agreement, its terms and conditions  remain in\r\n\neffect during negotiations for a successor agreement.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1    By  its  original  terms, the  Agreement  was  to  expire on\r\nSeptember 30, 1994; but, it was extended until March 31, 1995, by\r\nagreement  of the parties.  The Guild contends that the Agreement\r\nwas  extended because of the then pending acquisition and due, in\r\npart, to  the Publisher's representations that  a \"new Agreement\"\r\nwould  contain  enhancements  or  improvements  of  the  existing\r\nAgreement.\r\n\n2  ARTICLE 15.  Duration and Renewal\r\n\n            15.1  This Agreement shall  commence on the\r\n          9th day of November,  1993, and expire on the\r\n          30th day of September, 1994, and  shall inure\r\n          to the  benefits of  and be binding  upon the\r\n          successors and assigns of the Publisher.\r\n\n            15.2  Within eighty (80) days, and not less\r\n          than   thirty   (30)   days  prior   to   the\r\n          termination of this Agreement,  the Publisher\r\n          or the Guild may initiate negotiations  for a\r\n          new Agreement  to take effect April  1, 1995,\r\n          the new contract shall be made retroactive to\r\n          September 30, 1994.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          In   January   1995,   the   Guild   timely   initiated\r\n\nnegotiations for a successor agreement, and the first substantive\r\n\nbargaining session occurred on March 30, 1995.  At that time, the\r\n\nPublisher began  negotiations with  all of the  unions, including\r\n\nthe Guild, at  the Salem  facility and presented  the same  basic\r\n\nproposal  to each:    elimination of  jobs  in Salem  due to  the\r\n\nconsolidation, and  layoff severance packages for those employees\r\n\nnot offered  employment  in the  consolidated  operation.   In  a\r\n\nletter dated  April 14, 1995,  the Publisher communicated  to the\r\n\nGuild \"that [its] proposal is to negotiate a merger/consolidation\r\n\nagreement  and not  a  long-term contract  which [it]  believe[s]\r\n\nwould not be appropriate because a question of representation may\r\n\nbe  presented.\"   (Appellant's  Appendix,  p.  143).    The  next\r\n\nbargaining  session took place  on May 5,  1995.   Seventeen days\r\n\nlater, in a letter dated May 22, the Guild notified the Publisher\r\n\nof its grievance that  the Publisher was violating Article  15 of\r\n\nthe Agreement \"by  its refusal to bargain a  successor Agreement,\r\n\nby its failure to honor  all terms and conditions of  the current\r\n\nAgreement during  the course of negotiations, and  by its related\r\n\nconduct  . .  . .\"  (Appellant's Appendix,  p. 202).   Subsequent\r\n\nbargaining  sessions occurred  on  May 25, June  7, and  June 13,\r\n\n1995.\r\n\n          Soon thereafter, on June 21,  the Guild filed a  Demand\r\n\nfor  Arbitration  with   the  American  Arbitration  Association,\r\n\ndemanding that the Publisher  arbitrate the Guild's grievance and\r\n\nthat the  Publisher  be ordered  to  \"bargain a  'new  Agreement'\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwithin the meaning of  Article 15.2, restore all status  quo ante\r                                                                           \r\n\nconditions  pending  such  negotiations  and  make  all  affected\r\n\nemployees  whole.\"   (Appellant's  Appendix, p.  234).   Two days\r\n\nlater, on June  23, 1995, the  Guild launched a  double-barrelled\r\n\nattack.  First, the  Guild filed a Complaint pursuant  to Section\r\n\n301 of the Labor-Management  Relations Act (\"LMRA\"), 29 U.S.C.   \r\n\n185, as amended,3 in the  U.S. District Court of the  District of\r\n\nMassachusetts,  seeking injunctive relief in the form of an order\r\n\ncompelling the  Publisher to submit grievances  arising under the\r\n\nAgreement  to  arbitration  as  well as  a  permanent  injunction\r\n\nagainst layoffs of Guild employees in violation of Article 4.5 of\r\n\nthe Agreement.4    Second,  it  filed an  unfair  labor  practice\r\n\ncharge  with the  National  Labor Relations  Board (the  \"NLRB\"),\r\n\npursuant  to  Section  8  of  the  National Labor  Relations  Act\r\n\n(\"NLRA\"),  29 U.S.C.    158,  as amended, asserting,  inter alia,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthat  the   Publisher  breached   its  obligations   \"to  bargain\r\n\ncollectively  in good  faith  . .  .  by  refusing to  bargain  a\r\n\nsuccessor  agreement . . . and by insisting instead on bargaining\r\n\nonly a 'merger/consolidation' agreement.\"  (Appellant's Appendix,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3    Section 301(a)  of the  Labor  Management Relations  Act, 29\r\nU.S.C.    185(a),  provides:  \"Suits for  violation of  contracts\r\nbetween  an  employer  and   a  labor  organization  representing\r\nemployees in  an industry affecting  commerce as defined  in this\r\nchapter, or between any such labor organizations,  may be brought\r\nin any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of\r\nthe parties,  without respect  to the  amount  in controversy  or\r\nwithout regard to the citizenship of the parties.\"\r\n\n4  Article  4.5 provides that  \"[t]here shall be no  dismissal of\r\nemployees in the Guild jurisdiction for economy or as a result of\r\nnew or modified processes or equipment.\"\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\np. 247).   The Guild requested essentially the  same relief as in\r\n\nits  Complaint,  including a  request  that  the NLRB  pursue  an\r\n\ninjunction against layoffs.  (Appellant's Appendix, pp. 301-03).\r\n\n          After a hearing, the  district court denied the Guild's\r\n\nmotion  for injunctive  relief on  July 24,  1995.   The district\r\n\ncourt   ruled  that   the  grievance   regarding  the   scope  of\r\n\nnegotiations   was  expressly   excepted  from   the  Agreement's\r\n\narbitration  provision, Article  12,  which the  Guild sought  to\r\n\nenforce.   The district court,  finding that no  employee layoffs\r\n\nhad  occurred  during  the  negotiations, held  that  should  any\r\n\nlayoffs occur  during negotiations  it would entertain  a renewed\r\n\npetition  to enjoin  them.   The district  court also  noted that\r\n\n\"[i]f  any  layoffs should  occur  after  negotiations have  been\r                                                  \r\n\nconcluded,  any  unfair  labor  practice  would  lie  within  the\r\n\njurisdiction of  the [NLRB], before  which body a  case involving\r\n\nthe same issues is presently pending.\"5\r\n\n          On July  28, 1995,  the Guild filed  this interlocutory\r\n\nappeal.   A week later, on  August 2, the  Publisher notified the\r\n\nGuild  that negotiations  were at  an impasse  and that  it would\r\n\nimplement its  final proposals unless  the Guild was  prepared to\r\n\nmeet again or respond with counterproposals before noon on August\r\n\n7.  Having had  no response, the Publisher notified the  Guild on\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  In  a letter  dated August 1,  1995, the American  Arbitration\r\nAssociation  notified   the  parties  that  \"[g]iven  the  courts\r\nposition regarding the arbitrability  of the matter as  stated in\r\ntheir  opinion dated  July  25, 1995,  the  Association will  not\r\nproceed with administration of this matter without the consent of\r\nthe parties or a court order.\"  (Appellant's Appendix, p. 293).\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nAugust 7 that negotiations  for a merger/consolidation  agreement\r\n\nwere concluded and that layoffs would be effective August 21.  On\r\n\nAugust  9, 1995, the Guild filed an amended unfair labor practice\r\n\ncharge  with  the  NLRB,  challenging, among  other  things,  the\r\n\nPublisher's unilateral declaration of impasse, conclusion of  the\r\n\nnegotiations and implementation of  the layoffs.  The Guild  then\r\n\nfiled an emergency motion  with the district court on  August 14,\r\n\n1995,  seeking  an  injunction prohibiting  any  layoffs  pending\r\n\nresolution  of this appeal.   The emergency motion  was denied on\r\n\nAugust 16,  1995.   Two days later,  the Guild filed  two motions\r\n\nwith this court  seeking an injunction pending  resolution of the\r\n\nappeal  and for  an  expedited appeal.    This court  denied  the\r\n\nformer6 and granted the latter.\r\n\n          Before us, then, is the Guild's appeal  of the district\r\n\ncourt's July 24, 1995, order.  The Guild argues that the district\r\n\ncourt erred by not applying the mandatory presumption in favor of\r\n\narbitration  and by failing to compel the Publisher to proceed to\r\n\narbitration.   It  requests that  the district  court's order  be\r\n\nreversed.  The Guild  also argues that the district  court abused\r\n\nits  discretion by refusing to enjoin the layoff of Guild members\r\n\nand requests  that the  status quo  ante be  restored.   We  have\r                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6    The  record  shows  that  of  the  seventy-five  (75)  Guild\r\nemployees, thirty-seven (37) have  been fully integrated into the\r\nnew consolidated The Salem  Evening News.  (Appellant's Appendix,\r                                                  \r\npp.  273 &amp; 296).   The Publisher  states, and the  Guild does not\r\ndispute,  that  of  the  thirty-eight  (38) that  were  laid  off\r\neffective August 21,  thirty-two (32)  executed full  releases of\r\nall  claims  relating  to  their employment  and  termination  in\r\nconsideration for severance packages.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\njurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1292(a).\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n                                I\r\n\n          As  a  threshold  matter,  we must  first  address  the\r\n\nPublisher's motion  to dismiss  this interlocutory appeal  on the\r\n\ngrounds that  it is moot.  The Publisher argues that both aspects\r\n\nof  the Guild's  appeal --  regarding compelling  arbitration and\r\n\nenjoining layoffs --  has been rendered moot  due to developments\r\n\nsince  the  district court's  decision;  namely,  the Publisher's\r\n\ndeclaration  of   impasse,   the  conclusion   of  the   parties'\r\n\nnegotiations, and  the implementation of layoffs  which the Guild\r\n\nsought to enjoin.\r\n\n          We address  the  layoffs first.    An appeal  from  the\r\n\ndenial of  a motion for  preliminary injunction is  rendered moot\r\n\nwhen the act sought to be enjoined has occurred.   See, e.g., CMM\r                                                                           \r\n\nCable  Rep., Inc. v.

The  Publisher  also  argues  that  the  Guild's  appeal\r\n\nregarding  the district court's denial of an arbitration order is\r\n\nsimilarly moot due to the  Publisher's declaration of impasse and\r\n\nthe  conclusion of  the parties'  negotiations.   As there  is no\r\n\ndispute that  the terms and  conditions of the  Agreement expired\r\n\nupon the  parties'  reaching  impasse  or a  new  agreement,  the\r\n\nPublisher contends that the Guild can no longer obtain the relief\r\n\nsought in its motion --  i.e., to compel the Publisher \"to  honor\r                                       \r\n\nthe  terms of  the  collective bargaining  agreement until  those\r                                                                           \r\n\nnegotiations  are  completed.\"    (Appellant's  Appendix,  p.  38\r                                      \r\n\n(emphasis added)).   In  response, the Guild  argues convincingly\r\n\nthat,  if it prevails in its contention that the Publisher failed\r\n\nto enter  into the contractually required  negotiations, then the\r\n\nPublisher's unilateral declaration of impasse is without meaning.\r\n\nBecause the Guild makes a colorable  argument that it was and  is\r\n\nentitled  to  seek some  relief  through arbitration,  we  do not\r\n\nbelieve that its arbitration request is mooted by the Publisher's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  Because we have  dismissed this aspect of the appeal  as moot,\r\nwe  do not need  to address the Publisher's  claim that the Guild\r\nwithdrew  its request  for a  preliminary injunction  against the\r\nlayoffs nor resolve whether  or not the denial of  the injunction\r\nagainst the layoffs is properly before us. \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nunilateral declaration  of impasse.

Even assuming that\r\n\nthe Publisher  was bound, we  find that  as a matter  of law  the\r\n\nGuild's  grievance is  not  arbitrable and  that, therefore,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  properly  denied  the Guild's  request  for  the\r\n\ninjunction.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          We  turn, then,  to  the arbitrability  of the  Guild's\r\n\ngrievance and to our  reasons for not finding it arbitrable.  The\r\n\nGuild's grievance is as follows:\r\n\n            The Publisher has violated  and continues\r\n            to violate  the Agreement by  its refusal\r\n            to bargain a successor Agreement,  by its\r\n            failure to honor all terms and conditions\r\n            of  the  current  Agreement   during  the\r\n            course  of  negotiations,   and  by   its\r\n            related conduct, all in violation of Art.\r\n            15   and   related   provisions  of   the\r\n            collective bargaining agreement.\r\n\n(Appellant's  Appendix,  pp. 202  &amp; 234).    Article 15.2  of the\r\n\nAgreement provides, in relevant part, that \"the Publisher or  the\r\n\nGuild  may initiate  negotiations  for a  new  Agreement to  take\r\n\neffect April 1,  1995\" and  that \"[t]he terms  and conditions  of\r\n\nthis Agreement shall remain  in effect during such negotiations.\"\r\n\n(Appellant's Appendix, p. 202).   In its Demand for  Arbitration,\r\n\nthe   relief   the   Guild    requests   is   to   \"[o]rder   the\r\n\nEmployer/Publisher  to  bargain  a  \"new  agreement\"  within  the\r\n\nmeaning of Article  15.2, restore all status quo  ante conditions\r                                                                \r\n\npending such  bargaining and make all  affected employees whole.\"\r\n\n(Appellant's Appendix,  p. 234).  The  Publisher argues, however,\r\n\nthat what the Guild  seeks to arbitrate is explicitly  beyond the\r\n\nscope of the arbitration provisions in the Agreement,  upon which\r\n\nthe  Guild's   motion  to  compel  arbitration   relies.    Those\r\n\nprovisions provide, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\n            ARTICLE 12.  Grievance Committee\r\n\n            12.1    The   Guild  shall  designate   a\r\n            committee  .  . .  to  take  up with  the\r\n            Publisher  or  its  authorized agent  any\r\n            matter  arising  from the  application of\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n            this Agreement or affecting the relations\r\n            of the employees and the Publisher.\r\n\n            12.2   Any such matter, except renewal of\r                                                               \r\n            this contract, not satisfactorily settled\r                                   \r\n            within  a reasonable period  of its first\r\n            consideration may be  submitted to  final\r\n            and binding arbitration  by either  party\r\n            . . . .\r\n\n(Appellant's  Appendix, p.  61).   The Publisher argues  that the\r\n\nGuild's request is directly related to contract renewal and, when\r\n\nunveiled,    is    essentially    a    request    for   \"interest\r\n\narbitration.\"10   The district court  did not err  in denying the\r\n\nGuild's  request,  the   Publisher  concludes,   because  it   is\r\n\nexplicitly prohibited by the terms of the Agreement.\r\n\n          While the Guild concedes that \"interest arbitration\" is\r\n\nprohibited by  Article  12.2's  contract  renewal  exclusion,  it\r\n\nnonetheless  insists  that  it  is  not  seeking  to  compel  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  Two categories of  labor arbitration have been distinguished:\r\n(i)  \"grievance arbitration\"  which  concerns  disputes over  the\r\nterms of existing contracts and (ii) \"interest\" or \"new contract\"\r\narbitration  which allows for arbitration  of the terms  of a new\r\nagreement.

The  Guild  explains  that  the\r\n\narbitrator would  not be  dictating the  terms  of the  successor\r\n\nagreement; instead, it would be determining \"whether Article 15.2\r\n\nimposes an obligation on the Publisher to negotiate in good faith\r\n\non a  broader range of topics.\" (Appellant's  Brief, p. 26).  The\r\n\nGuild contends  that the district court's critical  error was its\r\n\nfailure to distinguish between the  obligation to bargain in good\r\n\nfaith and the  obligation to agree to specific  terms.  The Guild\r\n\nclaims that  the district court, while  properly recognizing that\r\n\nthe Guild only sought to have an arbitrator require the Publisher\r\n\nto  enter  into  bargaining  for  a  new  agreement,  erroneously\r                                     \r\n\nconcluded  that  \"[s]uch a  request is  beyond  the scope  of the\r\n\narbitration  clause  in  the  old  agreement  which  specifically\r\n\nexcludes contract renewal as a proper issue for arbitration.\"  In\r\n\nturn, the  Publisher contends  that the Guild's  \"distinction\" is\r\n\nbut a  \"semantic dance\" when the case is put in its full context.\r\n\nThe  Publisher contends that for  an arbitrator to  rule that the\r\n\nPublisher must engage in negotiations that are broader in scope -\r\n\n- i.e., renewal -- effectively amounts to the arbitrator deciding\r                \r\n\nthe \"renewal of the  contract\" which is expressly excluded  under\r\n\nArticle  12.    Because  the  term  or  length  of  a  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement  is one of the  more substantive provisions,\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nthe Publisher claims this is nothing less than a form of interest\r\n\narbitration.\r\n\n          We  agree with  the Publisher  and, thus,  find neither\r\n\nmistake  of law nor abuse  of discretion in  the district court's\r\n\nconclusion.  Not  only is the plain language of  Article 12 clear\r\n\nand  unambiguous  in  stating that  contract  renewal  is  not an\r\n\narbitral matter, we  are also  unpersuaded by  the Guild's  claim\r\n\nthat it asks  not for  \"interest arbitration\" but  rather for  an\r\n\narbitrator  to  merely decide  its  rights  under the  Agreement.\r\n\nWithout  deciding whether  a meaningful  distinction can  ever be\r\n\nmade between  the terms of a  new agreement and the  scope of the\r\n\nnegotiations  thereto,  or  whether  this distinction  is  but  a\r\n\n\"semantic  dance\" performed  by the  Guild,11 we  find  that here\r\n\nthere is none.   In this case, as  a practical matter, it is  not\r\n\npossible for an arbitrator  to issue an award defining  the scope\r\n\nof  the negotiations  for  a new  contract without  substantively\r\n\nimpacting the new contract and its terms and conditions.  Because\r\n\nthe  scope of the negotiations is part of the negotiating process\r\n\ntowards  a new  agreement,  the arbitrator  would necessarily  be\r\n\nmaking a determination involving  \"renewal of this contract\" were\r\n\nit to   define the  scope.  Thus,  although interest  arbitration\r\n\ngoes  only  to the  terms  of the  agreement rather  than  to the\r                                   \r\n\nnegotiations itself, the district  court neither erred nor abused\r                      \r\n\nits  discretion  when it  concluded  that  the Guild's  grievance\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n11  We also note that the Guild's argument may not necessarily be\r\na \"semantic dance\"  given that the parties could  have negotiated\r\nthe impasse and be where they are today. \r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\namounted  to \"interest  arbitration\" and  was, therefore,  a non-\r\n\narbitral  grievance  under the  plain  language  of Article  12's\r\n\nexclusion.\r\n\n          In  this regard, we find  the Guild's reliance on Inner\r                                                                           \r\n\nCity Broadcasting  Corp.  v.

In contrast,  the  Guild's\r                                             \r\n\ngrievance  and  the  relief  it  seeks  --  \"to  bargain  a  'new\r\n\nagreement'  within the meaning of Article  15.2\" -- goes directly\r\n\nto renewal of  the collective bargaining agreement and thus falls\r\n\noutside the  scope of  the arbitration provision  which expressly\r\n\nexcludes contract renewal as a proper issue for arbitration.\r\n\n          Second, in  Cumberland,  the court  upheld the  union's\r                                          \r\n\nright to  arbitrate  a dispute  which  arose under  the  parties'\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nexpired   collective   bargaining   agreement   concerning   that\r\n\nagreement's  lifetime job  guaranty provision.

In contrast, here,  the\r                                         \r\n\nGuild's  grievance  about  the  Publisher's  alleged  closed mind\r\n\nregarding negotiating  a successor  agreement does not  involve a\r\n\nvested  arbitrable   right  as  contract  renewal  is  explicitly\r                            \r\n\nexcluded under the plain language of Article 12.  In other words,\r\n\nwhen  unveiled, the  Guild's grievance  is essentially  concerned\r\n\nwith  the  acquisition of  future  rights  --  through a  renewed\r\n\nagreement  -- and is, thus, but a form of \"interest arbitration.\"\r\n\nAccordingly,  were we to grant  the Guild's request,  we would be\r\n\ncompelling  matters  of contract  renewal  to  arbitration --  in\r\n\nblatant contradiction of the Agreement's plain language.\r\n\n          Indeed,  because  renewal of  the  agreement  is not  a\r\n\npermissible topic for arbitration,  we fail to see what  there is\r\n\nfor  the  arbitrator  to  determine  other  than,  as  the  Guild\r\n\nsuggests, whether the Publisher came to  the negotiating table in\r\n\ngood faith  or with a  closed mind.   While this question,  which\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nstems from the  Publisher's refusal to  negotiate renewal of  the\r\n\nagreement after negotiations were  timely initiated by the Guild,\r\n\nmay  involve a  question of  unfair labor  practice, it  does not\r\n\ninvolve  a  vested arbitral  right  under the  plain  language of\r                                     \r\n\nArticle  12.

(reviewing doctrine and concluding\r\n\nthat it mandates the holding that district courts may not decide,\r\n\nindependent of the NLRB,  the merits of an unfair  labor practice\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n\"primarily   representational\"  and,  thus,  within  the  primary\r\njurisdiction of the  NLRB.  See Local Union 204,  668 F.2d at 419\r                                                         \r\n(\"We believe the  appropriate line between those  cases where the\r\ndistrict court has  jurisdiction under section  301 and those  in\r\nwhich  it does  not is to  be determined  by examining  the major\r\nissues to be decided  as to whether they can  be characterized as\r\nprimarily representational or contractual.\").  \r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\ndefense to enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement in  a\r\n\nsection 301 action), reh'g denied, (1979).\r                                           \r\n\n          Here, the gravamen of the Guild's complaint is that the\r\n\nemployer bargained in bad  faith, unlawfully reached impasse, and\r\n\nunlawfully undermined the Guild's representational status.  These\r\n\nissues fall  squarely within  the NLRB's primary  jurisdiction as\r\n\nthey  are  essentially  extra-contractual  claims  regarding  the\r\n\nPublisher's duty  to bargain  in good faith,  its conduct  during\r\n\nnegotiations   and   the   resulting  damage   to   the   Guild's\r\n\nrepresentational  status.  29 U.S.C.   158.  Accordingly, we find\r\n\nno error in the district court's conclusion that any unfair labor\r\n\npractice charge  would fall  within the NLRB's  jurisdiction once\r\n\nnegotiations concluded.  Finally, we merely add that, even if the\r\n\nGuild's  claims constituted  a legitimate  section 301  claim, we\r\n\nwould  nonetheless find  no abuse  of discretion in  the district\r\n\ncourt's decision to defer to the NLRB's jurisdiction.
