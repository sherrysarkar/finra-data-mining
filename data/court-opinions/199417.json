Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n         Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stephen B. Hrones, with whom Hrones & Garrity was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Heidi E.\nBrieger, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                         May 30, 2001\n\f\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.              On October 14, 1999, a jury\n\nconvicted defendant-appellant Marla Barnes of conspiracy to\n\nimport cocaine and unlawful use of a communications facility in\n\nconnection with that conspiracy.              See 21 U.S.C. §§ 963, 843(b).\n\nThe district court imposed a 168-month incarcerative sentence,\n\nto be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.                       The\n\nappellant now challenges her conviction on various grounds.\n\nFinding her arguments unpersuasive, we affirm the conviction.\n\nThe appellant also advances three assignments of error that\n\ntouch upon her sentence.          We reject two of these, but accept the\n\nthird.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n           This appeal arises out of a joint trial at which both\n\nthe   appellant      and    her    brother,     Reynaldo,    were      convicted.\n\nAlthough we consolidated their ensuing appeals for briefing and\n\noral argument, we opted to dispose of the appeals separately.\n\nThis is the second of the two opinions.\n\n           Because the facts on which the convictions rest are not\n\ncentral   to   the    issues      raised   on    this   appeal,   we    begin   by\n\nrehearsing     what    we    previously         wrote   in   connection      with\n\nReynaldo's appeal:\n\n           [T]he jury supportably could have found that\n           [Reynaldo Barnes], in an effort to expand\n           his ongoing trade in illegal narcotics, told\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f           one of his quondam customers that his\n           sister, Marla Barnes, could provide the\n           sizable quantities of cocaine that the\n           customer   professed   to  require.     The\n           customer, in reality an undercover agent\n           employed by the federal Drug Enforcement\n           Administration    (DEA),    accepted    the\n           invitation.    He thereafter met with the\n           Barnes siblings, and Marla Barnes made\n           preliminary arrangements (or so she said)\n           for a large purchase of cocaine through her\n           connections in Panama.\n\n                  As an initial step in the process,\n           Marla Barnes sold a one kilogram sample of\n           cocaine to the undercover agent. . . . For\n           a variety of reasons, the larger deal never\n           materialized.\n\nUnited States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           The grand jury initially indicted both Barnes siblings\n\nin what we sometimes shall call \"Indictment No. 1.\"             The charges\n\nwere severed, however, after Reynaldo indicated an intention to\n\nplead    guilty.     Following     Marla   Barnes's   separate    trial   on\n\nIndictment No. 1, she was convicted of conspiracy to import\n\ncocaine.    On appeal, this court vacated the judgment and ordered\n\nthe indictment dismissed without prejudice as to Marla Barnes on\n\nthe ground that the prosecution had dallied impermissibly in\n\nbringing her to trial.       United States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 15-\n\n18 (1st Cir. 1998) (Barnes I).\n\n           The     grand   jury   promptly   reindicted   the    appellant,\n\ncharging her, in what we sometimes shall call \"Indictment No.\n\n                                     -4-\n\f2,\" not only with conspiracy to import cocaine but also with two\n\ninstances of unlawful use of a communications facility in the\n\ncourse of drug-trafficking activities.                 At that time, Indictment\n\nNo. 1 was still pending against Reynaldo Barnes, who had moved\n\nto withdraw his guilty plea.                 On March 19, 1999, the district\n\ncourt   (Tauro,        J.)   allowed       the     motion    to   withdraw.        The\n\ngovernment      then    moved       to   dismiss    Indictment     No.     1   without\n\nprejudice and Reynaldo moved to dismiss that indictment with\n\nprejudice.\n\n            These motions were pending on May 19, 1999, when the\n\ngrand   jury     —   one     day    before    the    appellant's        speedy   trial\n\ndeadline    —    superseded         Indictment      No.     2.    The    superseding\n\nindictment added Reynaldo Barnes as a defendant in this case,\n\ncharging him with having committed the same offenses that it\n\npreviously had charged Marla Barnes with committing.1                          Several\n\nthings then occurred.              We mention two.        On June 23, 1999, Judge\n\nTauro denied Reynaldo Barnes's motion to dismiss Indictment No.\n\n1 with prejudice and granted the government's cross-motion for\n\ndismissal       without      prejudice.          The      superseded     version    of\n\n\n    1The first and second indictments did not replicate one\nanother. Although both charged the defendants with conspiracy,\nIndictment No. 1 included a criminal forfeiture count, see 21\nU.S.C. § 853, which Indictment No. 2 omitted, and Indictment No.\n2 (as initially brought and as superseded) included two\n\"communications facility\" counts, see id. § 843(b), which\nIndictment No. 1 omitted.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fIndictment No. 2 remained zoetic, with both Barnes siblings as\n\ndefendants.            On   October       4,   1999,    Judge    Gorton   denied    the\n\nappellant's motion to dismiss that indictment under the Speedy\n\nTrial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 (the STA).                    The case eventually went\n\nto trial and the jury convicted both defendants — Reynaldo on\n\nall three counts and Marla on the conspiracy count and one of\n\nthe two \"communications facility\" counts (acquitting her on the\n\nremaining count).            This appeal followed.\n\n             Before         us,    the   appellant      advances   three      principal\n\narguments.        First, she classifies the government as a repeat\n\noffender, contending that it again violated her rights under the\n\nSTA.    Second, she claims to have detected reversible error in\n\nthe district court's jury instructions.                         Third, she lodges a\n\nmultifaceted       claim          of   sentencing      error.     We   address   these\n\nasseverations sequentially.\n\nII.    ALLEGED SPEEDY TRIAL ACT VIOLATIONS\n\n             In invoking the prophylaxis of the STA, the appellant\n\nmakes three interrelated arguments.                      The lower court rejected\n\nall of them, and so do we.\n\n                  A.    Commencement of the STA Time Line.\n\n             Typically, the speedy trial clock begins to run on the\n\nlater of (a) the filing date of the indictment or information,\n\nor    (b)   the   defendant's            first   appearance      before   a   judicial\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fofficer.     18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1).            In the event of a retrial,\n\nhowever, the STA adds a special twist.                  It stipulates that, in\n\nsuch an event, \"the trial shall commence within seventy days\n\nfrom the date the action occasioning the trial becomes final.\"\n\nId. § 3161(d)(2).\n\n           The    appellant     contends      that      this   latter    provision\n\ngoverns her case, and that, therefore, the relevant date for\n\nrestarting the speedy trial clock was January 12, 1999 (the date\n\nwhen our mandate issued in Barnes I).                Because the second trial\n\ndid not commence within seventy non-excluded days of that date,\n\nthe appellant moved to dismiss the new indictment.                    The district\n\ncourt refused to attach decretory significance to the January 12\n\ndate and, accordingly, denied the motion.                      Affording de novo\n\nreview, see United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 600 (1st Cir.\n\n1996), we uphold the district court's ruling.\n\n           In arguing that this court's mandate qualifies as \"the\n\naction occasioning the trial\" and thus governs the speedy trial\n\ncomputation, the appellant             relies almost exclusively on our\n\ndecision in      United States v.        Joost, 133 F.3d 125 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).     To be sure, we held there that the date of mandate\n\nconstituted      the   starting    point      for   a   renewed       speedy   trial\n\ncalculation.      Id. at 130.     But the circumstances were materially\n\ndifferent.        In   Joost,     we    had   overturned        the    defendant's\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fconviction     based   on   parlous    jury   instructions,    leaving   the\n\nindictment intact and setting the stage for a retrial on the\n\nsame indictment.       Id. at 127.\n\n            The case at hand is cut from markedly different cloth.\n\nOur decision in Barnes I resulted in dismissal of the then-\n\npending indictment, thereby precluding a further trial unless\n\nthe government obtained a new indictment.            See United States v.\n\nTaylor, 487 U.S. 326, 342 (1988) (explaining that dismissal\n\nwithout prejudice under the STA forces the government to obtain\n\na new indictment if it chooses to reprosecute); United States v.\n\nBrown, 770 F.2d 241, 243 (1st Cir. 1985) (similar).               Thus, in\n\ncontrast to Joost, this case does not involve a retrial on the\n\nsame indictment, but, rather, a first trial on a new indictment.\n\nFor this reason, the issuance of mandate in connection with the\n\noriginal appeal cannot be viewed as \"the action occasioning the\n\ntrial,\"     and   section    3161(c)(1),       not   section   3161(d)(2),\n\ncontrols.\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.           The grand jury\n\nhanded    up   Indictment    No.   2    on    November   19,   1998.     The\n\nappellant's initial appearance before the court with respect to\n\nthat indictment took place on February 11, 1999.                The latter\n\ndate, rather than the date of mandate in Barnes I, marks the\n\noccasion for restarting the speedy trial clock.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f                             B.    Excludable Time.\n\n            Once the clock begins to tick, the STA contemplates\n\nseveral     situations       in     which        delays         may     occur   without\n\ncompromising the seventy-day limit.                See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)-\n\n(9).   The appellant challenges the district court's exclusion of\n\ncertain    time,    claiming       that    the    court         erred   in   granting   a\n\ncontinuance and a concomitant period of excludable delay, based\n\non the \"ends of justice.\"            Id. § 3161(h)(8)(A).                We review the\n\ndistrict court's \"ends of justice\" determination for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1044 (1st\n\nCir. 1983).       We discern none in this instance.\n\n            The    rudiments       are    clear.           When    a    judge   bases   a\n\ncontinuance on an explicit finding that the ends of justice\n\noutweigh    the     collective       interest         in    a     speedy     trial,   the\n\nresulting    period     of    delay       may    be    excluded         under   section\n\n3161(h)(8) of the STA.            United States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130\n\nF.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1997).              Gaining such an exclusion involves\n\na balancing of the interests of the prosecution, the defendant,\n\nand the public.        Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1043.                      To ensure the\n\nappropriateness of this balance, the trial court ordinarily must\n\nelucidate its reasons for approving such a continuance, United\n\nStates v. Doran, 882 F.2d 1511, 1515 (10th Cir. 1989); United\n\nStates v. Pringle, 751 F.2d 419, 432 (1st Cir. 1984), save for\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fcases in which those reasons are readily apparent from the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n            A trial court's discretion to authorize an \"ends of\n\njustice\"     continuance    is     relatively        circumscribed,     and\n\ncontinuances should not be granted cavalierly.               Mitchell, 723\n\nF.2d at 1044.      The STA sets out a non-exhaustive list of\n\nconsiderations that the court should bear in mind in deciding\n\nwhether to grant or deny a continuance on this basis.               See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B) (mentioning, inter alia, the demands of\n\njustice, the complexity of the case, and the timing of relevant\n\nantecedent    events).     At    the    close   of   the   day,    however,\n\nreasonableness serves as the touchstone of an \"ends of justice\"\n\nanalysis.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to the relevant facts.\n\nOn February 11, 1999, a magistrate judge excluded the period\n\nfrom that date to March 11 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8).\n\nThe   magistrate   judge   made    an     explicit   \"ends    of   justice\"\n\ndetermination designed, he said, to provide the defense with a\n\nreasonable period of time within which to determine whether to\n\nproceed under automatic discovery rules (and if so, a further\n\nperiod to accommodate compliance).           The magistrate judge also\n\nadvised the parties that they had ten days within which to file\n\nobjections to the order.        No one objected.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           The order (and, hence, the challenged exclusion of\n\ntime) is fully consistent with the policies underlying the STA.\n\nSee    Mitchell,    723        F.2d   at     1044     (explaining        that    Congress\n\n\"recognized that the time limit requirements of the [STA] must\n\nbe flexible enough to accommodate the practicalities of our\n\nadversary system\").            Moreover, it seems perfectly reasonable as\n\na case-management device.             Cf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 17\n\n(excluding the time reasonably required to schedule a new trial\n\ndate under the \"ends of justice\" rubric); United States v.\n\nEdwards,   627     F.2d    460,       461     (D.C.       Cir.   1980)    (per       curiam)\n\n(upholding   \"ends        of    justice\"          continuance     based    in        part   on\n\nscheduling   conflicts).                  After    all,    the   magistrate          judge's\n\nexplicit references to section 6(b)(8) of the district court's\n\nSpeedy Trial Plan and Local Rule 112.2(A)(2) make manifest that\n\nhe    intended   to   create          a    window     of    opportunity         to    permit\n\nautomatic discovery to take place and motions to be filed.\n\nSince the appellant neither objected to the magistrate judge's\n\norder at the time nor explained in her brief how the judge's\n\nseemingly innocuous effort to facilitate discovery plausibly can\n\nbe labeled an abuse of discretion, we approve the exclusion.\n\n           In a belated effort to turn the tables, the appellant\n\npoints out that she filed a notice on February 16, 1999, in\n\nwhich she waived automatic discovery pursuant to Local Rule\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\f116.1(B).      She asserts that once she made this election, the\n\ncourt should have amended its earlier order and truncated the\n\nperiod of excludable delay accordingly.            But the appellant did\n\nnot make a timely request to that effect in the district court.\n\nTrial judges are not expected to be mind readers, nor are they\n\nobliged to review case records sua sponte in order to determine\n\nwhether changed circumstances warrant the revision of orders\n\nentered at an earlier date.          The appellant, had she wished to\n\nexplore the feasibility of shortening the previously announced\n\nperiod of excludable delay, should have so moved.                Her failure\n\nto do so constituted a waiver of the claim that she now attempts\n\nto   advance.       See,   e.g.,   Santiago-Becerril,     130    F.3d   at   18\n\n(noting significance of lack of timely objection in evaluating\n\nreasonableness of exclusions of time under the STA);                    United\n\nStates   v.    Baskin-Bey,    45   F.3d   200,   203-04   (7th   Cir.    1995)\n\n(ruling that defendant's failure to object contemporaneously to\n\na period of excludable delay amounted to a waiver).\n\n              We hold, therefore, that the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in excluding the one-month period from\n\nFebruary 11 to March 11 to satisfy the ends of justice.\n\n\n\n\n               C.   Effect of the Superseding Indictment.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f            The appellant's final invocation of the STA implicates\n\nthe   advent    of    the     superseding     indictment.            The   grand      jury\n\nreturned that indictment on May 19, 1999 — the day before the\n\nappellant's speedy trial deadline.                     As we have said, the bill\n\nadded a new (albeit previously known) defendant but left the\n\narray of charges intact.               The district court restarted the\n\nspeedy trial clock at that point and overrode the appellant's\n\nensuing protest.\n\n            The issue raised by the appellant involves 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3161(h)(7), which permits a reasonable period of excludable\n\ndelay \"when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant\n\nas to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for\n\nseverance has been granted.\"               The Supreme Court has interpreted\n\nthis proviso to mean that when a joint trial is in prospect, the\n\nspeedy trial clock seeks the longest available span of time.\n\nHenderson      v.    United    States,      476       U.S.    321,   323   n.2   (1986)\n\n(providing, in general, that all defendants who are joined for\n\ntrial   fall        within    the   most    generous          speedy   trial     period\n\navailable to any one of them).                In other words, the time line\n\nfor the last defendant joined usually becomes the time line for\n\nall defendants.         Id.    The court below adhered to this rule.\n\n            The      appellant      resists       a    rote    application       of    the\n\nHenderson rule.          She notes that the Court has held that a\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fsuperseding indictment does not restart the speedy trial clock\n\nif it makes only minor changes to the charging document.               See\n\nUnited States v. Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 231, 237 (1985)\n\n(holding that correction of a date by way of a superseding\n\nindictment does not justify restarting the speedy trial clock).\n\nBuilding on this foundation, she then observes that this court,\n\nin   discussing   the   latter   tenet,   stated   that   a   superseding\n\nindictment which added two new defendants \"did not restart [the\n\noriginal defendant's] STA's [sic] clock because [the superseding\n\nindictment] was based on the original charges.\"                 Santiago-\n\nBecerril, 130 F.3d at 19.        The appellant posits that the quoted\n\nlanguage in Santiago-Becerril is controlling here.\n\n          We reject this postulate.        Read literally, the quoted\n\nwords   from   Santiago-Becerril     would   contradict       the   Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Henderson (and, thus, would not command our\n\nallegiance).    Equally as important, that statement forms no part\n\nof the holding in Santiago-Becerril.         Indeed, the court there\n\nconcluded that, even without resetting the speedy trial clock\n\nupon the return of the superseding indictment, no STA violation\n\nhad occurred.     130 F.3d at 23.      Hence, the language which the\n\nappellant embraces is classic dictum — it can be removed from\n\nthe opinion without either impairing the analytical foundations\n\nof the court's holding or altering the result reached — and we\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fdo not consider ourselves bound by it.          See, e.g., Dedham Water\n\nCo. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 459 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (\"Dictum constitutes neither the law of the case nor the\n\nstuff of binding precedent.\").        Thus, we disavow it in order to\n\navoid confusion over its proper scope.\n\n            Putting the disavowed Santiago-Becerril dictum to one\n\nside, Henderson is the beacon by which we must steer.               There,\n\nthe Court specifically interpreted section 3161(h)(7) to mean\n\nthat \"[a]ll defendants who are joined for trial generally fall\n\nwithin the speedy trial computation of the latest codefendant.\"\n\n476 U.S. at 323 n.2.       This case comes within the Henderson rule.\n\nResetting    the   clock    upon   the     return   of   the   superseding\n\nindictment synchronized the original defendant (Marla) with the\n\nnewly-joined defendant (Reynaldo) for purposes of the STA.            This\n\nsort of adjustment helps to ensure that the STA will not become\n\na vehicle for altering existing rules of joinder and severance\n\nby   compelling    the   government   to    prosecute    properly   joined\n\ndefendants piecemeal.       See United States v. Tobin, 840 F.2d 867,\n\n869 (11th Cir. 1988); see also United States v. Pena, 793 F.2d\n\n486, 489 (2d Cir. 1986) (explaining how resetting the STA clock\n\nafter the addition of a new defendant serves to husband judicial\n\nresources and avoid duplicative proceedings).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f          Nor    does     the     Rojas-Contreras       doctrine    demand    a\n\ndifferent result.       The superseding indictment here added a new\n\ndefendant, an important development that distinguishes this case\n\nfrom   those    in   which    a   grand     jury   employs   a     superseding\n\nindictment as a means of correcting a minor error in an extant\n\nindictment.     E.g., Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. at 236-37 (holding\n\nSTA clock not restarted upon return of a superseding indictment\n\nthat   merely   changed      an   incorrect    date);    United     States   v.\n\nReynolds, 781 F.2d 135-37 (8th Cir. 1986) (holding to like\n\neffect when superseding indictment simply recharacterized a\n\nwitness's role).        Given the substantial nature of the change\n\nconveyed by the superseding indictment in this case, it seems\n\nentirely appropriate to allow all parties extra time to prepare\n\nadequately for trial.           See, e.g., United States v. Spring, 80\n\nF.3d 1450, 1457 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\n          To sum up, Henderson controls.                Thus, the district\n\ncourt did not err in clearing the appellant's speedy trial clock\n\nupon the return of the superseding indictment.                     See United\n\nStates v. Baker, 40 F.3d 154, 159 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that\n\nthe STA clock begins to run anew on the date of the last\n\ncodefendant's arraignment); Pena, 793 F.2d at 489 (noting that\n\n\"cases involving multiple defendants are governed by a single\n\nspeedy trial clock, which begins to run with the clock of the\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fmost   recently   added   defendant\").        We    do,   however,    add   a\n\ncautionary note.    Although we find that the government complied\n\nwith the STA, we are concerned that the government stretched the\n\nclock so far:     after once violating the appellant's STA rights,\n\nthe government filed the superseding indictment only one day\n\nbefore the clock was to expire again, thereby laying claim to\n\nyet another seventy days.\n\n            We recognize that extenuating circumstances existed\n\nhere and that Reynaldo's vacillation about whether to plead\n\nguilty   likely   contributed   both     to   the    delay   and     to   the\n\nprosecution's last-minute decision to re-indict the siblings\n\ntogether.    Nevertheless, in other, less exigent circumstances,\n\nthe clock may not prove to be so elastic.             The Henderson rule\n\nanticipates exceptions, see 476 U.S. at 323 n.2 (noting that\n\ncodefendants \"generally\" fall within the latest defendant's\n\ncomputation), and we think it generally advisable, even absent\n\na violation of the STA, for a court faced with such a belated\n\njoinder to consider specifically how much time is \"reasonable\"\n\nfor trial preparation rather than automatically restarting the\n\nclock.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7) (excluding a \"reasonable\n\nperiod of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a\n\ncodefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run\"); id. §\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f3161(c)(2) (setting thirty days as the minimum trial preparation\n\ntime guaranteed a defendant).\n\nIII.       ALLEGED INSTRUCTIONAL ERRORS\n\n              The appellant's next assignment of error implicates the\n\ndistrict court's jury instructions on the law of conspiracy.\n\nShe    maintains    that     the   court    erred    in     its    definition       of\n\n\"agreement\" and, to make a bad situation worse, failed properly\n\nto instruct as to the object of the conspiracy.\n\n              We   turn    first    to    the     court's    definition       of     a\n\nconspiratorial       agreement      (reprinted      in    the     margin).2        The\n\nappellant       takes     issue    with    this     definition,       criticizing\n\nespecially the court's indication that \"shar[ing] a general\n\nunderstanding about the crime\" would be sufficient to show the\n\nrequisite agreement.\n\n\n\n       2The court stated in pertinent part:\n            Now, a conspiracy is an agreement, spoken or\n            unspoken. The conspiracy does not have to\n            be a formal agreement or plan in which\n            everyone involved sat down together and\n            worked out all of the details. It does not\n            even have to be a successful plan. But the\n            government must prove beyond a reasonable\n            doubt that those who were involved shared a\n            general understanding about the crime. Mere\n            similarity of conduct among various people,\n            or the fact that they may have associated\n            with each other or discussed common aims and\n            interests, does not necessarily establish\n            proof of existence of a conspiracy, but you\n            may consider such factors.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f          We dismiss this argument out of hand.        We review jury\n\ninstructions that involve an explanation of the law de novo.\n\nSee United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nReading the court's instructions as a whole, see United States\n\nv. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 1003 (1st Cir. 1987), they constitute\n\na fair statement of the applicable law.       No more is exigible.\n\nSee United States v.      Rivera-Alicia, 205 F.3d 480, 484 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 256 (2000); United States v.\n\nMcGill, 953 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          The appellant nonetheless contends that the challenged\n\ninstruction is less than she deserved because she specifically\n\nrequested that the court tell the jurors that a \"meeting of the\n\nminds\"   was   a   necessary   prerequisite   to   a   conspiratorial\n\nagreement.3    The fact that the appellant made such an entreaty\n\ndoes not change the equation, even if the requested charge was\n\nsubstantially correct.    There is no exact formula for converting\n\nlegal principles into lay language — and the choice of what\n\nwords are to be used belongs, within wide margins, to the trial\n\njudge.   It is apodictic that \"[t]he trial court's refusal to\n\ngive a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only\n\n\n    3The appellant asked the district court to charge the jury\nthat \"[a] meeting of the minds between or among the members of\nthe conspiracy is required\" to show an agreement, and that\n\"[t]here must be a meeting of the minds . . . to commit the\nunlawful act.\"\n\n                                 -19-\n\fif the requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter of\n\nsubstantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the\n\ncharge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in\n\nthe case.\"      McGill, 953 F.2d at 13.\n\n              In this case, the charge that the court gave covered\n\nsubstantially the same terrain as the proffered \"meeting of the\n\nminds\" language.        Although there were linguistic differences,\n\nthey were more matters of style than of substance.               We fail to\n\nsee how the court's definition of an agreement varied in a\n\nmaterial way from the definition espoused by the appellant.\n\nMindful that a party generally has no right to insist that the\n\ntrial court parrot particular language in its jury instructions,\n\nUnited States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1124 (1st Cir. 1989), we\n\nreject the appellant's assignment of error.\n\n              The appellant has yet another string to her bow.            She\n\nmaintains that the district court failed to instruct the jury\n\nthat the conspirators must reach agreement as to the object of\n\nthe conspiracy.        See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Rivera-Santiago,\n\n872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989).            This criticism reads the\n\ncourt's charge too narrowly.          The court told the jurors that, in\n\norder to convict, they \"must find that the defendants conspired\n\nwith   each    other    to   import   cocaine   into   the   United   States\"\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f(emphasis supplied).           We think that this reference, taken in\n\ncontext, sufficed both to describe the object of the conspiracy\n\nand to delineate the jury's obligation.\n\nIV.    ALLEGED SENTENCING ERRORS\n\n           The district court sentenced the appellant to a 168-\n\nmonth incarcerative term, to be followed by a five-year period\n\nof    supervised   release.        The    appellant       attacks      her    prison\n\nsentence on three grounds.\n\n           First, the appellant contends that the district court\n\nclearly erred in its drug-quantity finding (and, therefore, in\n\nits determination of the guideline sentencing range).                    We do not\n\nlinger    over   this    contention.        We     dispatched     an     identical\n\nargument in deciding the codefendant's appeal.                         See United\n\nStates v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 176-77.               The outcome here\n\nnecessarily is the same.         Accordingly, we reject the appellant's\n\ncomplaint about the district court's drug-quantity determination\n\nfor the reasons stated in our earlier opinion.                  See id.\n\n           The appellant's second argument suffers the same fate.\n\nShe asserts that the length of her sentence offends the rule\n\nestablished in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 2362-63\n\n(2000)    (holding      that   \"[o]ther     than    the    fact     of    a   prior\n\nconviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime\n\nbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\").                   This argument,\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\ftoo, was previously made and rejected.                 See United States v.\n\nReynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 177-78 (citing United States v.\n\nRobinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001)).                      Here, as in\n\nReynaldo's case, we discern no Apprendi error in respect to the\n\nprison sentence imposed.\n\n            Once      again,    we   need   not   tarry.     An   incarcerative\n\nsentence of no greater than twenty years for importing, or\n\nconspiring to import, any quantity of cocaine falls below the\n\ndefault statutory maximum for such an offense,4 and therefore\n\ndoes not violate Apprendi.            Id.   That is dispositive here.           \"No\n\nApprendi violation occurs when the district court sentences a\n\ndefendant below the default statutory maximum, even though drug\n\nquantity, determined by the court under a preponderance-of-the-\n\nevidence    standard,        influences     the    length    of   the    sentence\n\nimposed.\"    Robinson, 241 F.3d at 119.\n\n            As   to    the     five-year    supervised      release     term,   the\n\nappellant benefits from the fact that the penalty statute, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 960(b)(3), provides explicitly for a supervised release\n\nterm of three years for violations of the importation statute\n\ninvolving less than 500 grams of cocaine.                See United States v.\n\nReynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 177-78 (explaining this point).\n\n    4 As we explained in our earlier opinion, the default\nstatutory maximum applicable to violations of 21 U.S.C. § 963\n(the statute criminalizing importation or attempted importation\nof any detectable quantity of cocaine) is contained in 21 U.S.C.\n§ 960(b)(3). See United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at\n177.\n\n                                       -22-\n\fGiven this court's previous holding that supervised release\n\nterms set out in particular sections of the drug laws establish\n\nthe maximum terms for violations of those sections, see Suveges\n\nv. United States, 7 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (construing 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)), we think that here, as in the companion\n\nappeal, Apprendi requires that this aspect of the appellant's\n\nsentence   be    reduced    to    three    years,    see   United   States   v.\n\nReynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 178.5                  This reduction can, of\n\ncourse, be accomplished without either disturbing the remainder\n\nof the sentence or reconvening the disposition hearing.               See id.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.          After careful consideration of\n\nthe record, we conclude that the government did not violate the\n\nSpeedy   Trial     Act    and    that    the   lower   court   committed     no\n\nreversible error in charging the jury.              We therefore affirm the\n\nappellant's conviction.          We also affirm her sentence, except for\n\none particular.     To repair that defect, we instruct the district\n\ncourt,   on     remand,    to    reduce    the   supervised    release   term\n\npreviously imposed from five years to three years.\n\n\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n     Given the idiosyncratic facts, we treated this Apprendi\nerror as \"plain\" in Reynaldo's case, and we do the same here.\n\n                                        -23-\n\f",

See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 963, 843(b). The district court imposed a 168-month incarcerative sentence, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. The appellant now challenges her conviction on various grounds. Finding her arguments unpersuasive, we affirm the conviction. The appellant also advances three assignments of error that touch upon her sentence. We reject two of these, but accept the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal arises out of a joint trial at which both the appellant and her brother, Reynaldo, were convicted.

The customer, in reality an undercover agent employed by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), accepted the invitation. He thereafter met with the Barnes siblings, and Marla Barnes made preliminary arrangements (or so she said) for a large purchase of cocaine through her connections in Panama.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial step in the process, Marla Barnes sold a one kilogram sample of cocaine to the undercover agent. . . . For a variety of reasons, the larger deal never materialized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury initially indicted both Barnes siblings in what we sometimes shall call \"Indictment No. 1.\" The charges were severed, however, after Reynaldo indicated an intention to plead guilty. Following Marla Barnes's separate trial on Indictment No. 1, she was convicted of conspiracy to import cocaine. On appeal, this court vacated the judgment and ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice as to Marla Barnes on the ground that the prosecution had dallied impermissibly in bringing her to trial. United States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 15-18 (1st Cir. 1998) (Barnes I).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury promptly reindicted the appellant, charging her, in what we sometimes shall call \"Indictment No. 2,\" not only with conspiracy to import cocaine but also with two instances of unlawful use of a communications facility in the course of drug-trafficking activities. At that time, Indictment No. 1 was still pending against Reynaldo Barnes, who had moved to withdraw his guilty plea. On March 19, 1999, the district court (Tauro, J.) allowed the motion to withdraw. The government then moved to dismiss Indictment No. 1 without prejudice and Reynaldo moved to dismiss that indictment with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These motions were pending on May 19, 1999, when the grand jury -- one day before the appellant's speedy trial deadline -- superseded Indictment No. 2. The superseding indictment added Reynaldo Barnes as a defendant in this case, charging him with having committed the same offenses that it previously had charged Marla Barnes with committing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Several things then occurred. We mention two. On June 23, 1999, Judge Tauro denied Reynaldo Barnes's motion to dismiss Indictment No. 1 with prejudice and granted the government's cross-motion for dismissal without prejudice. The superseded version of Indictment No. 2 remained zoetic, with both Barnes siblings as defendants. On October 4, 1999, Judge Gorton denied the appellant's motion to dismiss that indictment under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161 (the STA). The case eventually went to trial and the jury convicted both defendants -- Reynaldo on all three counts and Marla on the conspiracy count and one of the two \"communications facility\" counts (acquitting her on the remaining count). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant advances three principal arguments. First, she classifies the government as a repeat offender, contending that it again violated her rights under the STA. Second, she claims to have detected reversible error in the district court's jury instructions. Third, she lodges a multifaceted claim of sentencing error. We address these asseverations sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ALLEGED SPEEDY TRIAL ACT VIOLATIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In invoking the prophylaxis of the STA, the appellant makes three interrelated arguments. The lower court rejected all of them, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Commencement of the STA Time Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, the speedy trial clock begins to run on the later of (a) the filing date of the indictment or information, or (b) the defendant's first appearance before a judicial officer. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1). In the event of a retrial, however, the STA adds a special twist. It stipulates that, in such an event, \"the trial shall commence within seventy days from the date the action occasioning the trial becomes final.\" Id. &#167; 3161(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that this latter provision governs her case, and that, therefore, the relevant date for restarting the speedy trial clock was January 12, 1999 (the date when our mandate issued in Barnes I). Because the second trial did not commence within seventy non-excluded days of that date, the appellant moved to dismiss the new indictment. The district court refused to attach decretory significance to the January 12 date and, accordingly, denied the motion. Affording de novo review, see United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 600 (1st Cir. 1996), we uphold the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that this court's mandate qualifies as \"the action occasioning the trial\" and thus governs the speedy trial computation, the appellant relies almost exclusively on our decision in United States v. Joost, 133 F.3d 125 (1st Cir. 1998). To be sure, we held there that the date of mandate constituted the starting point for a renewed speedy trial calculation. Id. at 130. But the circumstances were materially different. In Joost, we had overturned the defendant's conviction based on parlous jury instructions, leaving the indictment intact and setting the stage for a retrial on the same indictment. Id. at 127.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is cut from markedly different cloth. Our decision in Barnes I resulted in dismissal of the then-pending indictment, thereby precluding a further trial unless the government obtained a new indictment. See United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326, 342 (1988) (explaining that dismissal without prejudice under the STA forces the government to obtain a new indictment if it chooses to reprosecute); United States v. Brown, 770 F.2d 241, 243 (1st Cir. 1985) (similar). Thus, in contrast to Joost, this case does not involve a retrial on the same indictment, but, rather, a first trial on a new indictment. For this reason, the issuance of mandate in connection with the original appeal cannot be viewed as \"the action occasioning the trial,\" and section 3161(c)(1), not section 3161(d)(2), controls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. The grand jury handed up Indictment No. 2 on November 19, 1998. The appellant's initial appearance before the court with respect to that indictment took place on February 11, 1999. The latter date, rather than the date of mandate in Barnes I, marks the occasion for restarting the speedy trial clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Excludable Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the clock begins to tick, the STA contemplates several situations in which delays may occur without compromising the seventy-day limit. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)-(9). The appellant challenges the district court's exclusion of certain time, claiming that the court erred in granting a continuance and a concomitant period of excludable delay, based on the \"ends of justice.\" Id. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A). We review the district court's \"ends of justice\" determination for abuse of discretion. United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1044 (1st Cir. 1983). We discern none in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rudiments are clear. When a judge bases a continuance on an explicit finding that the ends of justice outweigh the collective interest in a speedy trial, the resulting period of delay may be excluded under section 3161(h)(8) of the STA. United States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1997). Gaining such an exclusion involves a balancing of the interests of the prosecution, the defendant, and the public. Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1043. To ensure the appropriateness of this balance, the trial court ordinarily must elucidate its reasons for approving such a continuance, United States v. Doran, 882 F.2d 1511, 1515 (10th Cir. 1989); United States v. Pringle, 751 F.2d 419, 432 (1st Cir. 1984), save for cases in which those reasons are readily apparent from the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court's discretion to authorize an \"ends of justice\" continuance is relatively circumscribed, and continuances should not be granted cavalierly. Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1044. The STA sets out a non-exhaustive list of considerations that the court should bear in mind in deciding whether to grant or deny a continuance on this basis. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(B) (mentioning, inter alia, the demands of justice, the complexity of the case, and the timing of relevant antecedent events). At the close of the day, however, reasonableness serves as the touchstone of an \"ends of justice\" analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the relevant facts. On February 11, 1999, a magistrate judge excluded the period from that date to March 11 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8). The magistrate judge made an explicit \"ends of justice\" determination designed, he said, to provide the defense with a reasonable period of time within which to determine whether to proceed under automatic discovery rules (and if so, a further period to accommodate compliance). The magistrate judge also advised the parties that they had ten days within which to file objections to the order. No one objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order (and, hence, the challenged exclusion of time) is fully consistent with the policies underlying the STA. See Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1044 (explaining that Congress \"recognized that the time limit requirements of the [STA] must be flexible enough to accommodate the practicalities of our adversary system\"). Moreover, it seems perfectly reasonable as a case-management device. Cf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 17 (excluding the time reasonably required to schedule a new trial date under the \"ends of justice\" rubric); United States v. Edwards, 627 F.2d 460, 461(D.C. Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (upholding \"ends of justice\" continuance based in part on scheduling conflicts). After all, the magistrate judge's explicit references to section 6(b)(8) of the district court's Speedy Trial Plan and Local Rule 112.2(A)(2) make manifest that he intended to create a window of opportunity to permit automatic discovery to take place and motions to be filed. Since the appellant neither objected to the magistrate judge's order at the time nor explained in her brief how the judge's seemingly innocuous effort to facilitate discovery plausibly can be labeled an abuse of discretion, we approve the exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a belated effort to turn the tables, the appellant points out that she filed a notice on February 16, 1999, in which she waived automatic discovery pursuant to Local Rule 116.1(B). She asserts that once she made this election, the court should have amended its earlier order and truncated the period of excludable delay accordingly. But the appellant did not make a timely request to that effect in the district court. Trial judges are not expected to be mind readers, nor are they obliged to review case records sua sponte in order to determine whether changed circumstances warrant the revision of orders entered at an earlier date. The appellant, had she wished to explore the feasibility of shortening the previously announced period of excludable delay, should have so moved. Her failure to do so constituted a waiver of the claim that she now attempts to advance. See, e.g., Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 18 (noting significance of lack of timely objection in evaluating reasonableness of exclusions of time under the STA); United States v. Baskin-Bey, 45 F.3d 200, 203-04 (7th Cir. 1995) (ruling that defendant's failure to object contemporaneously to a period of excludable delay amounted to a waiver).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the one-month period from February 11 to March 11 to satisfy the ends of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Effect of the Superseding Indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final invocation of the STA implicates the advent of the superseding indictment. The grand jury returned that indictment on May 19, 1999 -- the day before the appellant's speedy trial deadline. As we have said, the bill added a new (albeit previously known) defendant but left the array of charges intact. The district court restarted the speedy trial clock at that point and overrode the appellant's ensuing protest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue raised by the appellant involves 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(7), which permits a reasonable period of excludable delay \"when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.\" The Supreme Court has interpreted this proviso to mean that when a joint trial is in prospect, the speedy trial clock seeks the longest available span of time. Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 323 n.2 (1986) (providing, in general, that all defendants who are joined for trial fall within the most generous speedy trial period available to any one of them). In other words, the time line for the last defendant joined usually becomes the time line for all defendants. Id. The court below adhered to this rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant resists a rote application of the Henderson rule. She notes that the Court has held that a superseding indictment does not restart the speedy trial clock if it makes only minor changes to the charging document. See United States v. Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 231, 237(1985) (holding that correction of a date by way of a superseding indictment does not justify restarting the speedy trial clock). Building on this foundation, she then observes that this court, in discussing the latter tenet, stated that a superseding indictment which added two new defendants \"did not restart [the original defendant's] STA's [sic] clock because [the superseding indictment] was based on the original charges.\" Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 19. The appellant posits that the quoted language in Santiago-Becerril is controlling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this postulate. Read literally, the quoted words from Santiago-Becerril would contradict the Supreme Court's decision in Henderson (and, thus, would not command our allegiance). Equally as important, that statement forms no part of the holding in Santiago-Becerril. Indeed, the court there concluded that, even without resetting the speedy trial clock upon the return of the superseding indictment, no STA violation had occurred. 130 F.3d at 23. Hence, the language which the appellant embraces is classic dictum -- it can be removed from the opinion without either impairing the analytical foundations of the court's holding or altering the result reached -- and we do not consider ourselves bound by it. See, e.g., Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 459 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Dictum constitutes neither the law of the case nor the stuff of binding precedent.\"). Thus, we disavow it in order to avoid confusion over its proper scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting the disavowed Santiago-Becerril dictum to one side, Henderson is the beacon by which we must steer. There, the Court specifically interpreted section 3161(h)(7) to mean that \"[a]ll defendants who are joined for trial generally fall within the speedy trial computation of the latest codefendant.\" 476 U.S. at 323 n.2. This case comes within the Henderson rule. Resetting the clock upon the return of the superseding indictment synchronized the original defendant (Marla) with the newly-joined defendant (Reynaldo) for purposes of the STA. This sort of adjustment helps to ensure that the STA will not become a vehicle for altering existing rules of joinder and severance by compelling the government to prosecute properly joined defendants piecemeal. See United States v. Tobin, 840 F.2d 867, 869 (11th Cir. 1988); see also United States v. Pena, 793 F.2d 486, 489 (2d Cir. 1986) (explaining how resetting the STA clock after the addition of a new defendant serves to husband judicial resources and avoid duplicative proceedings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Rojas-Contreras doctrine demand a different result. The superseding indictment here added a new defendant, an important development that distinguishes this case from those in which a grand jury employs a superseding indictment as a means of correcting a minor error in an extant indictment. E.g., Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. at 236-37 (holding STA clock not restarted upon return of a superseding indictment that merely changed an incorrect date); United States v. Reynolds, 781 F.2d 135-37 (8th Cir. 1986) (holding to like effect when superseding indictment simply recharacterized a witness's role). Given the substantial nature of the change conveyed by the superseding indictment in this case, it seems entirely appropriate to allow all parties extra time to prepare adequately for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Spring, 80 F.3d 1450, 1457 (10th Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, Henderson controls. Thus, the district court did not err in clearing the appellant's speedy trial clock upon the return of the superseding indictment. See United States v. Baker, 40 F.3d 154, 159 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that the STA clock begins to run anew on the date of the last codefendant's arraignment); Pena, 793 F.2d at 489 (noting that \"cases involving multiple defendants are governed by a single speedy trial clock, which begins to run with the clock of the most recently added defendant\"). We do, however, add a cautionary note. Although we find that the government complied with the STA, we are concerned that the government stretched the clock so far: after once violating the appellant's STA rights, the government filed the superseding indictment only one day before the clock was to expire again, thereby laying claim to yet another seventy days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that extenuating circumstances existed here and that Reynaldo's vacillation about whether to plead guilty likely contributed both to the delay and to the prosecution's last-minute decision to re-indict the siblings together. Nevertheless, in other, less exigent circumstances, the clock may not prove to be so elastic. The Henderson rule anticipates exceptions, see 476 U.S. at 323 n.2 (noting that codefendants \"generally\" fall within the latest defendant's computation), and we think it generally advisable, even absent a violation of the STA, for a court faced with such a belated joinder to consider specifically how much time is \"reasonable\" for trial preparation rather than automatically restarting the clock. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(7) (excluding a \"reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run\"); id. &#167; 3161(c)(2) (setting thirty days as the minimum trial preparation time guaranteed a defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ALLEGED INSTRUCTIONAL ERRORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's next assignment of error implicates the district court's jury instructions on the law of conspiracy. She maintains that the court erred in its definition of \"agreement\" and, to make a bad situation worse, failed properly to instruct as to the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the court's definition of a conspiratorial agreement (reprinted in the margin).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The appellant takes issue with this definition, criticizing especially the court's indication that \"shar[ing] a general understanding about the crime\" would be sufficient to show the requisite agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We dismiss this argument out of hand. We review jury instructions that involve an explanation of the law de novo. See United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997). Reading the court's instructions as a whole, see United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 1003 (1st Cir. 1987), they constitute a fair statement of the applicable law. No more is exigible. See United States v. Rivera-Alicia, 205 F.3d 480, 484 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 256 (2000); United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant nonetheless contends that the challenged instruction is less than she deserved because she specifically requested that the court tell the jurors that a \"meeting of the minds\" was a necessary prerequisite to a conspiratorial agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The fact that the appellant made such an entreaty does not change the equation, even if the requested charge was substantially correct. There is no exact formula for converting legal principles into lay language -- and the choice of what words are to be used belongs, within wide margins, to the trial judge. It is apodictic that \"[t]he trial court's refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.\" McGill, 953 F.2d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the charge that the court gave covered substantially the same terrain as the proffered \"meeting of the minds\" language. Although there were linguistic differences, they were more matters of style than of substance. We fail to see how the court's definition of an agreement varied in a material way from the definition espoused by the appellant. Mindful that a party generally has no right to insist that the trial court parrot particular language in its jury instructions, United States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1124 (1st Cir. 1989), we reject the appellant's assignment of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has yet another string to her bow. She maintains that the district court failed to instruct the jury that the conspirators must reach agreement as to the object of the conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989). This criticism reads the court's charge too narrowly. The court told the jurors that, in order to convict, they \"must find that the defendants conspired with each other to import cocaine into the United States\" (emphasis supplied). We think that this reference, taken in context, sufficed both to describe the object of the conspiracy and to delineate the jury's obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. ALLEGED SENTENCING ERRORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced the appellant to a 168-month incarcerative term, to be followed by a five-year period of supervised release. The appellant attacks her prison sentence on three grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellant contends that the district court clearly erred in its drug-quantity finding (and, therefore, in its determination of the guideline sentencing range). We do not linger over this contention. We dispatched an identical argument in deciding the codefendant's appeal. See United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 176-77. The outcome here necessarily is the same. Accordingly, we reject the appellant's complaint about the district court's drug-quantity determination for the reasons stated in our earlier opinion. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second argument suffers the same fate. She asserts that the length of her sentence offends the rule established in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 2362-63 (2000) (holding that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\"). This argument, too, was previously made and rejected. See United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 177-78 (citing United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001)). Here, as in Reynaldo's case, we discern no Apprendi error in respect to the prison sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, we need not tarry. An incarcerative sentence of no greater than twenty years for importing, or conspiring to import, any quantity of cocaine falls below the default statutory maximum for such an offense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and therefore does not violate Apprendi. Id. That is dispositive here. \"No Apprendi violation occurs when the district court sentences a defendant below the default statutory maximum, even though drug quantity, determined by the court under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, influences the length of the sentence imposed.\" Robinson, 241 F.3d at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the five-year supervised release term, the appellant benefits from the fact that the penalty statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(3), provides explicitly for a supervised release term of three years for violations of the importation statute involving less than 500 grams of cocaine. See United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 177-78 (explaining this point). Given this court's previous holding that supervised release terms set out in particular sections of the drug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those sections, see Suveges v. United States, 7 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (construing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)), we think that here, as in the companion appeal, Apprendi requires that this aspect of the appellant's sentence be reduced to three years, see United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 178.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This reduction can, of course, be accomplished without either disturbing the remainder of the sentence or reconvening the disposition hearing.

After careful consideration of the record, we conclude that the government did not violate the Speedy Trial Act and that the lower court committed no reversible error in charging the jury. We therefore affirm the appellant's conviction. We also affirm her sentence, except for one particular. To repair that defect, we instruct the district court, on remand, to reduce the supervised release term previously imposed from five years to three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The first and second indictments did not replicate one another.

See 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 963, 843(b). The district court imposed a 168-month incarcerative sentence, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. The appellant now challenges her conviction on various grounds. Finding her arguments unpersuasive, we affirm the conviction. The appellant also advances three assignments of error that touch upon her sentence. We reject two of these, but accept the third.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal arises out of a joint trial at which both the appellant and her brother, Reynaldo, were convicted. Although we consolidated their ensuing appeals for briefing and oral argument, we opted to dispose of the appeals separately. This is the second of the two opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the facts on which the convictions rest are not central to the issues raised on this appeal, we begin by rehearsing what we previously wrote in connection with Reynaldo's appeal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he jury supportably could have found that [Reynaldo Barnes], in an effort to expand his ongoing trade in illegal narcotics, told one of his quondam customers that his sister, Marla Barnes, could provide the sizable quantities of cocaine that the customer professed to require. The customer, in reality an undercover agent employed by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), accepted the invitation. He thereafter met with the Barnes siblings, and Marla Barnes made preliminary arrangements (or so she said) for a large purchase of cocaine through her connections in Panama.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial step in the process, Marla Barnes sold a one kilogram sample of cocaine to the undercover agent. . . . For a variety of reasons, the larger deal never materialized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199335\"><a href=\"/opinion/199335/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 175 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury initially indicted both Barnes siblings in what we sometimes shall call \"Indictment No. 1.\" The charges were severed, however, after Reynaldo indicated an intention to plead guilty. Following Marla Barnes's separate trial on Indictment No. 1, she was convicted of conspiracy to import cocaine. On appeal, this court vacated the judgment and ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice as to Marla Barnes on the ground that the prosecution had dallied impermissibly in bringing her to trial. United States v. Barnes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198181\"><a href=\"/opinion/198181/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 15-18 (1st Cir. 1998) (Barnes I).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury promptly reindicted the appellant, charging her, in what we sometimes shall call \"Indictment No. 2,\" not only with conspiracy to import cocaine but also with two instances of unlawful use of a communications facility in the course of drug-trafficking activities. At that time, Indictment No. 1 was still pending against Reynaldo Barnes, who had moved to withdraw his guilty plea. On March 19, 1999, the district court (Tauro, J.) allowed the motion to withdraw. The government then moved to dismiss Indictment No. 1 without prejudice and Reynaldo moved to dismiss that indictment with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These motions were pending on May 19, 1999, when the grand jury -- one day before the appellant's speedy trial deadline -- superseded Indictment No. 2. The superseding indictment added Reynaldo Barnes as a defendant in this case, charging him with having committed the same offenses that it previously had charged Marla Barnes with committing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Several things then occurred. We mention two. On June 23, 1999, Judge Tauro denied Reynaldo Barnes's motion to dismiss Indictment No. 1 with prejudice and granted the government's cross-motion for dismissal without prejudice. The superseded version of Indictment No. 2 remained zoetic, with both Barnes siblings as defendants. On October 4, 1999, Judge Gorton denied the appellant's motion to dismiss that indictment under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161 (the STA). The case eventually went to trial and the jury convicted both defendants -- Reynaldo on all three counts and Marla on the conspiracy count and one of the two \"communications facility\" counts (acquitting her on the remaining count). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant advances three principal arguments. First, she classifies the government as a repeat offender, contending that it again violated her rights under the STA. Second, she claims to have detected reversible error in the district court's jury instructions. Third, she lodges a multifaceted claim of sentencing error. We address these asseverations sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ALLEGED SPEEDY TRIAL ACT VIOLATIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In invoking the prophylaxis of the STA, the appellant makes three interrelated arguments. The lower court rejected all of them, and so do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Commencement of the STA Time Line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, the speedy trial clock begins to run on the later of (a) the filing date of the indictment or information, or (b) the defendant's first appearance before a judicial officer. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1). In the event of a retrial, however, the STA adds a special twist. It stipulates that, in such an event, \"the trial shall commence within seventy days from the date the action occasioning the trial becomes final.\" Id. &#167; 3161(d)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that this latter provision governs her case, and that, therefore, the relevant date for restarting the speedy trial clock was January 12, 1999 (the date when our mandate issued in Barnes I). Because the second trial did not commence within seventy non-excluded days of that date, the appellant moved to dismiss the new indictment. The district court refused to attach decretory significance to the January 12 date and, accordingly, denied the motion. Affording de novo review, see United States v. Staula, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196665\"><a href=\"/opinion/196665/united-states-v-staula/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 600 (1st Cir. 1996), we uphold the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that this court's mandate qualifies as \"the action occasioning the trial\" and thus governs the speedy trial computation, the appellant relies almost exclusively on our decision in United States v. Joost, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750075\"><a href=\"/opinion/750075/united-states-v-robert-m-joost/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1998). To be sure, we held there that the date of mandate constituted the starting point for a renewed speedy trial calculation. Id. at 130. But the circumstances were materially different. In Joost, we had overturned the defendant's conviction based on parlous jury instructions, leaving the indictment intact and setting the stage for a retrial on the same indictment. Id. at 127.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is cut from markedly different cloth. Our decision in Barnes I resulted in dismissal of the then-pending indictment, thereby precluding a further trial unless the government obtained a new indictment. See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112129\"><a href=\"/opinion/112129/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span>, 342 (1988) (explaining that dismissal without prejudice under the STA forces the government to obtain a new indictment if it chooses to reprosecute); United States v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457047\"><a href=\"/opinion/457047/united-states-v-charles-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 243 (1st Cir. 1985) (similar). Thus, in contrast to Joost, this case does not involve a retrial on the same indictment, but, rather, a first trial on a new indictment. For this reason, the issuance of mandate in connection with the original appeal cannot be viewed as \"the action occasioning the trial,\" and section 3161(c)(1), not section 3161(d)(2), controls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. The grand jury handed up Indictment No. 2 on November 19, 1998. The appellant's initial appearance before the court with respect to that indictment took place on February 11, 1999. The latter date, rather than the date of mandate in Barnes I, marks the occasion for restarting the speedy trial clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Excludable Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the clock begins to tick, the STA contemplates several situations in which delays may occur without compromising the seventy-day limit. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)-(9). The appellant challenges the district court's exclusion of certain time, claiming that the court erred in granting a continuance and a concomitant period of excludable delay, based on the \"ends of justice.\" Id. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A). We review the district court's \"ends of justice\" determination for abuse of discretion. United States v. Mitchell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429195\"><a href=\"/opinion/429195/united-states-v-mark-a-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1044 (1st Cir. 1983). We discern none in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rudiments are clear. When a judge bases a continuance on an explicit finding that the ends of justice outweigh the collective interest in a speedy trial, the resulting period of delay may be excluded under section 3161(h)(8) of the STA. United States v. Santiago-Becerril, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197654\"><a href=\"/opinion/197654/united-states-v-santiago-becerril/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1997). Gaining such an exclusion involves a balancing of the interests of the prosecution, the defendant, and the public. Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1043. To ensure the appropriateness of this balance, the trial court ordinarily must elucidate its reasons for approving such a continuance, United States v. Doran, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1511</span></span>, 1515 (10th Cir. 1989); United States v. Pringle, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></span>, 432 (1st Cir. 1984), save for cases in which those reasons are readily apparent from the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court's discretion to authorize an \"ends of justice\" continuance is relatively circumscribed, and continuances should not be granted cavalierly. Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1044. The STA sets out a non-exhaustive list of considerations that the court should bear in mind in deciding whether to grant or deny a continuance on this basis. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(B) (mentioning, inter alia, the demands of justice, the complexity of the case, and the timing of relevant antecedent events). At the close of the day, however, reasonableness serves as the touchstone of an \"ends of justice\" analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the relevant facts. On February 11, 1999, a magistrate judge excluded the period from that date to March 11 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8). The magistrate judge made an explicit \"ends of justice\" determination designed, he said, to provide the defense with a reasonable period of time within which to determine whether to proceed under automatic discovery rules (and if so, a further period to accommodate compliance). The magistrate judge also advised the parties that they had ten days within which to file objections to the order. No one objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order (and, hence, the challenged exclusion of time) is fully consistent with the policies underlying the STA. See Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1044 (explaining that Congress \"recognized that the time limit requirements of the [STA] must be flexible enough to accommodate the practicalities of our adversary system\"). Moreover, it seems perfectly reasonable as a case-management device. Cf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 17 (excluding the time reasonably required to schedule a new trial date under the \"ends of justice\" rubric); United States v. Edwards, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380933\"><a href=\"/opinion/380933/united-states-v-vernon-edwards-united-states-of-america-v-robert-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span>, 461(D.C. Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (upholding \"ends of justice\" continuance based in part on scheduling conflicts). After all, the magistrate judge's explicit references to section 6(b)(8) of the district court's Speedy Trial Plan and Local Rule 112.2(A)(2) make manifest that he intended to create a window of opportunity to permit automatic discovery to take place and motions to be filed. Since the appellant neither objected to the magistrate judge's order at the time nor explained in her brief how the judge's seemingly innocuous effort to facilitate discovery plausibly can be labeled an abuse of discretion, we approve the exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a belated effort to turn the tables, the appellant points out that she filed a notice on February 16, 1999, in which she waived automatic discovery pursuant to Local Rule 116.1(B). She asserts that once she made this election, the court should have amended its earlier order and truncated the period of excludable delay accordingly. But the appellant did not make a timely request to that effect in the district court. Trial judges are not expected to be mind readers, nor are they obliged to review case records sua sponte in order to determine whether changed circumstances warrant the revision of orders entered at an earlier date. The appellant, had she wished to explore the feasibility of shortening the previously announced period of excludable delay, should have so moved. Her failure to do so constituted a waiver of the claim that she now attempts to advance. See, e.g., Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 18 (noting significance of lack of timely objection in evaluating reasonableness of exclusions of time under the STA); United States v. Baskin-Bey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686799\"><a href=\"/opinion/686799/united-states-v-mozella-baskin-bey-and-doris-groth/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 203-04 (7th Cir. 1995) (ruling that defendant's failure to object contemporaneously to a period of excludable delay amounted to a waiver).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the one-month period from February 11 to March 11 to satisfy the ends of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Effect of the Superseding Indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final invocation of the STA implicates the advent of the superseding indictment. The grand jury returned that indictment on May 19, 1999 -- the day before the appellant's speedy trial deadline. As we have said, the bill added a new (albeit previously known) defendant but left the array of charges intact. The district court restarted the speedy trial clock at that point and overrode the appellant's ensuing protest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue raised by the appellant involves 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(7), which permits a reasonable period of excludable delay \"when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.\" The Supreme Court has interpreted this proviso to mean that when a joint trial is in prospect, the speedy trial clock seeks the longest available span of time. Henderson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 323 n.2 (1986) (providing, in general, that all defendants who are joined for trial fall within the most generous speedy trial period available to any one of them). In other words, the time line for the last defendant joined usually becomes the time line for all defendants. Id. The court below adhered to this rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant resists a rote application of the Henderson rule. She notes that the Court has held that a superseding indictment does not restart the speedy trial clock if it makes only minor changes to the charging document. See United States v. Rojas-Contreras, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111550\"><a href=\"/opinion/111550/united-states-v-rojas-contreras/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 237(1985) (holding that correction of a date by way of a superseding indictment does not justify restarting the speedy trial clock). Building on this foundation, she then observes that this court, in discussing the latter tenet, stated that a superseding indictment which added two new defendants \"did not restart [the original defendant's] STA's [sic] clock because [the superseding indictment] was based on the original charges.\" Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 19. The appellant posits that the quoted language in Santiago-Becerril is controlling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this postulate. Read literally, the quoted words from Santiago-Becerril would contradict the Supreme Court's decision in Henderson (and, thus, would not command our allegiance). Equally as important, that statement forms no part of the holding in Santiago-Becerril. Indeed, the court there concluded that, even without resetting the speedy trial clock upon the return of the superseding indictment, no STA violation had occurred. 130 F.3d at 23. Hence, the language which the appellant embraces is classic dictum -- it can be removed from the opinion without either impairing the analytical foundations of the court's holding or altering the result reached -- and we do not consider ourselves bound by it. See, e.g., Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588805\"><a href=\"/opinion/588805/dedham-water-co-inc-v-cumberland-farms-dairy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 459 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"Dictum constitutes neither the law of the case nor the stuff of binding precedent.\"). Thus, we disavow it in order to avoid confusion over its proper scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting the disavowed Santiago-Becerril dictum to one side, Henderson is the beacon by which we must steer. There, the Court specifically interpreted section 3161(h)(7) to mean that \"[a]ll defendants who are joined for trial generally fall within the speedy trial computation of the latest codefendant.\" 476 U.S. at 323 n.2. This case comes within the Henderson rule. Resetting the clock upon the return of the superseding indictment synchronized the original defendant (Marla) with the newly-joined defendant (Reynaldo) for purposes of the STA. This sort of adjustment helps to ensure that the STA will not become a vehicle for altering existing rules of joinder and severance by compelling the government to prosecute properly joined defendants piecemeal. See United States v. Tobin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502383\"><a href=\"/opinion/502383/united-states-v-william-tobin/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 869 (11th Cir. 1988); see also United States v. Pena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471772\"><a href=\"/opinion/471772/united-states-v-alberto-pena-juan-urena/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span>, 489 (2d Cir. 1986) (explaining how resetting the STA clock after the addition of a new defendant serves to husband judicial resources and avoid duplicative proceedings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Rojas-Contreras doctrine demand a different result. The superseding indictment here added a new defendant, an important development that distinguishes this case from those in which a grand jury employs a superseding indictment as a means of correcting a minor error in an extant indictment. E.g., Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. at 236-37 (holding STA clock not restarted upon return of a superseding indictment that merely changed an incorrect date); United States v. Reynolds, 781 F.2d 135-37 (8th Cir. 1986) (holding to like effect when superseding indictment simply recharacterized a witness's role). Given the substantial nature of the change conveyed by the superseding indictment in this case, it seems entirely appropriate to allow all parties extra time to prepare adequately for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Spring, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715844\"><a href=\"/opinion/715844/united-states-v-bruce-derek-spring-aka-bruce-derek-walls/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span>, 1457 (10th Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, Henderson controls. Thus, the district court did not err in clearing the appellant's speedy trial clock upon the return of the superseding indictment. See United States v. Baker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682467\"><a href=\"/opinion/682467/united-states-v-michael-d-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 159 (7th Cir. 1994) (noting that the STA clock begins to run anew on the date of the last codefendant's arraignment); Pena, 793 F.2d at 489 (noting that \"cases involving multiple defendants are governed by a single speedy trial clock, which begins to run with the clock of the most recently added defendant\"). We do, however, add a cautionary note. Although we find that the government complied with the STA, we are concerned that the government stretched the clock so far: after once violating the appellant's STA rights, the government filed the superseding indictment only one day before the clock was to expire again, thereby laying claim to yet another seventy days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that extenuating circumstances existed here and that Reynaldo's vacillation about whether to plead guilty likely contributed both to the delay and to the prosecution's last-minute decision to re-indict the siblings together. Nevertheless, in other, less exigent circumstances, the clock may not prove to be so elastic. The Henderson rule anticipates exceptions, see 476 U.S. at 323 n.2 (noting that codefendants \"generally\" fall within the latest defendant's computation), and we think it generally advisable, even absent a violation of the STA, for a court faced with such a belated joinder to consider specifically how much time is \"reasonable\" for trial preparation rather than automatically restarting the clock. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(7) (excluding a \"reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run\"); id. &#167; 3161(c)(2) (setting thirty days as the minimum trial preparation time guaranteed a defendant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ALLEGED INSTRUCTIONAL ERRORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's next assignment of error implicates the district court's jury instructions on the law of conspiracy. She maintains that the court erred in its definition of \"agreement\" and, to make a bad situation worse, failed properly to instruct as to the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the court's definition of a conspiratorial agreement (reprinted in the margin).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The appellant takes issue with this definition, criticizing especially the court's indication that \"shar[ing] a general understanding about the crime\" would be sufficient to show the requisite agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We dismiss this argument out of hand. We review jury instructions that involve an explanation of the law de novo. See United States v. Pitrone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197373\"><a href=\"/opinion/197373/united-states-v-pitrone/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1997). Reading the court's instructions as a whole, see United States v. Cintolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488517\"><a href=\"/opinion/488517/united-states-v-william-j-cintolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 1003 (1st Cir. 1987), they constitute a fair statement of the applicable law. No more is exigible. See United States v. Rivera-Alicia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 484 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></span> (2000); United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575209\"><a href=\"/opinion/575209/united-states-v-robert-l-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant nonetheless contends that the challenged instruction is less than she deserved because she specifically requested that the court tell the jurors that a \"meeting of the minds\" was a necessary prerequisite to a conspiratorial agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The fact that the appellant made such an entreaty does not change the equation, even if the requested charge was substantially correct. There is no exact formula for converting legal principles into lay language -- and the choice of what words are to be used belongs, within wide margins, to the trial judge. It is apodictic that \"[t]he trial court's refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.\" McGill, 953 F.2d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the charge that the court gave covered substantially the same terrain as the proffered \"meeting of the minds\" language. Although there were linguistic differences, they were more matters of style than of substance. We fail to see how the court's definition of an agreement varied in a material way from the definition espoused by the appellant. Mindful that a party generally has no right to insist that the trial court parrot particular language in its jury instructions, United States v. Nivica, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531008\"><a href=\"/opinion/531008/united-states-v-gjon-n-nivica-united-states-of-america-v-mark-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1124 (1st Cir. 1989), we reject the appellant's assignment of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has yet another string to her bow. She maintains that the district court failed to instruct the jury that the conspirators must reach agreement as to the object of the conspiracy. See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Rivera-Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521900\"><a href=\"/opinion/521900/united-states-v-antonio-rivera-santiago-aka-junior-vivique-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989). This criticism reads the court's charge too narrowly. The court told the jurors that, in order to convict, they \"must find that the defendants conspired with each other to import cocaine into the United States\" (emphasis supplied). We think that this reference, taken in context, sufficed both to describe the object of the conspiracy and to delineate the jury's obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. ALLEGED SENTENCING ERRORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced the appellant to a 168-month incarcerative term, to be followed by a five-year period of supervised release. The appellant attacks her prison sentence on three grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellant contends that the district court clearly erred in its drug-quantity finding (and, therefore, in its determination of the guideline sentencing range). We do not linger over this contention. We dispatched an identical argument in deciding the codefendant's appeal. See United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 176-77. The outcome here necessarily is the same. Accordingly, we reject the appellant's complaint about the district court's drug-quantity determination for the reasons stated in our earlier opinion. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second argument suffers the same fate. She asserts that the length of her sentence offends the rule established in Apprendi v. New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, 2362-63 (2000) (holding that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\"). This argument, too, was previously made and rejected. See United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 177-78 (citing United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199304\"><a href=\"/opinion/199304/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir. 2001)). Here, as in Reynaldo's case, we discern no Apprendi error in respect to the prison sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, we need not tarry. An incarcerative sentence of no greater than twenty years for importing, or conspiring to import, any quantity of cocaine falls below the default statutory maximum for such an offense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and therefore does not violate Apprendi. Id. That is dispositive here. \"No Apprendi violation occurs when the district court sentences a defendant below the default statutory maximum, even though drug quantity, determined by the court under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, influences the length of the sentence imposed.\" Robinson, 241 F.3d at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the five-year supervised release term, the appellant benefits from the fact that the penalty statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(3), provides explicitly for a supervised release term of three years for violations of the importation statute involving less than 500 grams of cocaine. See United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 177-78 (explaining this point). Given this court's previous holding that supervised release terms set out in particular sections of the drug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those sections, see Suveges v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194978\"><a href=\"/opinion/194978/suveges-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (construing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)), we think that here, as in the companion appeal, Apprendi requires that this aspect of the appellant's sentence be reduced to three years, see United States v. Reynaldo Barnes, 244 F.3d at 178.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This reduction can, of course, be accomplished without either disturbing the remainder of the sentence or reconvening the disposition hearing. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. After careful consideration of the record, we conclude that the government did not violate the Speedy Trial Act and that the lower court committed no reversible error in charging the jury. We therefore affirm the appellant's conviction. We also affirm her sentence, except for one particular. To repair that defect, we instruct the district court, on remand, to reduce the supervised release term previously imposed from five years to three years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The first and second indictments did not replicate one another. Although both charged the defendants with conspiracy, Indictment No. 1 included a criminal forfeiture count, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, which Indictment No. 2 omitted, and Indictment No. 2 (as initially brought and as superseded) included two \"communications facility\" counts, see id. &#167; 843(b), which Indictment No. 1 omitted.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court stated in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Now, a conspiracy is an agreement, spoken or unspoken. The conspiracy does not have to be a formal agreement or plan in which everyone involved sat down together and worked out all of the details. It does not even have to be a successful plan. But the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that those who were involved shared a general understanding about the crime. Mere similarity of conduct among various people, or the fact that they may have associated with each other or discussed common aims and interests, does not necessarily establish proof of existence of a conspiracy, but you may consider such factors.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The appellant asked the district court to charge the jury that \"[a] meeting of the minds between or among the members of the conspiracy is required\" to show an agreement, and that \"[t]here must be a meeting of the minds . . . to commit the unlawful act.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As we explained in our earlier opinion, the default statutory maximum applicable to violations of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963 (the statute criminalizing importation or attempted importation of any detectable quantity of cocaine) is contained in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(3).
