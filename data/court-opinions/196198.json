BACKGROUND\r                                    I. BACKGROUND\r\n\n     The  eight  appellants  are  Donna  Saccoccia  (wife  of\r\n\nStephen), her brother Vincent Hurley, James Saccoccio and his\r\n\nbrother  Kenneth  Saccoccio,  Carlo DeMarco  and  his brother\r\n\nAnthony DeMarco,  Stanley Cirella  and Stephen Pizzo.   Along\r\n\nwith Stephen  Saccoccia and others, appellants  were indicted\r\n\non November  18, 1991, and  were charged  with conspiracy  to\r\n\nviolate  the Racketeer  Influenced and  Corrupt Organizations\r\n\nAct (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C.   1962(d).  Certain of them were also\r\n\ncharged with  substantive  counts  of  money  laundering,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.     1956-57, currency reporting offenses,  31 U.S.C.  \r\n\n5324, and interstate travel in aid of racketeering, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1952.\r\n\n     One  conspirator  originally charged,  David  Izzi, pled\r\n\nguilty  before  trial  and  testified  for   the  government.\r\n\nStephen Saccoccia was severed and tried separately due to the\r\n\nillness  of  his  counsel.    Alfred  Gabriele,  added  as  a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nconspirator  in  a  superseding  indictment, was  also  tried\r\n\nseparately, and his  appeal is still pending.   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Gabriele, No. 94-1215 (1st Cir.).  The end result was that\r                       \r\n\nthe  eight appellants in this case were tried together in the\r\n\ndistrict court in Rhode  Island.  Trial began on  November 6,\r\n\n1992, and ended in a jury verdict on December 18, 1992.\r\n\n     At  trial, the government's evidence consisted primarily\r\n\nof  the   testimony  of  other  participants   in  the  money\r\n\nlaundering activities, of Colombian nationals involved in the\r\n\ninternational  drug  trade,  and  of  bank  employees.    The\r\n\ngovernment   also   offered   bank   records   of   financial\r\n\ntransactions and numerous  court-ordered wiretap  recordings.\r\n\nViewed in the  light most favorable  to the verdicts,  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Valerio,  48  F.3d 58,  63  (1st Cir.  1995),  the\r                              \r\n\nevidence permitted a reasonable jury to find the following.\r\n\n     Stephen  Saccoccia  owned  and  controlled  a number  of\r\n\nprecious metals businesses, including Saccoccia  Coin Company\r\n\nin  Cranston, Rhode Island (\"Saccoccia Coin\"); Trend Precious\r\n\nMetals in Cranston and  in New York, New York  (\"Trend\"); and\r\n\nInternational  Metal  Marketing  (\"International Metal\")  and\r\n\nClinton  Import/Export in  Los Angeles,  California (\"Clinton\r\n\nImport/Export\").   In  the  late 1980s,  after some  indirect\r\n\ndealings,  Stephen Saccoccia began  laundering drug money for\r\n\nDuvan Arboleda, a Colombian narcotics dealer.  The laundering\r\n\noperation, ultimately expanded to serve a second drug ring as\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwell,  took  several  forms   but  each  began  with  Stephen\r\n\nSaccoccia  receiving  large  amounts  of cash  in  New  York,\r\n\ngenerated from the  sale of cocaine.   Often, Saccoccia would\r\n\nsend  one of his employees, usually unindicted co-conspirator\r\n\nRichard  Gizzarelli, to  a  prearranged location,  such as  a\r\n\nstreet  corner, to  meet  a customer's  courier.   Gizzarelli\r\n\nwould bring  the cash to the  Trend office in New  York or to\r\n\nSaccoccia's apartment in New York to count it.\r\n\n     The money then followed  two different routes.  Some  of\r\n\nthe  cash would be used to purchase money orders or gold; the\r\n\ngold and some of the remaining  cash would then be shipped to\r\n\nInternational Metal in Los Angeles.  Much of the  rest of the\r\n\ncash--up to  $200,000 per  day--would  be sent  to Trend  and\r\n\nSaccoccia Coin  in Rhode  Island, either through  armored car\r\n\nservice or in the car of a Saccoccia employee.\r\n\n     Once the cash  reached Rhode Island,  it was counted  by\r\n\nSaccoccia employees and divided into  a number of packets  in\r\n\namounts  either greater than or  less than $10,000.   Most of\r\n\nthe cash went  to the  Trend office in  Cranston.   Saccoccia\r\n\nemployees,  directed by Izzi, then drove to local banks where\r\n\nthey purchased cashier's checks  in amounts less than $10,000\r\n\npayable to Trend, or cashier's checks in amounts greater than\r\n\n$10,000 payable to companies nominally  owned by Hurley.  The\r\n\npurpose   of  these   maneuvers--called  \"smurfing\"   in  law\r\n\nenforcement parlance--was to avoid  or minimize the filing of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\naccurate currency transaction reports, which  are required by\r\n\nfederal law for cash deposits in amounts of $10,000 or more.\r\n\n     Ultimately  the  local  Rhode  Island  checks  would  be\r\n\ndeposited in, and  money from the  Hurley accounts wired  to,\r\n\nthe  Trend account  at  Citizens Bank  in  Rhode Island.    A\r\n\nsmaller  portion of  the cash  sent to  Rhode Island  went to\r\n\nSaccoccia  Coin.   That  cash was  used  to buy  gold without\r\n\ndocumentation;  the  gold  was  then   resold  to  legitimate\r\n\ncompanies  in exchange  for checks  recorded as  payments for\r\n\ngold  sales.  Some of the cash  was also used in the ordinary\r\n\noperations of  the Saccoccia Coin Shop,  a heavily cash-based\r\n\nenterprise.\r\n\n     At the  Los Angeles end, the gold  sent to International\r\n\nMetal was sold, and the proceeds were wired back to the Trend\r\n\naccount  at Citizens  Bank.   Cash received  by International\r\n\nMetal was used to  purchase gold covertly, the gold  was then\r\n\nsold,  and the proceeds were also wired to the Trend account.\r\n\nThus,  the bulk of  the cash that  Saccoccia sent out  of New\r\n\nYork eventually ended  up in the  Trend account at  Citizens.\r\n\nCitizens  Bank  closed  the  Trend  account  in  April  1991.\r\n\nThereafter,  cash was  still  transported from  New York  and\r\n\n\"smurf\" employees in  Rhode Island  still obtained  cashier's\r\n\nchecks  from  various banks,  but  the  checks were  sent  to\r\n\nInternational Metal and Clinton Import/Export in Los Angeles.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     Donna Saccoccia assisted her  husband in most aspects of\r\n\nthe  operation, relayed  his instructions  to the  others and\r\n\nwired funds  abroad to Colombian  banks.  Hurley  and Anthony\r\n\nDeMarco  picked  up  cash  from  couriers  in  New  York  and\r\n\ntransported it  to Rhode Island.   Hurley, Anthony  and Carlo\r\n\nDeMarco,  Kenneth  and  James Saccoccio,  Cirella  and  Pizzo\r\n\nreceived  the cash  deliveries in  Rhode Island,  counted the\r\n\nmoney, and separated it into  packets of smaller amounts  for\r\n\ntransport to  local banks.   Anthony  DeMarco  and James  and\r\n\nKenneth Saccoccio bought the bulk of the cashier's checks.\r\n\n     A  staggering  amount   of  money  moved   through  this\r\n\nlaundering operation.  Between March  1, 1990, and August 22,\r\n\n1991, Stephen  or Donna Saccoccia wired over  $136 million to\r\n\nforeign bank  accounts primarily  in Colombia; more  than $97\r\n\nmillion  of this amount was  wired from the  Trend account in\r\n\nCitizens Bank jointly controlled by Donna and Stephen.  Apart\r\n\nfrom the $136 million, substantial sums were  retained by the\r\n\nSaccoccias and their employees as compensation.\r\n\n     All eight  appellants were convicted of RICO conspiracy.\r\n\nAll but Carlo DeMarco and Pizzo were convicted of substantive\r\n\noffenses.     After   post-trial  motions,   appellants  were\r\n\nsentenced in May 1993,  and forfeiture judgments against each\r\n\nappellant  were  entered  pursuant  to  the  RICO  forfeiture\r\n\nstatute, 18  U.S.C.   1963, and in some cases under the money\r\n\nlaundering forfeiture statute.  18 U.S.C.   982.

THE RICO ISSUES\r                                 II.  THE RICO ISSUES\r\n\n     The   RICO  conspiracy  offense  charged  in  this  case\r\n\nrequired the  government to prove an  agreement by appellants\r\n\n\"to conduct  or participate  .  . .  in the  conduct of  [an]\r\n\nenterprise's  affairs  through  a  pattern   of  racketeering\r\n\nactivity\";  and the  pattern  alleged in  this case  required\r\n\nproof of  two or  more criminal acts  by an  appellant (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nmoney laundering or structuring).  See 18  U.S.C.    1961(1),\r                                                  \r\n\n1962(c), (d).  Appellants  here challenge the indictment, the\r\n\ninstructions and the evidence relating to RICO.\r\n\n                    A. The RICO Indictment\r                                A. The RICO Indictment\r                                                      \r\n\n     The RICO conspiracy count  alleged the formal requisites\r\n\nof the  offense including  the assertion that  each appellant\r\n\nagreed to commit  at least two racketeering acts;  but it did\r\n\nnot specify which predicate  acts each appellant committed or\r\n\nagreed  to commit.  Hurley,  Cirella, Pizzo and Carlo DeMarco\r\n\nargue  that  this  lack  of  specificity  is   fatal  to  the\r\n\nindictment  because  a  sufficient  indictment  must  \"fairly\r\n\ninform[ ]  a defendant  of the charge  against which  he must\r\n\ndefend . . . .\"   Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87,  117\r                                                      \r\n\n(1974).\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     In count I,  the indictment  identified the  enterprise,\r\n\nits  precise method  of operation,  the  role played  by each\r\n\nappellant,  and the nature of the predicate acts charged.  In\r\n\nappended  lists  specifically  referenced  in  count  I,  the\r\n\nindictment  also  set  forth  thousands  of  individual  bank\r\n\ntransactions and  wire transfers.   What was lacking  was any\r\n\nidentification of  the particular  transactions in  which the\r\n\nfour complaining appellants  were involved, since they  acted\r\n\nmainly  as counters  and subdividers  of money  deposited and\r\n\ntransferred by others.\r\n\n     But  if  a defendant  were  charged  with conspiring  to\r\n\ndistribute drugs, it would  surely be enough to show  that he\r\n\nhad acted as a packer in the drug-making \"factory\" during the\r\n\nperiod in which  a series of identified  shipments were made.\r\n\nThe government might  never know  which particular  shipments\r\n\nhad been  packed  by  the defendant;  but  his  agreement  to\r\n\nparticipate  in distributing multiple  shipments could fairly\r\n\nbe inferred.  The same principle applies in this case.  There\r\n\nis, we note,  no indication  that appellants  were misled  or\r\n\nleft  in  ignorance about  what  the  government intended  to\r\n\nprove.\r\n\n     United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120 (1st Cir.  1981),\r                                        \r\n\ncert. denied, 460 U.S. 1011  (1983), relied on by appellants,\r                        \r\n\nis not in point.  In that case we held that the indictment of\r\n\ntwo defendants  failed because \"a RICO  conspiracy count must\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ncharge  as a minimum that each defendant agreed to commit two\r\n\nor more specified predicate crimes.\"  Id. at 1136.

Here,  the indictment did so charge, and Winter is not\r                                                                  \r\n\nin point.  \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n      B.

Ct. 1163, 1172 (1993),  the Supreme Court interpreted\r\n\nthe words \"conduct or participate\" and held that they require\r\n\nthe   defendant's  \"participat[ion]   in  the   operation  or\r\n\nmanagement of the enterprise itself.\"  Reves involved a civil\r                                                        \r\n\nRICO suit against an  outside accounting firm hired  to audit\r\n\nthe  books of  an allegedly  corrupt enterprise.   Construing\r\n\nReves, we  held in United  States v. Oreto, 37  F.3d 739, 750\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994), cert.  denied, 115 S.

No objection to the instruction\r                                       \r\n\nwas made at trial,  so we review only for \"plain error,\" Fed.\r\n\nR.  Crim. P. 52(b), which requires appellants to show that an\r\n\nerror was made, the error was clear or obvious, and the error\r\n\nresulted in prejudice--that  is, it affected the  defendant's\r\n\nsubstantial rights.  United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct. 1770,\r                                                       \r\n\n1777-78  (1993).

The difference--which\r                            \r\n\nappellants  deem  crucial--is  that  the   Oreto  instruction\r                                                            \r\n\nencompassed  defendants who  perform  acts  \"necessary to  or\r\n\nhelpful  in the  operation  of the  enterprise,\" whereas  the\r\n\ninstruction in this  case encompassed defendants who  perform\r\n\nacts  \"related   to   the  operation   of  the   enterprise.\"\r\n\nAppellants argue that the court's language embraced precisely\r\n\nthe view that Reves rejected: \"that almost any involvement in\r                               \r\n\nthe  affairs of  an  enterprise [satisfies]  the 'conduct  or\r\n\nparticipate' requirement.\"  Reves, 113 S.

But  in  this  case  the\r                                            \r\n\ngovernment's  version  of  the  evidence   placed  appellants\r\n\nsquarely in the  role of  employees of the  enterprise.   The\r\n\njury's verdict shows that  the jury accepted that  version of\r\n\nevents,  making the  alleged  ambiguity  in the  instructions\r\n\nharmless.   To  the  extent that  appellants are  challenging\r\n\nOreto's reading of Reves,  Oreto is the law of  this circuit.\r                                            \r\n\nSee United  States v.

First, they challenge the\r\n\nuse  of a  general  \"willful blindness\"  instruction and  the\r\n\ncourt's refusal  to instruct the jury  that willful blindness\r\n\ndid not apply  to the RICO conspiracy  count.  They say  that\r\n\none cannot simultaneously be  willfully blind to a conspiracy\r\n\nand also intend and agree to join the conspiracy.\r\n\n     The  district judge  first  instructed the  jury on  the\r\n\nsubstantive counts.  He  then gave a detailed  explanation of\r\n\nthe RICO conspiracy count, including the requirement that the\r\n\ngovernment  prove both \"an intent to agree\" and \"an intent to\r\n\ncommit the  substantive offenses that are the  objects of the\r\n\nconspiracy.\"  The  judge told  the jury that  they could  not\r\n\ninfer knowledge of  the conspiracy from negligence,  mistake,\r\n\nor  ignorance; instead, the  defendant must  act \"voluntarily\r\n\nand intentionally.\"   After lengthy instructions  on the RICO\r\n\ncount, the judge moved on to more general propositions.  Only\r\n\nthen did he give the \"willful blindness\" instruction:\r\n\n     In  deciding whether  a Defendant  acted knowingly,\r\n     you may infer that the Defendant had knowledge of a\r\n     fact if  you find  that the  Defendant deliberately\r\n     closed his  eyes  to a  fact that  would have  been\r\n     obvious to him.\r\n\n     The  willful blindness instruction  appears to have been\r\n\naimed at  the \"knowing\" requirements  of substantive  counts.\r\n\nE.g.,  18 U.S.C.   1956  (money laundering).

Here  the\r\n\ntrial  judge  adequately  guarded  against  that  risk   with\r\n\ncautionary  instructions stressing  that the  defendants must\r\n\nhave joined the conspiracy  intentionally, see United  States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Ct. 80 (1994), and  we see no way that the jury could have\r\n\nconvicted without finding deliberate agreement.\r\n\n     Second,  appellants  object   to  the  district  court's\r\n\nrefusal  of  their  request  for  an  instruction  that  each\r\n\nappellant  had to know of the existence and general nature of\r\n\nthe enterprise.  When this request was made after the charge,\r\n\nit was  entangled with other requests and  the district court\r\n\nmay not  have focused on the  request or may have  thought it\r\n\nhad in substance been given.  Although nothing in the statute\r\n\nexplicitly requires such knowledge, there is  some precedent,\r\n\nincluding  a  comment  from  this  court,  suggesting  it  is\r\n\nappropriate.  See, e.g., Brandon, 17 F.3d at 428; 2 L.  Sand,\r                                            \r\n\nJ.  Siffert,  W. Loughlin  &amp;  S. Reiss,  Modern  Federal Jury\r                                                                         \r\n\nInstructions   52.04 at 52-39 &amp; comment (1995).\r                        \r\n\n     We think that  in substance the jury  was told, although\r\n\nsomewhat indirectly,  that appellants had to be  aware of the\r\n\nenterprise and  its general character  in order to  be guilty\r\n\nunder the RICO conspiracy charge.  The court  instructed that\r\n\nthe  first element  that  the jury  had to  find  was that  a\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nconspiracy existed \"to conduct  or participate in the affairs\r\n\nof an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.\"\r\n\nThe court subsequently told the jury that the government must\r\n\nalso prove  \"that the  defendant knew the  conspiracy existed\r\n\nand knew of its unlawful purpose.\"\r\n\n     Perhaps in theory one might imagine a defendant who knew\r\n\nof  and joined in a  conspiracy to conduct  an enterprise but\r\n\ndid not know  the nature  of the enterprise.   In this  case,\r\n\nhowever,  the government's  evidence  showed that  appellants\r\n\nknowingly engaged  in structuring transactions  on an ongoing\r\n\nbasis  within the  framework of Stephen  Saccoccia's business\r\n\nventure.  Given the  evidence accepted by the jury,  there is\r\n\nno doubt that appellants  knew what they were doing  and knew\r\n\nthey  were doing  it within  the framework  of the  Saccoccia\r\n\norganization.  If  the instruction deviated from  perfection,\r\n\nthe deviation was assuredly harmless.\r\n\n  D.  The RICO Instructions: Single or Multiple Conspiracies\r              D.  The RICO Instructions: Single or Multiple Conspiracies\r                                                                        \r\n\n     At trial,  the government  offered  evidence of  out-of-\r\n\ncourt statements by several  persons whom it characterized as\r\n\nunindicted  co-conspirators.   The  most  important were  two\r\n\nregional  managers  of  rival  drug  cartels  each  of  which\r\n\nsupplied  money  to  be  laundered   by  Stephen  Saccoccia's\r\n\norganization.  The district  court admitted the hearsay under\r\n\nthe  co-conspirator exception,  Fed.  R. Evid.  801(d)(2)(E),\r\n\npursuant  to United States v.  Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20 (1st\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nCir. 1977).  The court found that the regional managers were,\r\n\nmore probably  than not, members of  the Saccoccia conspiracy\r\n\nand  rendered a  final Petrozziello  ruling at  the close  of\r                                               \r\n\nevidence.\r\n\n     Appellants  say first  that the  two drug  ring managers\r\n\ncould not conceivably be members of the same  conspiracy with\r\n\neach other  because the  rings were  rivals.  The  government\r\n\nresponds that the hearsay exception does not require that the\r\n\nconspiracy used to support  the hearsay evidence be the  same\r\n\nas that charged, see  United States v. Dworken, 855  F.2d 12,\r                                                          \r\n\n24 (1st Cir. 1988), and that at the very least that each drug\r\n\ndealer  necessarily  conspired  with   the  members  of   the\r\n\nSaccoccia organization.  Whether  the government's premise of\r\n\nseparate  conspiracies  is sound  or  squares  with what  the\r\n\ndistrict court found is not evident from its brief.  \r\n\n     Nevertheless,  appellants--who bear the burden on appeal\r\n\nof showing error in the Petrozziello finding--make no serious\r                                                \r\n\neffort to show that the two drug dealers could not have  been\r\n\npart of the same conspiracy; their  alleged rivalry is hardly\r\n\nconclusive  because   it  is  not  necessary   that  all  co-\r\n\nconspirators know of each other's existence, Brandon, 17 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 428.  Whether a conspiracy's customers are also members of\r\n\nthe conspiracy is a fact-based question, see United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMoran,  984 F.2d 1299, 1303  (1st Cir. 1993),  and once again\r                 \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\nappellants  make  no effort  to muster  the evidence  on this\r\n\nissue, or even to argue it.\r\n\n     Alternatively, appellants argue that the court should at\r\n\nleast  have  given  a  multiple  conspiracy  instruction,  an\r\n\nargument reinforced--although  perhaps only superficially--by\r\n\nthe government's  defense of  the hearsay declarations.   The\r\n\ngovernment  says that this issue  was not raised  in a timely\r\n\nfashion  and that there was  no factual basis  for a multiple\r\n\nconspiracy instruction.   In declining to give such a charge,\r\n\nthe trial judge rested on both of these grounds and found, in\r\n\naddition,  that the proposed  multiple conspiracy instruction\r\n\nwas itself deficient.\r\n\n     The district  court could  be  sustained on  any one  of\r\n\nthese  three  grounds  but  we  think  that  untimeliness  is\r\n\nsufficient, United  States v. Akers,  987 F.2d 507,  513 (8th\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1993); Yoffe v. United  States, 153 F.2d  570, 576 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1946), and add  two further points.  First,  the request\r\n\nfor such an instruction  was not made until after  government\r\n\ncounsel  had   completed  his  closing  argument,  making  it\r\n\nimpossible for  him  to  address  the  jury  on  this  point.\r\n\nSecond, the core of  the government's case tended to  show an\r\n\noverarching conspiracy; and appellants make  little effort in\r\n\ntheir brief to show that multiple conspiracies were a serious\r\n\npossibility.\r\n\n               E.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                           E.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\n     In  reviewing sufficiency  claims, we  normally consider\r\n\nthe evidence \"in the light most favorable to the prosecution\"\r\n\nand then  ask whether  the evidence  \"would allow  a rational\r\n\njury  to  determine  beyond   a  reasonable  doubt  that  the\r\n\ndefendants were  guilty as charged.\"   United States  v. Mena\r                                                                         \r\n\nRobles,  4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114\r                                                                    \r\n\nS. Ct. 1550  (1994).   Although appellants deny  that any  of\r\n\nthem  \"directed\"  the  enterprise,  we  rejected  this  legal\r\n\npremise in Oreto, holding  that an employee can \"conduct\"  or\r                            \r\n\n\"participate\" in the conduct  of an enterprise by  playing an\r\n\nintegral role  in its operation.  37 F.3d at 750.  By Oreto's\r                                                                       \r\n\ntest, a rational jury could convict each appellant.\r\n\n     Donna  Saccoccia relayed  her husband's  instructions to\r\n\nother appellants  on numerous occasions, helped  count money,\r\n\nand personally authorized the wire transfer of more  than $38\r\n\nmillion  from the  Trend  account to  foreign bank  accounts.\r\n\nHurley  and Anthony  DeMarco received  and counted  the large\r\n\ncash  deliveries in New York and helped transport the cash to\r\n\nRhode  Island.    James  and Kenneth  Saccoccio  and  Anthony\r\n\nDeMarco did most of the legwork involved in money laundering,\r\n\nexchanging millions  of dollars in cash  for cashier's checks\r\n\nat  various banks.  Carlo  DeMarco travelled to  New York and\r\n\nConnecticut to transport the  cash; Cirella and Stephen Pizzo\r\n\nreceived and counted money at the coin shop.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n\n     Four appellants  argue that apart from  their low levels\r\n\nof responsibility,  the  evidence was  insufficient  to  show\r\n\nknowledge on  their part that the  Saccoccia organization was\r\n\nengaged in money laundering or that the money being laundered\r\n\nwas  derived  from  narcotics.   These  claims  are  made  by\r\n\nCirella, Pizzo  and James and  Kenneth Saccoccio in  order to\r\n\ndefeat the showing of predicate acts available to the jury to\r\n\nunderpin  their RICO convictions.   Each of the  four says or\r\n\nimplies that he was  unaware of money laundering but  working\r\n\nfor what he understood to be a legitimate business.\r\n\n     The jury was entitled to find that these four appellants\r\n\nknew  that they  were engaged  in unlawful  money laundering.\r\n\nStephen  Saccoccia discussed  with Cirella  and Pizzo,  among\r\n\nothers, how to avoid police  detection; and Pizzo and Cirella\r\n\ndiscussed \"washing .  . .  the money\" and  means of  avoiding\r\n\njail.  James and  Kenneth Saccoccio were involved in  so many\r\n\ndeposits   and  manipulative   subdividings  of   funds  that\r\n\nlaundering was  the only plausible explanation.   Further, in\r\n\none  instance (July  10,  1990), discussing  the division  of\r\n\n$54,000  into  packages  of  $9,000 for  deposit,  James  and\r\n\nKenneth   Saccoccio   conducted   the  following   (recorded)\r\n\nconversation with Izzi:\r\n\n          James:    54, I can't do  that.  He wants me  to do\r\n                    $9,000 at every bank, that's stupid!\r\n                    (voices fade out)\r\n\n          James:    KENNY, you want me to do 9 at every bank?\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                         -22-\r\r\n\n          Kenneth:  (unintelligible) $54,000 that's the way I\r\n                    been  doing  it.   Use  VOGUE,  do VOGUE,\r\n                    (unintelligible).\r\n\n          Izzi:     Not all of  it, do a couple  of TRENDS if\r\n                    you could.\r\n\n     As for the  drug-based origins of  the cash, the  direct\r\n\nevidence of  knowledge among  the underlings is  much thinner\r\n\nsince none  of the  conspirators were directly  involved with\r\n\nthe narcotics sales.  Kenneth Saccoccio is an exception since\r\n\nhe was recorded,  while counting cash at  Trend, referring to\r\n\nit  as \"drug  money\";  and in  one  conversation with  Pizzo,\r\n\nCirella  said something  that the  jury might  have  taken as\r\n\nreferring to the  drug origins of the proceeds.   In the case\r\n\nof  James Saccoccio,  the  imputation of  knowledge of  drugs\r\n\nrests  on the vast sums involved in the laundering and James'\r\n\nclose association with Kenneth.\r\n\n     There are plenty of cash-generating businesses but among\r\n\nthose that require the illicit laundering of funds, the  drug\r\n\nbusiness  is notorious  and preeminent.   In  this case,  the\r\n\nevidence showed  that narcotics were  the source of  the cash\r\n\nand  that this fact was  well known to  Stephen Saccoccia and\r\n\nKenneth  Saccoccio, among others.   We think  that a rational\r\n\njury  could  conclude  that James  too  knew  of  the money's\r\n\norigins, either from  the size and  continuing nature of  the\r\n\ndeliveries, or  from  being told  that  the money  came  from\r\n\ndrugs; and Cirella and Pizzo are a fortiori cases.    \r                                                       \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\r\n\n           III.  CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORT ISSUES\r                       III.  CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORT ISSUES\r\n\n     The Bank  Secrecy Act requires domestic  banks to report\r\n\nany  transactions involving  more  than $10,000  in cash,  31\r\n\nU.S.C.    5313; 31 C.F.R.   103.   The statute also prohibits\r\n\ncustomers  from providing  false  information  for  a  bank's\r\n\nreport.    31 U.S.C.    5324(2).1    Further, under  the 1986\r\n\namendments, \"[n]o person shall for the purpose of evading the\r\n\nreporting  requirements of [the Act or its regulations] . . .\r\n\n(3)  structure or assist in structuring . . . any transaction\r\n\nwith one or  more domestic  financial institutions.\"   Id.   \r                                                                      \r\n\n5324.  The most  common method of \"structuring\" is  to divide\r\n\nsums of cash into  amounts that are either under  the $10,000\r\n\nreporting threshold or into amounts that are larger but still\r\n\nless likely to attract attention.\r\n\n     Structuring is a criminal act, 31 U.S.C.    5322(a), and\r\n\na violator is subject to double  the fine and sentence if  he\r\n\nor she structures while violating  another federal law or  as\r\n\npart  of a  pattern of  crime.

Needless to  say, a fair  portion of  those\r\n\ninvolved in  such accidents may be  identifying themselves in\r\n\nsituations that could result in  criminal jeopardy.  But  the\r\n\nCourt  found that  the  report  required  was  not  itself  a\r\n\nconfession of criminal conduct, and that the law was directed\r\n\nto all auto  drivers in the state rather than  a more limited\r\n\ngroup \"inherently  suspect of  criminal activities.\"   Byers,\r                                                                        \r\n\n402 U.S. at 430 (quoting Albertson, 382 U.S. at 79).\r                                              \r\n\n     Of  course, a  witness  may invoke  the Fifth  Amendment\r\n\nbased on  fairly remote risks, see In  re Kave, 760 F.2d 343,\r                                                          \r\n\n354 (1st Cir.  1985), but reporting  statutes play a  central\r\n\nrole in  the administration of government  (e.g., taxes), and\r                                                            \r\n\nthe jurisprudence that governs  them has followed a different\r\n\ncourse.

The bank  report, based  on\r\n\ninformation that  the teller secures from  the customer, asks\r\n\n\"on  whose  behalf\"  the  transaction   is  being  conducted.\r\n\nAnthony DeMarco told bank  tellers that the transactions were\r\n\nbeing conducted on  his own  behalf but  the evidence  showed\r\n\nthat   they  were  being  conducted  for  Stephen  Saccoccia.\r\n\nAnthony DeMarco claims that the \"on whose behalf\" language is\r\n\nunconstitutionally vague.\r\n\n     Due  process  requires  that  criminal  statutes  define\r\n\noffenses with sufficient clarity  that an ordinary person can\r\n\nunderstand what  conduct is prohibited.   Kolender v. Lawson,\r                                                                        \r\n\n461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983).

It\r\n     requires  something more  than  mere negligence  or\r\n     mistake.  It requires  proof that a Defendant acted\r\n     with   the  purpose   of   either   disobeying   or\r\n     disregarding the law.\r\n\n     No objection was made to this  instruction, so we review\r\n\nfor plain error.  This case does not present the conundrum of\r\n\na failure to object followed by a wholly unexpected change of\r\n\nlaw;  one month before the trial  in our case, this court had\r\n\nan en banc  argument to consider the  scienter requirement in\r                      \r\n\nthe structuring  statute.

The indictment\r\n\ncharged that they, together with James and Kenneth Saccoccio,\r\n\nstructured a set  of six  bank deposits of  $8,000 to  $9,000\r\n\neach in several  different bank accounts on October  2, 1990.\r\n\nThe indictment said:\r\n\n     [T]he    defendants    structured,   assisted    in\r\n     structuring and  attempted to structure  and assist\r\n     in  structuring  the  transaction  by   dividing  a\r\n     quantity of currency in  excess of $10,000 into two\r\n     or more portions  and using those smaller  portions\r\n     to purchase cashiers checks or other instruments in\r\n     amounts under  $10,000  at two  or  more  financial\r\n     institutions on the same day . . . .\r\n\n     The evidence at  trial showed that  on October 2,  1990,\r\n\nIzzi told Hurley and Cirella to give him $35,000 in $10 bills\r\n\nand later in the day to give Kenneth Saccoccio $30,000 in $20\r\n\nbills.   Bank records showed  that after the conversation and\r\n\nlater  that   day   Kenneth   Saccoccio   made   two   $9,000\r\n\ntransactions.  The jury convicted Hurley and Cirella on count\r\n\n67, and on appeal they raise a bevy of arguments.\r\n\n     The first argument is  based on the fact that  the trial\r\n\njudge,   without   objection,   instructed  the   jury   that\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                         -30-\r\r\n\nstructuring can occur either  by dividing a sum  over $10,000\r\n\ninto deposits under  that figure or by dividing  the original\r\n\nsum  into  amounts  that  are over  $10,000  but  reduce  the\r\n\nreportable amount.   Appellants read the  indictment language\r\n\nas limiting  the offense  to the  \"under $10,000\"  theory and\r\n\nargue that  the \"over $10,000\"  theory permitted the  jury to\r\n\nconvict on  a different theory of  the offense, impermissibly\r\n\ncausing  a constructive  amendment of  the indictment.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g.,  United States v. Atisha,  804 F.2d 920,  927 (6th Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1067 (1987).\r                               \r\n\n     The  apparent strength of the argument is that the taped\r\n\nevidence showed  these two appellants being  told to assemble\r\n\namounts  over  $10,000  and the  \"over  $10,000\"  instruction\r\n\nappears  to  dovetail with  this  evidence.   But  the  \"over\r\n\n$10,000\" instruction was a general one, describing one method\r\n\nof  structuring, and  had nothing  in particular  to  do with\r\n\ncount 67.    Further, the  \"over  $10,000\" theory  fit  those\r\n\ninstances  (involving DeMarco,  Kenneth and  James Saccoccio)\r\n\nwhere  a deposit occurred that was over $10,000 but less than\r\n\nthe  original  sum.   On the  other  hand, the  only deposits\r\n\nalleged in relationship to count 67 were under $10,000. \r\n\n     Thus, reading the instructions in  relation to evidence,\r\n\nwe  think   that  the  jury   had  to  understand   that  the\r\n\ngovernment's case  on count 67  amounted to this:  Hurley and\r\n\nCirella, to facilitate specified unreported deposits of under\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                         -31-\r\r\n\n$10,000 on October 2,  provided larger sums (as  directed) in\r\n\naid of and with the expectation that they would be subdivided\r\n\ninto  amounts  under  $10,000   to  avoid  reports  and  then\r\n\ndeposited,  as in  fact they  were.   The practice  of giving\r\n\ngeneral instructions in multiple count cases, and letting the\r\n\njury sort  out their application  according to the  facts, is\r\n\ncommon and permissible.       Given  this  interpretation  of\r\n\nwhat  happened, we have  no reason to  consider whether there\r\n\nwould  have  been  a  constructive amendment  rather  than  a\r\n\nvariance if the jury  had been instructed to apply  the \"over\r\n\n$10,000\"  theory to  count 67.   See  generally 3  C. Wright,\r                                                           \r\n\nFederal Practice and  Procedure    516, at 26  (2d ed.  1982)\r                                           \r\n\n(describing distinction  as \"shadowy\").  We  do consider, but\r\n\nreject, appellants' claim that the evidence was inadequate to\r\n\nconnect their  delivery of $30,000 to  Kenneth Saccoccio with\r\n\nhis  later deposits of amounts  under $10,000 that  day.  The\r\n\ntiming made the connection a permissible inference.\r\n\n     In a  different attack,  appellants argue that  count 67\r\n\nwas  facially defective  because  it alleged,  but failed  to\r\n\nspecify, the  other federal law concurrently  violated or the\r\n\npattern of illegal activity involving over $100,000 within 12\r\n\nmonths.   This additional allegation was not  needed to prove\r\n\nthe violation but was needed  to trigger the enhanced penalty\r\n\nprovided  by  section 5322(b).

They say  that\r\n\nthere is insufficient evidence  that they knew structuring to\r\n\nbe  illegal,  as Ratzlaf  required, and  that they  were thus\r                                    \r\n\nentitled to judgments  of acquittal.  In Ratzlaf  itself, the\r                                                            \r\n\ndissent contended  that the majority's  knowledge requirement\r\n\nwould  frustrate  the   statute;  the   majority  said   that\r\n\nreasonable  inferences could  be drawn.   114  S.

Our case presents just this issue.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r\n\n     There is  no direct evidence that  either appellant knew\r\n\nthat structuring was a crime.  At the same time, the evidence\r\n\npermitted the jury to conclude that both knew that drug money\r\n\nwas involved; that both knew that the break-downs of the cash\r\n\nwere designed to  disguise proceeds; and that  both were paid\r\n\nin proportion  to  the  deposits  they made.    In  addition,\r\n\nKenneth Saccoccio  made a recorded statement  indicating that\r\n\nhe knew that his  own activity was criminal; and  given their\r\n\ncommon  role and  association a  jury could  reasonably infer\r\n\nthat James had the same level of apprehension.3\r\n\n     We   think  that  the  thrust  of  Ratzlaf's  wilfulness\r                                                           \r\n\nrequirement is  met if  persons engaged in  depositing broken\r\n\ndown amounts  are generally  conscious that  their laundering\r\n\noperation  is illegal, even if  they do not  know the precise\r\n\nrequirements of the law.  This circuit in Aversa was the only\r                                                            \r\n\none  to anticipate Ratzlaf and  we are fully sympathetic with\r                                      \r\n\nits aims.   But those  aims were  to screen  out persons  who\r\n\nstructured  transactions to  disguise  amounts in  situations\r\n\nwhere the actor might reasonably have no idea that the course\r\n\nof conduct was unlawful.  See Ratzlaf, 114  S.

This\r\n\nis not countered, as  their brief suggests, by the  fact that\r\n\nthey generally gave their  names and identifying  information\r\n\nwhen  requested by  banks: couriers  in their  position could\r\n\nreasonably think  that an  individual deposit  standing alone\r\n\nwould not appear irregular, while remaining aware that anyone\r\n\nwith a full knowledge of their activities would condemn them.\r\n\n     Ratzlaf dealt  with an abstract jury  instruction in yes\r                        \r\n\nor no terms; and in  its wake, courts and juries must  try to\r\n\nanswer  more concrete questions of how much is enough.  Where\r\n\na defendant's  structuring is genuinely innocent  of criminal\r\n\nintent, we think  that under Ratzlaf a  judgment of acquittal\r                                                \r\n\nis proper  no  matter  how  unattractive the  context.

But where the context is itself\r                  \r\n\nsaturated with  consciousness of illegality, we  do not think\r\n\nthat  Ratzlaf requires the jury to ignore it in assessing the\r                         \r\n\ndefendant's state of mind.\r\n\n               IV.

The\r\n\ngovernment  turned over  the bulk  of its  discovery  in late\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                         -35-\r\r\n\nJuly.     In  September,  her  counsel   requested  a  60-day\r\n\ncontinuance,  he was instead  granted 30 days,  and trial was\r\n\nset to begin on November 2.\r\n\n     Ten days before  trial Donna Saccoccia's  attorney asked\r\n\nfor  another continuance, which was denied.  As a result, her\r\n\nteam of lawyers had  just over 100 days after  arraignment to\r\n\nprepare  for  her  trial.   Pointing  to  the  length of  the\r\n\ngovernment  investigation,  the  number  of charges  and  the\r\n\nquantity of  evidence (over  1600 hours of  surveillance tape\r\n\nand  10,000 pages  of  financial documents),  Donna Saccoccia\r\n\nclaims  that  the  denial   of  the  second  continuance  was\r\n\nprejudicial error.\r\n\n     Although the government  asserts that Donna  Saccoccia's\r\n\ncounsel  were   able  to   prepare  during   the  extradition\r\n\nproceedings, this is at  least open to dispute.   Still, many\r\n\nof the issues were common to  all of the defendants, so  that\r\n\nDonna Saccoccia benefited from the work of her co-defendants'\r\n\ncounsel,  who  had  eight  months  to  prepare,  examine  the\r\n\ngovernment's  tapes and  documents,  search  for  exculpatory\r\n\nevidence and  do  research.    Although  a  few  issues  were\r\n\npeculiar to Donna Saccoccia, the common issues bulked large.\r\n\n     Given the broad discretion  enjoyed by trial judges, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

Midway  through the\r\n\ntrial he moved  for a  severance on the  ground that  Anthony\r\n\nDeMarco, his  brother and co-defendant, would  testify on his\r\n\nbehalf in a separate  trial.  Carlo offered the  affidavit of\r\n\nhis counsel that Anthony would testify (along with a few less\r\n\nimportant facts)  that Carlo  \"was not  to  be told  anything\r\n\nexcept that he was  working for a gold dealer.\"  The district\r\n\ncourt held that the motion was untimely and without merit.\r\n\n     In  United States v.

It is doubtful that\r\n\nthe affidavit  from counsel satisfied this  requirement.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v.

Many of  the participants  were\r\n\nrelated by  blood  or marriage,  and incriminating  exchanges\r\n\nwere often  interspersed with  personal conversation.   It is\r\n\nhard to see how the  agents could have done more than  make a\r\n\ngood-faith determination to turn off recording devices when a\r\n\nconversation   was  seemingly  unrelated  to  the  laundering\r\n\noperation.\r\n\n     Here,  as in United States  v.

Here, Hurley's  transportation\r\n\nof the money from New York to Rhode Island was a central part\r\n\nof the ongoing laundering operation.  The particular trip was\r\n\nnot only interstate travel but also comprised--\"thereafter\"--\r\n\nthe delivery of  funds for laundering.

The  defense then  retained  a  clinical\r\n\npsychologist who  examined Donna Saccoccia and concluded that\r\n\nshe  was mentally  incompetent  and had  been throughout  the\r\n\ntrial.  \r\n\n     Two days before sentencing, trial counsel filed a motion\r\n\nseeking a  competency hearing, which is  required where there\r\n\nis  \"reasonable  cause\"  to   believe  that  a  defendant  is\r\n\n\"mentally  incompetent to  the extent  that he  is  unable to\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                         -42-\r\r\n\nunderstand  the  nature and  consequences of  the proceedings\r\n\nagainst him or to assist properly in his defense.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n   4241(a).

The district court  found that a  full-scale\r\n\ncompetency hearing  was not required and  Donna Saccoccia now\r\n\nappeals that decision.  \r\n\n     This is a close issue.  The fact that a reputable expert\r\n\ngives  his opinion does not resolve the matter, even if there\r\n\nis  no countervailing expert evidence on the other side.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nFigueroa-Vazquez  v. United  States, 718  F.2d 511,  512 (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1983).   But here  the expert  appears to  have made  a\r\n\nsubstantial  examination and  his concerns--although  not his\r\n\nspecific  conclusions--have  a  degree  of  support in  trial\r\n\ncounsel's  comment  at  the  arraignment  and  the   concerns\r\n\nexpressed in  the presentence  report.  For  obvious reasons,\r\n\ncompetency  claims  are  not   subject  to  ordinary   waiver\r\n\ndoctrine.  Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 384 (1966).\r                                       \r\n\n     On the other  hand, the focus of  the incompetency claim\r\n\nin this  case is upon Donna Saccoccia's  ability or inability\r\n\nto assist in her defense.  The trial judge had some basis for\r\n\ndoubting whether  the psychologist understood  the issues  in\r\n\nthe  case  well  enough to  make  a  judgment,  but far  more\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                         -43-\r\r\n\nimportant is the  silence of  defense counsel  on this  point\r\n\nduring  the trial.  An  experienced trial lawyer  ought to be\r\n\nthe  first  to notice  a lack  of  cooperation or  ability to\r\n\nassist so severe as to raise competency questions.  There was\r\n\nno complaint  from trial counsel  until after trial  when the\r\n\npresentence  report  reawakened  counsel's  interest  in  the\r\n\nmatter.\r\n\n     Neither  at  the preliminary  competency hearing  nor on\r\n\nappeal  has counsel  been  able  to  point  to  any  specific\r\n\nproblems  with Donna  Saccoccia's  assistance  during  trial.\r\n\nThis  is not  a conclusive  objection  since (in  theory) the\r\n\nimpairment  might  prevent  counsel  from  ever  learning  of\r\n\ninformation  helpful  to  the defense;  but  the  generalized\r\n\ncharacter  of the  claim  weakens its  force.   The  district\r\n\njudge,  who  presided  over  the trial  and  the  preliminary\r\n\nhearing,  is entitled to some  latitude in making judgment on\r\n\nthe need for a full-scale competency hearing.   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

U.S.S.G.\r\n\n                             -44-\r                                         -44-\r\r\n\n  2E1.1.   The money  laundering guideline in  effect at  the\r\n\ntime of sentencing increased a defendant's base offense level\r\n\nfor money laundering  by three levels if  the defendant \"knew\r\n\nor  believed\" that  the laundered money  was the  proceeds of\r\n\nnarcotics sales.   Id.   2S1.1(b)(1).   That provision became\r                                  \r\n\neffective  on  November  1, 1991;  previously,  the  increase\r\n\napplied only if the defendant \"knew\" that the money came from\r\n\nnarcotics.  \r\n\n     In  a claim  not  raised at  sentencing, appellants  now\r\n\nargue that the district  court erred by applying the  new and\r\n\nbroader guideline,  because (they say) the  last actual money\r\n\nlaundering  offense occurred  in  April 1991  before the  new\r\n\nguideline  took effect.   See United  States v.  Cousens, 942\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 800, 801 n.1  (1st Cir. 1991).  The  government responds\r\n\nthat  the RICO  conspiracy  itself continued  at least  until\r\n\nNovember 1991, asserting that no ex post facto problem exists\r                                                          \r\n\nwhere the crime continues  after the effective date of  a new\r\n\nguideline sentence.  E.g.,  United States v. David, 940  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n722,  739  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 502  U.S.  989 (1991).\r                                                 \r\n\nDavid can arguably  be distinguished, but the issue  need not\r                 \r\n\nbe decided here.  \r\n\n     The  new guideline  language was  intended to  apply the\r\n\nenhancement to  cases in which  a defendant \"knew\"  that drug\r\n\ntrafficking was involved, but the knowledge turned out  to be\r\n\nmistaken because (for example) the operation was a government\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                         -45-\r\r\n\nsting and no real narcotics were involved.  See U.S.S.G. app.\r                                                           \r\n\nC, amend.  378 (1994).    Here, the  money  was in  fact  the\r\n\nproceeds  of narcotics  trafficking  so belief  and knowledge\r\n\nwere the same  thing.   A defendant who  merely believed  the\r\n\ndrug proceeds were involved would (because of the correctness\r\n\nof that belief) also know that drug proceeds were involved.  \r\n\n     Appellants    contend    that    the   district    court\r\n\nmisinterpreted  the phrase  \"knew  or believed\"  to allow  an\r\n\nincrease based on a  showing that appellants merely suspected\r\n\nor should have known  that drug money was involved.   We have\r\n\nexamined  the transcript  of the  sentencing and  reject this\r\n\nconjecture.   In some cases,  an appellant was  shown to have\r\n\ndirect knowledge, and in  others, knowledge was inferred from\r\n\ncircumstances; but in each  case a fair reading of  the trial\r\n\ncourt's  remarks  show that  the  judge  determined that  the\r\n\nappellant knew the source of the laundered funds.  \r\n\n     Pizzo and James Saccoccio assert that even  if the court\r\n\ndid  not  misunderstand   the  standard,  the   evidence  was\r\n\ninadequate to show  that they knew  that the laundered  money\r\n\nwas  the proceeds of narcotic sales.  As explained earlier in\r\n\nthe opinion, the evidence on this point was sufficient.  Even\r\n\napart  from Pizzo's  disputed  reference to  \"the coke,\"  the\r\n\nvolume of funds, the duration, the geographic source, the use\r\n\nof  small  bills and  other  circumstances  made it  entirely\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r\n\nreasonable  to  infer   that  direct   participants  in   the\r\n\nenterprise knew that the funds were derived from drugs.  \r\n\n                 B.  Other Sentencing Errors\r                             B.  Other Sentencing Errors\r                                                        \r\n\n     The offense level for money laundering offenses is keyed\r\n\nto the value of the laundered funds.  U.S.S.G.   2S1.1(b)(2).\r\n\nAppellants contend  that in  various respects  the sentencing\r\n\ncourt  erred in  determining the  value of  the funds  and in\r\n\ndetermining the varying amounts that it found each individual\r\n\nappellant    reasonably   had    foreseen.       U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  These are largely factual issues, reviewable\r\n\nonly for clear error.  United States v. LaCroix, 28 F.3d 223,\r                                                           \r\n\n231  (1st Cir. 1994).  We  have examined each of these claims\r\n\nof  error and  think that the  district court's  findings are\r\n\nsupportable,  and  that  none   involves  any  issue  of  law\r\n\nrequiring discussion.\r\n\n     Something  closer to an issue of law is presented by the\r\n\ndistrict   court's  determination  that   Carlo  DeMarco  was\r\n\nentitled  to a  two-level  reduction as  a minor  participant\r\n\nrather  than   to  the  four-level  decrease   as  a  minimal\r\n\nparticipant.  See U.S.S.G.   3B1.2.  The issue arises because\r                             \r\n\nDeMarco  participated  for only  a  few  months in  the  RICO\r\n\nconspiracy and was held responsible for only $3.9 million  of\r\n\nthe  $136 million conspiracy.  But  as to that segment of the\r\n\nconspiracy,  the  court found  that  the  range of  DeMarco's\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                         -47-\r\r\n\nactivities   made  him   a  minor   rather  than   a  minimal\r\n\nparticipant.\r\n\n     On appeal  DeMarco argues that  he was entitled  to have\r\n\nhis role determined in  light of the entire conspiracy.   The\r\n\ngovernment  argues  that his  role  should  be measured  only\r\n\nagainst the  foreseeable conduct for  which he has  been held\r\n\nresponsible.   No  case law  discussing this  issue  has been\r\n\ncited.  But we think that common sense permitted the district\r\n\njudge  to  determine  that  DeMarco--who  participated  quite\r\n\nactively in several roles  over a significant period  and was\r\n\ninvolved with a substantial  amount of laundered funds--was a\r\n\nminor and not a minimal participant.\r\n\n                    VI.  FORFEITURE ISSUES\r                                VI.  FORFEITURE ISSUES\r\n\n     Between January  1990 and April 1991,  Stephen and Donna\r\n\nSaccoccia  wired  $136,344,231.86  to foreign  bank  accounts\r\n\napparently controlled  by Colombian  drug suppliers.   In the\r\n\nindictment,  the  government  took  the  position  that  each\r\n\nappellant was  jointly and  severally liable for  this amount\r\n\nunder one of RICO's  several forfeiture provisions, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1963(a)(3).    This  subsection  requires  a  defendant  to\r\n\nforfeit  \"any property  constituting,  or  derived from,  any\r\n\nproceeds which the  person obtained, directly or  indirectly,\r\n\nfrom racketeering activity . . . .\"  Id.  By special verdict,\r                                                    \r\n\nthe  jury imposed such a forfeiture in this amount on Hurley,\r\n\n                             -48-\r                                         -48-\r\r\n\nthe other appellants having waived a jury trial on forfeiture\r\n\nissues.4  \r\n\n     The district  court imposed separate  forfeitures on the\r\n\nother appellants.   United States v.  Saccoccia, 823 F.  Supp\r                                                           \r\n\n994  (D.R.I.  1993).   The  court  held that  proceeds  under\r\n\nsection 1963(a)(3)  included laundered  funds obtained  by an\r\n\nappellant even  though later passed along  to the Colombians,\r\n\nand that each appellant was responsible for funds foreseeably\r\n\nobtained  by other  co-conspirators.   The  court found  that\r\n\nHurley, Stephen and Donna Saccoccia, and Anthony DeMarco were\r\n\naware of most or all aspects of the conspiracy and liable for\r\n\nthe  full amount;  that the  Saccoccio brothers,  Cirella and\r\n\nPizzo  were aware  mainly of the  Rhode Island  operation and\r\n\ntherefore  liable  only  for  the   $37,456,100.79  laundered\r\n\nthrough  Trend and  Saccoccia Coin;  and that  Carlo DeMarco,\r\n\nactive  only   from   August  through   November  1991,   was\r\n\nresponsible  for  $3,927,357.55  that  he  had  deposited  or\r\n\notherwise known about.\r\n\n     After appellants filed notices of appeal, the government\r\n\nfiled a  motion seeking  forfeiture of substitute  assets, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    982(b), 1963(m); following various proceedings, the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     4The jury  also imposed a separate  forfeiture on Hurley\r\nof $52,800  under the money laundering provision, 18 U.S.C.  \r\n982, in connection with a  reporting violation.  Neither this\r\nnor  other section  982  forfeitures imposed  on three  other\r\nappellants  by the  district  judge have  been challenged  on\r\nappeal except  on grounds identical to  those discussed below\r\nin connection with the RICO forfeitures.\r\n\n                             -49-\r                                         -49-\r\r\n\ndistrict court ultimately  determined that  because the  $136\r\n\nmillion had  been transferred  out of the  jurisdiction, each\r\n\nappellant  was liable to pay  the amounts in  question out of\r\n\nany  other assets  of  that  appellant.   Both  the  original\r\n\nforfeiture orders  and their  extension to substitute  assets\r\n\nare the subject of a number of attacks in this case.\r\n\n                A.  \"Proceeds . . . Obtained\"\r                            A.  \"Proceeds . . . Obtained\"\r\n\n     The opening  question is whether the  $136 million wired\r\n\nto the  Colombians constituted, at least as to the appellants\r\n\nwho handled or controlled these funds before they were wired,\r\n\n\"any property  constituting, or  derived  from, any  proceeds\r\n\nwhich  the person  obtained,  directly  or  indirectly,  from\r\n\nracketeering activity .  . . in  violation of section  1962.\"\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    1963(a)(3).   Appellants argue  that \"proceeds\"\r\n\nmeans net  profits, see United  States v.  Masters, 924  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n1362, 1369-70 (7th Cir.) (semble), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 919\r                                                           \r\n\n(1991), in which case $136 million vastly overstates the 5 to\r\n\n15 percent commission  apparently retained by  the Saccoccias\r\n\nand the  (presumably smaller)  amounts passed along  to other\r\n\nappellants.   Alternatively, appellants contend that  none of\r\n\nthe $137  million could fairly  be regarded as  \"obtained\" by\r\n\nthem  since  it   represents  amounts   transmitted  by   the\r\n\nSaccoccias to the drug owners themselves.\r\n\n     Section 1963(a)(3)  was added by Congress  to other RICO\r\n\nforfeiture  provisions in  1984, and its  legislative history\r\n\n                             -50-\r                                         -50-\r\r\n\nexplains without qualification that \"the  term `proceeds' has\r\n\nbeen used in lieu of the term `profits' in order to alleviate\r\n\nthe  unreasonable burden  on  the government  of proving  net\r\n\nprofits.\"  S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.  199 (1984).\r\n\nIn Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16 (1983), the Supreme\r                                        \r\n\nCourt made clear its desire for generous construction  of the\r\n\nRICO forfeiture  provisions, in  line with  Congress' unusual\r\n\ncommand that  RICO (although  a criminal statute)  be broadly\r\n\ninterpreted.  See id.  at 27.  Given the  legislative history\r                                 \r\n\nand Russello,  the broader definition of  \"proceeds\" seems to\r                        \r\n\nus a rather easy call.\r\n\n     The  point  is  borne  out  by  imagining  that  Stephen\r\n\nSaccoccia  had been caught with  the $136 million  in cash or\r\n\ngold just before delivering  it to the Colombians.   The cash\r\n\nor gold  could surely  be described as  property representing\r\n\n\"proceeds\"   which  Stephen  Saccoccia  had  \"obtained\"  from\r\n\nracketeering activity  in violation of  section 1962, namely,\r\n\nthrough  money laundering.  As  a matter of  policy, there is\r\n\nevery  reason why  the booty  in that  situation ought  to be\r\n\nforfeit, and that Congress  would desire such a result.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Lizza Indus., Inc., 775 F.2d 492, 497-99 (2d\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1082 (1986).\r                                    \r\n\n     The  more difficult question  is whether property should\r\n\nbe  regarded as \"obtained\" by the money launderer when it has\r\n\nmerely been held in  custody by that individual and  has been\r\n\n                             -51-\r                                         -51-\r\r\n\npassed along to its true owner.  To read  \"obtained\" to cover\r\n\nproperty  once held by a  defendant on behalf  of another has\r\n\nthe   effect--when  combined   with  the   substitute  assets\r\n\nprovision--of converting  the forfeiture into a  fine.  Thus,\r\n\nat  first, the  temptation  is to  read  the word  \"obtained\"\r\n\nnarrowly, having  in mind the  low level  courier who  merely\r\n\ntransports the money and could face death if any of the funds\r\n\nwere diverted.\r\n\n     Yet,  on  reflection,  it is  only  in  degree  that the\r\n\ncourier who gets a very small cut differs from intermediaries\r\n\nwho get  a larger one, and  from the leader of  the drug ring\r\n\nwho is effectively paying much of the money back to suppliers\r\n\nand  servitors  of  various   kinds.    Looking  at  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture under RICO  as a kind of shadow fine,  the size of\r\n\nthe amount transported is some measure of the  potential harm\r\n\nfrom  the  transaction.    And  since  temporary  custody  is\r\n\ncertainly  enough for a possession charge in a drug case, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Zavala Maldanado, 23 F.3d 4, 6-8 (1st Cir.),\r                                             \r\n\ncert. denied,  115 S. Ct. 451  (1994), it is hard  to see why\r                        \r\n\n\"obtained\" should be read more narrowly.\r\n\n     Finally, it is  very hard to escape  the implications of\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   982(b)(2).  There, Congress has expressly  carved\r\n\nout a narrow safe harbor, which protects against forfeiture a\r\n\ndefendant who  \"acted merely  as an intermediary  who handled\r\n\nbut  did  not  retain  the  property\"  unless  the  defendant\r\n\n                             -52-\r                                         -52-\r\r\n\nconducted  three  or more  separate transactions  involving a\r\n\ntotal of $100,000  or more  in a twelve-month  period.   This\r\n\nprovision  indicates  that  Congress  itself  thought  that a\r\n\nseparate statute  was necessary  for a \"passing  on\" defense.\r\n\nThere is no counterpart safe harbor provision in RICO nor, in\r\n\nview of the amounts involved, could such a provision help any\r\n\nappellants in this case.\r\n\n                   B.  Vicarious Liability\r                               B.  Vicarious Liability\r                                                      \r\n\n     The question remains whether a defendant's forfeiture is\r\n\nlimited  to the  laundered funds  that the  defendant himself\r\n\nobtained or  whether it  extends to funds  obtained by  other\r\n\nmembers  of the  conspiracy.   The  district  court took  the\r\n\nlatter position with one  important qualification:  laundered\r\n\nfunds obtained  by other members  of the conspiracy  would be\r\n\nattributed  only  to the  extent  that  they were  reasonably\r\n\nforeseeable to  the particular defendant.   Saccoccia, 823 F.\r                                                                 \r\n\nSupp. at 1004.  This is a sensible resolution of a very close\r\n\nissue, and we follow the district court's lead.  \r\n\n     The arguments  for limiting  forfeiture solely to  funds\r\n\npersonally obtained  by an individual defendant  are several.\r\n\nThe  statutory  language  speaks  of  a  violator  forfeiting\r\n\n\"proceeds  which  the person  obtained\" by  violating section\r                                        \r\n\n1962.  18 U.S.C.   1963(a)(3) (emphasis added).  In addition,\r\n\nthe  plight  of  a  defendant  who  was  merely  a  temporary\r\n\ncustodian of cash and passed it  on is even starker than that\r\n\n                             -53-\r                                         -53-\r\r\n\nof a person who never possessed the cash at all.  Thus, there\r\n\nis a  respectable basis for holding  that vicarious liability\r\n\nfor  co-conspirator behavior  does  not exist  under  section\r\n\n1963.  \r\n\n     The  arguments  pointing  the   other  way  seem  to  us\r\n\nstronger.     Under  established  case  law,   members  of  a\r\n\nconspiracy  are  substantively  liable  for  the  foreseeable\r\n\ncriminal  conduct of  the  other members  of the  conspiracy.\r\n\nPinkerton v. United States,  328 U.S. 640 (1946).   Using the\r                                      \r\n\nsame  concept,  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  attribute  to  a\r\n\ndefendant  at  sentencing  the  foreseeable  conduct  of  co-\r\n\nconspirators.  U.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  It  would be odd,\r\n\nalthough  not impossible,  to depart  from this  principle of\r\n\nattributed  conduct when  it  comes to  apply the  forfeiture\r\n\nrules, which  have aspects both of  substantive liability and\r\n\nof penalty.  \r\n\n     It  is  largely  fortuitous  whether  an  individual co-\r\n\nconspirator  happened to  possess  the laundered  funds at  a\r\n\nparticular point.   If conclusive  weight were  given to  who\r\n\nphysically handled  the money,  a low-level courier  or money\r\n\ncounter could  be liable  for vast  sums, while  other higher\r\n\nlevel conspirators could  easily escape  responsibility.   So\r\n\nlong  as the amount handled by  others is foreseeable as to a\r\n\ndefendant,  the  foreseeable  amount represents  the  sounder\r\n\nmeasure of liability.\r\n\n                             -54-\r                                         -54-\r\r\n\n     Finally,  we have to give  some weight to  the fact that\r\n\neach  court  of appeals  that  has  addressed  the topic  has\r\n\nconcluded that  the forfeiture provisions  involve joint  and\r\n\nseveral  liability.   E.g.,  Masters,  924  F.2d at  1369-70;\r                                                \r\n\nFleischhauer v.

This is a somewhat backward way\r                  \r\n\nof  putting the  matter,  since \"joint  and several\"  roughly\r\n\ndescribes the result without explaining the underlying theory\r\n\nof liability.  Here, we think the theory is the familiar rule\r\n\nthat  a  member  of  a  conspiracy  is  responsible  for  the\r\n\nforeseeable acts of other members  of the conspiracy taken in\r\n\nfurtherance  of the conspiracy.  Pinkerton,  328 U.S. at 646-\r                                                      \r\n\n47; U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1)(B).\r\n\n     Appellants   appear  to   think  that   their  vicarious\r\n\nliability for  amounts they did not physically touch rests on\r\n\nthe assumption  that the Colombian drug  lords who ultimately\r\n\n\"obtained\" $136 million were  members of the same conspiracy.\r\n\nOn this premise, appellants advance  a number of arguments as\r\n\nto  why  such  a conspiracy  cannot  be  made  out under  the\r\n\nindictment or evidence  in this  case.  The  short answer  is\r\n\nthat  the  premise  is  mistaken;  individual  appellants are\r\n\nliable  because  their  convicted   American  co-conspirators\r\n\n                             -55-\r                                         -55-\r\r\n\nobtained the funds, regardless of the  status assigned to the\r\n\nColombians.\r\n\n     Nor  do  we  see  any  basis  for  the  claim  that  the\r\n\nforfeiture violates  the  \"excessive  fines\"  clause  of  the\r\n\nEighth Amendment.   Although  the provision is  applicable to\r\n\nforfeitures, see Alexander v. United States, 113 S.  Ct. 2766\r                                                       \r\n\n(1993), holding  a defendant  liable for  an amount of  money\r\n\nforeseeably laundered by himself and  his own co-conspirators\r\n\nis  quite  rational  based  on  a  proportionality  analysis.\r\n\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991).  In this case none\r                                \r\n\nof the appellants was  separately fined, so we can  leave for\r\n\nanother day forfeitures imposed on top of separate fines.\r\n\n     We appreciate the fact that a formidable penalty can  be\r\n\ninflicted  when  one  disallows  a  passing-on  defense  then\r\n\nimposes vicarious  liability for the foreseeable  acts of co-\r\n\nconspirators.   The government  can collect its  $136 million\r\n\nonly once but, subject  to that cap, it can collect  from any\r\n\nappellant so much of  that amount as was foreseeable  to that\r\n\nappellant.  But there  is no reason to think that this result\r\n\nis  unattractive   to  Congress,  which  requested   a  broad\r\n\nconstruction of RICO, or to the Supreme Court, which followed\r\n\nthis policy in Russello.\r                                   \r\n\n                    C.

In this case,\r\n\nthe  original  jury  verdicts  contain   a  determination  of\r\n\nforfeiture only as to Hurley; forfeiture findings against the\r\n\nother appellants were made  thereafter by the district court,\r\n\nas earlier described.  \r\n\n     Appellants   filed   notices   of  appeal   from   their\r\n\nconvictions in  May and  June 1993.   On July  16, 1993,  the\r\n\ngovernment  moved   in  the  district  court   to  amend  the\r\n\nforfeiture provisions of  its judgments  to substitute  other\r\n\nproperty of the  appellants for the $137 million in laundered\r\n\nfunds.  After a hearing, the court granted these motions.  On\r\n\nappeal, appellants  argue  that  the  district  court  lacked\r\n\njurisdiction  to  enter  those  orders  because  appeals  had\r\n\nalready been taken.\r\n\n     This  claim rests on the \"general rule\" that \"entry of a\r\n\nnotice of  appeal divests the district  court of jurisdiction\r\n\nto adjudicate  any matters  related to  the appeal.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

But the\r                              \r\n\nrule is not absolute, for even  after the appeal is filed the\r\n\n                             -57-\r                                         -57-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court  retains  authority  to  decide  matters  not\r\n\ninconsistent  with the pendency of the appeal.  See Spound v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMohasco  Indus., Inc.  534  F.2d 404,  411  (1st Cir.)  cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,  429  U.S. 886  (1976).   A  district court  may, for\r                  \r\n\nexample, determine  attorneys' fees after an  appeal has been\r\n\ntaken or act in aid of  execution of a judgment that has been\r\n\nappealed but not  stayed.   See In re  Nineteen Appeals,  982\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 603, 609 n.10 (1st  Cir. 1992); International Paper  Co.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Whitson, 595 F.2d 559, 561-62 (10th Cir.  1979).  We think\r                      \r\n\nthat  the  substitution  of  assets orders  fit  within  this\r\n\ngeneral category.\r\n\n     Criminal forfeiture orders are  something of a  mongrel.\r\n\nThe  initial  forfeiture is  sought  in  the indictment  and,\r\n\nabsent  a  waiver of  jury trial,  is  specified in  the jury\r\n\nverdict.   See Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  7(c)(2); 31(e).   But  the\r                          \r\n\nstatute  says that an order substituting assets is to be made\r\n\nby \"the court.\"   18 U.S.C.    1963(m).   The implication  is\r\n\nthat  such an order may commonly be entered after the initial\r\n\nforfeiture has been determined.  Indeed, the government might\r\n\nnot even know  that substitution is necessary until  it seeks\r\n\nto take possession  of the property specified  in the initial\r\n\nforfeiture order. \r\n\n     Under  these circumstances,  we  see no  reason why  the\r\n\ntaking  of the  appeal  should divest  the district  court of\r\n\nauthority to enter  an order forfeiting  substitute property.\r\n\n                             -58-\r                                         -58-\r\r\n\nAppellants do not provide any reason to think that this would\r\n\ninterfere   with,  or  contradict,   the  court  of  appeals'\r\n\nconsideration of  the original  judgment of a  conviction and\r\n\nsentence, including the  initial forfeiture order.   Avoiding\r\n\nsuch  interference and  inconsistency is  the purpose  of the\r\n\ngeneral rule  barring district  court proceedings  during the\r\n\npendency of an appeal.  Venen v. Sweet, 758 F.2d 117, 121 (3d\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1985).  There  is no reason to  extend this ban  further\r\n\nthan its own rationale.  \r\n\n     Of  course,  the  substitute  assets order,  if  one  is\r\n\neventually  made, may give rise to new issues for appeal, but\r                                                  \r\n\na  new  appeal  can  be   taken  directly  from  this  order.\r\n\nSimilarly, a decision  of the appeals  court on the  original\r\n\nconviction could undermine the substitute assets order (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nby  overturning  the   conviction  itself   or  the   initial\r\n\nforfeiture), but a substitute assets order can then be undone\r\n\nor overturned.  After all, determination of counsel fees in a\r\n\nsection 1983 case presents  the same problem and is  resolved\r\n\nin  precisely  this  manner.   See,  e.g.,  Casa Marie  Hogar\r                                                                         \r\n\nGeriatrico,  Inc. v.

The fact  that the  substitute assets\r\n\norder  may  be  entered  at  some  time  after  the  original\r\n\nconviction does  not make it  a second prosecution,  any more\r\n\nthan  sentencing  after conviction  is a  second prosecution.\r\n\nThe substitution order is  entered in the original proceeding\r\n\nas  one of  a number  of steps,  primarily relating  to post-\r\n\nconviction sanctions,  that are  known to the  defendant from\r\n\nthe outset.\r\n\n     As   for  the   claim   of   multiple  punishment,   the\r\n\nConstitution  does not  prevent  multiple  sanctions for  one\r\n\noffense  where  the sanctions  are  specified  in advance  by\r\n\nCongress   and  imposed  in   reasonable  proximity   to  the\r\n\nconviction:   a  fine  and imprisonment  is a  common federal\r                                      \r\n\nsentence.

CONCLUSION\r\n\n     A number  of the remaining arguments  made by appellants\r\n\nhave  been addressed by  the court in  the decision affirming\r\n\nStephen Saccoccia's  conviction  and need  not  be  discussed\r\n\nagain.  These  include attacks on  certain references to  the\r\n\nColombians,  on  the  admission  of dog  sniff  evidence,  on\r\n\ntestimony by  Agent Shedd,  and on  tape excerpts  claimed to\r\n\nrefer  to   cocaine  and   drug  money.     Similarly,  Donna\r\n\nSaccoccia's claims relating to extradition, to the extent not\r\n\nwaived,  are in  substance covered  by the  earlier opinion's\r\n\ndiscussion   of   Stephen  Saccoccia's   counterpart  claims.\r\n\nSeveral  additional  arguments  (e.g.,   Kenneth  Saccoccio's\r                                                 \r\n\n\"theory of the defense\" instruction) have been considered but\r\n\ndeemed not to require separate treatment.\r\n\n     The  charges  in this  case  involved  a  web of  multi-\r\n\nparagraph statutes  with intricate  provisions that  the jury\r\n\nhad  to  apply to  numerous  transactions  involving multiple\r\n\ndefendants and occurring over  a considerable period of time.\r\n\nIn these  circumstances, we have  reviewed appellants' claims\r\n\nnot only as individually  presented, but also with an  eye to\r\n\n                             -61-\r                                         -61-\r\r\n\nmaking  certain  that no  innocent  person  has been  wrongly\r\n\nenmeshed  in criminal  proceedings.   We  are satisfied  that\r\n\nwhile several  debatable issues  have been raised  on appeal,\r\n\nthere was no prejudicial error and that the verdict  returned\r\n\nby the jury was a just one.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -62-\r                                         -62-\r\r\n",

BACKGROUND\r                                    I. BACKGROUND\r\n\n     The  eight  appellants  are  Donna  Saccoccia  (wife  of\r\n\nStephen), her brother Vincent Hurley, James Saccoccio and his\r\n\nbrother  Kenneth  Saccoccio,  Carlo DeMarco  and  his brother\r\n\nAnthony DeMarco,  Stanley Cirella  and Stephen Pizzo.   Along\r\n\nwith Stephen  Saccoccia and others, appellants  were indicted\r\n\non November  18, 1991, and  were charged  with conspiracy  to\r\n\nviolate  the Racketeer  Influenced and  Corrupt Organizations\r\n\nAct (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C.   1962(d).  Certain of them were also\r\n\ncharged with  substantive  counts  of  money  laundering,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.     1956-57, currency reporting offenses,  31 U.S.C.  \r\n\n5324, and interstate travel in aid of racketeering, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1952.\r\n\n     One  conspirator  originally charged,  David  Izzi, pled\r\n\nguilty  before  trial  and  testified  for   the  government.\r\n\nStephen Saccoccia was severed and tried separately due to the\r\n\nillness  of  his  counsel.    Alfred  Gabriele,  added  as  a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nconspirator  in  a  superseding  indictment, was  also  tried\r\n\nseparately, and his  appeal is still pending.   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Gabriele, No. 94-1215 (1st Cir.).  The end result was that\r                       \r\n\nthe  eight appellants in this case were tried together in the\r\n\ndistrict court in Rhode  Island.  Trial began on  November 6,\r\n\n1992, and ended in a jury verdict on December 18, 1992.\r\n\n     At  trial, the government's evidence consisted primarily\r\n\nof  the   testimony  of  other  participants   in  the  money\r\n\nlaundering activities, of Colombian nationals involved in the\r\n\ninternational  drug  trade,  and  of  bank  employees.    The\r\n\ngovernment   also   offered   bank   records   of   financial\r\n\ntransactions and numerous  court-ordered wiretap  recordings.\r\n\nViewed in the  light most favorable  to the verdicts,  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Valerio,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195933\"><a href=\"/opinion/195933/united-states-v-valerio/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  63  (1st Cir.  1995),  the\r                              \r\n\nevidence permitted a reasonable jury to find the following.\r\n\n     Stephen  Saccoccia  owned  and  controlled  a number  of\r\n\nprecious metals businesses, including Saccoccia  Coin Company\r\n\nin  Cranston, Rhode Island (\"Saccoccia Coin\"); Trend Precious\r\n\nMetals in Cranston and  in New York, New York  (\"Trend\"); and\r\n\nInternational  Metal  Marketing  (\"International Metal\")  and\r\n\nClinton  Import/Export in  Los Angeles,  California (\"Clinton\r\n\nImport/Export\").   In  the  late 1980s,  after some  indirect\r\n\ndealings,  Stephen Saccoccia began  laundering drug money for\r\n\nDuvan Arboleda, a Colombian narcotics dealer.  The laundering\r\n\noperation, ultimately expanded to serve a second drug ring as\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwell,  took  several  forms   but  each  began  with  Stephen\r\n\nSaccoccia  receiving  large  amounts  of cash  in  New  York,\r\n\ngenerated from the  sale of cocaine.   Often, Saccoccia would\r\n\nsend  one of his employees, usually unindicted co-conspirator\r\n\nRichard  Gizzarelli, to  a  prearranged location,  such as  a\r\n\nstreet  corner, to  meet  a customer's  courier.   Gizzarelli\r\n\nwould bring  the cash to the  Trend office in New  York or to\r\n\nSaccoccia's apartment in New York to count it.\r\n\n     The money then followed  two different routes.  Some  of\r\n\nthe  cash would be used to purchase money orders or gold; the\r\n\ngold and some of the remaining  cash would then be shipped to\r\n\nInternational Metal in Los Angeles.  Much of the  rest of the\r\n\ncash--up to  $200,000 per  day--would  be sent  to Trend  and\r\n\nSaccoccia Coin  in Rhode  Island, either through  armored car\r\n\nservice or in the car of a Saccoccia employee.\r\n\n     Once the cash  reached Rhode Island,  it was counted  by\r\n\nSaccoccia employees and divided into  a number of packets  in\r\n\namounts  either greater than or  less than $10,000.   Most of\r\n\nthe cash went  to the  Trend office in  Cranston.   Saccoccia\r\n\nemployees,  directed by Izzi, then drove to local banks where\r\n\nthey purchased cashier's checks  in amounts less than $10,000\r\n\npayable to Trend, or cashier's checks in amounts greater than\r\n\n$10,000 payable to companies nominally  owned by Hurley.  The\r\n\npurpose   of  these   maneuvers--called  \"smurfing\"   in  law\r\n\nenforcement parlance--was to avoid  or minimize the filing of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\naccurate currency transaction reports, which  are required by\r\n\nfederal law for cash deposits in amounts of $10,000 or more.\r\n\n     Ultimately  the  local  Rhode  Island  checks  would  be\r\n\ndeposited in, and  money from the  Hurley accounts wired  to,\r\n\nthe  Trend account  at  Citizens Bank  in  Rhode Island.    A\r\n\nsmaller  portion of  the cash  sent to  Rhode Island  went to\r\n\nSaccoccia  Coin.   That  cash was  used  to buy  gold without\r\n\ndocumentation;  the  gold  was  then   resold  to  legitimate\r\n\ncompanies  in exchange  for checks  recorded as  payments for\r\n\ngold  sales.  Some of the cash  was also used in the ordinary\r\n\noperations of  the Saccoccia Coin Shop,  a heavily cash-based\r\n\nenterprise.\r\n\n     At the  Los Angeles end, the gold  sent to International\r\n\nMetal was sold, and the proceeds were wired back to the Trend\r\n\naccount  at Citizens  Bank.   Cash received  by International\r\n\nMetal was used to  purchase gold covertly, the gold  was then\r\n\nsold,  and the proceeds were also wired to the Trend account.\r\n\nThus,  the bulk of  the cash that  Saccoccia sent out  of New\r\n\nYork eventually ended  up in the  Trend account at  Citizens.\r\n\nCitizens  Bank  closed  the  Trend  account  in  April  1991.\r\n\nThereafter,  cash was  still  transported from  New York  and\r\n\n\"smurf\" employees in  Rhode Island  still obtained  cashier's\r\n\nchecks  from  various banks,  but  the  checks were  sent  to\r\n\nInternational Metal and Clinton Import/Export in Los Angeles.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     Donna Saccoccia assisted her  husband in most aspects of\r\n\nthe  operation, relayed  his instructions  to the  others and\r\n\nwired funds  abroad to Colombian  banks.  Hurley  and Anthony\r\n\nDeMarco  picked  up  cash  from  couriers  in  New  York  and\r\n\ntransported it  to Rhode Island.   Hurley, Anthony  and Carlo\r\n\nDeMarco,  Kenneth  and  James Saccoccio,  Cirella  and  Pizzo\r\n\nreceived  the cash  deliveries in  Rhode Island,  counted the\r\n\nmoney, and separated it into  packets of smaller amounts  for\r\n\ntransport to  local banks.   Anthony  DeMarco  and James  and\r\n\nKenneth Saccoccio bought the bulk of the cashier's checks.\r\n\n     A  staggering  amount   of  money  moved   through  this\r\n\nlaundering operation.  Between March  1, 1990, and August 22,\r\n\n1991, Stephen  or Donna Saccoccia wired over  $136 million to\r\n\nforeign bank  accounts primarily  in Colombia; more  than $97\r\n\nmillion  of this amount was  wired from the  Trend account in\r\n\nCitizens Bank jointly controlled by Donna and Stephen.  Apart\r\n\nfrom the $136 million, substantial sums were  retained by the\r\n\nSaccoccias and their employees as compensation.\r\n\n     All eight  appellants were convicted of RICO conspiracy.\r\n\nAll but Carlo DeMarco and Pizzo were convicted of substantive\r\n\noffenses.     After   post-trial  motions,   appellants  were\r\n\nsentenced in May 1993,  and forfeiture judgments against each\r\n\nappellant  were  entered  pursuant  to  the  RICO  forfeiture\r\n\nstatute, 18  U.S.C.   1963, and in some cases under the money\r\n\nlaundering forfeiture statute.  18 U.S.C.   982.

THE RICO ISSUES\r                                 II.  THE RICO ISSUES\r\n\n     The   RICO  conspiracy  offense  charged  in  this  case\r\n\nrequired the  government to prove an  agreement by appellants\r\n\n\"to conduct  or participate  .  . .  in the  conduct of  [an]\r\n\nenterprise's  affairs  through  a  pattern   of  racketeering\r\n\nactivity\";  and the  pattern  alleged in  this case  required\r\n\nproof of  two or  more criminal acts  by an  appellant (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nmoney laundering or structuring).  See 18  U.S.C.    1961(1),\r                                                  \r\n\n1962(c), (d).  Appellants  here challenge the indictment, the\r\n\ninstructions and the evidence relating to RICO.\r\n\n                    A. The RICO Indictment\r                                A. The RICO Indictment\r                                                      \r\n\n     The RICO conspiracy count  alleged the formal requisites\r\n\nof the  offense including  the assertion that  each appellant\r\n\nagreed to commit  at least two racketeering acts;  but it did\r\n\nnot specify which predicate  acts each appellant committed or\r\n\nagreed  to commit.  Hurley,  Cirella, Pizzo and Carlo DeMarco\r\n\nargue  that  this  lack  of  specificity  is   fatal  to  the\r\n\nindictment  because  a  sufficient  indictment  must  \"fairly\r\n\ninform[ ]  a defendant  of the charge  against which  he must\r\n\ndefend . . . .\"   Hamling v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109084\"><a href=\"/opinion/109084/hamling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  117\r                                                      \r\n\n(1974).\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n     In count I,  the indictment  identified the  enterprise,\r\n\nits  precise method  of operation,  the  role played  by each\r\n\nappellant,  and the nature of the predicate acts charged.  In\r\n\nappended  lists  specifically  referenced  in  count  I,  the\r\n\nindictment  also  set  forth  thousands  of  individual  bank\r\n\ntransactions and  wire transfers.   What was lacking  was any\r\n\nidentification of  the particular  transactions in  which the\r\n\nfour complaining appellants  were involved, since they  acted\r\n\nmainly  as counters  and subdividers  of money  deposited and\r\n\ntransferred by others.\r\n\n     But  if  a defendant  were  charged  with conspiring  to\r\n\ndistribute drugs, it would  surely be enough to show  that he\r\n\nhad acted as a packer in the drug-making \"factory\" during the\r\n\nperiod in which  a series of identified  shipments were made.\r\n\nThe government might  never know  which particular  shipments\r\n\nhad been  packed  by  the defendant;  but  his  agreement  to\r\n\nparticipate  in distributing multiple  shipments could fairly\r\n\nbe inferred.  The same principle applies in this case.  There\r\n\nis, we note,  no indication  that appellants  were misled  or\r\n\nleft  in  ignorance about  what  the  government intended  to\r\n\nprove.\r\n\n     United States v.

But  in  this  case  the\r                                            \r\n\ngovernment's  version  of  the  evidence   placed  appellants\r\n\nsquarely in the  role of  employees of the  enterprise.   The\r\n\njury's verdict shows that  the jury accepted that  version of\r\n\nevents,  making the  alleged  ambiguity  in the  instructions\r\n\nharmless.   To  the  extent that  appellants are  challenging\r\n\nOreto's reading of Reves,  Oreto is the law of  this circuit.\r                                            \r\n\nSee United  States v.

First, they challenge the\r\n\nuse  of a  general  \"willful blindness\"  instruction and  the\r\n\ncourt's refusal  to instruct the jury  that willful blindness\r\n\ndid not apply  to the RICO conspiracy  count.  They say  that\r\n\none cannot simultaneously be  willfully blind to a conspiracy\r\n\nand also intend and agree to join the conspiracy.\r\n\n     The  district judge  first  instructed the  jury on  the\r\n\nsubstantive counts.  He  then gave a detailed  explanation of\r\n\nthe RICO conspiracy count, including the requirement that the\r\n\ngovernment  prove both \"an intent to agree\" and \"an intent to\r\n\ncommit the  substantive offenses that are the  objects of the\r\n\nconspiracy.\"  The  judge told  the jury that  they could  not\r\n\ninfer knowledge of  the conspiracy from negligence,  mistake,\r\n\nor  ignorance; instead, the  defendant must  act \"voluntarily\r\n\nand intentionally.\"   After lengthy instructions  on the RICO\r\n\ncount, the judge moved on to more general propositions.  Only\r\n\nthen did he give the \"willful blindness\" instruction:\r\n\n     In  deciding whether  a Defendant  acted knowingly,\r\n     you may infer that the Defendant had knowledge of a\r\n     fact if  you find  that the  Defendant deliberately\r\n     closed his  eyes  to a  fact that  would have  been\r\n     obvious to him.\r\n\n     The  willful blindness instruction  appears to have been\r\n\naimed at  the \"knowing\" requirements  of substantive  counts.\r\n\nE.g.,  18 U.S.C.   1956  (money laundering).

When this request was made after the charge,\r\n\nit was  entangled with other requests and  the district court\r\n\nmay not  have focused on the  request or may have  thought it\r\n\nhad in substance been given.  Although nothing in the statute\r\n\nexplicitly requires such knowledge, there is  some precedent,\r\n\nincluding  a  comment  from  this  court,  suggesting  it  is\r\n\nappropriate.  See, e.g., Brandon, 17 F.3d at 428; 2 L.  Sand,\r                                            \r\n\nJ.  Siffert,  W. Loughlin  &amp;  S.

The court  instructed that\r\n\nthe  first element  that  the jury  had to  find  was that  a\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nconspiracy existed \"to conduct  or participate in the affairs\r\n\nof an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.\"\r\n\nThe court subsequently told the jury that the government must\r\n\nalso prove  \"that the  defendant knew the  conspiracy existed\r\n\nand knew of its unlawful purpose.\"\r\n\n     Perhaps in theory one might imagine a defendant who knew\r\n\nof  and joined in a  conspiracy to conduct  an enterprise but\r\n\ndid not know  the nature  of the enterprise.   In this  case,\r\n\nhowever,  the government's  evidence  showed that  appellants\r\n\nknowingly engaged  in structuring transactions  on an ongoing\r\n\nbasis  within the  framework of Stephen  Saccoccia's business\r\n\nventure.  Given the  evidence accepted by the jury,  there is\r\n\nno doubt that appellants  knew what they were doing  and knew\r\n\nthey  were doing  it within  the framework  of the  Saccoccia\r\n\norganization.  If  the instruction deviated from  perfection,\r\n\nthe deviation was assuredly harmless.\r\n\n  D.  The RICO Instructions: Single or Multiple Conspiracies\r              D.

These  claims  are  made  by\r\n\nCirella, Pizzo  and James and  Kenneth Saccoccio in  order to\r\n\ndefeat the showing of predicate acts available to the jury to\r\n\nunderpin  their RICO convictions.   Each of the  four says or\r\n\nimplies that he was  unaware of money laundering but  working\r\n\nfor what he understood to be a legitimate business.\r\n\n     The jury was entitled to find that these four appellants\r\n\nknew  that they  were engaged  in unlawful  money laundering.\r\n\nStephen  Saccoccia discussed  with Cirella  and Pizzo,  among\r\n\nothers, how to avoid police  detection; and Pizzo and Cirella\r\n\ndiscussed \"washing .  . .  the money\" and  means of  avoiding\r\n\njail.  James and  Kenneth Saccoccio were involved in  so many\r\n\ndeposits   and  manipulative   subdividings  of   funds  that\r\n\nlaundering was  the only plausible explanation.   Further, in\r\n\none  instance (July  10,  1990), discussing  the division  of\r\n\n$54,000  into  packages  of  $9,000 for  deposit,  James  and\r\n\nKenneth   Saccoccio   conducted   the  following   (recorded)\r\n\nconversation with Izzi:\r\n\n          James:    54, I can't do  that.

Kenneth Saccoccio is an exception since\r\n\nhe was recorded,  while counting cash at  Trend, referring to\r\n\nit  as \"drug  money\";  and in  one  conversation with  Pizzo,\r\n\nCirella  said something  that the  jury might  have  taken as\r\n\nreferring to the  drug origins of the proceeds.   In the case\r\n\nof  James Saccoccio,  the  imputation of  knowledge of  drugs\r\n\nrests  on the vast sums involved in the laundering and James'\r\n\nclose association with Kenneth.\r\n\n     There are plenty of cash-generating businesses but among\r\n\nthose that require the illicit laundering of funds, the  drug\r\n\nbusiness  is notorious  and preeminent.   In  this case,  the\r\n\nevidence showed  that narcotics were  the source of  the cash\r\n\nand  that this fact was  well known to  Stephen Saccoccia and\r\n\nKenneth  Saccoccio, among others.   We think  that a rational\r\n\njury  could  conclude  that James  too  knew  of  the money's\r\n\norigins, either from  the size and  continuing nature of  the\r\n\ndeliveries, or  from  being told  that  the money  came  from\r\n\ndrugs; and Cirella and Pizzo are a fortiori cases.    \r                                                       \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\r\n\n           III.  CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORT ISSUES\r                       III.  CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORT ISSUES\r\n\n     The Bank  Secrecy Act requires domestic  banks to report\r\n\nany  transactions involving  more  than $10,000  in cash,  31\r\n\nU.S.C.    5313; 31 C.F.R.   103.   The statute also prohibits\r\n\ncustomers  from providing  false  information  for  a  bank's\r\n\nreport.    31 U.S.C.    5324(2).1    Further, under  the 1986\r\n\namendments, \"[n]o person shall for the purpose of evading the\r\n\nreporting  requirements of [the Act or its regulations] . . .\r\n\n(3)  structure or assist in structuring . . . any transaction\r\n\nwith one or  more domestic  financial institutions.\"   Id.   \r                                                                      \r\n\n5324.  The most  common method of \"structuring\" is  to divide\r\n\nsums of cash into  amounts that are either under  the $10,000\r\n\nreporting threshold or into amounts that are larger but still\r\n\nless likely to attract attention.\r\n\n     Structuring is a criminal act, 31 U.S.C.    5322(a), and\r\n\na violator is subject to double  the fine and sentence if  he\r\n\nor she structures while violating  another federal law or  as\r\n\npart  of a  pattern of  crime.

The indictment\r\n\ncharged that they, together with James and Kenneth Saccoccio,\r\n\nstructured a set  of six  bank deposits of  $8,000 to  $9,000\r\n\neach in several  different bank accounts on October  2, 1990.\r\n\nThe indictment said:\r\n\n     [T]he    defendants    structured,   assisted    in\r\n     structuring and  attempted to structure  and assist\r\n     in  structuring  the  transaction  by   dividing  a\r\n     quantity of currency in  excess of $10,000 into two\r\n     or more portions  and using those smaller  portions\r\n     to purchase cashiers checks or other instruments in\r\n     amounts under  $10,000  at two  or  more  financial\r\n     institutions on the same day . . . .\r\n\n     The evidence at  trial showed that  on October 2,  1990,\r\n\nIzzi told Hurley and Cirella to give him $35,000 in $10 bills\r\n\nand later in the day to give Kenneth Saccoccio $30,000 in $20\r\n\nbills.   Bank records showed  that after the conversation and\r\n\nlater  that   day   Kenneth   Saccoccio   made   two   $9,000\r\n\ntransactions.  The jury convicted Hurley and Cirella on count\r\n\n67, and on appeal they raise a bevy of arguments.\r\n\n     The first argument is  based on the fact that  the trial\r\n\njudge,   without   objection,   instructed  the   jury   that\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                         -30-\r\r\n\nstructuring can occur either  by dividing a sum  over $10,000\r\n\ninto deposits under  that figure or by dividing  the original\r\n\nsum  into  amounts  that  are over  $10,000  but  reduce  the\r\n\nreportable amount.   Appellants read the  indictment language\r\n\nas limiting  the offense  to the  \"under $10,000\"  theory and\r\n\nargue that  the \"over $10,000\"  theory permitted the  jury to\r\n\nconvict on  a different theory of  the offense, impermissibly\r\n\ncausing  a constructive  amendment of  the indictment.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g.,  United States v.

But  the  \"over\r\n\n$10,000\" instruction was a general one, describing one method\r\n\nof  structuring, and  had nothing  in particular  to  do with\r\n\ncount 67.    Further, the  \"over  $10,000\" theory  fit  those\r\n\ninstances  (involving DeMarco,  Kenneth and  James Saccoccio)\r\n\nwhere  a deposit occurred that was over $10,000 but less than\r\n\nthe  original  sum.   On the  other  hand, the  only deposits\r\n\nalleged in relationship to count 67 were under $10,000. \r\n\n     Thus, reading the instructions in  relation to evidence,\r\n\nwe  think   that  the  jury   had  to  understand   that  the\r\n\ngovernment's case  on count 67  amounted to this:  Hurley and\r\n\nCirella, to facilitate specified unreported deposits of under\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                         -31-\r\r\n\n$10,000 on October 2,  provided larger sums (as  directed) in\r\n\naid of and with the expectation that they would be subdivided\r\n\ninto  amounts  under  $10,000   to  avoid  reports  and  then\r\n\ndeposited,  as in  fact they  were.   The practice  of giving\r\n\ngeneral instructions in multiple count cases, and letting the\r\n\njury sort  out their application  according to the  facts, is\r\n\ncommon and permissible.       Given  this  interpretation  of\r\n\nwhat  happened, we have  no reason to  consider whether there\r\n\nwould  have  been  a  constructive amendment  rather  than  a\r\n\nvariance if the jury  had been instructed to apply  the \"over\r\n\n$10,000\"  theory to  count 67.   See  generally 3  C. Wright,\r                                                           \r\n\nFederal Practice and  Procedure    516, at 26  (2d ed.  1982)\r                                           \r\n\n(describing distinction  as \"shadowy\").  We  do consider, but\r\n\nreject, appellants' claim that the evidence was inadequate to\r\n\nconnect their  delivery of $30,000 to  Kenneth Saccoccio with\r\n\nhis  later deposits of amounts  under $10,000 that  day.  The\r\n\ntiming made the connection a permissible inference.\r\n\n     In a  different attack,  appellants argue that  count 67\r\n\nwas  facially defective  because  it alleged,  but failed  to\r\n\nspecify, the  other federal law concurrently  violated or the\r\n\npattern of illegal activity involving over $100,000 within 12\r\n\nmonths.   This additional allegation was not  needed to prove\r\n\nthe violation but was needed  to trigger the enhanced penalty\r\n\nprovided  by  section 5322(b).

They say  that\r\n\nthere is insufficient evidence  that they knew structuring to\r\n\nbe  illegal,  as Ratzlaf  required, and  that they  were thus\r                                    \r\n\nentitled to judgments  of acquittal.  In Ratzlaf  itself, the\r                                                            \r\n\ndissent contended  that the majority's  knowledge requirement\r\n\nwould  frustrate  the   statute;  the   majority  said   that\r\n\nreasonable  inferences could  be drawn.   114  S.

Our case presents just this issue.\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                         -33-\r\r\n\n     There is  no direct evidence that  either appellant knew\r\n\nthat structuring was a crime.  At the same time, the evidence\r\n\npermitted the jury to conclude that both knew that drug money\r\n\nwas involved; that both knew that the break-downs of the cash\r\n\nwere designed to  disguise proceeds; and that  both were paid\r\n\nin proportion  to  the  deposits  they made.    In  addition,\r\n\nKenneth Saccoccio  made a recorded statement  indicating that\r\n\nhe knew that his  own activity was criminal; and  given their\r\n\ncommon  role and  association a  jury could  reasonably infer\r\n\nthat James had the same level of apprehension.3\r\n\n     We   think  that  the  thrust  of  Ratzlaf's  wilfulness\r                                                           \r\n\nrequirement is  met if  persons engaged in  depositing broken\r\n\ndown amounts  are generally  conscious that  their laundering\r\n\noperation  is illegal, even if  they do not  know the precise\r\n\nrequirements of the law.  This circuit in Aversa was the only\r                                                            \r\n\none  to anticipate Ratzlaf and  we are fully sympathetic with\r                                      \r\n\nits aims.   But those  aims were  to screen  out persons  who\r\n\nstructured  transactions to  disguise  amounts in  situations\r\n\nwhere the actor might reasonably have no idea that the course\r\n\nof conduct was unlawful.  See Ratzlaf, 114  S.

This\r\n\nis not countered, as  their brief suggests, by the  fact that\r\n\nthey generally gave their  names and identifying  information\r\n\nwhen  requested by  banks: couriers  in their  position could\r\n\nreasonably think  that an  individual deposit  standing alone\r\n\nwould not appear irregular, while remaining aware that anyone\r\n\nwith a full knowledge of their activities would condemn them.\r\n\n     Ratzlaf dealt  with an abstract jury  instruction in yes\r                        \r\n\nor no terms; and in  its wake, courts and juries must  try to\r\n\nanswer  more concrete questions of how much is enough.  Where\r\n\na defendant's  structuring is genuinely innocent  of criminal\r\n\nintent, we think  that under Ratzlaf a  judgment of acquittal\r                                                \r\n\nis proper  no  matter  how  unattractive the  context.

But where the context is itself\r                  \r\n\nsaturated with  consciousness of illegality, we  do not think\r\n\nthat  Ratzlaf requires the jury to ignore it in assessing the\r                         \r\n\ndefendant's state of mind.\r\n\n               IV.

In  September,  her  counsel   requested  a  60-day\r\n\ncontinuance,  he was instead  granted 30 days,  and trial was\r\n\nset to begin on November 2.\r\n\n     Ten days before  trial Donna Saccoccia's  attorney asked\r\n\nfor  another continuance, which was denied.  As a result, her\r\n\nteam of lawyers had  just over 100 days after  arraignment to\r\n\nprepare  for  her  trial.   Pointing  to  the  length of  the\r\n\ngovernment  investigation,  the  number  of charges  and  the\r\n\nquantity of  evidence (over  1600 hours of  surveillance tape\r\n\nand  10,000 pages  of  financial documents),  Donna Saccoccia\r\n\nclaims  that  the  denial   of  the  second  continuance  was\r\n\nprejudicial error.\r\n\n     Although the government  asserts that Donna  Saccoccia's\r\n\ncounsel  were   able  to   prepare  during   the  extradition\r\n\nproceedings, this is at  least open to dispute.

The  trial proceeded with no  further request for\r\n\nsuch an examination  or suggestion  of incompetency,  until--\r\n\nabout six  months  after the  trial--the  presentence  report\r\n\nalluded  to  a  possible  sentence  reduction  for diminished\r\n\nmental  capacity.    The  defense then  retained  a  clinical\r\n\npsychologist who  examined Donna Saccoccia and concluded that\r\n\nshe  was mentally  incompetent  and had  been throughout  the\r\n\ntrial.  \r\n\n     Two days before sentencing, trial counsel filed a motion\r\n\nseeking a  competency hearing, which is  required where there\r\n\nis  \"reasonable  cause\"  to   believe  that  a  defendant  is\r\n\n\"mentally  incompetent to  the extent  that he  is  unable to\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                         -42-\r\r\n\nunderstand  the  nature and  consequences of  the proceedings\r\n\nagainst him or to assist properly in his defense.\"  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n   4241(a).

The district court  found that a  full-scale\r\n\ncompetency hearing  was not required and  Donna Saccoccia now\r\n\nappeals that decision.  \r\n\n     This is a close issue.

The money  laundering guideline in  effect at  the\r\n\ntime of sentencing increased a defendant's base offense level\r\n\nfor money laundering  by three levels if  the defendant \"knew\r\n\nor  believed\" that  the laundered money  was the  proceeds of\r\n\nnarcotics sales.   Id.   2S1.1(b)(1).   That provision became\r                                  \r\n\neffective  on  November  1, 1991;  previously,  the  increase\r\n\napplied only if the defendant \"knew\" that the money came from\r\n\nnarcotics.  \r\n\n     In  a claim  not  raised at  sentencing, appellants  now\r\n\nargue that the district  court erred by applying the  new and\r\n\nbroader guideline,  because (they say) the  last actual money\r\n\nlaundering  offense occurred  in  April 1991  before the  new\r\n\nguideline  took effect.

See U.S.S.G. app.\r                                                           \r\n\nC, amend.  378 (1994).    Here, the  money  was in  fact  the\r\n\nproceeds  of narcotics  trafficking  so belief  and knowledge\r\n\nwere the same  thing.   A defendant who  merely believed  the\r\n\ndrug proceeds were involved would (because of the correctness\r\n\nof that belief) also know that drug proceeds were involved.  \r\n\n     Appellants    contend    that    the   district    court\r\n\nmisinterpreted  the phrase  \"knew  or believed\"  to allow  an\r\n\nincrease based on a  showing that appellants merely suspected\r\n\nor should have known  that drug money was involved.   We have\r\n\nexamined  the transcript  of the  sentencing and  reject this\r\n\nconjecture.   In some cases,  an appellant was  shown to have\r\n\ndirect knowledge, and in  others, knowledge was inferred from\r\n\ncircumstances; but in each  case a fair reading of  the trial\r\n\ncourt's  remarks  show that  the  judge  determined that  the\r\n\nappellant knew the source of the laundered funds.  \r\n\n     Pizzo and James Saccoccio assert that even  if the court\r\n\ndid  not  misunderstand   the  standard,  the   evidence  was\r\n\ninadequate to show  that they knew  that the laundered  money\r\n\nwas  the proceeds of narcotic sales.  As explained earlier in\r\n\nthe opinion, the evidence on this point was sufficient.  Even\r\n\napart  from Pizzo's  disputed  reference to  \"the coke,\"  the\r\n\nvolume of funds, the duration, the geographic source, the use\r\n\nof  small  bills and  other  circumstances  made it  entirely\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                         -46-\r\r\n\nreasonable  to  infer   that  direct   participants  in   the\r\n\nenterprise knew that the funds were derived from drugs.  \r\n\n                 B.

U.S.S.G.   2S1.1(b)(2).\r\n\nAppellants contend  that in  various respects  the sentencing\r\n\ncourt  erred in  determining the  value of  the funds  and in\r\n\ndetermining the varying amounts that it found each individual\r\n\nappellant    reasonably   had    foreseen.       U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  These are largely factual issues, reviewable\r\n\nonly for clear error.  United States v. LaCroix, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195454\"><a href=\"/opinion/195454/united-states-v-lacroix/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                           \r\n\n231  (1st Cir. 1994).  We  have examined each of these claims\r\n\nof  error and  think that the  district court's  findings are\r\n\nsupportable,  and  that  none   involves  any  issue  of  law\r\n\nrequiring discussion.\r\n\n     Something  closer to an issue of law is presented by the\r\n\ndistrict   court's  determination  that   Carlo  DeMarco  was\r\n\nentitled  to a  two-level  reduction as  a minor  participant\r\n\nrather  than   to  the  four-level  decrease   as  a  minimal\r\n\nparticipant.  See U.S.S.G.   3B1.2.  The issue arises because\r                             \r\n\nDeMarco  participated  for only  a  few  months in  the  RICO\r\n\nconspiracy and was held responsible for only $3.9 million  of\r\n\nthe  $136 million conspiracy.  But  as to that segment of the\r\n\nconspiracy,  the  court found  that  the  range of  DeMarco's\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                         -47-\r\r\n\nactivities   made  him   a  minor   rather  than   a  minimal\r\n\nparticipant.\r\n\n     On appeal  DeMarco argues that  he was entitled  to have\r\n\nhis role determined in  light of the entire conspiracy.   The\r\n\ngovernment  argues  that his  role  should  be measured  only\r\n\nagainst the  foreseeable conduct for  which he has  been held\r\n\nresponsible.   No  case law  discussing this  issue  has been\r\n\ncited.  But we think that common sense permitted the district\r\n\njudge  to  determine  that  DeMarco--who  participated  quite\r\n\nactively in several roles  over a significant period  and was\r\n\ninvolved with a substantial  amount of laundered funds--was a\r\n\nminor and not a minimal participant.\r\n\n                    VI.  FORFEITURE ISSUES\r                                VI.  FORFEITURE ISSUES\r\n\n     Between January  1990 and April 1991,  Stephen and Donna\r\n\nSaccoccia  wired  $136,344,231.86  to foreign  bank  accounts\r\n\napparently controlled  by Colombian  drug suppliers.   In the\r\n\nindictment,  the  government  took  the  position  that  each\r\n\nappellant was  jointly and  severally liable for  this amount\r\n\nunder one of RICO's  several forfeiture provisions, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1963(a)(3).    This  subsection  requires  a  defendant  to\r\n\nforfeit  \"any property  constituting,  or  derived from,  any\r\n\nproceeds which the  person obtained, directly or  indirectly,\r\n\nfrom racketeering activity . . . .\"  Id.  By special verdict,\r                                                    \r\n\nthe  jury imposed such a forfeiture in this amount on Hurley,\r\n\n                             -48-\r                                         -48-\r\r\n\nthe other appellants having waived a jury trial on forfeiture\r\n\nissues.4  \r\n\n     The district  court imposed separate  forfeitures on the\r\n\nother appellants.   United States v.  Saccoccia, 823 F.  Supp\r                                                           \r\n\n994  (D.R.I.  1993).   The  court  held that  proceeds  under\r\n\nsection 1963(a)(3)  included laundered  funds obtained  by an\r\n\nappellant even  though later passed along  to the Colombians,\r\n\nand that each appellant was responsible for funds foreseeably\r\n\nobtained  by other  co-conspirators.   The  court found  that\r\n\nHurley, Stephen and Donna Saccoccia, and Anthony DeMarco were\r\n\naware of most or all aspects of the conspiracy and liable for\r\n\nthe  full amount;  that the  Saccoccio brothers,  Cirella and\r\n\nPizzo  were aware  mainly of the  Rhode Island  operation and\r\n\ntherefore  liable  only  for  the   $37,456,100.79  laundered\r\n\nthrough  Trend and  Saccoccia Coin;  and that  Carlo DeMarco,\r\n\nactive  only   from   August  through   November  1991,   was\r\n\nresponsible  for  $3,927,357.55  that  he  had  deposited  or\r\n\notherwise known about.\r\n\n     After appellants filed notices of appeal, the government\r\n\nfiled a  motion seeking  forfeiture of substitute  assets, 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    982(b), 1963(m); following various proceedings, the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     4The jury  also imposed a separate  forfeiture on Hurley\r\nof $52,800  under the money laundering provision, 18 U.S.C.  \r\n982, in connection with a  reporting violation.  Neither this\r\nnor  other section  982  forfeitures imposed  on three  other\r\nappellants  by the  district  judge have  been challenged  on\r\nappeal except  on grounds identical to  those discussed below\r\nin connection with the RICO forfeitures.\r\n\n                             -49-\r                                         -49-\r\r\n\ndistrict court ultimately  determined that  because the  $136\r\n\nmillion had  been transferred  out of the  jurisdiction, each\r\n\nappellant  was liable to pay  the amounts in  question out of\r\n\nany  other assets  of  that  appellant.   Both  the  original\r\n\nforfeiture orders  and their  extension to substitute  assets\r\n\nare the subject of a number of attacks in this case.\r\n\n                A.  \"Proceeds . . .

Alternatively, appellants contend that  none of\r\n\nthe $137  million could fairly  be regarded as  \"obtained\" by\r\n\nthem  since  it   represents  amounts   transmitted  by   the\r\n\nSaccoccias to the drug owners themselves.\r\n\n     Section 1963(a)(3)  was added by Congress  to other RICO\r\n\nforfeiture  provisions in  1984, and its  legislative history\r\n\n                             -50-\r                                         -50-\r\r\n\nexplains without qualification that \"the  term `proceeds' has\r\n\nbeen used in lieu of the term `profits' in order to alleviate\r\n\nthe  unreasonable burden  on  the government  of proving  net\r\n\nprofits.\"  S.

See id.  at 27.  Given the  legislative history\r                                 \r\n\nand Russello,  the broader definition of  \"proceeds\" seems to\r                        \r\n\nus a rather easy call.\r\n\n     The  point  is  borne  out  by  imagining  that  Stephen\r\n\nSaccoccia  had been caught with  the $136 million  in cash or\r\n\ngold just before delivering  it to the Colombians.   The cash\r\n\nor gold  could surely  be described as  property representing\r\n\n\"proceeds\"   which  Stephen  Saccoccia  had  \"obtained\"  from\r\n\nracketeering activity  in violation of  section 1962, namely,\r\n\nthrough  money laundering.

To read  \"obtained\" to cover\r\n\nproperty  once held by a  defendant on behalf  of another has\r\n\nthe   effect--when  combined   with  the   substitute  assets\r\n\nprovision--of converting  the forfeiture into a  fine.  Thus,\r\n\nat  first, the  temptation  is to  read  the word  \"obtained\"\r\n\nnarrowly, having  in mind the  low level  courier who  merely\r\n\ntransports the money and could face death if any of the funds\r\n\nwere diverted.\r\n\n     Yet,  on  reflection,  it is  only  in  degree  that the\r\n\ncourier who gets a very small cut differs from intermediaries\r\n\nwho get  a larger one, and  from the leader of  the drug ring\r\n\nwho is effectively paying much of the money back to suppliers\r\n\nand  servitors  of  various   kinds.    Looking  at  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture under RICO  as a kind of shadow fine,  the size of\r\n\nthe amount transported is some measure of the  potential harm\r\n\nfrom  the  transaction.

This is a sensible resolution of a very close\r\n\nissue, and we follow the district court's lead.  \r\n\n     The arguments  for limiting  forfeiture solely to  funds\r\n\npersonally obtained  by an individual defendant  are several.\r\n\nThe  statutory  language  speaks  of  a  violator  forfeiting\r\n\n\"proceeds  which  the person  obtained\" by  violating section\r                                        \r\n\n1962.  18 U.S.C.   1963(a)(3) (emphasis added).  In addition,\r\n\nthe  plight  of  a  defendant  who  was  merely  a  temporary\r\n\ncustodian of cash and passed it  on is even starker than that\r\n\n                             -53-\r                                         -53-\r\r\n\nof a person who never possessed the cash at all.  Thus, there\r\n\nis a  respectable basis for holding  that vicarious liability\r\n\nfor  co-conspirator behavior  does  not exist  under  section\r\n\n1963.  \r\n\n     The  arguments  pointing  the   other  way  seem  to  us\r\n\nstronger.     Under  established  case  law,   members  of  a\r\n\nconspiracy  are  substantively  liable  for  the  foreseeable\r\n\ncriminal  conduct of  the  other members  of the  conspiracy.\r\n\nPinkerton v.

U.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  It  would be odd,\r\n\nalthough  not impossible,  to depart  from this  principle of\r\n\nattributed  conduct when  it  comes to  apply the  forfeiture\r\n\nrules, which  have aspects both of  substantive liability and\r\n\nof penalty.  \r\n\n     It  is  largely  fortuitous  whether  an  individual co-\r\n\nconspirator  happened to  possess  the laundered  funds at  a\r\n\nparticular point.   If conclusive  weight were  given to  who\r\n\nphysically handled  the money,  a low-level courier  or money\r\n\ncounter could  be liable  for vast  sums, while  other higher\r\n\nlevel conspirators could  easily escape  responsibility.   So\r\n\nlong  as the amount handled by  others is foreseeable as to a\r\n\ndefendant,  the  foreseeable  amount represents  the  sounder\r\n\nmeasure of liability.\r\n\n                             -54-\r                                         -54-\r\r\n\n     Finally,  we have to give  some weight to  the fact that\r\n\neach  court  of appeals  that  has  addressed  the topic  has\r\n\nconcluded that  the forfeiture provisions  involve joint  and\r\n\nseveral  liability.

We think\r                      \r\n\nthat  the  substitution  of  assets orders  fit  within  this\r\n\ngeneral category.\r\n\n     Criminal forfeiture orders are  something of a  mongrel.\r\n\nThe  initial  forfeiture is  sought  in  the indictment  and,\r\n\nabsent  a  waiver of  jury trial,  is  specified in  the jury\r\n\nverdict.   See Fed.  R.  Crim. P.  7(c)(2); 31(e).   But  the\r                          \r\n\nstatute  says that an order substituting assets is to be made\r\n\nby \"the court.\"   18 U.S.C.    1963(m).   The implication  is\r\n\nthat  such an order may commonly be entered after the initial\r\n\nforfeiture has been determined.  Indeed, the government might\r\n\nnot even know  that substitution is necessary until  it seeks\r\n\nto take possession  of the property specified  in the initial\r\n\nforfeiture order. \r\n\n     Under  these circumstances,  we  see no  reason why  the\r\n\ntaking  of the  appeal  should divest  the district  court of\r\n\nauthority to enter  an order forfeiting  substitute property.\r\n\n                             -58-\r                                         -58-\r\r\n\nAppellants do not provide any reason to think that this would\r\n\ninterfere   with,  or  contradict,   the  court  of  appeals'\r\n\nconsideration of  the original  judgment of a  conviction and\r\n\nsentence, including the  initial forfeiture order.

CONCLUSION\r                                   VII.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n     A number  of the remaining arguments  made by appellants\r\n\nhave  been addressed by  the court in  the decision affirming\r\n\nStephen Saccoccia's  conviction  and need  not  be  discussed\r\n\nagain.  These  include attacks on  certain references to  the\r\n\nColombians,  on  the  admission  of dog  sniff  evidence,  on\r\n\ntestimony by  Agent Shedd,  and on  tape excerpts  claimed to\r\n\nrefer  to   cocaine  and   drug  money.     Similarly,  Donna\r\n\nSaccoccia's claims relating to extradition, to the extent not\r\n\nwaived,  are in  substance covered  by the  earlier opinion's\r\n\ndiscussion   of   Stephen  Saccoccia's   counterpart  claims.\r\n\nSeveral  additional  arguments  (e.g.,   Kenneth  Saccoccio's\r                                                 \r\n\n\"theory of the defense\" instruction) have been considered but\r\n\ndeemed not to require separate treatment.\r\n\n     The  charges  in this  case  involved  a  web of  multi-\r\n\nparagraph statutes  with intricate  provisions that  the jury\r\n\nhad  to  apply to  numerous  transactions  involving multiple\r\n\ndefendants and occurring over  a considerable period of time.\r\n\nIn these  circumstances, we have  reviewed appellants' claims\r\n\nnot only as individually  presented, but also with an  eye to\r\n\n                             -61-\r                                         -61-\r\r\n\nmaking  certain  that no  innocent  person  has been  wrongly\r\n\nenmeshed  in criminal  proceedings.   We  are satisfied  that\r\n\nwhile several  debatable issues  have been raised  on appeal,\r\n\nthere was no prejudicial error and that the verdict  returned\r\n\nby the jury was a just one.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -62-\r                                         -62-\r\r\n</pre>",
