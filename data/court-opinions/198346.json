KOURI-PEREZ,\r\n\n                       Petitioner.\r\n\n     PETITION FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO \r\n\n     [Hon. Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n             and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Benny Frankie Cerezo and Law Offices Benny Frankie Cerezo on\r\nPetition for Writ of Mandamus for petitioner.\r\n\nFebruary 26, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the petition for\r\nmandamus and the urgent motion for stay, we are not persuaded\r\nto grant the extraordinary writ.  Petitioner does not have a\r\n\"clear and indisputable\" entitlement to relief, and we do not\r\nfind that equitable factors or risk of irreparable harm weigh\r\nin his favor.  See In re Martinez-Catala, 129 F.3d 213, 217-18\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  \r\n          Specifically, in the context of this mandamus review,\r\nwe cannot say that the judge was required to recuse.  We would\r\nreach the same conclusion whether applying the standard of 28\r\nU.S.C.  144 actually invoked by petitioner, or applying the\r\nstandards of 28 U.S.C.  455(a) and 455(b)(1) additionally\r\nmentioned by the district court.  Taking petitioner's averments\r\nas true, and considering any extrajudicial circumstances along\r\nwith the events of the instant case, still we cannot say that\r\npetitioner made a clear and indisputable showing of personal\r\nbias or prejudice, nor did he raise a reasonable question as to\r\nthe judge's impartiality.  \r\n          The petition for writ of mandamus is denied.  The\r\nmotion for stay is moot.\r\n\n                           -2-\n",
