This case concerns claims made\n\non the allocation of monies to the states, specifically Rhode\n\nIsland, from the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement in the tobacco\n\nlitigation.\n\n         Blanche E. Greenless appeals the dismissal of her suit\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nagainst the Governor of Rhode Island and various other state\n\nofficials, all in their official capacities. Greenless seeks to\n\nrepresent all of Rhode Island's Medicaid recipients who have\n\nsuffered damages from the use of tobacco.      She claims that\n\nfederal law requires Rhode Island to pay that class a portion of\n\nthe proceeds from the settlement of its claims against the\n\ntobacco industry, and that Rhode Island is wrongfully converting\n\nwhat are essentially Medicaid recovery collections.\n\n         The district court dismissed Greenless's suit without\n\na hearing as barred by the doctrine of state sovereign immunity\n\nembodied in the Eleventh Amendment.   We affirm the dismissal of\n\nthe action, but on different grounds, holding that Greenless has\n\n\n\n                              -2-\n\ffailed to state a claim on which relief can be granted due to a\n\nrecent amendment of the Medicaid statute.         We do not reach the\n\ndifficult   question   whether   a   claim   of   the   sort   Greenless\n\nasserts, if provided by federal law, would be barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                                     I.\n\nA.   Facts\n\n             During the 1990s, more than forty of the fifty states,\n\nincluding     Rhode    Island,    filed     suits    against   the    major\n\nmanufacturers of tobacco products.              See State v. Brown &\n\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., No. 97-3058 (R.I. Sup. Ct. Dec. 17,\n\n1998) (consent decree and final judgment).            The exact theories\n\nof recovery varied from state to state.             Generally, the states\n\nalleged that the tobacco industry had misled the public by\n\nconcealing the risks of cigarette smoking and had therefore\n\ncaused the states to spend vast sums of public money on\n\nproviding health care for those made ill by tobacco.                 Unlike\n\nprior   attempts      to   hold   tobacco   manufacturers      liable   for\n\nsmoking-related illnesses or deaths, the states' suits resulted\n\nin a lucrative settlement, recorded by the Master Settlement\n\nAgreement.      See National Association of Attorneys General,\n\nMaster Settlement Agreement, at http://www.naag.org/tobac/\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcigmsa.rtf (Nov. 23, 1998).      According to Greenless, under the\n\nAgreement    Rhode   Island   will   receive   approximately   $1.408\n\nbillion.1\n\n            The expenditures on health care on which the state's\n\nsuits relied arose in significant part through the Medicaid\n\nprogram. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are the two largest\n\nsources of public funding for health care in the United States.\n\nMedicare, which provides health care primarily to the elderly\n\nand to some individuals with disabilities, receives funds\n\nexclusively from the federal government.            Medicaid, which\n\nprovides health care primarily to the indigent, receives funds\n\nfrom both the federal government and the states. State Medicaid\n\nexpenditures consume large portions of states' budgets; in\n\nfiscal year 2000, Rhode Island spent 22.6% of its budget on\n\nMedicaid.    Rhode Island Department of Human Services, Annual\n\nReport: Fiscal Year 2000: Rhode Island Medicaid Program 13,\n\n\n\n     1    Payments under the Agreement are contingent on many\nfactors, and assigning values to a state's right to payment is\ntherefore difficult. See Floyd v. Thompson, 227 F.3d 1029, 1038\n(7th Cir. 2000) (\"The final amount to be paid . . . is unknown\nand unknowable at this point . . . .\"). The question presented\nby this appeal is not quantitative, so exact amounts are not\nmaterial. Rhode Island stands to receive a great deal of money.\n\n                                 -5-\n\favailable at http://www.dhs.state.ri.us/dhs/reports/ma2000.pdf.\n\nWhen the states sought to recover funds spent on health care\n\nmade necessary by smoking, some of their alleged damages were\n\nMedicaid expenditures.     So stated Rhode Island's complaint at\n\nthe time.\n\n            The recovery of Medicaid expenditures from the tobacco\n\nindustry arguably brought into play certain aspects of the\n\nfederal Medicaid statute. When a state agrees to participate in\n\nMedicaid by enacting a statute, it must create a plan that meets\n\nrequirements specified by Congress.     That state Medicaid plan\n\nmust \"provide that, as a condition of eligibility for medical\n\nassistance under the State plan . . . the individual is required\n\n-- (A) to assign the State any rights . . . to payment for\n\nmedical care from any third party.\"        42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)\n\n(1994).\n\n            Moreover, when a state, acting on an individual's\n\nassignment of his or her rights, has recovered from a third\n\nparty compensation for state expenditures to provide health care\n\nvia Medicaid, the state may not necessarily keep all of the\n\nmoney.    Instead,\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          [s]uch part of any amount collected by the State under\n          an assignment made under the provisions of this\n          section shall be retained by the State as is necessary\n          to reimburse it for medical assistance payments made\n          on behalf of an individual with respect to whom such\n          assignment    was    executed     (with    appropriate\n          reimbursement of the Federal Government to the extent\n          of its participation in the financing of such medical\n          assistance), and the remainder of such amount\n          collected shall be paid to such individual.\n\nId. § 1396k(b) (emphasis added).2            After the state and federal\n\ngovernments     are   reimbursed,      any    excess     is   paid    to   the\n\nindividual, \"who is usually a person of limited resources.\"                 45\n\nFed. Reg. 8982, 8983 (Feb. 11, 1980).\n\n          If these provisions apply to the Master Settlement\n\nAgreement (Rhode Island claims they do not because the suit was\n\nbrought   not   as    a   §   1396k   assignment   but    under      different\n\ntheories) then at least some of the money that the tobacco\n\nindustry paid the states under the Agreement belongs to the\n\n\n    2     This language is clarified by regulation:\n\n    The agency must distribute collections as follows --\n         (a) To itself, an amount equal to State Medicaid\n         expenditures for the individual on whose right the\n         collection was based.\n         (b) To the Federal Government, the Federal share of the\n         State Medicaid expenditures, minus any incentive payment\n         made in accordance with [a related provision] . . . .\n         (c) To the recipient, any remaining amount. . . .\n\n42 C.F.R. § 433.153 (2000).\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffederal government as appropriate reimbursement within the\n\nmeaning of § 1396k(b).   If, as well, the states received more\n\nmoney from the tobacco industry under the Agreement than was\n\nnecessary to reimburse both the state and federal governments\n\nfor medical assistance payments made on behalf of smokers, then\n\nthe remainder belongs to the smokers on whose behalf those\n\npayments were made.   Greenless's claim rests on this theory.\n\n         Congress has recently amended the statute.    The 1999\n\nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act exempts from the\n\nnormal procedures by which the federal government takes its\n\nshare of state recoveries \"any amount recovered or paid to a\n\nState as part of the comprehensive settlement of November 1998\n\nbetween manufacturers of tobacco products . . . and State\n\nAttorneys General.\"   Pub. L. No. 106-31, § 3031, 113 Stat. 57,\n\n103-04 (1999) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(i) (Supp.\n\nV 1999)). It furthermore provides, with an exception irrelevant\n\nto this case, that \"a State may use amounts recovered or paid to\n\nthe State as part of a comprehensive . . . settlement . . .\n\ndescribed in [the prior] clause . . . for any expenditures\n\ndetermined appropriate by the State.\"    Id., 113 Stat. at 104\n\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)).\n\n                              -8-\n\f         The parties agree that this new language removes any\n\nclaim to the states' tobacco settlement money by the federal\n\ngovernment.   The question presented by this appeal is whether\n\nthe language also removes any possible claim to that money under\n\nfederal law by the individuals whose illnesses caused the states\n\nto spend the money.\n\n\n\n\n                              -9-\n\fB.   History\n\n          Greenless filed this suit in the District of Rhode\n\nIsland   against   the   various    defendants     in   their   official\n\ncapacities, claiming that Rhode Island must pay her and the\n\nmembers of her class the amount by which the tobacco settlement\n\nexceeds its actual costs.          She alleged this amount to be\n\nsubstantial.   For her cause of action she relied on 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 and its broad-ranging remedies for violations of federal\n\nrights under color of state law.          She asked for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief to compel Rhode Island's officials to pay her\n\nthe alleged excess.\n\n          The defendants moved to dismiss on two grounds. First,\n\nthey argued that Greenless's suit is barred under the Eleventh\n\nAmendment by state sovereign immunity as a suit for, in effect,\n\nmoney damages against the treasury of a state.            Second, they\n\nargued that Greenless has no cause of action under § 1983\n\nbecause her rights under the Medicaid statute have not been and\n\nwill not be violated.     Greenless in response claimed that her\n\nsuit does not run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment because the\n\nstate is not a party, only state officials, and because she\n\nseeks only prospective relief permissible under the doctrine of\n\n                                   -10-\n\fEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), as explained in Edelman v.\n\nJordan,   415   U.S.    651   (1974).        She   also   responded   to   the\n\ndefendants' statutory arguments.              On February 26, 2001, the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the case in a seven-page opinion\n\naddressing only    the     question     of    state   sovereign    immunity.\n\nGreenless v. Almond, C.A. No. 00-037ML (D.R.I. Feb. 26, 2001).\n\nThis appeal followed.         The defendants make on appeal both sets\n\nof arguments presented to the district court in support of the\n\njudgment.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Our review of the district court's judgment in this\n\ncase is de novo.       See Mills v. Maine, 118 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (reviewing de novo a dismissal on Eleventh Amendment\n\ngrounds); Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B.,\n\n958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1992) (same for failure to state a\n\nclaim). As always, we may affirm a district court's judgment on\n\nany grounds supported by the record.           Doe v. Anrig, 728 F.2d 30,\n\n32 (1st Cir. 1984).           Moreover, this circuit has held that\n\nfederal courts need not answer questions of state sovereign\n\nimmunity under the Eleventh Amendment before answering other,\n\neasier legal questions that would decide a case.                  Parella v.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fRet. Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46, 53-57\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (declining to apply to cases involving the\n\nEleventh Amendment the rule of    Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\n\nBetter Environment, 523 U.S. 83 (1998), in which \"a majority of\n\njustices rejected the use of 'hypothetical jurisdiction'\").\n\nA.   Eleventh Amendment and constitutional avoidance\n\n          Other plaintiffs have brought cases similar to this one\n\nagainst numerous other states.   None have yet succeeded.3    The\n\nonly circuit courts4 to address the Eleventh Amendment question,\n\nthe Fifth and Tenth Circuits, have held that the Amendment would\n\nnot prevent the plaintiffs in a case such as this one from\n\nobtaining the relief they seek, if that relief were available\n\nunder federal law.    Harris v. Owens, 264 F.3d 1282, 1289-94\n\n\n\n\n     3    Our discussion of similar cases in this opinion is not\nexhaustive and includes only those published opinions useful to\ngive context to our decision today.\n     4    Some district courts have decided, as the district\ncourt concluded in this case, that state sovereign immunity bars\nsuch claims. E.g., Clark v. Stovall, 158 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (D.\nKan. 2001); Cardenas v. Anzai, 128 F. Supp. 2d 704 (D. Haw.\n2001); Martin v. New Mexico, 197 F.R.D. 694 (D.N.M. 2000);\nBarton v. Summers, 111 F. Supp. 2d 989 (M.D. Tenn. 2000). The\ndecision of the District of New Mexico in Martin preceded the\nTenth Circuit's decision in Harris, discussed in text; Harris is\nnow, of course, the law of that circuit.\n\n                              -12-\n\f(10th   Cir.   2001)   (holding   that    the   relief   requested   is\n\npermissible under the doctrine of Ex parte Young); Watson v.\n\nTexas, 261 F.3d 436, 440-43 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding that Texas\n\nwaived its sovereign immunity in the settlement agreement).\n\n          Every court to consider the question has, however,\n\ndecided that § 1396k(b) does not apply to the state tobacco\n\nsettlements, either because the settlements are not recoveries\n\nof the sort governed by that section as a general matter or\n\nbecause   §    1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)        specifically    exempts     the\n\nsettlements. See Tyler v. Douglas, No. 00-7839, 2001 WL 1230630\n\n(2d Cir. Oct. 16, 2001) (relying on § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii));\n\nHarris, 264 F.3d at 1294-97 (same); McClendon v. Ga. Dep't of\n\nCmty. Health, 261 F.3d 1252, 1259-62 (11th Cir. 2001) (relying\n\non § 1396k(b));5 Floyd v. Thompson, 227 F.3d 1029, 1035-38 (7th\n\nCir. 2000) (relying on § 1396k(b) and on Wisconsin assignment\n\nlaw); Skillings v. Illinois, 121 F. Supp. 2d 1235 (C.D. Ill.\n\n2000) (following Floyd while applying Illinois law); see also\n\nState v. Superior Court, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 735 (Cal. App. 2000)\n\n\n\n    5     Judge Noonan would have relied on § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii).\nMcClendon, 261 F.3d at 1262 (Noonan, J., concurring in the\njudgment).\n\n                                  -13-\n\f(interpreting         portion   of   state   code    implementing   federal\n\nstatutory scheme); Brown v. State, 617 N.W.2d 421, 425-27 (Minn.\n\nCt. App. 2000) (same).\n\n                 In summary, the courts that have considered questions\n\nof state sovereign immunity similar to those presented by this\n\ncase have split, and the circuit courts among this group have\n\nheld       the    Eleventh   Amendment   not   to    bar   claims   such   as\n\nGreenless's.          Those that have considered statutory questions\n\nsimilar to those here are so far unanimous, although different\n\ncourts have followed different reasoning to the same conclusion.\n\n                 We do not decide any question of state sovereign\n\nimmunity today.         We will, however, sketch the outlines of the\n\nquestion on the facts of this case in order to explain our\n\nreasons for avoiding it. As a general matter the several states\n\nare immune under the Eleventh Amendment from private suit in the\n\nfederal courts, absent their consent.6              Among the exceptions to\n\nthis rule is the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123\n\n(1908), which allows a plaintiff to enforce a claim of federal\n\n\n       6  States do not waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity\nmerely by participating in the Medicaid program. Fla. Dep't of\nHealth & Rehabilitative Servs. v. Fla. Nursing Home Ass'n, 450\nU.S. 147 (1981) (per curiam).\n\n                                      -14-\n\fright by obtaining injunctive or declaratory relief against a\n\nstate officer in the officer's official capacity.                      In Edelman v.\n\nJordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974), the Supreme Court explained that\n\nthe   purpose      of    this   exception        is    to    prevent     continuing\n\nviolations of federal law, but not to remedy past violations.\n\nTherefore, an Ex parte Young plaintiff may obtain prospective,\n\nbut not retrospective, relief.                  See id. at 664-65; see also\n\nIdaho     v.    Coeur    d'Alene     Tribe,      521    U.S.    261,    294   (1997)\n\n(O'Connor,       J.,    concurring    in    part       and   concurring       in   the\n\njudgment) (\"[A] Young suit is available where a plaintiff\n\nalleges an ongoing violation of                 federal law, and where the\n\nrelief sought is prospective rather than retrospective.\"); id.\n\nat 298 (Souter, J., dissenting) (observing that, given the\n\ndisposition of the Justices in that case, \"Justice O'Connor's\n\nview is the controlling one\").\n\n               Greenless claims to seek a prospective remedy for an\n\nallegedly ongoing violation of federal law that will recur each\n\ntime the state actually receives an installment payment of the\n\ntobacco        settlement.         The     defendants          claim    she    seeks\n\nretrospective compensation for the alleged violation that the\n\nstate committed when it reached agreement with the tobacco\n\n                                         -15-\n\findustry without providing that a portion of the proceeds would\n\ngo to Greenless and her class.            Because of the Supreme Court's\n\nrecent   reinvigoration        of   the   doctrine   of   state   sovereign\n\nimmunity, see, e.g., Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44\n\n(1996); Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), private plaintiffs'\n\nability to enforce congressionally enacted restraints on the\n\nstates' use of many types of funds may well turn on just such\n\nquestions    to   a   degree    few   readers   of   Edelman   would   have\n\npredicted when that case was decided.\n\n            It is not, however, the role of the federal courts to\n\nanswer legal questions unless specific cases need answers. This\n\nprinciple applies with special force to complex questions of\n\nconstitutional law, so that courts often avoid such questions by\n\nchoosing to focus on other aspects of a case that adequately\n\ndispose of the controversy between the parties.             See Ashwander\n\nv. Tenn. Valley Auth., 297 U.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J.,\n\nconcurring) (\"The Court will not pass upon a constitutional\n\nquestion although properly presented by the record, if there is\n\nalso present some other ground upon which the case may be\n\ndisposed of.\"); U.S.I. Props. Corp. v. M.D. Constr. Co., 230\n\nF.3d 489, 495 (1st Cir. 2000) (avoiding a complex Eleventh\n\n                                      -16-\n\fAmendment question in favor of a simpler statutory subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction question); Parella, 173 F.3d at 56. In this\n\ncase, the constitutional question is difficult; but, as we\n\ndiscuss below, at least one statutory question is easy and\n\ndisposes completely of Greenless's suit.    We therefore bypass\n\nthe constitutional question, as have the Second, Seventh, and\n\nEleventh Circuits, in favor of the easier question whether\n\nplaintiffs have stated a claim on which relief may be granted.7\n\n\n    7     The Tenth Circuit in Harris reached the same conclusion\nabout the relative difficulty of the questions but nevertheless\nheld itself bound to answer the constitutional question because\nof its prior holding in Martin v. Kansas, 190 F.3d 1120 (10th\nCir. 1999), that questions involving the Eleventh Amendment must\nbe reached before all other legal issues in a case. Harris, 264\nF.3d at 1288. The Fifth Circuit follows a similar rule. United\nStates ex rel. Foulds v. Tex. Tech Univ., 171 F.3d 279, 285-88\n(5th Cir. 1999).      Under Parella, this circuit follows a\ndifferent one. Several other circuits appear to agree, or at\nleast to leave open some room for judicial discretion.        See\nTyler, 2001 WL 1230630, at *4 (observing the Tenth Circuit's\ndifficulty, and then deciding the statutory question);\nMcClendon, 261 F.3d at 1258 (distinguishing Seaborn v. Fla.\nDep't of Corr., 143 F.3d 1405 (11th Cir. 1998), which had\nappeared to announce a holding similar to that of Martin, and\nreaching the statutory question); United States ex rel. Long v.\nSCS Bus. & Technical Inst., 173 F.3d 890 (D.C. Cir. 1999)\n(holding that a federal court may reach other questions before\nan Eleventh Amendment question at least if the state involved\nconsents, and observing the benefits of doing so when the\nEleventh Amendment question is complex); cf. Floyd, 227 F.3d at\n1035 (stating that the court would resolve the Eleventh\nAmendment issue first \"if it appeared in any way possible\" that\n\n                              -17-\n\fSee Tyler, 2001 WL       1230630, at *4; Floyd, 227 F.3d at 1034;\n\nMcClendon, 261 F.3d at 1258.         We recommend this course to the\n\ndistrict courts of this circuit as the wiser approach.\n\nB.   Statutory interpretation\n\n             There are two reasons to doubt whether the amended\n\nMedicaid statute will support Greenless's claim.            The first\n\nreason is that it is not clear whether any of the money\n\nrecovered by Rhode Island is money to which Greenless and her\n\nclass can stake a claim under § 1396k(b) as it stood at the time\n\nof the settlements. See McClendon, 261 F.3d at 1259-62; Watson,\n\n261 F.3d at 443-45.      The second reason, and the one on which we\n\nbase   our    holding,   is   §   1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii),   added    by   the\n\nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999, Pub. L. No.\n\n106-31, 113 Stat. 57, 103-04 (1999).          We find persuasive the\n\nreasoning of Tyler, in which the Second Circuit held that\n\n§ 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii) was plain and foreclosed a suit similar to\n\nthe present one.     Tyler, 2001 WL 1230630, at *5-8.           We agree\n\nwith the Second Circuit that the funds described in that section\n\nas available \"for any expenditures determined appropriate by the\n\n\nthe plaintiffs could sue the state, and then concluding that\nsuch a suit was not possible).\n\n                                   -18-\n\fState\" cannot simultaneously be owed to Medicaid recipients.\n\nId. at *6 (quoting § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)).\n\n          Greenless makes two arguments against this reading of\n\n§   1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)   based     on    traditional   principles    of\n\nstatutory interpretation.       First, she claims that the reading\n\nviolates the presumption against implied repeal.            Second, she\n\nclaims that the reading violates the presumption against giving\n\nlegislation retroactive effect. Although these two presumptions\n\nare well-known landmarks of this area of the law, neither\n\napplies to this case.\n\n          The \"implied repeal\" argument is an odd one because at\n\nissue is not whether Congress totally repealed § 1396k, but\n\nwhether it intended to carve out tobacco settlement monies from\n\nthe reach of that provision.            But we will use Greenless's\n\nterminology.    She argues that the amendment only waives the\n\nfederal government's share of the settlement and does not affect\n\nany rights of individuals.       Not so.     The presumption against\n\nimplied repeal, although of particular force when, as here,\n\napplied   to   appropriations     riders,    nevertheless    turns   on\n\nlegislative intent. United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 221-24\n\n(1980) (\"[W]hen Congress desires to suspend or repeal a statute\n\n                                 -19-\n\fin force, '[t]here can be no doubt that . . . it could\n\naccomplish its purpose by an amendment to an appropriation bill,\n\nor otherwise.'\" (quoting United States v. Dickerson, 310 U.S.\n\n554, 555 (1940)) (second and third alterations in Will)).\n\nIndeed, the presumption results from certain assumptions that\n\ncourts make about the legislative process:\n\n         Courts do not lightly assume that one statute has\n         implicitly repealed another.     This principle is a\n         product of a set of beliefs about the legislative\n         process -- in particular, a belief that Congress,\n         focused as it usually is on a particular problem,\n         should not be understood to have eliminated without\n         specific consideration another program that was likely\n         the product of sustained attention.\n\nC. R. Sunstein, Interpreting Statutes in the Regulatory State,\n\n103 Harv. L. Rev. 405, 475 (1989) (footnote omitted).     These\n\nconcerns have less force where, as here, Congress was responding\n\nto a recent event, the Master Settlement Agreement, and was\n\nclear in its language.   The only even arguable doubt is whether\n\nthat repeal covered Medicaid recipients' possible claims as well\n\nas the federal government's.    In our view the plain statutory\n\nlanguage means both.8\n\n\n    8     Even were we to apply the presumption against implied\nrepeal, that presumption can be overcome by an \"irreconciliable\nconflict\" between statutes. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.\n\n                               -20-\n\f           The presumption against retroactivity also does not\n\naffect the result in this case.      It is true that as a general\n\nmatter Congress must speak clearly to make its legislation\n\nretroactive.   Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 280\n\n(1994).9   Whatever the proper characterization of the relief\n\nGreenless seeks in this case, Congress made its intent clear in\n\nthe amendment, which \"applies to all funds received under the\n\nMaster Settlement Agreement, whether past, present, or future.\"\n\nHarris, 264 F.3d at 1296.\n\n\n\n\nEpstein, 516 U.S. 367, 381 (1996) (quoting Kremer v. Chem.\nConstr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 468 (1982)) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).   It is impossible to reconcile § 1396k(b)'s\nrequirement that \"the remainder of [the tobacco settlement]\nshall be paid to such individual\" with § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)'s\npermission to use the money \"for any expenditures determined\nappropriate by the State.\"\n     9    We disregard the tension between Greenless's argument\nfor Eleventh Amendment purposes that she seeks prospective\nrelief for a future injury, rather than retrospective\ncompensation for a past injury, and her argument that our\nreading of the statute renders it retroactive. See Landgraf,\n511 U.S. at 273 (\"When the intervening statute authorizes or\naffects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the\nnew provision is not retroactive.\").\n\n                              -21-\n\f                                  III.\n\n         To avoid the unnecessary resolution of a difficult\n\nconstitutional   question,   we    have   assessed   the   merits   of\n\nGreenless's case and have found that she has failed to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief may be granted.      Therefore, although we\n\ndo not reach the reasoning of the district court's opinion, its\n\njudgment dismissing the case is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f",

This case concerns claims made\n\non the allocation of monies to the states, specifically Rhode\n\nIsland, from the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement in the tobacco\n\nlitigation.\n\n         Blanche E. Greenless appeals the dismissal of her suit\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nagainst the Governor of Rhode Island and various other state\n\nofficials, all in their official capacities. Greenless seeks to\n\nrepresent all of Rhode Island's Medicaid recipients who have\n\nsuffered damages from the use of tobacco.      She claims that\n\nfederal law requires Rhode Island to pay that class a portion of\n\nthe proceeds from the settlement of its claims against the\n\ntobacco industry, and that Rhode Island is wrongfully converting\n\nwhat are essentially Medicaid recovery collections.\n\n         The district court dismissed Greenless's suit without\n\na hearing as barred by the doctrine of state sovereign immunity\n\nembodied in the Eleventh Amendment.   We affirm the dismissal of\n\nthe action, but on different grounds, holding that Greenless has\n\n\n\n                              -2-\n\ffailed to state a claim on which relief can be granted due to a\n\nrecent amendment of the Medicaid statute.         We do not reach the\n\ndifficult   question   whether   a   claim   of   the   sort   Greenless\n\nasserts, if provided by federal law, would be barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                                     I.\n\nA.   Facts\n\n             During the 1990s, more than forty of the fifty states,\n\nincluding     Rhode    Island,    filed     suits    against   the    major\n\nmanufacturers of tobacco products.              See State v. Brown &\n\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., No. 97-3058 (R.I. Sup. Ct. Dec. 17,\n\n1998) (consent decree and final judgment).            The exact theories\n\nof recovery varied from state to state.             Generally, the states\n\nalleged that the tobacco industry had misled the public by\n\nconcealing the risks of cigarette smoking and had therefore\n\ncaused the states to spend vast sums of public money on\n\nproviding health care for those made ill by tobacco.                 Unlike\n\nprior   attempts      to   hold   tobacco   manufacturers      liable   for\n\nsmoking-related illnesses or deaths, the states' suits resulted\n\nin a lucrative settlement, recorded by the Master Settlement\n\nAgreement.      See National Association of Attorneys General,\n\nMaster Settlement Agreement, at http://www.naag.org/tobac/\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcigmsa.rtf (Nov. 23, 1998).      According to Greenless, under the\n\nAgreement    Rhode   Island   will   receive   approximately   $1.408\n\nbillion.1\n\n            The expenditures on health care on which the state's\n\nsuits relied arose in significant part through the Medicaid\n\nprogram. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are the two largest\n\nsources of public funding for health care in the United States.\n\nMedicare, which provides health care primarily to the elderly\n\nand to some individuals with disabilities, receives funds\n\nexclusively from the federal government.            Medicaid, which\n\nprovides health care primarily to the indigent, receives funds\n\nfrom both the federal government and the states. State Medicaid\n\nexpenditures consume large portions of states' budgets; in\n\nfiscal year 2000, Rhode Island spent 22.6% of its budget on\n\nMedicaid.    Rhode Island Department of Human Services, Annual\n\nReport: Fiscal Year 2000: Rhode Island Medicaid Program 13,\n\n\n\n     1    Payments under the Agreement are contingent on many\nfactors, and assigning values to a state's right to payment is\ntherefore difficult. See Floyd v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770571\"><a href=\"/opinion/770571/vera-l-floyd-floyd-griffin-jr-curlee-williams-individually-and-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1038\n(7th Cir. 2000) (\"The final amount to be paid . . . is unknown\nand unknowable at this point . . . .\"). The question presented\nby this appeal is not quantitative, so exact amounts are not\nmaterial. Rhode Island stands to receive a great deal of money.\n\n                                 -5-\n\favailable at http://www.dhs.state.ri.us/dhs/reports/ma2000.pdf.\n\nWhen the states sought to recover funds spent on health care\n\nmade necessary by smoking, some of their alleged damages were\n\nMedicaid expenditures.     So stated Rhode Island's complaint at\n\nthe time.\n\n            The recovery of Medicaid expenditures from the tobacco\n\nindustry arguably brought into play certain aspects of the\n\nfederal Medicaid statute. When a state agrees to participate in\n\nMedicaid by enacting a statute, it must create a plan that meets\n\nrequirements specified by Congress.     That state Medicaid plan\n\nmust \"provide that, as a condition of eligibility for medical\n\nassistance under the State plan . . . the individual is required\n\n-- (A) to assign the State any rights . . . to payment for\n\nmedical care from any third party.\"        42 U.S.C. § 1396k(a)\n\n(1994).\n\n            Moreover, when a state, acting on an individual's\n\nassignment of his or her rights, has recovered from a third\n\nparty compensation for state expenditures to provide health care\n\nvia Medicaid, the state may not necessarily keep all of the\n\nmoney.    Instead,\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          [s]uch part of any amount collected by the State under\n          an assignment made under the provisions of this\n          section shall be retained by the State as is necessary\n          to reimburse it for medical assistance payments made\n          on behalf of an individual with respect to whom such\n          assignment    was    executed     (with    appropriate\n          reimbursement of the Federal Government to the extent\n          of its participation in the financing of such medical\n          assistance), and the remainder of such amount\n          collected shall be paid to such individual.\n\nId. § 1396k(b) (emphasis added).2            After the state and federal\n\ngovernments     are   reimbursed,      any    excess     is   paid    to   the\n\nindividual, \"who is usually a person of limited resources.\"                 45\n\nFed. Reg. 8982, 8983 (Feb. 11, 1980).\n\n          If these provisions apply to the Master Settlement\n\nAgreement (Rhode Island claims they do not because the suit was\n\nbrought   not   as    a   §   1396k   assignment   but    under      different\n\ntheories) then at least some of the money that the tobacco\n\nindustry paid the states under the Agreement belongs to the\n\n\n    2     This language is clarified by regulation:\n\n    The agency must distribute collections as follows --\n         (a) To itself, an amount equal to State Medicaid\n         expenditures for the individual on whose right the\n         collection was based.\n         (b) To the Federal Government, the Federal share of the\n         State Medicaid expenditures, minus any incentive payment\n         made in accordance with [a related provision] . . . .\n         (c) To the recipient, any remaining amount. . . .\n\n42 C.F.R. § 433.153 (2000).\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffederal government as appropriate reimbursement within the\n\nmeaning of § 1396k(b).   If, as well, the states received more\n\nmoney from the tobacco industry under the Agreement than was\n\nnecessary to reimburse both the state and federal governments\n\nfor medical assistance payments made on behalf of smokers, then\n\nthe remainder belongs to the smokers on whose behalf those\n\npayments were made.   Greenless's claim rests on this theory.\n\n         Congress has recently amended the statute.    The 1999\n\nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act exempts from the\n\nnormal procedures by which the federal government takes its\n\nshare of state recoveries \"any amount recovered or paid to a\n\nState as part of the comprehensive settlement of November 1998\n\nbetween manufacturers of tobacco products . . . and State\n\nAttorneys General.\"   Pub. L. No. 106-31, § 3031, 113 Stat. 57,\n\n103-04 (1999) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(i) (Supp.\n\nV 1999)). It furthermore provides, with an exception irrelevant\n\nto this case, that \"a State may use amounts recovered or paid to\n\nthe State as part of a comprehensive . . . settlement . . .\n\ndescribed in [the prior] clause . . . for any expenditures\n\ndetermined appropriate by the State.\"    Id., 113 Stat. at 104\n\n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)).\n\n                              -8-\n\f         The parties agree that this new language removes any\n\nclaim to the states' tobacco settlement money by the federal\n\ngovernment.   The question presented by this appeal is whether\n\nthe language also removes any possible claim to that money under\n\nfederal law by the individuals whose illnesses caused the states\n\nto spend the money.\n\n\n\n\n                              -9-\n\fB.   History\n\n          Greenless filed this suit in the District of Rhode\n\nIsland   against   the   various    defendants     in   their   official\n\ncapacities, claiming that Rhode Island must pay her and the\n\nmembers of her class the amount by which the tobacco settlement\n\nexceeds its actual costs.          She alleged this amount to be\n\nsubstantial.   For her cause of action she relied on 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 and its broad-ranging remedies for violations of federal\n\nrights under color of state law.          She asked for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief to compel Rhode Island's officials to pay her\n\nthe alleged excess.\n\n          The defendants moved to dismiss on two grounds.

We recommend this course to the\n\ndistrict courts of this circuit as the wiser approach.\n\nB.   Statutory interpretation\n\n             There are two reasons to doubt whether the amended\n\nMedicaid statute will support Greenless's claim.            The first\n\nreason is that it is not clear whether any of the money\n\nrecovered by Rhode Island is money to which Greenless and her\n\nclass can stake a claim under § 1396k(b) as it stood at the time\n\nof the settlements. See McClendon, 261 F.3d at 1259-62; Watson,\n\n261 F.3d at 443-45.      The second reason, and the one on which we\n\nbase   our    holding,   is   §   1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii),   added    by   the\n\nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999, Pub. L. No.\n\n106-31, 113 Stat. 57, 103-04 (1999).          We find persuasive the\n\nreasoning of Tyler, in which the Second Circuit held that\n\n§ 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii) was plain and foreclosed a suit similar to\n\nthe present one.     Tyler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1230630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5-8.           We agree\n\nwith the Second Circuit that the funds described in that section\n\nas available \"for any expenditures determined appropriate by the\n\n\nthe plaintiffs could sue the state, and then concluding that\nsuch a suit was not possible).\n\n                                   -18-\n\fState\" cannot simultaneously be owed to Medicaid recipients.\n\nId. at *6 (quoting § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)).\n\n          Greenless makes two arguments against this reading of\n\n§   1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)   based     on    traditional   principles    of\n\nstatutory interpretation.       First, she claims that the reading\n\nviolates the presumption against implied repeal.            Second, she\n\nclaims that the reading violates the presumption against giving\n\nlegislation retroactive effect. Although these two presumptions\n\nare well-known landmarks of this area of the law, neither\n\napplies to this case.\n\n          The \"implied repeal\" argument is an odd one because at\n\nissue is not whether Congress totally repealed § 1396k, but\n\nwhether it intended to carve out tobacco settlement monies from\n\nthe reach of that provision.            But we will use Greenless's\n\nterminology.    She argues that the amendment only waives the\n\nfederal government's share of the settlement and does not affect\n\nany rights of individuals.       Not so.     The presumption against\n\nimplied repeal, although of particular force when, as here,\n\napplied   to   appropriations     riders,    nevertheless    turns   on\n\nlegislative intent. United States v. Will, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110365\"><a href=\"/opinion/110365/united-states-v-will/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221-24\n\n(1980) (\"[W]hen Congress desires to suspend or repeal a statute\n\n                                 -19-\n\fin force, '[t]here can be no doubt that . . . it could\n\naccomplish its purpose by an amendment to an appropriation bill,\n\nor otherwise.'\" (quoting United States v. Dickerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103370\"><a href=\"/opinion/103370/united-states-v-dickerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (1940)) (second and third alterations in Will)).\n\nIndeed, the presumption results from certain assumptions that\n\ncourts make about the legislative process:\n\n         Courts do not lightly assume that one statute has\n         implicitly repealed another.     This principle is a\n         product of a set of beliefs about the legislative\n         process -- in particular, a belief that Congress,\n         focused as it usually is on a particular problem,\n         should not be understood to have eliminated without\n         specific consideration another program that was likely\n         the product of sustained attention.\n\nC. R. Sunstein, Interpreting Statutes in the Regulatory State,\n\n103 Harv. L. Rev. 405, 475 (1989) (footnote omitted).     These\n\nconcerns have less force where, as here, Congress was responding\n\nto a recent event, the Master Settlement Agreement, and was\n\nclear in its language.   The only even arguable doubt is whether\n\nthat repeal covered Medicaid recipients' possible claims as well\n\nas the federal government's.    In our view the plain statutory\n\nlanguage means both.8\n\n\n    8     Even were we to apply the presumption against implied\nrepeal, that presumption can be overcome by an \"irreconciliable\nconflict\" between statutes. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.\n\n                               -20-\n\f           The presumption against retroactivity also does not\n\naffect the result in this case.      It is true that as a general\n\nmatter Congress must speak clearly to make its legislation\n\nretroactive.   Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280\n\n(1994).9   Whatever the proper characterization of the relief\n\nGreenless seeks in this case, Congress made its intent clear in\n\nthe amendment, which \"applies to all funds received under the\n\nMaster Settlement Agreement, whether past, present, or future.\"\n\nHarris, 264 F.3d at 1296.\n\n\n\n\nEpstein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118001\"><a href=\"/opinion/118001/matsushita-elec-industrial-co-v-epstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 381 (1996) (quoting Kremer v.

It is impossible to reconcile § 1396k(b)'s\nrequirement that \"the remainder of [the tobacco settlement]\nshall be paid to such individual\" with § 1396b(d)(3)(B)(ii)'s\npermission to use the money \"for any expenditures determined\nappropriate by the State.\"\n     9    We disregard the tension between Greenless's argument\nfor Eleventh Amendment purposes that she seeks prospective\nrelief for a future injury, rather than retrospective\ncompensation for a past injury, and her argument that our\nreading of the statute renders it retroactive. See Landgraf,\n511 U.S. at 273 (\"When the intervening statute authorizes or\naffects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the\nnew provision is not retroactive.\").\n\n                              -21-\n\f                                  III.\n\n         To avoid the unnecessary resolution of a difficult\n\nconstitutional   question,   we    have   assessed   the   merits   of\n\nGreenless's case and have found that she has failed to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief may be granted.      Therefore, although we\n\ndo not reach the reasoning of the district court's opinion, its\n\njudgment dismissing the case is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f</pre>",
