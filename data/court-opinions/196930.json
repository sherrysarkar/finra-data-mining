An early-morning assault in\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\r\n\nMashpee,  Massachusetts, on  August 29,  1991, resulted  in a\r\n\nchase  through  nearby woods  and  the  arrest  of Daniel  D.\r\n\nTavares.  On May 15, 1992, Tavares was convicted of violating\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    922(g), the  felon in  possession of  a firearm\r\n\nstatute.  Tavares appealed, and  this court, sitting en banc,\r                                                                        \r\n\nreversed  his  conviction on  the  ground  that the  district\r\n\ncourt's decision to  allow the government to prove the \"prior\r\n\nfelon\" element of Section 922(g) rather than accept a defense\r\n\nstipulation created  unfair prejudice.  See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nTavares, 21  F.3d 1 (1st Cir.  1994) (en banc).   There was a\r                                                         \r\n\nsecond  trial and, on March 30, 1995, Tavares was again found\r\n\nguilty.  He appeals, asserting: (i) a variety of trial errors\r\n\nin  a pro  se  submission;  and  (ii) two  sentencing  errors\r                         \r\n\nthrough  a  counsel  assisted  submission.    We  affirm  the\r\n\ndistrict court  on the claimed  trial errors, but  vacate and\r\n\nremand on the sentencing issues.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                            \r\n\n          On  August  29, 1991,  Tavares  and his  companion,\r\n\nCyril  Pocknett, Jr.,  were in  a confrontation  with Sheldon\r\n\nBlake and Rodney Hunt over accusations of the  theft of a car\r\n\nstereo.  Threats were exchanged,  but no violence ensued, and\r\n\nTavares and Pocknett left the area.  Blake and Hunt then went\r\n\nto  Blake's  apartment.     Blake  lived  in  a  second-floor\r\n\napartment with his girlfriend,  Nicole Cain, and their infant\r\n\ndaughter.   About  an  hour and  a  half later,  Tavares  and\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nPocknett returned and buzzed Blake's front door.  Hunt opened\r\n\nthe door and Tavares greeted  him with a shotgun to  the head\r\n\nand the words, \"What's up  now, motherfucker?\"  Standing next\r\n\nto Tavares was Pocknett, aiming a .22 caliber rifle at Hunt.\r\n\n          Acting  on instinct,  Hunt grabbed  the  barrels of\r\n\nboth  rifles, pushed them down,  and fled up  the stairs into\r\n\nBlake's apartment.  Tavares then fired his shotgun repeatedly\r\n\ninto Blake's nearby parked car.  Meanwhile, Hunt noticed that\r\n\nhis hand was bleeding.  Apparently, in grabbing the barrel of\r\n\nTavares' shotgun, he had  ripped the palm of his  hand on the\r\n\ngun's sight.\r\n\n          Cain,  on  hearing  the  gunshots,  rushed  to  her\r\n\ndaughter's  bedroom to  protect her from  danger.   After the\r\n\nshots subsided, she looked out the window and saw Tavares and\r\n\nPocknett   running   toward  the   nearby  woods.     Shortly\r\n\nthereafter, the police arrived.  They searched the woods, and\r\n\nafter a chase, captured Tavares.  They also found the shotgun\r\n\nand .22 caliber rifle, hidden under pine needles.  \r\n\n          Back at the apartment  building, Hunt, whose  right\r\n\nhand was bleeding profusely,  wrapped it in a rag  which soon\r\n\nbecame bloodsoaked.   On entering the  building, Officer Alan\r\n\nRoguzac  observed pools of blood  in both the  hallway and on\r\n\nthe carpeting leading  up to Blake's apartment.   Soon after,\r\n\non  seeing Hunt's  wound, Roguzac  radioed for  an ambulance.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nHunt was taken to the Falmouth Hospital emergency room, where\r\n\nhis hand received eight stitches.\r\n\n          Cain,  Blake  and  Hunt  were  interviewed  by  the\r\n\npolice. Specifically,  Cain spoke to Sergeant  David Mace and\r\n\nDetective Doris Dottridge.\r\n\nTrial\r                 \r\n\n          Cain  did not testify at  Tavares' first trial.  At\r\n\nhis second trial, however, she testified that on the night of\r\n\nthe incident she had told a male police officer and Dottridge\r\n\nthat  she had seen Tavares  with a gun.   Dottridge could not\r\n\nrecollect any  such statement  by Cain,   but Mace  testified\r\n\nthat he was the male police officer to whom Cain had made her\r\n\nstatement.  Tavares attacked Mace's testimony by pointing out\r\n\nthat Mace's police report  did not specifically report Cain's\r\n\nstatement. Instead,  Mace's report said only  that \"they\" had\r\n\nseen  Tavares with a gun.   Tavares argued  that \"they\" meant\r\n\nonly  Hunt  and  Blake,  whereas Mace  asserted  that  \"they\"\r\n\nincluded Cain as well.\r\n\n          At the conclusion of  the six-day second trial, the\r\n\njury  requested the  transcripts  of the  testimony of  Cain,\r\n\nHunt,   Blake,  and Earl  Cash, another  witness.   The court\r\n\nexplained to the  jury that, thanks  to the court  reporter's\r\n\npersonal investment  in certain equipment, the  court had the\r\n\nunusual  ability to  provide them  with transcripts  within a\r\n\nshort period of time.  The court noted, however, that despite\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthe reporter's speed, skill and equipment, since the reporter\r\n\nwas needed on a different case the next morning, he might not\r\n\nbe able to  satisfy all of the jury's requests,  and that the\r\n\njury was  to proceed in its deliberations  nevertheless.  The\r\n\nnext morning, the jury was  provided with the transcripts for\r\n\nCain, Hunt, and Cash, but not Blake.  The court told the jury\r\n\nthat, if  possible,  it  would get  them  the  transcript  of\r\n\nBlake's testimony, but  reiterated that  they should  proceed\r\n\nregardless. Within  a little over an hour, and without having\r\n\nreceived  the  transcript  of  Blake's  testimony,  the  jury\r\n\nreturned a verdict of guilty.\r\n\nSentencing\r                      \r\n\n          Tavares was sentenced to ten years in prison.   The\r\n\nguideline applicable to his offense of conviction was Section\r\n\n2K2.1 (unlawful  possession of a  firearm).   See U.S.S.G.   \r                                                             \r\n\n2K2.1  (Nov. 1990).1  The  court then  applied Section  2A2.2\r\n\n(aggravated assault)  by way of a  cross-reference in Section\r\n\n2K2.1.2    As  a  result  of  applying  the  cross-reference,\r\n\nTavares' offense  level jumped  from twelve to  twenty-three.\r\n\nLevel twenty-three  represented a  starting offense  level of\r\n\nfifteen  for aggravated  assault  plus an  increase of  eight\r\n\nlevels for specific offense characteristics  -- a three-level\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The court applied the version of the Guidelines in effect\r\nat the time of Tavares' offense.  Neither party contends that\r\na different version should apply.\r\n\n2.  See U.S.S.G.    2K2.1(c)(2) and 2X1.1(c)(1). \r                   \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nincrease  for the  victim's  bodily injury  and a  five-level\r\n\nincrease  for the discharge  of a firearm.   The Pre-Sentence\r\n\nInvestigation  Report  recommended  that the  court  sentence\r\n\nTavares under the aggravated assault guideline because he had\r\n\npointed  a  loaded  shotgun  at his  victim's  head,  thereby\r\n\nevincing  an  \"intent to  do bodily  harm.\"   See  U.S.S.G.  \r                                                             \r\n\n2A2.2, comment. (n.1(a)).   The Guidelines define \"aggravated\r\n\nassault\"  as \"a  felonious assault  that involved\"  either \"a\r\n\ndangerous  weapon with  intent to  do bodily harm  (i.e., not\r                                                                    \r\n\nmerely to frighten)\" or \"serious bodily injury\" or \"intent to\r\n\ncommit another  felony.\"   U.S.S.G.   2A2.2,  comment. (n.1).\r\n\n          At  sentencing,  however,  Tavares  protested  that\r\n\nthere was  insufficient record  support for either  a finding\r\n\nthat he had had the  requisite intent to do bodily harm  or a\r\n\nfinding that serious bodily injury had resulted.  Instead, he\r\n\nsaid,  the  evidence showed  that  he  had  merely  meant  to\r\n\nfrighten  his victim.    Additionally, Tavares  argued  that,\r\n\nunder the  Guidelines, a serious  bodily injury was  one that\r\n\nrequired hospitalization or surgery.   The government  argued\r\n\nthat  the injury Tavares' victim had suffered, i.e., a cut to\r                                                               \r\n\nthe hand requiring  a trip  to the emergency  room and  eight\r\n\nstitches, was  in fact  a  serious bodily  injury within  the\r\n\nGuidelines'  definition.    See  id. and  U.S.S.G.     1B1.1,\r                                                \r\n\ncomment. (n.1(j)).   The court  accepted this argument.   The\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nresulting   Guidelines   sentencing  range,   given  Tavares'\r\n\ncriminal history category (\"CHC\") of IV, was 70-87 months.\r\n\n          The sentencing  court then departed  upward by  two\r\n\nCHC  levels  and  one  offense  level  to  achieve  a   final\r\n\nsentencing range  of 110-125 months.   See U.S.S.G.    4A1.3,\r                                                      \r\n\np.s.   (departures  beyond   CHC  VI   may  occasionally   be\r\n\nappropriate  in  cases  of an  \"egregious,  serious  criminal\r\n\nrecord\").  The court's stated basis for  the upward departure\r\n\nwas that Tavares had,  in fact, committed three state  crimes\r\n\n(that had resulted in  \"guilty filed\" dispositions as opposed\r\n\nto  outright convictions3) that  were not counted  in his CHC\r\n\nscore and  that a CHC  of IV did  not adequately  reflect the\r\n\ntrue seriousness of Tavares' chronic criminality.\r\n\n          Tavares appeals, asserting errors in both the trial\r\n\nand sentencing.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Trial\r                                             \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  \"Guilty  filed\"  dispositions   in  the  Commonwealth  of\r\nMassachusetts involve an admission  of sufficient facts for a\r\npossible finding of guilt,  but not an explicit  admission of\r\nguilt.   The primary focus  of the  sentencing hearing  after\r\nTavares'  second  federal  trial  was whether  three  of  his\r\n\"guilty  filed\" dispositions counted as predicate convictions\r\nunder  the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\").  See 18 U.S.C.\r                                                               \r\n  924(e).  The sentencing court ruled that the \"guilty filed\"\r\ndispositions could  not be  counted as convictions  under the\r\nACCA.    The  court explained,  however,  that  as  there was\r\nsufficient evidence  that Tavares  had in fact  committed the\r\nstate crimes,  and because,  had they been  convictions, they\r\nwould have resulted in a minimum federal sentence  of fifteen\r\nyears,  it was going to depart upward and sentence Tavares to\r\nten years.        \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Tavares'  pro  se brief  asserts that  the district\r                                       \r\n\ncourt committed  reversible error in: (i)  failing to provide\r\n\nthe jury with a transcript of a particular witness' testimony\r\n\nthat it had  requested and instructing  the jurors that  they\r\n\nshould proceed  to deliberate  without that transcript;  (ii)\r\n\npermitting  the   jury  to  \"view\"  the   allegedly  perjured\r\n\ntestimony of a witness; (iii) failing to ask the jury whether\r\n\nits request for transcripts pertained to the instant trial or\r\n\nprior proceedings.   Because contemporaneous  objections were\r\n\nnot made  with respect to  any of the  claims, review is  for\r\n\nplain error.   See,  e.g., United States  v. Cruz-Kuilan,  75\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 59,  62 (1st Cir.  1996).  We discern  no miscarriage of\r\n\njustice  and Tavares'  claims fail this  review.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 751 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                     \r\n\nA. Failure to Provide Transcript \r                                            \r\n\n          After  deliberations commenced,  the jury  asked to\r\n\nreview the testimony of four witnesses: Cain,  Hunt, Cash and\r\n\nBlake.  The  next morning, the court was  able to provide the\r\n\njury with transcripts  for Cain, Hunt  and Cash, but  Blake's\r\n\nwas not yet ready.  The court reporter  was needed on another\r\n\ncase  and the court told  the jurors that,  if possible, they\r\n\nwould be  provided with the transcript, but  that they should\r\n\nproceed with their deliberations regardless.   Tavares argues\r\n\nthat this was reversible error.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Decisions   regarding   the   provision  of   trial\r\n\ntranscripts  to the  jury are  within  the discretion  of the\r\n\ntrial judge.

Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 226\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1991) (decision as to  whether requested testimony\r\n\nshould be reread to jury  rests in trial court's discretion).\r\n\nIn making  its  decision,  the  trial judge  is  to  consider\r\n\nfactors such as the ease or difficulty of compliance with the\r\n\njury's request  and what is likely to be gained or lost.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nThe  court  here provided  the jury  with  three of  the four\r\n\ntranscripts requested.   The one transcript  not provided was\r\n\nthat  of Blake, who had testified most recently, and that was\r\n\nbecause  the court reporter was needed for another case.  Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nid. (where testimony is fresh in jury's mind there is less of\r               \r\n\na need for  rereading).  We discern no plain  error either in\r\n\nthe  non-provision of  the transcript  or in  the instruction\r\n\nthat the jury should continue deliberations.\r\n\nB. Perjured Testimony\r                                 \r\n\n          Tavares argues that  the court erred  in permitting\r\n\nthe  jury  to  \"view\"  the  perjured  testimony  of  Cain,  a\r\n\ngovernment  witness.4    Tavares  further  asserts  that  the\r\n\ngovernment knew or should have known that not only was Cain's\r\n\ntestimony  perjured,  but that  the  supporting  testimony of\r\n\nSergeant Mace  was perjured as  well.  Tavares,  however, has\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  We  assume  that  Tavares  is referring  to  the  court's\r\nprovision of the jury with the transcript of Cain's testimony\r\nduring deliberations.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nnot  shown that either witness committed perjury.  And so the\r\n\nargument fails for want of a foundational piece.\r\n\n          Cain testified  at the  instant trial that:  (a) on\r\n\nthe night of  the incident, she  saw Tavares with a  gun; and\r\n\n(b) that she had told this to the police on the  scene.  Cain\r\n\ndid not, however, testify at Tavares' first trial.\r\n\n          Tavares  says that  her  testimony  at the  instant\r\n\ntrial  must have been perjured because there was no record of\r\n\nher having  related this  information to  the  police on  the\r\n\nnight in  question.   Tavares theorizes that  the government,\r\n\nhaving been reversed once,  used perjured testimony to ensure\r\n\nits victory  in the second  trial.  As support,  he points to\r\n\nthe  testimony of  Dottridge, one of  the officers  whom Cain\r\n\nallegedly  told of having seen Tavares with a gun.  Dottridge\r\n\ntestified  that she could not recall  Cain having stated that\r\n\nshe  saw Tavares with a  gun.  There  was, however, testimony\r\n\nfrom Dottridge's  colleague, Mace,  that he had  heard Cain's\r\n\nstatement.   But Tavares says that Mace's testimony must have\r\n\nbeen perjury as  well because  Mace's police  report did  not\r\n\nstate specifically  that Cain  had seen Tavares  with a  gun.\r\n\nInstead, Mace's  report stated  that \"they\" had  seen Tavares\r\n\nwith  a  gun,  without  specifying   which  witnesses  \"they\"\r\n\nreferred to.\r\n\n          \"[A]  conviction obtained  by  the knowing  use  of\r\n\nperjured testimony  is fundamentally unfair, and  must be set\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\naside if there  is any reasonable  likelihood that the  false\r\n\ntestimony  could have  affected  the judgment  of the  jury.\"\r\n\nUnited States  v. Agurs, 427  U.S. 97, 103  (1976) (footnotes\r                                   \r\n\nomitted).  Under federal law, perjury occurs when a  \"witness\r\n\ntestifying  under  oath   or  affirmation . . . gives   false\r\n\ntestimony  concerning  a  material matter  with  the  willful\r\n\nintent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of\r\n\nconfusion,  mistake, or  faulty  memory.\"   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nDunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993) (referring to the definition\r                    \r\n\nof  perjury under 18 U.S.C.    1621).   Tavares, however, has\r\n\npointed  to no  more  than an  inconsistency (between  Cain's\r\n\ntestimony and that of Dottridge) and an unclear police report\r\n\n(that of Mace).   Inconsistent testimony  by itself does  not\r\n\namount  to perjury, nor does an unclear police report make it\r\n\nso.  See  United States v. Gary, 74 F.3d  304, 314 (1st Cir.)\r                                           \r\n\n(\"it  is axiomatic that inconsistent  testimony is not per se\r                                                                         \r\n\nperjurious\"), cert. denied, 116  S.Ct. 2567 (1996).  Further,\r                                      \r\n\nthe fact that Cain  did not testify at Tavares'  first trial,\r\n\nbut did at the  second, avails Tavares naught.   See Anderson\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

We  decline his invitation  that we now\r\n\nfind willful  intent to provide  false testimony based  on no\r\n\nmore than an  inconsistency in testimony  and a dispute  over\r\n\nthe clarity of a police report.\r\n\nC.  Transcript From Prior Trial   \r                                           \r\n\n          Tavares'  final trial-related  claim  is  that  the\r\n\ncourt misunderstood the  jury's request  for transcripts  and\r\n\nsent  in  the  wrong transcripts.    The  court  sent in  the\r\n\ntranscripts of the instant  trial, but Tavares says  that the\r                                             \r\n\njury  was, in fact,  requesting the transcripts  of his prior\r                                                                         \r\n\ntrial for the same offense.  The claim is unavailing.\r                 \r\n\n          To  the extent  there was  ambiguity in  the jury's\r\n\nrequest  for   transcripts,  Tavares   had  the   ability  to\r\n\ncontemporaneously request  clarification.  He did  not do so.\r\n\nNor has Tavares  pointed to  any sign that  the jury  thought\r\n\nthat  they had been given  the wrong transcripts.   We reject\r\n\nthe claim.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                             \r\n\n                         Sentencing \r                                               \r\n\n          In his counsel-assisted submission,  Tavares claims\r\n\nthat the  sentencing court erred in: (i)  determining that he\r\n\nhad committed an aggravated assault and that his sentence was\r\n\nthus governed by Section 2A2.2; and (ii) in  determining that\r\n\nhe  had an  egregious,  serious criminal  record that,  under\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nSection  4A1.3,  warranted  an  upward   departure  from  the\r\n\nGuidelines' recommended  range of 70-87 months  to a sentence\r\n\nof 120 months.5  A. Aggravated Assault\r                                                  \r\n\n          Tavares argues that  the sentencing court  erred in\r\n\ndetermining that his offense was an aggravated assault within\r\n\nthe  meaning of Section 2A2.2.   However, because  of a fact-\r\n\nbased internal  inconsistency in  the court's  application of\r\n\nSection 2A2.2, we are unable to decide the merits of Tavares'\r\n\nchallenge and remand for clarification and resentencing.\r\n\n          The aggravated assault  guideline is structured  so\r\n\nthat a  victim's serious  bodily injury both  functions as  a\r\n\ntrigger for the application  of the guideline as a  whole and\r                                                                         \r\n\nprovides  a   basis,  in  applying  the   guideline,  for  an\r\n\nadditional upward  offense level adjustment.   In effect, the\r\n\nguideline provides two separate  opportunities for a court to\r\n\ngive  effect  to a  finding of  serious  bodily injury.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 673-75 (1st Cir. 1992)\r                                   \r\n\n(double   counting   of   victim's  serious   bodily   injury\r\n\npermissible under Section 2A2.2),  cert. denied, 510 U.S. 812\r                                                           \r\n\n(1993).   Here,  the sentencing  court appeared  to determine\r\n\nthat  the  victim  had  suffered serious  bodily  injury  for\r\n\npurposes  of  deciding the  applicability,  vel  non, of  the\r                                                                \r\n\naggravated  assault guideline, but  also determined  that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Tavares' pro se brief  raises the same sentencing issues,\r                               \r\nalbeit  with  less clarity.    We,  therefore,  focus on  his\r\ncounsel-assisted submission.   \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nvictim had suffered something less than serious bodily injury\r                                              \r\n\nfor purposes of applying the guideline's  internal provisions\r\n\nfor offense level adjustment.\r\n\n          The  Guidelines  define  aggravated  assault  as  a\r\n\nfelonious assault involving:\r\n\n          (a) a dangerous weapon  with intent to do\r\n          bodily   harm   (i.e.,   not  merely   to\r                                           \r\n          frighten), or\r\n          (b) serious bodily injury, or\r\n          (c) an intent to commit another felony.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2A2.2, comment. (n.1).  Serious bodily injury, in\r\n\nturn, is defined as:\r\n\n          [(i)]  injury  involving extreme  pain or\r\n          the impairment of a function  of a bodily\r\n          member, organ or mental faculty; or\r\n          [(ii)]  requiring   medical  intervention\r\n          such  as   surgery,  hospitalization,  or\r\n          physical rehabilitation.6\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    1B1.1,  comment.  (n.1(j)).   Tavares caused  his\r\n\nvictim to suffer  a laceration  to the hand  that required  a\r\n\ntrip to the  emergency room  and eight stitches.   The  court\r\n\ndetermined that that injury  was sufficiently analogous to an\r\n\ninjury  requiring  surgery,   hospitalization,  or   physical\r\n\nrehabilitation  to  fall  within  the  definition of  serious\r\n\nbodily injury; thus, Section 2A2.2 applied.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  In  contrast,   \"bodily  injury\"   is  defined  as   \"any\r\nsignificant  injury;  e.g., an  injury  that  is painful  and\r                                      \r\nobvious,  or  is  of  a  type  for  which  medical  attention\r\nordinarily  would be  sought.\"   U.S.S.G.    1B1.1,  comment.\r\n(n.1(b)). \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          The court did not find on the record before it that\r\n\nthe brandishing  of  the shotgun  itself  was done  with  the\r\n\n\"intent  to  do bodily  harm.\"   Absent  such a  finding, the\r\n\naggravated assault  determination could  not  be premised  on\r\n\nnote 1, part  (a), of the commentary to Section 2A2.2.  While\r\n\nsuch  an intent  may in  fact have  been present,  the record\r\n\nbefore the  district court  did not  require such a  finding.\r\n\nWe, therefore, cannot rest an affirmance on such a ground.\r\n\n          The  next  step  was  to  calculate adjustments  to\r\n\nTavares' offense level under the specific offense  adjustment\r\n\nprovisions  of  the   aggravated  assault  guideline.     The\r\n\naggravated assault guideline provides for different increases\r\n\nin  the offense  level, depending on  the seriousness  of the\r\n\nvictim's injury:\r\n\n          If  the  victim sustained  bodily injury,\r\n          increase the offense  level according  to\r\n          the seriousness of the injury:\r\n\n          Degree of Bodily Injury    Increase in Level\r                                                                  \r\n\n          (A) Bodily Injury            add 2\r\n          (B) Serious Bodily Injury    add 4\r                                               \r\n          (C) Permanent or\r\n              Life-Threatening \r\n              Bodily Injury            add 6\r\n\n          (D)If  the   degree  of  injury  is   between  that\r                                                                         \r\nspecified\r                     \r\n          in subdivision (A) and (B),  add 3 levels; or\r                                                               \r\n\n          (E)If   the  degree  of   injury  is  between  that\r\nspecified\r\n          in subdivisions (B) and (C), add 5 levels.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.     2A2.2(b)(3) (emphasis  added).    The sentencing\r\n\ncourt increased  Tavares' offense  level by three.   A  three\r                                                             \r\n\nlevel  increase applies  when the  magnitude of  the victim's\r\n\ninjury is  between  bodily injury and  serious bodily injury.\r                              \r\n\nSee  U.S.S.G.   2A2.2(b)(3)(D).   But  this  determination --\r               \r\n\nthat  the victim's  injury  was less  than  a serious  bodily\r                                                \r\n\ninjury  -- is in direct  conflict with the  court's basis for\r\n\napplying the aggravated assault guideline in the first place,\r\n\ni.e., that  the victim had suffered a serious bodily injury.7\r                \r\n\n          Were  the inconsistency in  the court's application\r\n\nof  Section 2A2.2 a purely legal  matter, we might be able to\r\n\nresolve it ourselves, without the need to remand.  But we  do\r\n\nnot think that the question can  be reduced to a purely legal\r\n\none.  Depending on context, an inch long laceration requiring\r\n\neight stitches  might or might not  constitute serious bodily\r\n\ninjury.  For  example, if  there was  a great  deal of  blood\r\n\nloss, or the victim  was a hemophiliac, such an  injury might\r\n\nwell  be thought serious.  More generally, we cannot say that\r\n\nthe  victim's injury in  this case  is of  a kind  that would\r                                                             \r\n\ncategorically call  for its characterization as  \"serious\" or\r                         \r\n\nnot.

We  note that  a three  level increase  in offense  level\r\nwould  not  have  produced such  a  conflict  if the  court's\r\ndecision to  apply  Section  2A2.2  had been  premised  on  a\r\ndetermination that there  was an \"intent to do  bodily harm.\"\r\nSee U.S.S.G.   2A2.2, comment.

This  is  not a  case in  which  the record  either\r\n\nclearly  precludes or  mandates a  finding of  serious bodily\r\n\ninjury.   In the context of clear error review, it is not for\r\n\nthis court to choose  between two mutually inconsistent fact-\r\n\nbased determinations that each has some plausibility in light\r\n\nof  the record.   Since,  on this record, we cannot reconcile\r\n\nor  resolve  the  sentencing  court's dual  findings  of  the\r\n\nseverity of the  victim's injury, we are  left no alternative\r\n\nbut  to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.  The\r\n\ndistrict court is free to make new findings or reconsider the\r\n\nbasis for  the  adjustment entirely.   Cf.  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nWester,    F.3d   ,   , slip op. at 21, No. 95-1143 (1st Cir.\r                  \r\n\nJuly 22, 1996). \r\n\nB. Egregious, Serious Criminal Record\r                                                 \r\n\n          Tavares  next  argues  that   the  court  erred  in\r\n\ndeparting upward from the recommended  70-87 month sentencing\r\n\nrange (that  applied as a  result of applying  the aggravated\r\n\nassault  guideline)  to  a  sentence  of  120  months.    The\r\n\nsentencing court  made the  departure  because it  determined\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nthat  the CHC  of  IV  that  had  produced  the  70-87  month\r\n\nrecommended   range  did  not   adequately  reflect  Tavares'\r\n\nextensive criminal  record.  It  therefore increased Tavares'\r\n\nCHC level by two,  to CHC VI (the Guidelines'  highest level,\r\n\nresulting in a  sentencing range of 92-115  months), and then\r\n\nwithin  CHC VI, departed higher  still, to a  sentence of 120\r\n\nmonths.    The  Guidelines,   in  the  proper  circumstances,\r\n\nencourage  departures  in  CHC  levels, but,  for  departures\r\n\nbeyond CHC VI, require that the defendant have an \"egregious,\r\n\nserious criminal record.\"   U.S.S.G.   4A1.3, p.s.;  see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Doe, 18  F.3d 41,  48-49 (1st  Cir. 1994);\r                                  \r\n\nUnited States  v. Mendez-Colon,  15 F.3d  188, 190  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1994).    Tavares argues  that  his criminal  record  was not\r\n\negregious and serious and that  the sentencing court erred in\r\n\ndetermining so.\r\n\n          The  sentencing court  explained that  had Tavares'\r\n\nthree \"guilty  filed\" dispositions from the  state court been\r\n\nconvictions, a  minimum sentence of fifteen  years would have\r\n\nresulted under  the ACCA.   See  18 U.S.C.    924(e).   Since\r                                           \r\n\nthere  were sufficient  facts  for the  court  to find  by  a\r\n\npreponderance  of the  evidence that  the three  state crimes\r\n\nwere  in  fact  committed,  it  found  a  ten  year  sentence\r\n\nappropriate.   Based on  Tavares' extensive criminal history,\r\n\nwe  see  no abuse  of discretion  in  the court's  upward CHC\r\n\ndeparture.  See United States v. Koon, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 2047-\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n48  (1996)  (abuse of  discretion  standard  appropriate when\r\n\nexamining  district  court's  decision  to  depart  from  the\r\n\nGuidelines).  Similarly, we see no abuse of discretion in the\r\n\nextent  of  the  departure.   See  id.    However, since  the\r                                                  \r\n\nsentencing   court's  offense   level  determination   is  in\r\n\nquestion, we leave it to the sentencing court to redetermine,\r\n\non remand, the extent of CHC departure warranted.\r\n\n77                           IV.\r                                            \r\n\n          The  judgment  of  conviction  is  affirmed.

Tavares.  On May 15, 1992, Tavares was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), the felon in possession of a firearm statute.  Tavares appealed, and this court, sitting en banc, reversed his conviction on the ground that the district court's decision to allow the government to prove the \"prior felon\" element of Section 922(g) rather than accept a defense stipulation created unfair prejudice.  See United States v. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1994) (en banc ).  There was a second trial and, on March 30, 1995, Tavares was again found guilty.  He appeals, asserting:  (i) a variety of trial errors in a pro se submission;  and (ii) two sentencing errors through a counsel assisted submission.  We affirm the district court on the claimed trial errors, but vacate and remand on the sentencing issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 1991, Tavares and his companion, Cyril Pocknett, Jr., were in a confrontation with Sheldon Blake and Rodney Hunt over accusations of the theft of a car stereo.  Threats were exchanged, but no violence ensued, and Tavares and Pocknett left the area.  Blake and Hunt then went to Blake's apartment.  Blake lived in a second-floor apartment with his girlfriend, Nicole Cain, and their infant daughter.  About an hour and a half later, Tavares and Pocknett returned and buzzed Blake's front door.  Hunt opened the door and Tavares greeted him with a shotgun to the head and the words, \"What's up now, motherfucker?\"   Standing next to Tavares was Pocknett, aiming a .22 caliber rifle at Hunt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on instinct, Hunt grabbed the barrels of both rifles, pushed them down, and fled up the stairs into Blake's apartment.  Tavares then fired his shotgun repeatedly into Blake's nearby parked car.  Meanwhile, Hunt noticed that his hand was bleeding.  Apparently, in grabbing the barrel of Tavares' shotgun, he had ripped the palm of his hand on the gun's sight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain, on hearing the gunshots, rushed to her daughter's bedroom to protect her from danger.  After the shots subsided, she looked out the window and saw Tavares and Pocknett running toward the nearby woods.  Shortly thereafter, the police arrived.  They searched the woods, and after a chase, captured Tavares.  They also found the shotgun and .22 caliber rifle, hidden under pine needles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Back at the apartment building, Hunt, whose right hand was bleeding profusely, wrapped it in a rag which soon became bloodsoaked.  On entering the building, Officer Alan Roguzac observed pools of blood in both the hallway and on the carpeting leading up to Blake's apartment.  Soon after, on seeing Hunt's wound, Roguzac radioed for an ambulance.  Hunt was taken to the Falmouth Hospital emergency room, where his hand received eight stitches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain, Blake and Hunt were interviewed by the police.  Specifically, Cain spoke to Sergeant David Mace and Detective Doris Dottridge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain did not testify at Tavares' first trial.  At his second trial, however, she testified that on the night of the incident she had told a male police officer and Dottridge that she had seen Tavares with a gun.  Dottridge could not recollect any such statement by Cain, but Mace testified that he was the male police officer to whom Cain had made her statement.  Tavares attacked Mace's testimony by pointing out that Mace's police report did not specifically report Cain's statement.  Instead, Mace's report said only that \"they\" had seen Tavares with a gun.  Tavares argued that \"they\" meant only Hunt and Blake, whereas Mace asserted that \"they\" included Cain as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the six-day second trial, the jury requested the transcripts of the testimony of Cain, Hunt, Blake, and Earl Cash, another witness.  The court explained to the jury that, thanks to the court reporter's personal investment in certain equipment, the court had the unusual ability to provide them with transcripts within a short period of time.  The court noted, however, that despite the reporter's speed, skill and equipment, since the reporter was needed on a different case the next morning, he might not be able to satisfy all of the jury's requests, and that the jury was to proceed in its deliberations nevertheless.  The next morning, the jury was provided with the transcripts for Cain, Hunt, and Cash, but not Blake.  The court told the jury that, if possible, it would get them the transcript of Blake's testimony, but reiterated that they should proceed regardless.  Within a little over an hour, and without having received the transcript of Blake's testimony, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares was sentenced to ten years in prison.  The guideline applicable to his offense of conviction was Section 2K2.1 (unlawful possession of a firearm).  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1 (Nov.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The court then applied Section 2A2.2 (aggravated assault) by way of a cross-reference in Section 2K2.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As a result of applying the cross-reference, Tavares' offense level jumped from twelve to twenty-three.  Level twenty-three represented a starting offense level of fifteen for aggravated assault plus an increase of eight levels for specific offense characteristics--a three-level increase for the victim's bodily injury and a five-level increase for the discharge of a firearm.  The Pre-Sentence Investigation Report recommended that the court sentence Tavares under the aggravated assault guideline because he had pointed a loaded shotgun at his victim's head, thereby evincing an \"intent to do bodily harm.\"   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, comment.  (n.1(a)).  The Guidelines define \"aggravated assault\" as \"a felonious assault that involved\" either \"a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten)\" or \"serious bodily injury\" or \"intent to commit another felony.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, comment.  (n.1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, however, Tavares protested that there was insufficient record support for either a finding that he had had the requisite intent to do bodily harm or a finding that serious bodily injury had resulted.  Instead, he said, the evidence showed that he had merely meant to frighten his victim.  Additionally, Tavares argued that, under the Guidelines, a serious bodily injury was one that required hospitalization or surgery.  The government argued that the injury Tavares' victim had suffered, i.e., a cut to the hand requiring a trip to the emergency room and eight stitches, was in fact a serious bodily injury within the Guidelines' definition.  See id. and U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.1, comment.  (n.1(j)).  The court accepted this argument.  The resulting Guidelines sentencing range, given Tavares' criminal history category (\"CHC\") of IV, was 70-87 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court then departed upward by two CHC levels and one offense level to achieve a final sentencing range of 110-125 months.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.  (departures beyond CHC VI may occasionally be appropriate in cases of an \"egregious, serious criminal record\").  The court's stated basis for the upward departure was that Tavares had, in fact, committed three state crimes (that had resulted in \"guilty filed\" dispositions as opposed to outright convictions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>) that were not counted in his CHC score and that a CHC of IV did not adequately reflect the true seriousness of Tavares' chronic criminality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares appeals, asserting errors in both the trial and sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares' pro se brief asserts that the district court committed reversible error in:  (i) failing to provide the jury with a transcript of a particular witness' testimony that it had requested and instructing the jurors that they should proceed to deliberate without that transcript;  (ii) permitting the jury to \"view\" the allegedly perjured testimony of a witness;  (iii) failing to ask the jury whether its request for transcripts pertained to the instant trial or prior proceedings.  Because contemporaneous objections were not made with respect to any of the claims, review is for plain error.  See, e.g., United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir.1996).  We discern no miscarriage of justice and Tavares' claims fail this review.  See, e.g., United States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 751 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Failure to Provide Transcript</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After deliberations commenced, the jury asked to review the testimony of four witnesses:  Cain, Hunt, Cash and Blake.  The next morning, the court was able to provide the jury with transcripts for Cain, Hunt and Cash, but Blake's was not yet ready.  The court reporter was needed on another case and the court told the jurors that, if possible, they would be provided with the transcript, but that they should proceed with their deliberations regardless.  Tavares argues that this was reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions regarding the provision of trial transcripts to the jury are within the discretion of the trial judge.  See United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 226 (1st Cir.1991) (decision as to whether requested testimony should be reread to jury rests in trial court's discretion).  In making its decision, the trial judge is to consider factors such as the ease or difficulty of compliance with the jury's request and what is likely to be gained or lost.   Id.  The court here provided the jury with three of the four transcripts requested.  The one transcript not provided was that of Blake, who had testified most recently, and that was because the court reporter was needed for another case.  Cf. id.  (where testimony is fresh in jury's mind there is less of a need for rereading).  We discern no plain error either in the non-provision of the transcript or in the instruction that the jury should continue deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Perjured Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares argues that the court erred in permitting the jury to \"view\" the perjured testimony of Cain, a government witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Tavares further asserts that the government knew or should have known that not only was Cain's testimony perjured, but that the supporting testimony of Sergeant Mace was perjured as well.  Tavares, however, has not shown that either witness committed perjury.  And so the argument fails for want of a foundational piece.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain testified at the instant trial that:  (a) on the night of the incident, she saw Tavares with a gun;  and (b) that she had told this to the police on the scene.  Cain did not, however, testify at Tavares' first trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares says that her testimony at the instant trial must have been perjured because there was no record of her having related this information to the police on the night in question.  Tavares theorizes that the government, having been reversed once, used perjured testimony to ensure its victory in the second trial.  As support, he points to the testimony of Dottridge, one of the officers whom Cain allegedly told of having seen Tavares with a gun.  Dottridge testified that she could not recall Cain having stated that she saw Tavares with a gun.  There was, however, testimony from Dottridge's colleague, Mace, that he had heard Cain's statement.  But Tavares says that Mace's testimony must have been perjury as well because Mace's police report did not state specifically that Cain had seen Tavares with a gun.  Instead, Mace's report stated that \"they\" had seen Tavares with a gun, without specifying which witnesses \"they\" referred to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair, and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\"   United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (footnotes omitted).  Under federal law, perjury occurs when a \"witness testifying under oath or affirmation ... gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\"   United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993) (referring to the definition of perjury under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1621).  Tavares, however, has pointed to no more than an inconsistency (between Cain's testimony and that of Dottridge) and an unclear police report (that of Mace).  Inconsistent testimony by itself does not amount to perjury, nor does an unclear police report make it so.  See United States v. Gary, 74 F.3d 304, 314 (1st Cir.)  (\"it is axiomatic that inconsistent testimony is not per se perjurious\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2567, 135 L.Ed.2d 1084 (1996).  Further, the fact that Cain did not testify at Tavares' first trial, but did at the second, avails Tavares naught.  See Anderson v. United States, 403 F.2d 451, 454 (7th Cir.1968) (inconsistency in witness' testimony between trials is not, alone, enough to show perjury), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 903, 89 S.Ct. 1009, 22 L.Ed.2d 215 (1969);  cf. United States v. Lebon, 4 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1993) (defendant did not show perjury merely by showing that witness changed her story between post-arrest interview and trial).  Tavares made no request that the trial court make a finding of perjury.  We decline his invitation that we now find willful intent to provide false testimony based on no more than an inconsistency in testimony and a dispute over the clarity of a police report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Transcript From Prior Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares' final trial-related claim is that the court misunderstood the jury's request for transcripts and sent in the wrong transcripts.  The court sent in the transcripts of the instant trial, but Tavares says that the jury was, in fact, requesting the transcripts of his prior trial for the same offense.  The claim is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent there was ambiguity in the jury's request for transcripts, Tavares had the ability to contemporaneously request clarification.  He did not do so.  Nor has Tavares pointed to any sign that the jury thought that they had been given the wrong transcripts.  We reject the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his counsel-assisted submission, Tavares claims that the sentencing court erred in:  (i) determining that he had committed an aggravated assault and that his sentence was thus governed by Section 2A2.2;  and (ii) in determining that he had an egregious, serious criminal record that, under Section 4A1.3, warranted an upward departure from the Guidelines' recommended range of 70-87 months to a sentence of 120 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Aggravated Assault</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares argues that the sentencing court erred in determining that his offense was an aggravated assault within the meaning of Section 2A2.2.  However, because of a fact-based internal inconsistency in the court's application of Section 2A2.2, we are unable to decide the merits of Tavares' challenge and remand for clarification and resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aggravated assault guideline is structured so that a victim's serious bodily injury both functions as a trigger for the application of the guideline as a whole and provides a basis, in applying the guideline, for an additional upward offense level adjustment.  In effect, the guideline provides two separate opportunities for a court to give effect to a finding of serious bodily injury.  See United States v. Newman, 982 F.2d 665, 673-75 (1st Cir.1992) (double counting of victim's serious bodily injury permissible under Section 2A2.2), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 812, 114 S.Ct. 59, 126 L.Ed.2d 28 (1993).  Here, the sentencing court appeared to determine that the victim had suffered serious bodily injury for purposes of deciding the applicability, vel non, of the aggravated assault guideline, but also determined that the victim had suffered something less than serious bodily injury for purposes of applying the guideline's internal provisions for offense level adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines define aggravated assault as a felonious assault involving:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(a) a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten), or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(b) serious bodily injury, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(c) an intent to commit another felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, comment.

The court determined that that injury was sufficiently analogous to an injury requiring surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation to fall within the definition of serious bodily injury;  thus, Section 2A2.2 applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did not find on the record before it that the brandishing of the shotgun itself was done with the \"intent to do bodily harm.\"   Absent such a finding, the aggravated assault determination could not be premised on note 1, part (a), of the commentary to Section 2A2.2.  While such an intent may in fact have been present, the record before the district court did not require such a finding.  We, therefore, cannot rest an affirmance on such a ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step was to calculate adjustments to Tavares' offense level under the specific offense adjustment provisions of the aggravated assault guideline.  The aggravated assault guideline provides for different increases in the offense level, depending on the seriousness of the victim's injury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>If the victim sustained bodily injury, increase the offense level according to the seriousness of the injury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <pre>    Degree of Bodily Injury                        Increase in Level\n    (A)  Bodily Injury                                     add 2\n    (B)  Serious Bodily Injury                             add 4\n    (C)  Permanent or Life\"Threatening Bodily              add 6\n           Injury</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>(D)  If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivision (A)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>and (B), add 3 levels; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>(E)  If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions (B)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>and (C), add 5 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3) (emphasis added).  The sentencing court increased Tavares' offense level by three.   A three level increase applies when the magnitude of the victim's injury is between bodily injury and serious bodily injury.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(D).  But this determination--that the victim's injury was less than a serious bodily injury--is in direct conflict with the court's basis for applying the aggravated assault guideline in the first place, i.e., that the victim had suffered a serious bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were the inconsistency in the court's application of Section 2A2.2 a purely legal matter, we might be able to resolve it ourselves, without the need to remand.  But we do not think that the question can be reduced to a purely legal one.  Depending on context, an inch long laceration requiring eight stitches might or might not constitute serious bodily injury.  For example, if there was a great deal of blood loss, or the victim was a hemophiliac, such an injury might well be thought serious.  More generally, we cannot say that the victim's injury in this case is of a kind that would categorically call for its characterization as \"serious\" or not.  Lacerations can be life-threatening or trivial;  where on the sliding scale of severity a particular laceration falls is not a determination that can be made solely as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained in  Newman, we review the sentencing court's \"fact dominated evaluative judgment\" of the seriousness of the victim's injury for clear error.  982 F.2d at 671.   This is not a case in which the record either clearly precludes or mandates a finding of serious bodily injury.  In the context of clear error review, it is not for this court to choose between two mutually inconsistent fact-based determinations that each has some plausibility in light of the record.  Since, on this record, we cannot reconcile or resolve the sentencing court's dual findings of the severity of the victim's injury, we are left no alternative but to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.  The district court is free to make new findings or reconsider the basis for the adjustment entirely.  Cf. United States v. Wester, 90 F.3d 592, 599-600 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Egregious, Serious Criminal Record</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares next argues that the court erred in departing upward from the recommended 70-87 month sentencing range (that applied as a result of applying the aggravated assault guideline) to a sentence of 120 months.  The sentencing court made the departure because it determined that the CHC of IV that had produced the 70-87 month recommended range did not adequately reflect Tavares' extensive criminal record.  It therefore increased Tavares' CHC level by two, to CHC VI (the Guidelines' highest level, resulting in a sentencing range of 92-115 months), and then within CHC VI, departed higher still, to a sentence of 120 months.  The Guidelines, in the proper circumstances, encourage departures in CHC levels, but, for departures beyond CHC VI, require that the defendant have an \"egregious, serious criminal record.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.;   see also United States v. Doe, 18 F.3d 41, 48-49 (1st Cir.1994);   United States v. Mendez-Colon, 15 F.3d 188, 190 (1st Cir.1994).  Tavares argues that his criminal record was not egregious and serious and that the sentencing court erred in determining so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court explained that had Tavares' three \"guilty filed\" dispositions from the state court been convictions, a minimum sentence of fifteen years would have resulted under the ACCA.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  Since there were sufficient facts for the court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the three state crimes were in fact committed, it found a ten year sentence appropriate.  Based on Tavares' extensive criminal history, we see no abuse of discretion in the court's upward CHC departure.  See Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047-48, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (abuse of discretion standard appropriate when examining district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines).  Similarly, we see no abuse of discretion in the extent of the departure.  See id.   However, since the sentencing court's offense level determination is in question, we leave it to the sentencing court to redetermine, on remand, the extent of CHC departure warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  The sentencing court ruled that the \"guilty filed\" dispositions could not be counted as convictions under the ACCA.

Tavares.  On May 15, 1992, Tavares was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), the felon in possession of a firearm statute.  Tavares appealed, and this court, sitting en banc, reversed his conviction on the ground that the district court's decision to allow the government to prove the \"prior felon\" element of Section 922(g) rather than accept a defense stipulation created unfair prejudice.  See United States v. Tavares, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195307\"><a href=\"/opinion/195307/united-states-v-tavares/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994) (en banc ).  There was a second trial and, on March 30, 1995, Tavares was again found guilty.  He appeals, asserting:  (i) a variety of trial errors in a pro se submission;  and (ii) two sentencing errors through a counsel assisted submission.  We affirm the district court on the claimed trial errors, but vacate and remand on the sentencing issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 29, 1991, Tavares and his companion, Cyril Pocknett, Jr., were in a confrontation with Sheldon Blake and Rodney Hunt over accusations of the theft of a car stereo.  Threats were exchanged, but no violence ensued, and Tavares and Pocknett left the area.  Blake and Hunt then went to Blake's apartment.  Blake lived in a second-floor apartment with his girlfriend, Nicole Cain, and their infant daughter.  About an hour and a half later, Tavares and Pocknett returned and buzzed Blake's front door.  Hunt opened the door and Tavares greeted him with a shotgun to the head and the words, \"What's up now, motherfucker?\"   Standing next to Tavares was Pocknett, aiming a .22 caliber rifle at Hunt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on instinct, Hunt grabbed the barrels of both rifles, pushed them down, and fled up the stairs into Blake's apartment.  Tavares then fired his shotgun repeatedly into Blake's nearby parked car.  Meanwhile, Hunt noticed that his hand was bleeding.  Apparently, in grabbing the barrel of Tavares' shotgun, he had ripped the palm of his hand on the gun's sight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain, on hearing the gunshots, rushed to her daughter's bedroom to protect her from danger.  After the shots subsided, she looked out the window and saw Tavares and Pocknett running toward the nearby woods.  Shortly thereafter, the police arrived.  They searched the woods, and after a chase, captured Tavares.  They also found the shotgun and .22 caliber rifle, hidden under pine needles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Back at the apartment building, Hunt, whose right hand was bleeding profusely, wrapped it in a rag which soon became bloodsoaked.  On entering the building, Officer Alan Roguzac observed pools of blood in both the hallway and on the carpeting leading up to Blake's apartment.  Soon after, on seeing Hunt's wound, Roguzac radioed for an ambulance.  Hunt was taken to the Falmouth Hospital emergency room, where his hand received eight stitches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain, Blake and Hunt were interviewed by the police.  Specifically, Cain spoke to Sergeant David Mace and Detective Doris Dottridge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain did not testify at Tavares' first trial.  At his second trial, however, she testified that on the night of the incident she had told a male police officer and Dottridge that she had seen Tavares with a gun.  Dottridge could not recollect any such statement by Cain, but Mace testified that he was the male police officer to whom Cain had made her statement.  Tavares attacked Mace's testimony by pointing out that Mace's police report did not specifically report Cain's statement.  Instead, Mace's report said only that \"they\" had seen Tavares with a gun.  Tavares argued that \"they\" meant only Hunt and Blake, whereas Mace asserted that \"they\" included Cain as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the six-day second trial, the jury requested the transcripts of the testimony of Cain, Hunt, Blake, and Earl Cash, another witness.  The court explained to the jury that, thanks to the court reporter's personal investment in certain equipment, the court had the unusual ability to provide them with transcripts within a short period of time.  The court noted, however, that despite the reporter's speed, skill and equipment, since the reporter was needed on a different case the next morning, he might not be able to satisfy all of the jury's requests, and that the jury was to proceed in its deliberations nevertheless.  The next morning, the jury was provided with the transcripts for Cain, Hunt, and Cash, but not Blake.  The court told the jury that, if possible, it would get them the transcript of Blake's testimony, but reiterated that they should proceed regardless.  Within a little over an hour, and without having received the transcript of Blake's testimony, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares was sentenced to ten years in prison.  The guideline applicable to his offense of conviction was Section 2K2.1 (unlawful possession of a firearm).  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1 (Nov.1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The court then applied Section 2A2.2 (aggravated assault) by way of a cross-reference in Section 2K2.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As a result of applying the cross-reference, Tavares' offense level jumped from twelve to twenty-three.  Level twenty-three represented a starting offense level of fifteen for aggravated assault plus an increase of eight levels for specific offense characteristics--a three-level increase for the victim's bodily injury and a five-level increase for the discharge of a firearm.  The Pre-Sentence Investigation Report recommended that the court sentence Tavares under the aggravated assault guideline because he had pointed a loaded shotgun at his victim's head, thereby evincing an \"intent to do bodily harm.\"   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, comment.  (n.1(a)).  The Guidelines define \"aggravated assault\" as \"a felonious assault that involved\" either \"a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten)\" or \"serious bodily injury\" or \"intent to commit another felony.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, comment.  (n.1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, however, Tavares protested that there was insufficient record support for either a finding that he had had the requisite intent to do bodily harm or a finding that serious bodily injury had resulted.  Instead, he said, the evidence showed that he had merely meant to frighten his victim.  Additionally, Tavares argued that, under the Guidelines, a serious bodily injury was one that required hospitalization or surgery.  The government argued that the injury Tavares' victim had suffered, i.e., a cut to the hand requiring a trip to the emergency room and eight stitches, was in fact a serious bodily injury within the Guidelines' definition.  See id. and U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.1, comment.  (n.1(j)).  The court accepted this argument.  The resulting Guidelines sentencing range, given Tavares' criminal history category (\"CHC\") of IV, was 70-87 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court then departed upward by two CHC levels and one offense level to achieve a final sentencing range of 110-125 months.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.  (departures beyond CHC VI may occasionally be appropriate in cases of an \"egregious, serious criminal record\").  The court's stated basis for the upward departure was that Tavares had, in fact, committed three state crimes (that had resulted in \"guilty filed\" dispositions as opposed to outright convictions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>) that were not counted in his CHC score and that a CHC of IV did not adequately reflect the true seriousness of Tavares' chronic criminality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares appeals, asserting errors in both the trial and sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares' pro se brief asserts that the district court committed reversible error in:  (i) failing to provide the jury with a transcript of a particular witness' testimony that it had requested and instructing the jurors that they should proceed to deliberate without that transcript;  (ii) permitting the jury to \"view\" the allegedly perjured testimony of a witness;  (iii) failing to ask the jury whether its request for transcripts pertained to the instant trial or prior proceedings.  Because contemporaneous objections were not made with respect to any of the claims, review is for plain error.  See, e.g., United States v.

The next morning, the court was able to provide the jury with transcripts for Cain, Hunt and Cash, but Blake's was not yet ready.  The court reporter was needed on another case and the court told the jurors that, if possible, they would be provided with the transcript, but that they should proceed with their deliberations regardless.

In making its decision, the trial judge is to consider factors such as the ease or difficulty of compliance with the jury's request and what is likely to be gained or lost.   Id.  The court here provided the jury with three of the four transcripts requested.  The one transcript not provided was that of Blake, who had testified most recently, and that was because the court reporter was needed for another case.  Cf. id.  (where testimony is fresh in jury's mind there is less of a need for rereading).  We discern no plain error either in the non-provision of the transcript or in the instruction that the jury should continue deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Perjured Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares argues that the court erred in permitting the jury to \"view\" the perjured testimony of Cain, a government witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Tavares further asserts that the government knew or should have known that not only was Cain's testimony perjured, but that the supporting testimony of Sergeant Mace was perjured as well.  Tavares, however, has not shown that either witness committed perjury.  And so the argument fails for want of a foundational piece.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cain testified at the instant trial that:  (a) on the night of the incident, she saw Tavares with a gun;  and (b) that she had told this to the police on the scene.

Tavares theorizes that the government, having been reversed once, used perjured testimony to ensure its victory in the second trial.  As support, he points to the testimony of Dottridge, one of the officers whom Cain allegedly told of having seen Tavares with a gun.  Dottridge testified that she could not recall Cain having stated that she saw Tavares with a gun.  There was, however, testimony from Dottridge's colleague, Mace, that he had heard Cain's statement.  But Tavares says that Mace's testimony must have been perjury as well because Mace's police report did not state specifically that Cain had seen Tavares with a gun.  Instead, Mace's report stated that \"they\" had seen Tavares with a gun, without specifying which witnesses \"they\" referred to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair, and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\"   United States v.

Tavares, however, has pointed to no more than an inconsistency (between Cain's testimony and that of Dottridge) and an unclear police report (that of Mace).  Inconsistent testimony by itself does not amount to perjury, nor does an unclear police report make it so.  See United States v.

Tavares made no request that the trial court make a finding of perjury.  We decline his invitation that we now find willful intent to provide false testimony based on no more than an inconsistency in testimony and a dispute over the clarity of a police report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Transcript From Prior Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares' final trial-related claim is that the court misunderstood the jury's request for transcripts and sent in the wrong transcripts.  The court sent in the transcripts of the instant trial, but Tavares says that the jury was, in fact, requesting the transcripts of his prior trial for the same offense.  The claim is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent there was ambiguity in the jury's request for transcripts, Tavares had the ability to contemporaneously request clarification.  He did not do so.  Nor has Tavares pointed to any sign that the jury thought that they had been given the wrong transcripts.  We reject the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his counsel-assisted submission, Tavares claims that the sentencing court erred in:  (i) determining that he had committed an aggravated assault and that his sentence was thus governed by Section 2A2.2;  and (ii) in determining that he had an egregious, serious criminal record that, under Section 4A1.3, warranted an upward departure from the Guidelines' recommended range of 70-87 months to a sentence of 120 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Aggravated Assault</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares argues that the sentencing court erred in determining that his offense was an aggravated assault within the meaning of Section 2A2.2.  However, because of a fact-based internal inconsistency in the court's application of Section 2A2.2, we are unable to decide the merits of Tavares' challenge and remand for clarification and resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The aggravated assault guideline is structured so that a victim's serious bodily injury both functions as a trigger for the application of the guideline as a whole and provides a basis, in applying the guideline, for an additional upward offense level adjustment.  In effect, the guideline provides two separate opportunities for a court to give effect to a finding of serious bodily injury.  See United States v. Newman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597414\"><a href=\"/opinion/597414/united-states-v-michael-j-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></a></span>, 673-75 (1st Cir.1992) (double counting of victim's serious bodily injury permissible under Section 2A2.2), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span> (1993).  Here, the sentencing court appeared to determine that the victim had suffered serious bodily injury for purposes of deciding the applicability, vel non, of the aggravated assault guideline, but also determined that the victim had suffered something less than serious bodily injury for purposes of applying the guideline's internal provisions for offense level adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines define aggravated assault as a felonious assault involving:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(a) a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten), or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(b) serious bodily injury, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>(c) an intent to commit another felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2, comment.

(n.1(j)).  Tavares caused his victim to suffer a laceration to the hand that required a trip to the emergency room and eight stitches.  The court determined that that injury was sufficiently analogous to an injury requiring surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation to fall within the definition of serious bodily injury;  thus, Section 2A2.2 applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did not find on the record before it that the brandishing of the shotgun itself was done with the \"intent to do bodily harm.\"   Absent such a finding, the aggravated assault determination could not be premised on note 1, part (a), of the commentary to Section 2A2.2.  While such an intent may in fact have been present, the record before the district court did not require such a finding.  We, therefore, cannot rest an affirmance on such a ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step was to calculate adjustments to Tavares' offense level under the specific offense adjustment provisions of the aggravated assault guideline.  The aggravated assault guideline provides for different increases in the offense level, depending on the seriousness of the victim's injury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>If the victim sustained bodily injury, increase the offense level according to the seriousness of the injury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <pre>    Degree of Bodily Injury                        Increase in Level\n    (A)  Bodily Injury                                     add 2\n    (B)  Serious Bodily Injury                             add 4\n    (C)  Permanent or Life\"Threatening Bodily              add 6\n           Injury</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>(D)  If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivision (A)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>and (B), add 3 levels; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>(E)  If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions (B)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>and (C), add 5 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3) (emphasis added).  The sentencing court increased Tavares' offense level by three.   A three level increase applies when the magnitude of the victim's injury is between bodily injury and serious bodily injury.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(D).  But this determination--that the victim's injury was less than a serious bodily injury--is in direct conflict with the court's basis for applying the aggravated assault guideline in the first place, i.e., that the victim had suffered a serious bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were the inconsistency in the court's application of Section 2A2.2 a purely legal matter, we might be able to resolve it ourselves, without the need to remand.  But we do not think that the question can be reduced to a purely legal one.  Depending on context, an inch long laceration requiring eight stitches might or might not constitute serious bodily injury.  For example, if there was a great deal of blood loss, or the victim was a hemophiliac, such an injury might well be thought serious.  More generally, we cannot say that the victim's injury in this case is of a kind that would categorically call for its characterization as \"serious\" or not.  Lacerations can be life-threatening or trivial;  where on the sliding scale of severity a particular laceration falls is not a determination that can be made solely as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained in  Newman, we review the sentencing court's \"fact dominated evaluative judgment\" of the seriousness of the victim's injury for clear error.  982 F.2d at 671.   This is not a case in which the record either clearly precludes or mandates a finding of serious bodily injury.  In the context of clear error review, it is not for this court to choose between two mutually inconsistent fact-based determinations that each has some plausibility in light of the record.  Since, on this record, we cannot reconcile or resolve the sentencing court's dual findings of the severity of the victim's injury, we are left no alternative but to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.  The district court is free to make new findings or reconsider the basis for the adjustment entirely.  Cf. United States v. Wester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196877\"><a href=\"/opinion/196877/united-states-v-wester/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 599-600 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Egregious, Serious Criminal Record</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tavares next argues that the court erred in departing upward from the recommended 70-87 month sentencing range (that applied as a result of applying the aggravated assault guideline) to a sentence of 120 months.  The sentencing court made the departure because it determined that the CHC of IV that had produced the 70-87 month recommended range did not adequately reflect Tavares' extensive criminal record.  It therefore increased Tavares' CHC level by two, to CHC VI (the Guidelines' highest level, resulting in a sentencing range of 92-115 months), and then within CHC VI, departed higher still, to a sentence of 120 months.  The Guidelines, in the proper circumstances, encourage departures in CHC levels, but, for departures beyond CHC VI, require that the defendant have an \"egregious, serious criminal record.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, p.s.;   see also United States v.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  Since there were sufficient facts for the court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the three state crimes were in fact committed, it found a ten year sentence appropriate.  Based on Tavares' extensive criminal history, we see no abuse of discretion in the court's upward CHC departure.  See Koon v.
