Ms. Chanthaseng now appeals, challenging\n\nthe district court’s decision to apply the enhancement.                        We\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n      Between May 1999 and June 2000, Souphaphone Chanthaseng\n\nstole   nearly     one     million   dollars     from     Fleet    Bank.      The\n\nparticulars of her scheme being essential to our inquiry, we\n\nrecount them here in detail.1\n\n      Fleet Bank hired Ms. Chanthaseng as a bank teller in 1994,\n\nand promoted her in succession to the positions of head teller,\n\nvault teller and branch operations supervisor.               By the spring of\n\n1999, she held the latter two positions simultaneously while\n\nworking   at   a   Fleet    branch   in    Waltham,     Massachusetts.        Ms.\n\n\n\n1\n We draw the facts in this case from the sentencing\ntranscript, presentence report and materials used by the\ndistrict court. See, e.g., United States v. Gill, 99 F.3d\n484, 485 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing United States v. Egemonye, 62\nF.3d 425, 426 (1st Cir. 1995)). In particular, we adopt most\nof the relevant facts from an investigatory report conducted\nby Fleet Bank and submitted as an addendum to appellee’s\nsentencing memorandum.\n\n                                     - 2 -\n\fChanthaseng’s titles made her a mid-level employee.                  Her duties\n\ngave her access to the bank’s computerized accounting system and\n\nvault, and she supervised junior bank tellers.               However, Fleet’s\n\ninternal regulations\n\n required the branch manager to review and audit much of her\n\nwork.\n\n    Some of Ms. Chanthaseng’s job duties that were subject to\n\nsupervisory    review      involved    the    method   by    which    the   bank\n\naccounted    for   cash    deposits    from   its    commercial      customers.\n\nThese customers often brought bags of cash to the bank labeled\n\nwith a “rapid deposit ticket” denoting the amount of cash to be\n\ndeposited.    Rather than confirming the bag’s contents on site,\n\nthe bank immediately credited the customer’s account with the\n\namount shown on the ticket, and sent the bag to an outside\n\nvendor for counting.           While the cash was in transit, the rapid\n\ndeposit ticket served as a placeholder for the actual funds on\n\nthe bank’s ledger.        When the vendor returned the counted funds\n\nto the bank, the ticket was cancelled out of the accounting\n\nsystem and replaced with a corresponding entry for cash in the\n\nvault.\n\n    Fleet’s regulations required its employees to take numerous\n\nsecurity    measures      in   conjunction    with   rapid    deposit    ticket\n\ntransactions.      First, although any teller at the bank could\n\naccept rapid deposit tickets from customers, a senior teller had\n\n\n\n                                      - 3 -\n\fto countersign every deposit.                 Second, no senior teller was\n\nauthorized to countersign a rapid deposit ticket that he or she\n\npersonally    had    accepted      from   a    customer.     Third,   the   bank\n\nregularly generated reports of rapid deposit transactions that\n\nthe branch manager was to review, and finally, if rapid deposit\n\ntickets remained outstanding on the bank’s ledger for more than\n\nthirty days, Fleet’s “Central Operations Center” would red-flag\n\nthem for investigation.\n\n    As   vault      teller   and    branch      operations   supervisor,    Ms.\n\nChanthaseng    was     one   of    the    few    employees    at   her   branch\n\nauthorized to countersign other tellers’ rapid deposit tickets.\n\nAs noted, however, internal bank regulations forbade her from\n\ncountersigning her own tickets.               Nonetheless, Ms. Chanthaseng’s\n\nbranch manager permitted her to do so, in violation of the\n\nregulations.\n\n    Therein      lay   the   key     to   her     crime.     Ms.   Chanthaseng\n\nsuccessfully hoodwinked her employer by processing rapid deposit\n\ntickets reflecting deposits that were never actually made to the\n\nbank, and countersigning them.            The phony deposits appeared on\n\nthe ledger to be cash in transit, immediately available for\n\nwithdrawal.    Thus, Ms. Chanthaseng single-handedly created in\n\nthe accounting system a nonexistent cache of in-transit funds\n\nthat she could deposit into accounts she controlled.                  She would\n\nsubsequently cancel out the false tickets she had written, and\n\n\n\n                                     - 4 -\n\freplace them with new tickets for equal or larger amounts, thus\n\nconcealing her crime by constantly carrying in-transit balances\n\non the ledger.          A physical count of the cash in the vault,\n\nhowever, would have revealed a significant cash shortfall.\n\n      A physical count of the vault cash did in fact occur when\n\nbank security employees performed a surprise audit of the branch\n\nin   April     2000.        Taken   off    guard,    Ms.    Chanthaseng     feigned\n\ninability to open the vault, buying her enough time to enter a\n\nlarge balancing entry in the accounting system. When an employee\n\nof the safe company finally opened the vault, the correct amount\n\nof cash appeared to be there.\n\n      The balancing transaction did not go unnoticed, however.\n\nFleet’s Central Operations Center contacted the branch manager\n\nabout    it,    and    he    in   turn    referred    the       inquiry   about   the\n\nanomalous      entry    to    Ms.   Chanthaseng.           By   recording   several\n\nadditional entries in the system, she was able to conceal her\n\ncrime.    The branch manager did not pursue the issue further.\n\n      In all, Ms. Chanthaseng’s scheme racked up gains of nearly\n\none million dollars in just under a year.                       Then, in May 2000,\n\nFleet sold its Waltham branch to Sovereign Bank.                    As a result of\n\nthe sale, Ms. Chanthaseng lost access to the bank’s accounting\n\nsystem while three rapid deposit tickets were still outstanding.\n\nWhen the tickets were not cancelled out of the system after\n\nthirty days, Fleet immediately began an investigation.                      In short\n\n\n\n                                          - 5 -\n\forder,   bank   investigators   traced   the   transactions   to   Ms.\n\nChanthaseng, and she admitted to her wrongdoing.\n\n      Several months later, Ms. Chanthaseng pleaded guilty to\n\nthree counts of making false bank statements in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1005.    At sentencing, the district court ratcheted up\n\nher offense level by two levels for abuse of a position of\n\ntrust, pursuant to section 3B1.3 of the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.     The district court did not, however, explicitly\n\napply the appropriate legal standard to the facts in making the\n\nenhancement.    The propriety of this adjustment is now before us.\n\n\n\nII.   LEGAL DISCUSSION\n\n      Section 3B1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines is familiar\n\nground for the court.     We have previously ruled that section\n\n3B1.3 permits a court to increase a defendant’s offense level by\n\ntwo levels if the defendant (1) occupied a position of trust\n\nvis-à-vis her employer; and (2) utilized this position of trust\n\nto facilitate or conceal her offense. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Reccko, 151 F.3d 29, 31 (1 st Cir. 1998); United States v.\n\nGill, 99 F.3d 484, 489 (1st Cir. 1996).         While we address a\n\ndistrict court’s interpretation of section 3B1.3 in this regard\n\nde novo, we review its application of the Guideline to the facts\n\nonly for clear error.    See United States v. Sotomayor-Vazquez,\n\n249 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2001).     In a case such as this one, in\n\n\n\n                                - 6 -\n\fwhich the district court announced its decision to adjust upward\n\nwithout subsidiary findings of fact, we “review the evidence and\n\nthe result, and not the reasoning by which the result was\n\nreached by the district court.”             United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d\n\n199, 203 (1st Cir. 1994).           We therefore review the evidence to\n\ndetermine    if   it   satisfies      the    elements    of    a   section   3B1.3\n\nadjustment.\n\n\n\n    A.      Position of Trust\n\n    Appellant      first     argues    that      her   job   did   not   have   the\n\nhallmarks of a position of trust.                Our opinions in Reccko and\n\nUnited States v. O’Connell, 252 F.3d 524 (1st Cir. 2001), have\n\nmade clear that a “position of trust,” for the purposes of\n\nsection 3B1.3, is “characterized by professional or managerial\n\ndiscretion.”      Id. at 528; Reccko, 151 F.3d at 31 (quoting USSG\n\n§ 3B1.3).     This requirement is paramount.                 Although intuition\n\nmay suggest that a wide variety of vocations should be thought\n\nof as positions of trust, only those endowed with “substantial\n\ndiscretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable\n\ndeference” are subject to the enhancement. USSG § 3B1.3 cmt. 1.\n\nCompare   Reccko,      151   F.3d    at     31   (receptionist/      switchboard\n\noperator at police station did not occupy a position of trust,\n\neven though job allowed her to warn criminals about police\n\nactivity) with Sotomayor-Vazquez, 249 F.3d at 19-20 (consultant\n\n\n\n                                      - 7 -\n\foccupied position of trust where he controlled the finances of\n\nhealth services organization and was the “heart and soul” of the\n\noperation).\n\n    Appellant does not offer an alternate interpretation of\n\nsection 3B1.3.          Rather, she insists that the district court\n\ncommitted clear error in finding that she possessed substantial\n\nprofessional      or    managerial    discretion.      We   cannot      agree.\n\nSeveral pieces of evidence suggest that appellant possessed\n\nsubstantial discretionary judgment.            To begin with, she had the\n\nauthority to countersign rapid deposit tickets.                   Only a few\n\npersonnel within the bank were given this power, and exercising\n\nit affected the bank’s financial well-being by making funds\n\ncredited   to    accounts    via   the   rapid    deposit   ticket     process\n\navailable for immediate withdrawal.            Cf. USSG § 3B1.3 cmt. n. 1\n\n(bank executive’s fraudulent loan scheme worthy of abuse of\n\nposition of trust adjustment).\n\n    Moreover, in appellant’s case it is apparent that her branch\n\nmanager consistently failed to review her rapid deposit ticket\n\napprovals, essentially making her the branch’s sole decision-\n\nmaker   for     those    transactions    and     allowing   her   to    freely\n\ncountersign her own tickets.         Appellant believes this fact works\n\nin her favor, because her actions were contrary to bank policy.\n\nWe disagree.      This court has held that the relevant inquiry in\n\ncases such as this one is whether a person in fact occupied a\n\n\n\n                                     - 8 -\n\fposition of trust, rather than whether the person’s title or\n\nofficial job description contained a discretionary element.                    See\n\nGill, 99 F.3d at 489.          Thus in Gill, we found that a defendant\n\nwho had posed as a practicing psychologist had abused a position\n\nof trust in relation to his “patients,” even though he was not\n\nlegally licensed.        Id.   This case is no different.             Although it\n\nwas against bank regulations for appellant to countersign rapid\n\ndeposit tickets at will, the bank manager’s laxity effectively\n\nmade that a central element of her position.\n\n       The branch manager added to the discretionary nature of\n\nappellant’s job by referring the follow-up of an anomalous\n\nbalancing entry to her.          We consider the task of investigating\n\nand    reporting    on     potentially       fraudulent         transactions     a\n\ndiscretionary      job    function.         At    oral    argument,    appellant\n\nsuggested that “referred” mischaracterizes the nature of the\n\nbranch manager’s inquiry into the balancing entry.                    She insists\n\ninstead that the manager merely queried her about the entry, and\n\nfailed to follow up on her response.              The record plainly states,\n\nhowever, that the branch manger “referred” the matter to Ms.\n\nChanthaseng.     Appellant did not object to this characterization\n\nin    the   proceedings    below,     and    we    decline      to   indulge   her\n\nalternate explanation at this stage.                     See   United States v.\n\nApproximately Two Thousand, Five Hundred Thirty-Eight Point\n\nEighty-Five Shares etc., 988 F.2d 1281, 1288 n. 9 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n                                    - 9 -\n\f1993)     (counsel’s        representation     of    fact    on   appeal     not    a\n\nsubstitute for record showing).\n\n\n\n       B. Use of Discretion to Facilitate or Conceal Crime\n\n       Proceeding to the second prong of the analysis, we must\n\ndecide whether appellant’s substantial discretionary judgment\n\nfacilitated or concealed her crime.                 There can be no doubt that\n\nit did.     Because the bank manager allowed appellant to have the\n\nlast word on rapid deposit ticket transactions, she was able to\n\napprove    her    own    falsified    tickets       free   from   the   danger     of\n\noversight.       This freedom clearly facilitated her crime.                 By the\n\nsame token, when the branch manager referred investigation of\n\nthe anomalous balancing entry to appellant, appellant enjoyed\n\nthe freedom to conceal her misdeeds by recording several more\n\nentries without fear of oversight.                  The evidence very clearly\n\nsupports the second element of our section 3B1.3 analysis.\n\nIII.      CONCLUSION\n\n  While     we   are    cognizant     that   the     district     court    did    not\n\nexplicitly engage in the thorough, two-step analysis that this\n\ncase    merited,       it   reached   the    correct       result.        There    is\n\nsufficient evidence in the record to defeat the argument that\n\nthe     district       court’s    application        of     the   section    3B1.3\n\nenhancement was clear error.           For that reason, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 10 -\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            - 11 -\n\f",

A physical count of the cash in the vault, however, would have revealed a significant cash shortfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A physical count of the vault cash did in fact occur when bank security employees performed a surprise audit of the branch in April 2000. Taken off guard, Ms. Chanthaseng feigned inability to open the vault, buying her enough time to enter a large balancing entry in the accounting system. When an employee of the safe company finally opened the vault, the correct amount of cash appeared to be there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The balancing transaction did not go unnoticed, however. Fleet's Central Operations Center contacted the branch manager about it, and he in turn referred the inquiry about the anomalous entry to Ms. Chanthaseng. By recording several additional entries in the system, she was able to conceal her crime. The branch manager did not pursue the issue further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all, Ms. Chanthaseng's scheme racked up gains of nearly one million dollars in just under a year. Then, in May 2000, Fleet sold its Waltham branch to Sovereign Bank. As a result of the sale, Ms. Chanthaseng lost access to the bank's accounting system while three rapid deposit tickets were still outstanding. When the tickets were not cancelled out of the system after thirty days, Fleet immediately began an investigation. In short order, bank investigators traced the transactions to Ms. Chanthaseng, and she admitted to her wrongdoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months later, Ms. Chanthaseng pleaded guilty to three counts of making false bank statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1005. At sentencing, the district court ratcheted up her offense level by two levels for abuse of a position of trust, pursuant to section 3B1.3 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The district court did not, however, explicitly apply the appropriate legal standard to the facts inmaking the enhancement. The propriety of this adjustment is now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. LEGAL DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines is familiar ground for the court. We have previously ruled that section 3B1.3 permits a court to increase a defendant's offense level by two levels if the defendant (1) occupied a position of trust vis-a-vis her employer; and (2) utilized this position of trust to facilitate or conceal her offense. See, e.g., United States v. Reccko, 151 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Gill, 99 F.3d 484, 489 (1st Cir. 1996). While we address a district court's interpretation of section 3B1.3 in this regard de novo, we review its application of the Guideline to the facts only for clear error. See United States v. Sotomayor-Vazquez, 249 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2001). In a case such as this one, in which the district court announced its decision to adjust upward without subsidiary findings of fact, we \"review the evidence and the result, and not the reasoning by which the result was reached by the district court.\" United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 199, 203 (1st Cir. 1994). We therefore review the evidence to determine if it satisfies the elements of a section 3B1.3 adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Position of Trust</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant first argues that her job did not have the hallmarks of a position of trust. Our opinions in Reccko and United States v. O'Connell, 252 F.3d 524 (1st Cir. 2001), have made clear that a \"position of trust,\" for the purposes of section 3B1.3, is \"characterized by professional or managerial discretion.\" Id. at 528; Reccko, 151 F.3d at 31 (quoting USSG &#167; 3B1.3). This requirement is paramount. Although intuition may suggest that a wide variety of vocations should be thought of as positions of trust, only those endowed with \"substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference\" are subject to the enhancement. USSG &#167; 3B1.3 cmt. 1. Compare Reccko, 151 F.3d at 31 (receptionist/ switchboard operator at police station did not occupy a position of trust, even though job allowed her to warn criminals about police activity) with Sotomayor-Vazquez, 249 F.3d at 19-20 (consultant occupied position of trust where he controlled the finances of health services organization and was the \"heart and soul\" of the operation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant does not offer an alternate interpretation of section 3B1.3. Rather, she insists that the district court committed clear error in finding that she possessed substantial professional or managerial discretion. We cannot agree. Several pieces of evidence suggest that appellant possessed substantial discretionary judgment. To begin with, she had the authority to countersign rapid deposit tickets. Only a few personnel within the bank were given this power, and exercising it affected the bank's financial well-being by making funds credited to accounts via the rapid deposit ticket process available for immediate withdrawal. Cf. USSG &#167; 3B1.3 cmt. n. 1 (bank executive's fraudulent loan scheme worthy of abuse of position of trust adjustment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in appellant's case it is apparent that her branch manager consistently failed to review her rapid deposit ticket approvals, essentially making her the branch's sole decision-maker for those transactions and allowing her to freely countersign her own tickets. Appellant believes this fact works in her favor, because her actions were contrary to bank policy. We disagree. This court has held that the relevant inquiry in cases such as this one is whether a person in fact occupied a position of trust, rather than whether the person's title or official job description contained a discretionary element. See Gill, 99 F.3d at 489. Thus in Gill, we found that a defendant who had posed as a practicing psychologist had abused a position of trust in relation to his \"patients,\" even though he was not legally licensed. Id. This case is no different. Although it was against bank regulations for appellant to countersign rapid deposit tickets at will, the bank manager's laxity effectively made that a central element of her position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The branch manager added to the discretionary nature of appellant's job by referring the follow-up of an anomalous balancing entry to her. We consider the task of investigating and reporting on potentially fraudulent transactions a discretionary job function. At oral argument, appellant suggested that \"referred\" mischaracterizes the nature of the branch manager's inquiry into the balancing entry. She insists instead that the manager merely queried her about the entry, and failed to follow up on her response. The record plainly states, however, that the branch manger \"referred\" the matter to Ms. Chanthaseng. Appellant did not object to this characterization in the proceedings below, and we decline to indulge her alternate explanation at this stage. See United States v. Approximately Two Thousand, Five Hundred Thirty-Eight Point Eighty-Five Shares etc., 988 F.2d 1281, 1288 n. 9 (1st Cir. 1993) (counsel's representation of fact on appeal not a substitute for record showing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Use of Discretion to Facilitate or Conceal Crime</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceeding to the second prong of the analysis, we must decide whether appellant's substantial discretionary judgment facilitated or concealed her crime. There can be no doubt that it did. Because the bank manager allowed appellant to have the last word on rapid deposit ticket transactions, she was able to approve her own falsified tickets free from the danger of oversight. This freedom clearly facilitated her crime. By the same token, when the branch manager referred investigation of the anomalous balancing entry to appellant, appellant enjoyed the freedom to conceal her misdeeds by recording several more entries without fear of oversight. The evidence very clearly supports the second element of our section 3B1.3 analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we are cognizant that the district court did not explicitly engage in the thorough, two-step analysis that this case merited, it reached the correct result. There is sufficient evidence in the record to defeat the argument that the district court's application of the section 3B1.3 enhancement was clear error. For that reason, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>   Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We draw the facts in this case from the sentencing transcript, presentence report and materials used by the district court.

Ms. Chanthaseng now appeals, challenging the district court's decision to apply the enhancement. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between May 1999 and June 2000, Souphaphone Chanthaseng stole nearly one million dollars from Fleet Bank. The particulars of her scheme being essential to our inquiry, we recount them here in detail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleet Bank hired Ms. Chanthaseng as a bank teller in 1994, and promoted her in succession to the positions of head teller, vault teller and branch operations supervisor. By the spring of 1999, she held the latter two positions simultaneously while working at a Fleet branch in Waltham, Massachusetts. Ms. Chanthaseng's titles made her a mid-level employee. Her duties gave her access to the bank's computerized accounting system and vault, and she supervised junior bank tellers. However, Fleet's internal regulations required the branch manager to review and audit much of her work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of Ms. Chanthaseng's job duties that were subject to supervisory review involved the method by which the bank accounted for cash deposits from its commercial customers. These customers often brought bags of cash to the bank labeled with a \"rapid deposit ticket\" denoting the amount of cash to be deposited. Rather than confirming the bag's contents on site, the bank immediately credited the customer's account with the amount shown on the ticket, and sent the bag to an outside vendor for counting. While the cash was in transit, the rapid deposit ticket served as a placeholder for the actual funds on the bank's ledger. When the vendor returned the counted funds to the bank, the ticket was cancelled out of the accounting system and replaced with a corresponding entry for cash in the vault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleet's regulations required its employees to take numerous security measures in conjunction with rapid deposit ticket transactions. First, although any teller at the bank could accept rapid deposit tickets from customers, a senior teller had to countersign every deposit. Second, no senior teller was authorized to countersign a rapid deposit ticket that he or she personally had accepted from a customer. Third, the bank regularly generated reports of rapid deposit transactions that the branch manager was to review, and finally, if rapid deposit tickets remained outstanding on the bank's ledger for more than thirty days, Fleet's \"Central Operations Center\" would red-flag them for investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As vault teller and branch operations supervisor, Ms. Chanthaseng was one of the few employees at her branch authorized to countersign other tellers' rapid deposit tickets. As noted, however, internal bank regulations forbade her from countersigning her own tickets. Nonetheless, Ms. Chanthaseng's branch manager permitted her to do so, in violation of the regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therein lay the key to her crime. Ms. Chanthaseng successfully hoodwinked her employer by processing rapid deposit tickets reflecting deposits that were never actually made to the bank, and countersigning them. The phony deposits appeared on the ledger to be cash in transit, immediately available for withdrawal. Thus, Ms. Chanthaseng single-handedly created in the accounting system a nonexistent cache of in-transit funds that she could deposit into accounts she controlled. She would subsequently cancel out the false tickets she had written, and replace them with new tickets for equal or larger amounts, thus concealing her crime by constantly carrying in-transit balances on the ledger. A physical count of the cash in the vault, however, would have revealed a significant cash shortfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A physical count of the vault cash did in fact occur when bank security employees performed a surprise audit of the branch in April 2000.
