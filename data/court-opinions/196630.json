(\"Cumberland\")  a  convenience\r\n\nstore  in Turner's Falls, Massachusetts, took the property by\r\n\neminent domain.  That same day, pursuant to Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r\n\n79,   1,  the  order of taking was recorded, and as a result,\r\n\nCumberland's  ownership   rights   in   the   property   were\r\n\nextinguished.  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 79,   3.\r\n\n          Cumberland,  the owner  of hundreds  of convenience\r\n\nstores  in   various  states,  objected   to  MEDIC's  taking\r\n\ndecision.      Cumberland's   legal   maneuvering,  and   its\r\n\nbankruptcy, converted what  began as a simple  eminent domain\r\n\ncase into a six-year litigious war.\r\n\n          We  summarize   briefly.     Initially,  Cumberland\r\n\ndemanded  pro tanto compensation  for the property,  but when\r\n\nMEDIC  obliged,  Cumberland  rejected  its  offer  and  chose\r\n\ninstead  to contest the taking.  Cumberland initiated various\r\n\nstate  and federal court  actions, all designed  to frustrate\r\n\nthe taking and to deny  MEDIC possession.  Eventually, in May\r\n\nof 1992, while still in possession of the contested property,\r\n\nthe Cumberland chain filed  for protection and reorganization\r\n\nunder  Chapter 11  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  which  further\r\n\ndelayed  MEDIC's gaining possession.   Suffice it to say that\r\n\nnone  of Cumberland's delaying actions had merit, and finally\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\non  September 3,  1993, nearly  three  years after  acquiring\r\n\nlegal  title,  MEDIC  obtained  physical  possession  of  the\r\n\npremises.\r\n\n          Previously, Cumberland had  commenced a state court\r\n\naction objecting to the amount of MEDIC's original  pro tanto\r\n\noffer and  claiming reimbursement for relocation expenses and\r\n\ndamages.   MEDIC  removed the  action  to the  United  States\r\n\nBankruptcy  Court for  the District  of Massachusetts,  where\r\n\nCumberland's bankruptcy case was pending.\r\n\n          The  bankruptcy  court  found that  Cumberland  was\r\n\nentitled to recover  from MEDIC $380,000 as  compensation for\r\n\nthe value  of the property and $36,850  for relocation costs,\r\n\nreduced  by $137,250  for the  rental  value of  its use  and\r\n\noccupancy  during  Cumberland's  holdover  on  the  premises,\r\n\ntherefore judgment was issued for the net amount of $279,600.\r\n\nThe court allowed MEDIC's rent claim, even though the eminent\r\n\ndomain statute  did not speak  to a taking entity's  right to\r\n\ncharge  reasonable rent during a wrongful holdover beyond the\r\n\ndate  when the  taken premises  must be  vacated.   The court\r\n\ndisallowed   Cumberland's   claim   for   interest   on   the\r\n\ncompensation payment, because Cumberland  could have accepted\r\n\nthe pro tanto payment  and obtained use of the funds  at that\r\n\ntime.  The decision of the bankruptcy court  was subsequently\r\n\naffirmed by the United States District Court for the District\r\n\nofMassachusetts, and fromthat affirmance thisappeal followed.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          On   this  appeal,   Cumberland  argues   that  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court  erred in  awarding MEDIC  fair market  rent\r\n\nduring  the  holdover  period  during  which  Cumberland  was\r\n\nchallenging  the  eminent  domain  proceeding,  erred  in the\r\n\namount of relocation damages awarded  to it, and erred by not\r\n\nawarding  damages for  the  authority's  alleged  failure  to\r\n\nprovide timely and  adequate relocation assistance.   We find\r\n\nthat none of Cumberland's arguments on appeal merit extensive\r\n\nconsideration.1  We review the bankruptcy court's findings of\r\n\nfact for  clear error  and subject its  rulings of law  to de\r\n\nnovo review.  T I Fed. Credit Union v. Delbonis, 72 F.3d 921,\r                                                           \r\n\n928 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          We begin  with Cumberland's  claim that  it is  not\r\n\nliable for the  use and occupancy charges that the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt awarded to MEDIC, an issue that we review de novo.  The\r\n\napplicable  Massachusetts  eminent   domain  statute  allowed\r\n\nCumberland to  remain on  the premises for  a period  of four\r\n\nmonths after it received the notice of taking.  Mass. Gen. L.\r\n\nch. 79,   8B.  Before exercising its possessory rights, MEDIC\r\n\nwas  required to  give  Cumberland  a  thirty-day  notice  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Cumberland's notice of appeal included a complaint  about\r\nthe  court's  failure  to   grant  interest  to  it   on  the\r\ncompensation  awarded for  the  taking.   We deem  this issue\r\nwaived, as  Cumberland has not  referred to it in  its brief.\r\nSee, e.g., Willhauck  v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689,  700 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n1991)  (issues not  fully presented  in  appellate brief  are\r\ndeemed waived).\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nvacate,  sent by registered  mail or posted  on the property.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 79,  3.\r\n\n          The  bankruptcy  court  found  that MEDIC  provided\r\n\nnotice of  the taking to  Cumberland on October 9,  1990, and\r\n\nprovided  thirty-day notice of  eviction on January  8, 1991.\r\n\nThus, MEDIC was  within its rights in requiring Cumberland to\r\n\nvacate   the  property  by   February  13,  1991.     MEDIC's\r\n\ncounterclaim to Cumberland's petition for damages sought rent\r\n\nfor the  period from February  14, 1991, to August  30, 1993,\r\n\nwhen MEDIC finally obtained possession.\r\n\n          Although  the taking  statute  does not  address  a\r\n\nholdover  occupant's liability for  the fair rental  value of\r\n\nits  use  and  occupancy,  the  Massachusetts  regulation  on\r\n\nrelocation assistance appears to  contemplate charges for use\r\n\nand  occupancy rent following a  taking, because it directs a\r\n\ntaking authority to inform a property owner of the rent to be\r\n\npaid  during any  holdover period.  760  C.M.R.    27.03(13).\r\n\nMEDIC, in its  January 8,  1991, notice  to vacate,  informed\r\n\nCumberland  that it would seek fair market rent if Cumberland\r\n\nremained in possession.\r\n\n          The   bankruptcy  court   ruled  that   Cumberland,\r\n\nfollowing its failure to vacate  as directed, became a tenant\r\n\nat sufferance,  and as  a result MEDIC  was entitled  to rent\r\n\npursuant  to Mass. Gen. L. ch. 186,    3, which provides that\r\n\ntenants at sufferance are liable  for rent during the  period\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nof  continued occupancy after  a demand for  the premises has\r\n\nbeen  made.   It  also  found that  MEDIC's  claim was  fully\r\n\njustified  under  a  theory  of  unjust  enrichment,  because\r\n\nCumberland's continued use  of the premises was  profitable. \r\n\nAlthough we  find no decision  exactly on point,  the Supreme\r\n\nJudicial  Court  in  Lowell  Housing  Authority  v.  Save-Mor\r                                                                         \r\n\nFurniture  Stores, Inc., 193 N.E.2d 585, 587 (1963), approved\r                                   \r\n\na taking authority's claim for use and occupancy charges from\r\n\na tenant who  remained in possession  after a public  housing\r\n\nauthority  took  the  property  from  the  landlord-owner  by\r\n\neminent  domain.   Cumberland  argues that  as  an owner  its\r                                                                    \r\n\nposition  is  different from  that  of  a  tenant.   We  find\r                                                             \r\n\nCumberland's  argument  unconvincing, and  that  Cumberland's\r\n\nwrongful holdover does not differ in any relevant regard from\r\n\nthat of the tenant in Lowell Housing.  See 193 N.E.2d at 587.\r                                                      \r\n\nBecause we find that Lowell Housing is  apposite, we conclude\r                                               \r\n\nthat the bankruptcy  court did not err in  awarding MEDIC the\r\n\nfair rental value of Cumberland's continued use and occupancy\r\n\nof  the premises.   Accordingly, we need  not consider unjust\r\n\nenrichment, the second basis for the court's finding.\r\n\n          Cumberland next  argues that  the bankruptcy  court\r\n\nerred  in failing  to  grant all  of  its claimed  relocation\r\n\nexpenses, and  again our review  is de  novo.   Specifically,\r\n\nCumberland claims that the court erred in not finding that it\r\n\nwas  entitled to reimbursement  for the cost  of new gasoline\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\npumping  equipment  for  its new  location,  for  license and\r\n\ninspection fees, and for the cost of certain physical changes\r\n\nto its new location.\r\n\n          We find no error in the bankruptcy court's award of\r\n\nrelocation  costs under  Mass. Gen.  L. ch.  79A,    7, which\r\n\nprovides  that a taking  authority must reimburse  a property\r\n\nowner for:\r\n\n          1. actual documented  reasonable expenses\r\n          in  moving   himself,  his   family,  his\r\n          business,   farm   operation,   or  other\r\n          personal property; \r\n          2.  actual  direct   losses  of  tangible\r\n          personal property as  a result of  moving\r\n          or  discontinuing  a   business  or  farm\r\n          operation,  but not  to exceed  an amount\r\n          equal  to  the reasonable  expenses  that\r\n          would have been required to relocate such\r\n          property, as determined by the relocation\r\n          agency; and\r\n          3.   actual   reasonable    expenses   in\r\n          searching for  a replacement  business or\r\n          farm.\r\n\nAlthough  the bankruptcy court awarded payment for certain of\r\n\nCumberland's claimed relocation expenses as required by Mass.\r\n\nGen. L.  ch. 79A,   7, it denied Cumberland's request for the\r\n\ncosts  of obtaining  new  gasoline  pumps,  for  license  and\r\n\ninspection fees, and for certain  physical changes to its new\r\n\nfacility.  Cumberland  urges that the  court erred in  ruling\r\n\nthese expenses were  not recoverable under Mass.  Gen. L. ch.\r\n\n79A,    7 and,  in particular, the  implementing regulations,\r\n\n760 C.M.R. 27.09(8), 27.09(13), and 27.09(14).  MEDIC's short\r\n\nanswer is that MEDIC is  a taking authority governed by Mass.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nGen. L. ch. 121C, and that the relocation payment regulations\r\n\nthat  Cumberland relies upon apply to authorities governed by\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 121A  and 121B, but not to 121C  agencies.2\r\n\nSee 760 C.M.R.  27.01(4) (listing activities and  entities to\r               \r\n\nwhich  the relocation payment  regulations apply).   We agree\r\n\nwith  MEDIC, as  did the  district court,  and  conclude that\r\n\nCumberland is entitled  to reimbursement only as  provided in\r\n\nMass. Gen. L.  ch. 79A,   7, and not under the more expansive\r\n\nprovisions of 760 C.M.R. 27.09.3\r\n\n          Finally,  Cumberland  claims  that  the  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt erred in ruling that MEDIC had fulfilled its relocation\r\n\nassistance obligations to Cumberland.  We review this factual\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The relocation assistance regulations, in contrast to the\r                                         \r\nrelocation  payment regulations,  appear to apply  broadly to\r                               \r\nall entities authorized  to take by eminent domain.   See 760\r                                                                     \r\nC.M.R. 27.01(4).\r\n\n3.  We  note that the  record contains documents  provided by\r\nMEDIC to Cumberland that seem to promise reimbursement of the\r\ntypes  of   expenses  that   the  bankruptcy   court  denied.\r\nCumberland's brief, however,  does not contain  any arguments\r\nbased  on estoppel  or  similar  theories.    Therefore  such\r\narguments,  whatever their  merit, are  waived.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\nWillhauck, 953 F.2d at 700.  \r                     \r\n          We  have not considered any of the arguments raised\r\nby Cumberland  in its  Motion for  Leave to  Present Rebuttal\r\nArgument Pursuant to Local  Rule 34.1(b).  Cumberland  had an\r\nopportunity to raise rebuttal arguments in a reply brief, but\r\nchose  not  to submit  one.    Moreover,  Local Rule  34.1(b)\r\npertains  to oral rebuttal during the scheduled argument, and\r\ndoes  not  provide  an opportunity  for  further  briefing of\r\nissues after oral argument. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nfinding4 for  clear error,  and we find  no error,  let alone\r\n\nclear error, in the bankruptcy court's denial of Cumberland's\r\n\nclaims   for  damages  due  to  MEDIC's  failure  to  provide\r\n\nrelocation assistance.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.  Costs to appellee.\r                      Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Cumberland's  brief could  be read  to  suggest that  the\r\nbankruptcy   court's  ruling  in  this  regard  was  a  legal\r\nconclusion concerning an  earlier order of the  Massachusetts\r\nSuperior  Court.    Even though  Cumberland  has  not clearly\r\npresented that argument,  a de novo review  of the bankruptcy\r\ncourt's ruling would yield the same result: no error. \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n",

(\"Cumberland\") a convenience store in Turner's Falls, Massachusetts, took the property by eminent domain.   That same day, pursuant to Mass.Gen.L. ch. 79, &#167; 1, the order of taking was recorded, and as a result, Cumberland's ownership rights in the property were extinguished.

Cumberland's legal maneuvering, and its bankruptcy, converted what began as a simple eminent domain case into a six-year litigious war.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize briefly.   Initially, Cumberland demanded pro tanto compensation for the property, but when MEDIC obliged, Cumberland rejected its offer and chose instead to contest the taking.   Cumberland initiated various state and federal court actions, all designed to frustrate the taking and to deny MEDIC possession.   Eventually, in May of 1992, while still in possession of the contested property, the Cumberland chain filed for protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which further delayed MEDIC's gaining possession.   Suffice it to say that none of Cumberland's delaying actions had merit, and finally on September 3, 1993, nearly three years after acquiring legal title, MEDIC obtained physical possession of the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Previously, Cumberland had commenced a state court action objecting to the amount of MEDIC's original pro tanto offer and claiming reimbursement for relocation expenses and damages.   MEDIC removed the action to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts, where Cumberland's bankruptcy case was pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court found that Cumberland was entitled to recover from MEDIC $380,000 as compensation for the value of the property and $36,850 for relocation costs, reduced by $137,250 for the rental value of its use and occupancy during Cumberland's holdover on the premises, therefore judgment was issued for the net amount of $279,600.   The court allowed MEDIC's rent claim, even though the eminent domain statute did not speak to a taking entity's right to charge reasonable rent during a wrongful holdover beyond the date when the taken premises must be vacated.   The court disallowed Cumberland's claim for interest on the compensation payment, because Cumberland could have accepted the pro tanto payment and obtained use of the funds at that time.   The decision of the bankruptcy court was subsequently affirmed by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and from that affirmance this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Cumberland argues that the bankruptcy court erred in awarding MEDIC fair market rent during the holdover period during which Cumberland was challenging the eminent domain proceeding, erred in the amount of relocation damages awarded to it, and erred by not awarding damages for the authority's alleged failure to provide timely and adequate relocation assistance.   We find that none of Cumberland's arguments on appeal merit extensive consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We review the bankruptcy court's findings of fact for clear error and subject its rulings of law to de novo review.  T I Fed.  Credit Union v. Delbonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Cumberland's claim that it is not liable for the use and occupancy charges that the bankruptcy court awarded to MEDIC, an issue that we review de novo.   The applicable Massachusetts eminent domain statute allowed Cumberland to remain on the premises for a period of four months after it received the notice of taking.   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 79, &#167; 8B.   Before exercising its possessory rights, MEDIC was required to give Cumberland a thirty-day notice to vacate, sent by registered mail or posted on the property.   Mass.Gen.L. ch. 79, &#167; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court found that MEDIC provided notice of the taking to Cumberland on October 9, 1990, and provided thirty-day notice of eviction on January 8, 1991.   Thus, MEDIC was within its rights in requiring Cumberland to vacate the property by February 13, 1991.   MEDIC's counterclaim to Cumberland's petition for damages sought rent for the period from February 14, 1991, to August 30, 1993, when MEDIC finally obtained possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the taking statute does not address a holdover occupant's liability for the fair rental value of its use and occupancy, the Massachusetts regulation on relocation assistance appears to contemplate charges for use and occupancy rent following a taking, because it directs a taking authority to inform a property owner of the rent to be paid during any holdover period.  760 C.M.R. &#167; 27.03(13).   MEDIC, in its January 8, 1991, notice to vacate, informed Cumberland that it would seek fair market rent if Cumberland remained in possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court ruled that Cumberland, following its failure to vacate as directed, became a tenant at sufferance, and as a result MEDIC was entitled to rent pursuant to Mass.Gen.L. ch. 186, &#167; 3, which provides that tenants at sufferance are liable for rent during the period of continued occupancy after a demand for the premises has been made.   It also found that MEDIC's claim was fully justified under a theory of unjust enrichment, because Cumberland's continued use of the premises was profitable.   Although we find no decision exactly on point, the Supreme Judicial Court in Lowell Housing Authority v. Save-Mor Furniture Stores, Inc., 346 Mass. 426, 193 N.E.2d 585, 587 (1963), approved a taking authority's claim for use and occupancy charges from a tenant who remained in possession after a public housing authority took the property from the landlord-owner by eminent domain.   Cumberland argues that as an owner its position is different from that of a tenant.   We find Cumberland's argument unconvincing, and that Cumberland's wrongful holdover does not differ in any relevant regard from that of the tenant in Lowell Housing.   See 193 N.E.2d at 587.   Because we find that Lowell Housing is apposite, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in awarding MEDIC the fair rental value of Cumberland's continued use and occupancy of the premises.   Accordingly, we need not consider unjust enrichment, the second basis for the court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cumberland next argues that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to grant all of its claimed relocation expenses, and again our review is de novo.   Specifically, Cumberland claims that the court erred in not finding that it was entitled to reimbursement for the cost of new gasoline pumping equipment for its new location, for license and inspection fees, and for the cost of certain physical changes to its new location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the bankruptcy court's award of relocation costs under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 79A, &#167; 7, which provides that a taking authority must reimburse a property owner for:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>1. actual documented reasonable expenses in moving himself, his family, his business, farm operation, or other personal property;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>2. actual direct losses of tangible personal property as a result of moving or discontinuing a business or farm operation, but not to exceed an amount equal to the reasonable expenses that would have been required to relocate such property, as determined by the relocation agency;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>3. actual reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or farm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bankruptcy court awarded payment for certain of Cumberland's claimed relocation expenses as required by Mass.Gen.L. ch. 79A, &#167; 7, it denied Cumberland's request for the costs of obtaining new gasoline pumps, for license and inspection fees, and for certain physical changes to its new facility.   Cumberland urges that the court erred in ruling these expenses were not recoverable under Mass.Gen.L. ch. 79A, &#167; 7 and, in particular, the implementing regulations, 760 C.M.R. 27.09(8), 27.09(13), and 27.09(14).   MEDIC's short answer is that MEDIC is a taking authority governed by Mass.Gen.L. ch. 121C, and that the relocation payment regulations that Cumberland relies upon apply to authorities governed by Mass.Gen.L. ch. 121A and 121B, but not to 121C agencies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See 760 C.M.R. 27.01(4) (listing activities and entities to which the relocation payment regulations apply).   We agree with MEDIC, as did the district court, and conclude that Cumberland is entitled to reimbursement only as provided in Mass.Gen.L. ch. 79A, &#167; 7, and not under the more expansive provisions of 760 C.M.R. 27.09.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Cumberland claims that the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that MEDIC had fulfilled its relocation assistance obligations to Cumberland.   We review this factual finding<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> for clear error, and we find no error, let alone clear error, in the bankruptcy court's denial of Cumberland's claims for damages due to MEDIC's failure to provide relocation assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

We deem this issue waived, as Cumberland has not referred to it in its brief.   See, e.g., Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 700 (1st Cir.1991) (issues not fully presented in appellate brief are deemed waived)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The relocation assistance regulations, in contrast to the relocation payment regulations, appear to apply broadly to all entities authorized to take by eminent domain.   See 760 C.M.R. 27.01(4)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that the record contains documents provided by MEDIC to Cumberland that seem to promise reimbursement of the types of expenses that the bankruptcy court denied.   Cumberland's brief, however, does not contain any arguments based on estoppel or similar theories.   Therefore such arguments, whatever their merit, are waived.   See, e.g., Willhauck, 953 F.2d at 700</p>\n        <p>We have not considered any of the arguments raised by Cumberland in its Motion for Leave to Present Rebuttal Argument Pursuant to Local Rule 34.1(b).   Cumberland had an opportunity to raise rebuttal arguments in a reply brief, but chose not to submit one.   Moreover, Local Rule 34.1(b) pertains to oral rebuttal during the scheduled argument, and does not provide an opportunity for further briefing of issues after oral argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Cumberland's brief could be read to suggest that the bankruptcy court's ruling in this regard was a legal conclusion concerning an earlier order of the Massachusetts Superior Court.   Even though Cumberland has not clearly presented that argument, a de novo review of the bankruptcy court's ruling would yield the same result:  no error</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Halpin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575825\"><a href=\"/opinion/575825/francis-a-willhauck-jr-v-paul-halpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 700 (1st Cir.1991) (issues not fully presented in appellate brief are deemed waived)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The relocation assistance regulations, in contrast to the relocation payment regulations, appear to apply broadly to all entities authorized to take by eminent domain.   See 760 C.M.R. 27.01(4)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that the record contains documents provided by MEDIC to Cumberland that seem to promise reimbursement of the types of expenses that the bankruptcy court denied.   Cumberland's brief, however, does not contain any arguments based on estoppel or similar theories.   Therefore such arguments, whatever their merit, are waived.   See, e.g., Willhauck, 953 F.2d at 700</p>\n        <p>We have not considered any of the arguments raised by Cumberland in its Motion for Leave to Present Rebuttal Argument Pursuant to Local Rule 34.1(b).   Cumberland had an opportunity to raise rebuttal arguments in a reply brief, but chose not to submit one.   Moreover, Local Rule 34.1(b) pertains to oral rebuttal during the scheduled argument, and does not provide an opportunity for further briefing of issues after oral argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Cumberland's brief could be read to suggest that the bankruptcy court's ruling in this regard was a legal conclusion concerning an earlier order of the Massachusetts Superior Court.   Even though Cumberland has not clearly presented that argument, a de novo review of the bankruptcy court's ruling would yield the same result:  no error</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
