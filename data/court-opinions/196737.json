See, e.g.,  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                         \r\n\n          The overarching conspiracy  that the government charged\r\n\nin the indictment  and attempted to  portray at trial  pirouetted\r\n\naround Wilfredo  Figueroa, a Lawrence, Massachusetts drug dealer.\r\n\nFigueroa began his career as a  purveyor of cocaine.  In 1991, he\r\n\nshifted his  attention to heroin.   He soon built up  a roster of\r\n\napproximately  fifteen clients,  all from  Maine.   In  a typical\r\n\ntransaction  a client  would call  Figueroa from  Maine, order  a\r\n\ncertain  quantity of heroin, and then sojourn to Lawrence to take\r\n\ndelivery.    Occasionally a  client  would  appear on  Figueroa's\r\n\ndoorstep   without  any   prearrangement,   and  Figueroa   would\r\n\nimprovise.\r\n\n          In  effect, Figueroa acted  as a  middleman (or  so the\r\n\njury could have found).   From October 1991  forward, he had  two\r\n\nsuppliers:  Angel  Soto and the  appellant.  Figueroa  patronized\r\n\nSoto as his principal  supply source but turned to  the appellant\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nwhenever  Soto could  not fill  an order.   Furthermore,  some of\r\n\nFigueroa's  clients  preferred the  \"brand\"  of  heroin that  the\r\n\nappellant carried,  and Figueroa invariably used  Santiago as his\r\n\nsource of supply whenever a client ordered that brand.1\r\n\n          When  Figueroa asked  for  heroin, the  appellant would\r\n\neither  deliver  the  drugs   personally  or  arrange  for  their\r\n\ndelivery.    All  the  deliveries took  place  in  Massachusetts.\r\n\nFigueroa (who cooperated with the government and testified at the\r\n\ntrial)  stated  that he  purchased an  average  of fifty  bags of\r\n\nheroin a day from the appellant  at $15 apiece, often on  credit.\r\n\nAlthough the appellant claims that he never met any of the retail\r\n\ncustomers,  the government  presented evidence  that contradicted\r\n\nthis   assertion;  and,  moreover,  Figueroa  testified  that  he\r\n\ninformed the  appellant  that all  his clients  were coming  from\r\n\nMaine to Massachusetts to buy heroin.\r\n\n          Figueroa's  involvement in  the drug  trade followed  a\r\n\nhallowed family  tradition.   His uncle, Roberto  Figueroa, dealt\r\n\ndrugs in Maine.  Blood may be thicker than water, but it is by no\r\n\nmeans  thicker  than self-interest.    When lawmen  closed  in on\r\n\nRoberto Figueroa's operation he threw his nephew to the wolves in\r\n\nhopes of mitigating his own punishment.   To help set the  snare,\r\n\nRoberto  ordered 130 bags of heroin from his compliant nephew and\r\n\ndemanded delivery in  Maine.   The appellant sold  fifty bags  of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Santiago  (who  wrapped  individual  doses  of   heroin  in\r\nplastic)  and Soto (who used paper  bags) packaged their products\r\ndifferently.   Clients identified their preference  for one brand\r\nover another by reference to the packaging.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nheroin to Figueroa and  Soto supplied the remainder.   On January\r\n\n15, 1992, Figueroa  and Soto  exchanged the drugs  for cash at  a\r\n\ndesignated  rest  area  alongside  the Maine  Turnpike  and  were\r\n\npromptly arrested.  The  authorities apprehended the appellant in\r\n\nMassachusetts and, without objection,   removed him to Maine  for\r\n\ntrial.   He  was  convicted and  sentenced in  due course.   This\r\n\nappeal ensued.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                             Analysis\r                                       Analysis\r                                               \r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n                   Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                             Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                                                        \r\n\n          The appellant   who is represented by fresh  counsel on\r\n\nappeal     argues  that  the  government  presented  insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to justify a conviction.   Since the  appellant did not\r\n\npreserve  a  sufficiency  challenge  by moving  for  judgment  of\r\n\nacquittal at the close of all the evidence, see Fed.  R. Crim. P.\r                                                         \r\n\n29, our  review is limited  to the prevention of  clear and gross\r\n\ninjustice.   See United States v.  Taylor, 54 F.3d  967, 975 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1995); United  States v. McDowell,  918 F.2d  1004, 1009-10\r                                                 \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          To  determine a  sufficiency challenge,  we customarily\r\n\ninquire  whether the evidence, taken  in the light most favorable\r\n\nto the government   a perspective that requires us to draw  every\r\n\nplausible inference in line with the verdict and to resolve every\r\n\ncredibility conflict in the  same fashion   permitted  a rational\r\n\njury  to find each essential element of the offense of conviction\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nto have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Olbres,  61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct.\r                                                               \r\n\n522 (1995); Maraj, 947 F.2d at  522-23.  In a conspiracy case, as\r                           \r\n\nin virtually  any other  criminal case,  the government can  meet\r\n\nthis  burden by either  direct or circumstantial  evidence, or by\r\n\nany  combination thereof.   See  United States v.  Echeverri, 982\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 675, 679 (1st Cir.  1993); United States v. David,  940 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n722, 735 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1046 (1992). \r                                                \r\n\n          The  appellant's sufficiency  challenge  is lacking  in\r\n\nmerit.  Under the statute of conviction, 21 U.S.C.    846, it was\r\n\nincumbent  upon the  government to  establish that  the appellant\r\n\nagreed with Figueroa (and,  according to the indictment, possibly\r\n\n\"other  persons\"), at  least tacitly,  to commit  the substantive\r\n\ncrime     heroin  distribution,  see  21  U.S.C.     841(a)(1)  &amp;\r                                              \r\n\n(b)(1)(C)    which constituted the object of their agreement, and\r\n\nthat he  thereafter participated in the  conspiracy knowingly and\r\n\nvoluntarily.   See Echeverri, 982  F.2d at 679.   The record here\r                                      \r\n\nsatisfies those criteria.\r\n\n          To  be sure,  the appellant  makes an  impassioned plea\r\n\nthat the evidence shows no  more than a buyer-seller relationship\r\n\nbetween  him  and  Figueroa.   We  agree  with  the premise  that\r\n\nunderlies this  plea:  a buyer-seller  relationship, simpliciter,\r\n\nis an insufficient predicate for a finding that the buyer and the\r\n\nseller are guilty as coconspirators.  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMancari, 875 F.2d 103, 105 (7th Cir. 1989) (holding that the sale\r                 \r\n\nof drugs  in small  quantities is inadequate,  without additional\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nevidence, to support a finding of conspiracy to distribute  drugs\r\n\nto others because  the seller could reasonably  believe that such\r\n\npurchases  are intended for the  buyer's personal use).   But the\r\n\npremise provides the  appellant no  safe harbor on  the facts  of\r\n\nthis case.   While a scenario in which  A sells to B (who resells\r\n\nto C, D,  E, and F) may signify that A  and B are related only as\r\n\nvendor  and vendee, such a  scenario may also  signify a broader,\r\n\nmore imbricated relationship.  See, e.g., United States v. Moran,\r                                                                          \r\n\n984 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir. 1993).  Knowledge and intent are at\r\n\nthe core of  the issue.   Thus, the  question in such  a case  is\r\n\nwhether the evidence surrounding the transaction(s) is sufficient\r\n\nto allow a fairminded jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\n\nA knew that B was reselling the drugs, and intended to facilitate\r\n\nthe resales.  See id.\r                               \r\n\n          The evidence here, taken in the light most congenial to\r\n\nthe verdict,  establishes that the relationship  between Figueroa\r\n\nand Santiago contained  enough elements  of \"[c]ommon  knowledge,\r\n\ninterdependence, [and] shared purpose,\" id., to support a finding\r                                                     \r\n\nthat  they  were coconspirators.    Figueroa  testified that  the\r\n\nappellant had  actual knowledge of  the follow-on sales  to Maine\r\n\nresidents.   Two  of  Figueroa's customers  testified that  on at\r\n\nleast one occasion  the appellant  made a delivery  of heroin  to\r\n\nFigueroa's home and met some of his clients.\r\n\n          The foregoing testimony  was amply corroborated by  the\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence.  The appellant sold  Figueroa quantities\r\n\nof drugs  (fifty bags per  day) well beyond  the outer limits  of\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\npersonal  use amounts and packaged them in a manner suggestive of\r\n\nintended  resale.    The  regularity  of  the  transactions,  the\r\n\nquantities  of heroin,  the  amounts of  money involved,  and the\r\n\nfinancial  terms (especially the  appellant's extension of credit\r\n\nto Figueroa),  taken  together, form  a sturdy  foundation for  a\r\n\nfinding  that the  appellant and  Figueroa had  at least  a tacit\r\n\nagreement  to distribute the heroin to third parties.  Since they\r\n\nacted  upon that  tacit  agreement (or  so  the jury  could  have\r\n\nfound), the appellant's conviction is sustainable by any measure.\r\n\nSurely, it does not work an injustice.2\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r                                            \r\n\n                              Venue\r                                        Venue\r                                             \r\n\n          The  appellant next  asserts that  he was  tried  in an\r\n\nimproper venue because he never committed a crime in the District\r\n\nof  Maine.   This assertion  is baseless.   It is  settled beyond\r\n\nperadventure  that  venue is  a personal  privilege which  can be\r\n\nwaived.   See Fed.  R. Crim. P.  18; see also  Charles A. Wright,\r                                                       \r\n\nFederal Practice  and Procedure   306  (2d ed. 1982).   Here, the\r                                         \r\n\nappellant  consented to  his removal  and to  the holding  of the\r\n\nproceedings in Maine.

P. 12(b)(2) (mandating waiver of  most defenses that could\r\n\nhave been, but were not, raised prior to trial).\r\n\n          In all events, the  argument fails on the merits.   The\r\n\nvenue  requirement is  designed to  prevent a  criminal defendant\r\n\nfrom having to defend himself  in a place that has  no meaningful\r\n\nconnection to the  offense with which he is charged.   This court\r\n\nheld in United  States v. Uribe,  890 F.2d 554  (1st Cir.  1989),\r                                         \r\n\nthat  in a  conspiracy case  venue is  proper in any  district in\r\n\nwhich an act in  furtherance of the charged conspiracy  has taken\r\n\nplace,  even  if  a  particular  coconspirator  was  not  himself\r\n\nphysically  present  in that  district.   See  id. at  558.   The\r                                                            \r\n\nactuation  of a  drug distribution  conspiracy culminates  in the\r\n\nsale and delivery of  the controlled substance.  Thus,  any place\r\n\nin which the culmination  occurs provides a lawful venue  for the\r\n\nprosecution of the offense.  See id.\r                                              \r\n\n          In  this  instance,  the conspirators  distributed  the\r\n\nheroin  to Maine  residents knowing that  it would  be introduced\r\n\ninto Maine and consumed there for the most part.  Moreover, on at\r\n\nleast one occasion the  appellant's cohort, Figueroa,  personally\r\n\ndelivered  heroin  to   a  Maine  locus  in  furtherance  of  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The appellant's attempt to blunt this waiver by citing  the\r\nalleged ineffectiveness of his  trial counsel is unavailing.   We\r\nhave  consistently  held    and  today  reaffirm    that,  absent\r\nexceptional   circumstances  (not  now   present),  a   claim  of\r\nineffective assistance of counsel  cannot debut on direct appeal.\r\nSee  United States  v.

Because  these\r\n\nexhortations  are raised for the  first time on  appeal we review\r\n\nthem only for plain error.   See United States v. Arcadipane,  41\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st  Cir. 1994).  A close look assures  us that, under\r\n\nthe  jurisprudence of  plain error,  neither allegation  requires\r\n\nreversal.\r\n\n          We start  by addressing the allegation  that a variance\r\n\nexisted  between the indictment and the evidence.  The genesis of\r\n\nthe  claim  is as  follows.    Near the  end  of  the trial,  the\r\n\nattorneys presented a stipulation to the court.   The stipulation\r\n\nconfirmed that the  contraband seized from  Figueroa in Maine  at\r\n\nthe time  of  the denouement  comprised eighty-one  bags \"of  the\r\n\npaper  type\"  and fifty  bags \"of  the  plastic type.\"    But the\r\n\nstipulation  erroneously described the  drugs as marijuana rather\r\n\nthan  heroin.  It seems  likely that no  one noticed the misnomer\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nfor  the  court accepted  the  stipulation  without comment,  and\r\n\nduring closing  arguments each  side specifically  identified the\r\n\nbags as containing  heroin.   The appellant now  claims that  the\r\n\nobvious  error in  the stipulation  is a  variance  sufficient to\r\n\nwarrant vacation of the conviction.  We do not agree.\r\n\n          The  key  datum  surrounding  a claim  of  variance  is\r\n\nwhether the  purported variance is sufficiently  severe to affect\r\n\nthe substantial  rights of the accused.  See id. at 6-7.  Passing\r                                                          \r\n\nthe  point of whether a  criminal defendant ever  can predicate a\r                                                          \r\n\nclaim of variance on the introduction of evidence to which he has\r\n\nstipulated, the claimed variance is more apparent than real.  The\r\n\nrecord  discloses  that  the  reference  to  \"marijuana\"  was  an\r\n\nisolated  event.   The  indictment, the  opening statements,  the\r\n\ntrial testimony,  the summations,  and the district  court's jury\r\n\ninstructions all spoke exclusively  and unambiguously of heroin  \r\n\nnot  marijuana.    Moreover,  there  is   nothing  in  the  trial\r\n\ntranscript that suggests any basis for a claim that the appellant\r\n\nwas either misled or surprised   and he has not broached any such\r\n\ntheory in his appellate briefs.\r\n\n          A criminal defendant  is entitled to a  fair trial, not\r\n\nnecessarily a perfect  one.  Viewed in  the context of  the whole\r\n\nrecord, the misstatement  is at  worst the type  of minor  defect\r\n\nthat cannot plausibly be said to impact a defendant's substantial\r\n\nrights.   See, e.g., United  States v. Fermin  Castillo, 829 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1194, 1196-97 (1st Cir. 1987) (reaching a similar conclusion when\r\n\nthe indictment  misstated  the  name  of  the  bank  that  issued\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nmaterial  documents and  mischaracterized the  purpose for  which\r\n\nthese documents  were used).   Since the  stipulated misstatement\r\n\ndid not deprive the appellant of his due,  plain error is plainly\r\n\nlacking.\r\n\n          In  a related vein,  the appellant  raises an  issue of\r\n\nspillover from one  conspiracy to  another.  We  find this  claim\r\n\nhard  to follow.  In virtually all cases involving allegations of\r\n\nprejudicial spillover the trial  involves more than one defendant\r\n\nor more than  one count.  See, e.g., United  States v. Wihbey, 75\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  761, 774-75 (1st Cir.  1996); United States  v. Boylan, 898\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  230, 248  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  498 U.S.  849 (1990).\r                                                   \r\n\nHere, however, the appellant stood trial alone on a single charge\r\n\n  and the only evidence admitted at the trial was evidence deemed\r\n\nrelevant  to his guilt  or innocence on  that charge.   Thus, the\r\n\nclaim of prejudicial spillover is a non sequitur.\r\n\n          In  a vain  effort  to overcome  this incongruity,  the\r\n\nappellant suggests that his  dealings with Figueroa were entirely\r\n\ndistinct from Soto's dealing with Figueroa, and that the evidence\r\n\nanent the  Soto-Figueroa dealings \"spilled  over\" and  prejudiced\r\n\nthe jury against  him.  This  view misconceives both  the law  of\r\n\nconspiracy and the rules of evidence.  It is settled that members\r\n\nof a conspiracy need not all know each other, work  side by side,\r\n\nor  otherwise march  in lockstep.   See,  e.g., United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSepulveda,  15 F.3d 1161, 1191 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114\r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct. 2714  (1994); United States  v. Rivera-Santiago, 872  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1073, 1079  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910 &amp; 493 U.S. 832\r                                              \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n(1989).    The  government's  theory  here,  as  limned  in   the\r\n\nindictment and  bill of particulars, posited  a single conspiracy\r\n\nwith  Figueroa as a  linchpin.  The  court permitted  the jury to\r\n\nhear  the evidence of Soto's  involvement on that  basis, for the\r\n\nmost part without objection.  We discern no error in the district\r\n\ncourt's  reception  of  the evidence.    See  Fed.  R.

Because this supposed  bevue involves the\r\n\nsentencing  court's  interpretation  of a  guideline,  we  afford\r\n\nplenary review.  See United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir. 1994).  The guideline states:\r\n\n          A defendant  is a career offender  if (1) the\r\n          defendant was at least  eighteen years old at\r\n          the  time of  the  instant offense,  (2)  the\r\n          instant  offense of  conviction  is a  felony\r\n          that  is  either a  crime  of  violence or  a\r\n          controlled  substance  offense,  and (3)  the\r\n          defendant  has  at  least  two  prior  felony\r\n          convictions of either a crime of  violence or\r\n          a controlled substance offense.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.1 (Nov. 1992).   The question before us  is whether\r\n\nthe appellant's predicate  offenses crossed the two-prior-felony-\r\n\nconvictions threshold established by  4B1.1.\r\n\n          The  appellant's criminal  record  as disclosed  in the\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\npresentence investigation  report included  (1) a  conviction for\r\n\nassault and  battery against a  police officer, (2)  a conviction\r\n\nfor  assault and battery with  a dangerous weapon  (a work boot),\r\n\n(3) multiple convictions on narcotics charges (including a charge\r\n\nof  distributing heroin) stemming  from a single  arrest on March\r\n\n20,  1990,  and  (4)  another  set  of  multiple  convictions  on\r\n\nnarcotics-related  charges (including  possession of  heroin with\r\n\nintent to distribute) stemming  from a second arrest on  April 9,\r\n\n1990.  The  two drug arrests occurred within a  few weeks of each\r\n\nother and they were eventually consolidated for sentencing.   The\r\n\nappellant claims  that this consolidation rendered  the crimes we\r\n\nhave listed under  items (3)  and (4) \"related  cases\" and  meant\r\n\nthat  they had to be treated as  a single offense for purposes of\r\n\n 4B1.1.  See  U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(a)(2)  &amp; comment. (n.3).   He  also\r                      \r\n\nargues that because he  received a sentence of under  one year on\r\n\neach  of  the assault  and battery  convictions, neither  of them\r\n\nconstitutes  a cognizable  predicate  offense.   Inasmuch as  the\r\n\nappellant's  second argument  is clearly  erroneous, we  need not\r\n\naddress the question of whether the two sets of narcotics charges\r\n\nconstitute  separate predicate offenses under the career offender\r\n\nguideline.\r\n\n          U.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)  defines  a crime  of  violence  in\r\n\npertinent  part  as  \"any  offense  under  federal or  state  law\r\n\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that . .\r\n\n.  has as an element the use .  . . of physical force against the\r\n\nperson of another.\"   The appellant contends that neither  of his\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nprior convictions for assault and battery satisfy the requirement\r\n\nof being  \"punishable by  imprisonment for  a term  exceeding one\r\n\nyear\" since  he received a  six-month sentence on  each occasion.\r\n\nThe guideline, however,  does not  speak in terms  of a  judicial\r                                                                           \r\n\njudgment  (the length of the sentence meted out), but, rather, in\r\n\nterms   of  a   legislative  judgment  (the   maximum  punishment\r                                     \r\n\napplicable to the offense).  See  U.S.S.G.  4B1.2, comment.

Sanchez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n917 F.2d 607, 615 (1st Cir. 1990) (reaching the same conclusion),\r\n\ncert.  denied, 499  U.S. 977  (1991).   The offenses  occurred in\r                       \r\n\nMassachusetts,  and assault  and battery  was punishable  in that\r\n\ncommonwealth at  the time by  imprisonment of up  to two-and-one-\r\n\nhalf years.   See Mass. Gen. L.  ch. 265,   13A (1990).   Seen in\r                           \r\n\nthis light,  the appellant's convictions for  assault and battery\r\n\nconstitute predicate  offenses within  the purview of  the career\r\n\noffender guideline.4  Thus,  the sentencing court did not  err in\r\n\ntreating the appellant as a career offender.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The appellant argues that  the later conviction for assault\r\nand battery  with a dangerous  weapon should be  excluded because\r\nthe  \"weapon\" was  a pair  of work  boots.   We  do not  see what\r\npossible difference flows from this distinction.  For one  thing,\r\nwe take  a categorical approach  to the examination  of predicate\r\noffenses in order to determine whether they meet the requirements\r\nof the career offender guideline.  See, e.g.,  Winter, 22 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n18.  For another thing, assault and battery is no less a crime of\r\nviolence  because the  assailant  stomps his  victim rather  than\r\nassaulting him in some more traditional manner.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          We  need go no further.  The other assignments of error\r\n\nare patently meritless and do not warrant discussion.

Santiago guilty of a single count of conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and the district court sentenced him as a career offender.   Santiago now challenges his conviction and sentence.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We limn the facts in the light most congenial to the verdict, consistent with record support.   See, e.g., United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 522 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overarching conspiracy that the government charged in the indictment and attempted to portray at trial pirouetted around Wilfredo Figueroa, a Lawrence, Massachusetts drug dealer.   Figueroa began his career as a purveyor of cocaine.   In 1991, he shifted his attention to heroin.   He soon built up a roster of approximately fifteen clients, all from Maine.   In a typical transaction a client would call Figueroa from Maine, order a certain quantity of heroin, and then sojourn to Lawrence to take delivery.   Occasionally a client would appear on Figueroa's doorstep without any prearrangement, and Figueroa would improvise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, Figueroa acted as a middleman (or so the jury could have found).   From October 1991 forward, he had two suppliers:  Angel Soto and the appellant.   Figueroa patronized Soto as his principal supply source but turned to the appellant whenever Soto could not fill an order.   Furthermore, some of Figueroa's clients preferred the \"brand\" of heroin that the appellant carried, and Figueroa invariably used Santiago as his source of supply whenever a client ordered that brand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Figueroa asked for heroin, the appellant would either deliver the drugs personally or arrange for their delivery.   All the deliveries took place in Massachusetts.   Figueroa (who cooperated with the government and testified at the trial) stated that he purchased an average of fifty bags of heroin a day from the appellant at $15 apiece, often on credit.   Although the appellant claims that he never met any of the retail customers, the government presented evidence that contradicted this assertion;  and, moreover, Figueroa testified that he informed the appellant that all his clients were coming from Maine to Massachusetts to buy heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa's involvement in the drug trade followed a hallowed family tradition.   His uncle, Roberto Figueroa, dealt drugs in Maine.   Blood may be thicker than water, but it is by no means thicker than self-interest.   When lawmen closed in on Roberto Figueroa's operation he threw his nephew to the wolves in hopes of mitigating his own punishment.   To help set the snare, Roberto ordered 130 bags of heroin from his compliant nephew and demanded delivery in Maine.   The appellant sold fifty bags of heroin to Figueroa and Soto supplied the remainder.   On January 15, 1992, Figueroa and Soto exchanged the drugs for cash at a designated rest area alongside the Maine Turnpike and were promptly arrested.   The authorities apprehended the appellant in Massachusetts and, without objection, removed him to Maine for trial.   He was convicted and sentenced in due course.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant--who is represented by fresh counsel on appeal--argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to justify a conviction.   Since the appellant did not preserve a sufficiency challenge by moving for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, our review is limited to the prevention of clear and gross injustice.   See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1009-10 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine a sufficiency challenge, we customarily inquire whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the government--a perspective that requires us to draw every plausible inference in line with the verdict and to resolve every credibility conflict in the same fashion--permitted a rational jury to find each essential element of the offense of conviction to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.   See United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 522, 133 L.Ed.2d 430 (1995);  Maraj, 947 F.2d at 522-23.   In a conspiracy case, as in virtually any other criminal case, the government can meet this burden by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by any combination thereof.   See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 679 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 735 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1046, 112 S.Ct. 908, 116 L.Ed.2d 809 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's sufficiency challenge is lacking in merit.   Under the statute of conviction, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, it was incumbent upon the government to establish that the appellant agreed with Figueroa (and, according to the indictment, possibly \"other persons\"), at least tacitly, to commit the substantive crime--heroin distribution, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C)--which constituted the object of their agreement, and that he thereafter participated in the conspiracy knowingly and voluntarily.   See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.   The record here satisfies those criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the appellant makes an impassioned plea that the evidence shows no more than a buyer-seller relationship between him and Figueroa.   We agree with the premise that underlies this plea:  a buyer-seller relationship, simpliciter, is an insufficient predicate for a finding that the buyer and the seller are guilty as coconspirators.   See, e.g., United States v. Mancari, 875 F.2d 103, 105 (7th Cir.1989) (holding that the sale of drugs in small quantities is inadequate, without additional evidence, to support a finding of conspiracy to distribute drugs to others because the seller could reasonably believe that such purchases are intended for the buyer's personal use).   But the premise provides the appellant no safe harbor on the facts of this case.   While a scenario in which A sells to B (who resells to C, D, E, and F) may signify that A and B are related only as vendor and vendee, such a scenario may also signify a broader, more imbricated relationship.   See, e.g., United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir.1993).   Knowledge and intent are at the core of the issue.   Thus, the question in such a case is whether the evidence surrounding the transaction(s) is sufficient to allow a fairminded jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that A knew that B was reselling the drugs, and intended to facilitate the resales.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here, taken in the light most congenial to the verdict, establishes that the relationship between Figueroa and Santiago contained enough elements of \"[c]ommon knowledge, interdependence, [and] shared purpose,\" id., to support a finding that they were coconspirators.   Figueroa testified that the appellant had actual knowledge of the follow-on sales to Maine residents.   Two of Figueroa's customers testified that on at least one occasion the appellant made a delivery of heroin to Figueroa's home and met some of his clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing testimony was amply corroborated by the circumstantial evidence.   The appellant sold Figueroa quantities of drugs (fifty bags per day) well beyond the outer limits of personal use amounts and packaged them in a manner suggestive of intended resale.   The regularity of the transactions, the quantities of heroin, the amounts of money involved, and the financial terms (especially the appellant's extension of credit to Figueroa), taken together, form a sturdy foundation for a finding that the appellant and Figueroa had at least a tacit agreement to distribute the heroin to third parties.   Since they acted upon that tacit agreement (or so the jury could have found), the appellant's conviction is sustainable by any measure.   Surely, it does not work an injustice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Venue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next asserts that he was tried in an improper venue because he never committed a crime in the District of Maine.   This assertion is baseless.   It is settled beyond peradventure that venue is a personal privilege which can be waived.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 18;  see also, 2 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 306 (2d ed. 1982).   Here, the appellant consented to his removal and to the holding of the proceedings in Maine.   He submitted to trial there without ever contesting venue.   He has, therefore, waived the right to raise a venue-based challenge to his conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See United States v. Cordero, 668 F.2d 32, 44-45 (1st Cir.1981);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) (mandating waiver of most defenses that could have been, but were not, raised prior to trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the argument fails on the merits.   The venue requirement is designed to prevent a criminal defendant from having to defend himself in a place that has no meaningful connection to the offense with which he is charged.   This court held in United States v. Uribe, 890 F.2d 554 (1st Cir.1989), that in a conspiracy case venue is proper in any district in which an act in furtherance of the charged conspiracy has taken place, even if a particular coconspirator was not himself physically present in that district.   See id. at 558.   The actuation of a drug distribution conspiracy culminates in the sale and delivery of the controlled substance.   Thus, any place in which the culmination occurs provides a lawful venue for the prosecution of the offense.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the conspirators distributed the heroin to Maine residents knowing that it would be introduced into Maine and consumed there for the most part.   Moreover, on at least one occasion the appellant's cohort, Figueroa, personally delivered heroin to a Maine locus in furtherance of the conspiracy (or so the jury could have found).   This single, overt act, taking place in Maine, is itself sufficient to sustain venue in the District of Maine.   See id. at 558-59;  Cordero, 668 F.2d at 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant claims a prejudicial variance between the indictment and the proof, and also claims that there was injurious spillover from certain evidence regarding a second conspiracy (of which he was not a member).   Because these exhortations are raised for the first time on appeal we review them only for plain error.   See United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1994).   A close look assures us that, under the jurisprudence of plain error, neither allegation requires reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by addressing the allegation that a variance existed between the indictment and the evidence.   The genesis of the claim is as follows.   Near the end of the trial, the attorneys presented a stipulation to the court.   The stipulation confirmed that the contraband seized from Figueroa in Maine at the time of the denouement comprised eighty-one bags \"of the paper type\" and fifty bags \"of the plastic type.\"   But the stipulation erroneously described the drugs as marijuana rather than heroin.   It seems likely that no one noticed the misnomer for the court accepted the stipulation without comment, and during closing arguments each side specifically identified the bags as containing heroin.   The appellant now claims that the obvious error in the stipulation is a variance sufficient to warrant vacation of the conviction.   We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key datum surrounding a claim of variance is whether the purported variance is sufficiently severe to affect the substantial rights of the accused.   See id. at 6-7.   Passing the point of whether a criminal defendant ever can predicate a claim of variance on the introduction of evidence to which he has stipulated, the claimed variance is more apparent than real.   The record discloses that the reference to \"marijuana\" was an isolated event.   The indictment, the opening statements, the trial testimony, the summations, and the district court's jury instructions all spoke exclusively and unambiguously of heroin--not marijuana.   Moreover, there is nothing in the trial transcript that suggests any basis for a claim that the appellant was either misled or surprised--and he has not broached any such theory in his appellate briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not necessarily a perfect one.   Viewed in the context of the whole record, the misstatement is at worst the type of minor defect that cannot plausibly be said to impact a defendant's substantial rights.   See, e.g., United States v. Fermin Castillo, 829 F.2d 1194, 1196-97 (1st Cir.1987) (reaching a similar conclusion when the indictment misstated the name of the bank that issued material documents and mischaracterized the purpose for which these documents were used).   Since the stipulated misstatement did not deprive the appellant of his due, plain error is plainly lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, the appellant raises an issue of spillover from one conspiracy to another.   We find this claim hard to follow.   In virtually all cases involving allegations of prejudicial spillover the trial involves more than one defendant or more than one count.   See, e.g., United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 774-75 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 248 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990).   Here, however, the appellant stood trial alone on a single charge--and the only evidence admitted at the trial was evidence deemed relevant to his guilt or innocence on that charge.   Thus, the claim of prejudicial spillover is a non sequitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a vain effort to overcome this incongruity, the appellant suggests that his dealings with Figueroa were entirely distinct from Soto's dealing with Figueroa, and that the evidence anent the Soto-Figueroa dealings \"spilled over\" and prejudiced the jury against him.   This view misconceives both the law of conspiracy and the rules of evidence.   It is settled that members of a conspiracy need not all know each other, work side by side, or otherwise march in lockstep.   See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1191 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994);  United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910, 109 S.Ct. 3227, 106 L.Ed.2d 576 &amp; 493 U.S. 832, 110 S.Ct. 105, 107 L.Ed.2d 68 (1989).   The government's theory here, as limned in the indictment and bill of particulars, posited a single conspiracy with Figueroa as a linchpin.   The court permitted the jury to hear the evidence of Soto's involvement on that basis, for the most part without objection.   We discern no error in the district court's reception of the evidence.   See Fed.R.Evid. 401 (defining relevancy);  see also United States v. Nazzaro, 889 F.2d 1158, 1168 (1st Cir.1989) (applying abuse of discretion test to admission of evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final claim is that the lower court improperly applied the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, to his case.   Because this supposed bevue involves the sentencing court's interpretation of a guideline, we afford plenary review.   See United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1994).   The guideline states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1 (Nov. 1992).   The question before us is whether the appellant's predicate offenses crossed the two-prior-felony-convictions threshold established by &#167; 4B1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's criminal record as disclosed in the presentence investigation report included (1) a conviction for assault and battery against a police officer, (2) a conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a work boot), (3) multiple convictions on narcotics charges (including a charge of distributing heroin) stemming from a single arrest on March 20, 1990, and (4) another set of multiple convictions on narcotics-related charges (including possession of heroin with intent to distribute) stemming from a second arrest on April 9, 1990.   The two drug arrests occurred within a few weeks of each other and they were eventually consolidated for sentencing.   The appellant claims that this consolidation rendered the crimes we have listed under items (3) and (4) \"related cases\" and meant that they had to be treated as a single offense for purposes of &#167; 4B1.1.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2) &amp; comment.  (n. 3).   He also argues that because he received a sentence of under one year on each of the assault and battery convictions, neither of them constitutes a cognizable predicate offense.   Inasmuch as the appellant's second argument is clearly erroneous, we need not address the question of whether the two sets of narcotics charges constitute separate predicate offenses under the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1) defines a crime of violence in pertinent part as \"any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that ... has as an element the use ... of physical force against the person of another.\"   The appellant contends that neither of his prior convictions for assault and battery satisfy the requirement of being \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" since he received a six-month sentence on each occasion.   The guideline, however, does not speak in terms of a judicial judgment (the length of the sentence meted out), but, rather, in terms of a legislative judgment (the maximum punishment applicable to the offense).   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, comment.  (n. 3) (Nov. 1992) (explaining that a \" '[p]rior felony conviction' means a prior ... conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of ... the actual sentence imposed\");  see also United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 615 (1st Cir.1990) (reaching the same conclusion), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 977, 111 S.Ct. 1625, 113 L.Ed.2d 722 (1991).   The offenses occurred in Massachusetts, and assault and battery was punishable in that commonwealth at the time by imprisonment of up to two-and-one-half years.   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 265, &#167; 13A (1990).   Seen in this light, the appellant's convictions for assault and battery constitute predicate offenses within the purview of the career offender guideline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, the sentencing court did not err in treating the appellant as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   The other assignments of error are patently meritless and do not warrant discussion.   The record reflects, without serious question, that the appellant experienced a fair trial in a proper venue, and that he was lawfully convicted and sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Santiago (who wrapped individual doses of heroin in plastic) and Soto (who used paper bags) packaged their products differently.

We reject this claim for the reasons discussed in Part II(B), infra, and for the added reason that the indictment charges a drug distribution conspiracy that took place in \"Maine, Massachusetts, and elsewhere,\" unanchored to a single locale</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The appellant's attempt to blunt this waiver by citing the alleged ineffectiveness of his trial counsel is unavailing.   We have consistently held--and today reaffirm--that, absent exceptional circumstances (not now present), a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot debut on direct appeal.   See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1839, 128 L.Ed.2d 466 (1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The appellant argues that the later conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon should be excluded because the \"weapon\" was a pair of work boots.   We do not see what possible difference flows from this distinction.   For one thing, we take a categorical approach to the examination of predicate offenses in order to determine whether they meet the requirements of the career offender guideline.   See, e.g., Winter, 22 F.3d at 18.   For another thing, assault and battery is no less a crime of violence because the assailant stomps his victim rather than assaulting him in some more traditional manner</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Santiago now challenges his conviction and sentence.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We limn the facts in the light most congenial to the verdict, consistent with record support.   See, e.g., United States v. Maraj, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570481\"><a href=\"/opinion/570481/united-states-v-michael-maraj-united-states-of-america-v-sterling/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 522 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The overarching conspiracy that the government charged in the indictment and attempted to portray at trial pirouetted around Wilfredo Figueroa, a Lawrence, Massachusetts drug dealer.   Figueroa began his career as a purveyor of cocaine.   In 1991, he shifted his attention to heroin.   He soon built up a roster of approximately fifteen clients, all from Maine.   In a typical transaction a client would call Figueroa from Maine, order a certain quantity of heroin, and then sojourn to Lawrence to take delivery.   Occasionally a client would appear on Figueroa's doorstep without any prearrangement, and Figueroa would improvise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In effect, Figueroa acted as a middleman (or so the jury could have found).   From October 1991 forward, he had two suppliers:  Angel Soto and the appellant.   Figueroa patronized Soto as his principal supply source but turned to the appellant whenever Soto could not fill an order.   Furthermore, some of Figueroa's clients preferred the \"brand\" of heroin that the appellant carried, and Figueroa invariably used Santiago as his source of supply whenever a client ordered that brand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Figueroa asked for heroin, the appellant would either deliver the drugs personally or arrange for their delivery.   All the deliveries took place in Massachusetts.   Figueroa (who cooperated with the government and testified at the trial) stated that he purchased an average of fifty bags of heroin a day from the appellant at $15 apiece, often on credit.   Although the appellant claims that he never met any of the retail customers, the government presented evidence that contradicted this assertion;  and, moreover, Figueroa testified that he informed the appellant that all his clients were coming from Maine to Massachusetts to buy heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa's involvement in the drug trade followed a hallowed family tradition.   His uncle, Roberto Figueroa, dealt drugs in Maine.   Blood may be thicker than water, but it is by no means thicker than self-interest.   When lawmen closed in on Roberto Figueroa's operation he threw his nephew to the wolves in hopes of mitigating his own punishment.   To help set the snare, Roberto ordered 130 bags of heroin from his compliant nephew and demanded delivery in Maine.   The appellant sold fifty bags of heroin to Figueroa and Soto supplied the remainder.   On January 15, 1992, Figueroa and Soto exchanged the drugs for cash at a designated rest area alongside the Maine Turnpike and were promptly arrested.   The authorities apprehended the appellant in Massachusetts and, without objection, removed him to Maine for trial.   He was convicted and sentenced in due course.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant--who is represented by fresh counsel on appeal--argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to justify a conviction.   Since the appellant did not preserve a sufficiency challenge by moving for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, our review is limited to the prevention of clear and gross injustice.   See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

See United States v. Olbres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196204\"><a href=\"/opinion/196204/united-states-v-olbres/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span> (1995);  Maraj, 947 F.2d at 522-23.   In a conspiracy case, as in virtually any other criminal case, the government can meet this burden by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by any combination thereof.   See United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 679 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v.

Under the statute of conviction, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, it was incumbent upon the government to establish that the appellant agreed with Figueroa (and, according to the indictment, possibly \"other persons\"), at least tacitly, to commit the substantive crime--heroin distribution, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C)--which constituted the object of their agreement, and that he thereafter participated in the conspiracy knowingly and voluntarily.   See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.   The record here satisfies those criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the appellant makes an impassioned plea that the evidence shows no more than a buyer-seller relationship between him and Figueroa.   We agree with the premise that underlies this plea:  a buyer-seller relationship, simpliciter, is an insufficient predicate for a finding that the buyer and the seller are guilty as coconspirators.   See, e.g., United States v. Mancari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523248\"><a href=\"/opinion/523248/united-states-v-bruno-mancari/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 105 (7th Cir.1989) (holding that the sale of drugs in small quantities is inadequate, without additional evidence, to support a finding of conspiracy to distribute drugs to others because the seller could reasonably believe that such purchases are intended for the buyer's personal use).   But the premise provides the appellant no safe harbor on the facts of this case.   While a scenario in which A sells to B (who resells to C, D, E, and F) may signify that A and B are related only as vendor and vendee, such a scenario may also signify a broader, more imbricated relationship.   See, e.g., United States v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1303 (1st Cir.1993).   Knowledge and intent are at the core of the issue.   Thus, the question in such a case is whether the evidence surrounding the transaction(s) is sufficient to allow a fairminded jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that A knew that B was reselling the drugs, and intended to facilitate the resales.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence here, taken in the light most congenial to the verdict, establishes that the relationship between Figueroa and Santiago contained enough elements of \"[c]ommon knowledge, interdependence, [and] shared purpose,\" id., to support a finding that they were coconspirators.   Figueroa testified that the appellant had actual knowledge of the follow-on sales to Maine residents.   Two of Figueroa's customers testified that on at least one occasion the appellant made a delivery of heroin to Figueroa's home and met some of his clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing testimony was amply corroborated by the circumstantial evidence.   The appellant sold Figueroa quantities of drugs (fifty bags per day) well beyond the outer limits of personal use amounts and packaged them in a manner suggestive of intended resale.   The regularity of the transactions, the quantities of heroin, the amounts of money involved, and the financial terms (especially the appellant's extension of credit to Figueroa), taken together, form a sturdy foundation for a finding that the appellant and Figueroa had at least a tacit agreement to distribute the heroin to third parties.   Since they acted upon that tacit agreement (or so the jury could have found), the appellant's conviction is sustainable by any measure.   Surely, it does not work an injustice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Venue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next asserts that he was tried in an improper venue because he never committed a crime in the District of Maine.   This assertion is baseless.   It is settled beyond peradventure that venue is a personal privilege which can be waived.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 18;  see also, 2 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 306 (2d ed. 1982).   Here, the appellant consented to his removal and to the holding of the proceedings in Maine.   He submitted to trial there without ever contesting venue.   He has, therefore, waived the right to raise a venue-based challenge to his conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See United States v. Cordero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398639\"><a href=\"/opinion/398639/united-states-v-josephine-cordero-etc-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 44-45 (1st Cir.1981);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) (mandating waiver of most defenses that could have been, but were not, raised prior to trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the argument fails on the merits.   The venue requirement is designed to prevent a criminal defendant from having to defend himself in a place that has no meaningful connection to the offense with which he is charged.   This court held in United States v. Uribe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532755\"><a href=\"/opinion/532755/united-states-v-nestor-uribe-united-states-of-america-v-leon-alberior/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989), that in a conspiracy case venue is proper in any district in which an act in furtherance of the charged conspiracy has taken place, even if a particular coconspirator was not himself physically present in that district.   See id. at 558.   The actuation of a drug distribution conspiracy culminates in the sale and delivery of the controlled substance.   Thus, any place in which the culmination occurs provides a lawful venue for the prosecution of the offense.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the conspirators distributed the heroin to Maine residents knowing that it would be introduced into Maine and consumed there for the most part.   Moreover, on at least one occasion the appellant's cohort, Figueroa, personally delivered heroin to a Maine locus in furtherance of the conspiracy (or so the jury could have found).   This single, overt act, taking place in Maine, is itself sufficient to sustain venue in the District of Maine.   See id. at 558-59;  Cordero, 668 F.2d at 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant claims a prejudicial variance between the indictment and the proof, and also claims that there was injurious spillover from certain evidence regarding a second conspiracy (of which he was not a member).   Because these exhortations are raised for the first time on appeal we review them only for plain error.   See United States v. Arcadipane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195748\"><a href=\"/opinion/195748/united-states-v-arcadipane/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1994).   A close look assures us that, under the jurisprudence of plain error, neither allegation requires reversal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by addressing the allegation that a variance existed between the indictment and the evidence.   The genesis of the claim is as follows.   Near the end of the trial, the attorneys presented a stipulation to the court.   The stipulation confirmed that the contraband seized from Figueroa in Maine at the time of the denouement comprised eighty-one bags \"of the paper type\" and fifty bags \"of the plastic type.\"   But the stipulation erroneously described the drugs as marijuana rather than heroin.   It seems likely that no one noticed the misnomer for the court accepted the stipulation without comment, and during closing arguments each side specifically identified the bags as containing heroin.   The appellant now claims that the obvious error in the stipulation is a variance sufficient to warrant vacation of the conviction.   We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key datum surrounding a claim of variance is whether the purported variance is sufficiently severe to affect the substantial rights of the accused.   See id. at 6-7.   Passing the point of whether a criminal defendant ever can predicate a claim of variance on the introduction of evidence to which he has stipulated, the claimed variance is more apparent than real.   The record discloses that the reference to \"marijuana\" was an isolated event.   The indictment, the opening statements, the trial testimony, the summations, and the district court's jury instructions all spoke exclusively and unambiguously of heroin--not marijuana.   Moreover, there is nothing in the trial transcript that suggests any basis for a claim that the appellant was either misled or surprised--and he has not broached any such theory in his appellate briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not necessarily a perfect one.   Viewed in the context of the whole record, the misstatement is at worst the type of minor defect that cannot plausibly be said to impact a defendant's substantial rights.   See, e.g., United States v. Fermin Castillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495010\"><a href=\"/opinion/495010/united-states-v-jose-cristobal-fermin-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span>, 1196-97 (1st Cir.1987) (reaching a similar conclusion when the indictment misstated the name of the bank that issued material documents and mischaracterized the purpose for which these documents were used).   Since the stipulated misstatement did not deprive the appellant of his due, plain error is plainly lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, the appellant raises an issue of spillover from one conspiracy to another.   We find this claim hard to follow.   In virtually all cases involving allegations of prejudicial spillover the trial involves more than one defendant or more than one count.   See, e.g., United States v. Wihbey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196557\"><a href=\"/opinion/196557/united-states-v-wihbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 774-75 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 248 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span> (1990).   Here, however, the appellant stood trial alone on a single charge--and the only evidence admitted at the trial was evidence deemed relevant to his guilt or innocence on that charge.   Thus, the claim of prejudicial spillover is a non sequitur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a vain effort to overcome this incongruity, the appellant suggests that his dealings with Figueroa were entirely distinct from Soto's dealing with Figueroa, and that the evidence anent the Soto-Figueroa dealings \"spilled over\" and prejudiced the jury against him.   This view misconceives both the law of conspiracy and the rules of evidence.   It is settled that members of a conspiracy need not all know each other, work side by side, or otherwise march in lockstep.   See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1191 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government's theory here, as limned in the indictment and bill of particulars, posited a single conspiracy with Figueroa as a linchpin.   The court permitted the jury to hear the evidence of Soto's involvement on that basis, for the most part without objection.   We discern no error in the district court's reception of the evidence.   See Fed.R.Evid. 401 (defining relevancy);  see also United States v. Nazzaro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532513\"><a href=\"/opinion/532513/united-states-v-richard-a-nazzaro/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span>, 1168 (1st Cir.1989) (applying abuse of discretion test to admission of evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <p>Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final claim is that the lower court improperly applied the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, to his case.   Because this supposed bevue involves the sentencing court's interpretation of a guideline, we afford plenary review.   See United States v.

The question before us is whether the appellant's predicate offenses crossed the two-prior-felony-convictions threshold established by &#167; 4B1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's criminal record as disclosed in the presentence investigation report included (1) a conviction for assault and battery against a police officer, (2) a conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a work boot), (3) multiple convictions on narcotics charges (including a charge of distributing heroin) stemming from a single arrest on March 20, 1990, and (4) another set of multiple convictions on narcotics-related charges (including possession of heroin with intent to distribute) stemming from a second arrest on April 9, 1990.   The two drug arrests occurred within a few weeks of each other and they were eventually consolidated for sentencing.   The appellant claims that this consolidation rendered the crimes we have listed under items (3) and (4) \"related cases\" and meant that they had to be treated as a single offense for purposes of &#167; 4B1.1.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2) &amp; comment.  (n. 3).   He also argues that because he received a sentence of under one year on each of the assault and battery convictions, neither of them constitutes a cognizable predicate offense.   Inasmuch as the appellant's second argument is clearly erroneous, we need not address the question of whether the two sets of narcotics charges constitute separate predicate offenses under the career offender guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1) defines a crime of violence in pertinent part as \"any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that ... has as an element the use ... of physical force against the person of another.\"   The appellant contends that neither of his prior convictions for assault and battery satisfy the requirement of being \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" since he received a six-month sentence on each occasion.   The guideline, however, does not speak in terms of a judicial judgment (the length of the sentence meted out), but, rather, in terms of a legislative judgment (the maximum punishment applicable to the offense).   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, comment.  (n. 3) (Nov. 1992) (explaining that a \" '[p]rior felony conviction' means a prior ... conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of ... the actual sentence imposed\");  see also United States v. Sanchez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 615 (1st Cir.1990) (reaching the same conclusion), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></span> (1991).   The offenses occurred in Massachusetts, and assault and battery was punishable in that commonwealth at the time by imprisonment of up to two-and-one-half years.   See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 265, &#167; 13A (1990).   Seen in this light, the appellant's convictions for assault and battery constitute predicate offenses within the purview of the career offender guideline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, the sentencing court did not err in treating the appellant as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   The other assignments of error are patently meritless and do not warrant discussion.   The record reflects, without serious question, that the appellant experienced a fair trial in a proper venue, and that he was lawfully convicted and sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Santiago (who wrapped individual doses of heroin in plastic) and Soto (who used paper bags) packaged their products differently.   Clients identified their preference for one brand over another by reference to the packaging</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant also claims that the evidence fails to show that he conspired to distribute the drugs in Maine.   We reject this claim for the reasons discussed in Part II(B), infra, and for the added reason that the indictment charges a drug distribution conspiracy that took place in \"Maine, Massachusetts, and elsewhere,\" unanchored to a single locale</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The appellant's attempt to blunt this waiver by citing the alleged ineffectiveness of his trial counsel is unavailing.   We have consistently held--and today reaffirm--that, absent exceptional circumstances (not now present), a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot debut on direct appeal.   See United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1839</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></span> (1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The appellant argues that the later conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon should be excluded because the \"weapon\" was a pair of work boots.   We do not see what possible difference flows from this distinction.   For one thing, we take a categorical approach to the examination of predicate offenses in order to determine whether they meet the requirements of the career offender guideline.   See, e.g., Winter, 22 F.3d at 18.   For another thing, assault and battery is no less a crime of violence because the assailant stomps his victim rather than assaulting him in some more traditional manner</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
