Like a shade tree, the automatic  stay which attends the\r\n\ninitiation of bankruptcy proceedings,  11 U.S.C.   362(a) (1994),\r\n\nmust be nurtured if it  is to retain its vitality.   This appeal,\r\n\nwhich pits a Chapter 13 debtor  bent on saving his home against a\r\n\ncreditor bent on  enforcing its rights  under a mortgage,  raises\r\n\nissues  which touch upon  the degree of  judicial protection that\r\n\nthe  automatic  stay  invites.   These  issues  are  whether  the\r\n\nautomatic  stay  precludes   a  state   court  from   undertaking\r\n\nministerial acts after a bankruptcy filing; if not, what acts are\r\n\nexempt under  that rubric; whether  a bankruptcy court  may grant\r\n\nretroactive relief from the automatic stay; and if so, what legal\r\n\nstandard it should apply in prescribing such an anodyne.\r\n\nI.  LAYING THE FOUNDATION\r          I.  LAYING THE FOUNDATION\r\n\n          We   begin  by  retracing  the  labyrinthine  corridors\r\n\nthrough  which this litigation has  passed.  In  1990 the debtor,\r\n\nNapoleon G. Soares, purchased  a home in Brockton, Massachusetts.\r\n\nHe executed  a $70,000  promissory  note to  the Brockton  Credit\r\n\nUnion (BCU)  and secured the note by a first mortgage on the real\r\n\nestate.   After  sustaining  injuries in  a motorcycle  accident,\r\n\nSoares  lagged in  his monthly  payments.   BCU grew  restive and\r\n\ncommenced foreclosure  proceedings in  the state  superior court.\r\n\nSoares did  not file an  answer.  On  March 22, 1995,  BCU sent a\r\n\nletter to  the clerk of court  seeking an order of  default and a\r\n\njudgment  authorizing foreclosure.  Two days later Soares filed a\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nbankruptcy  petition, thus  triggering  the automatic  stay.   He\r\n\nimmediately gave  notice to  BCU, but  neither party  alerted the\r\n\nstate court.  On April 10, with the stay still firmly in place, a\r\n\njudge of that court issued the requested default order.  One week\r\n\nlater, she authorized the entry of a foreclosure judgment.\r\n\n          Soares missed some post-petition mortgage payments.  On\r\n\nJune 14, 1995, BCU, without apprising the bankruptcy court of the\r\n\norders  previously obtained  in  the state  proceedings, filed  a\r\n\nmotion  seeking relief  from the  automatic stay.   The  debtor's\r\n\nthen-counsel,   Gerard  Williamson,  neglected  to  oppose  BCU's\r\n\nmotion.   The bankruptcy  court granted  the unopposed  motion on\r\n\nJune 29  (the same day, coincidentally,  that Soares, unbeknownst\r\n\nto  the  judge, paid  the  post-petition arrearage).    The court\r\n\nsubsequently refused  to entertain  a belated objection  filed by\r\n\nWilliamson.\r\n\n          When Soares missed his  November payment, BCU activated\r\n\nthe  state court judgment.  At the ensuing foreclosure sale, held\r\n\non November 29, BCU itself bid in the mortgaged premises and paid\r\n\napproximately  $14,200 in  overdue municipal  taxes to  clear the\r\n\ntitle.  Soares thereafter sought relief in the state court on the\r\n\nground  that   the  foreclosure  judgment  had   been  issued  in\r\n\ncontravention of  the  automatic  stay.   The  court  denied  the\r\n\nmotion,   saying  that   its  post-petition   actions  had   been\r\n\n\"ministerial\" and that any error was harmless.1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Although Soares  did not appeal  from this ruling,  BCU has\r\nnever  urged it  as  a  basis  for  res  judicata  or  collateral\r\nestoppel.  Hence, we deem any such asseveration waived.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          Soares'  unsuccessful  foray  apparently  rang  warning\r\n\nbells  for  BCU, which  asked  the  bankruptcy court  to  clarify\r\n\nwhether  the June 29 order (lifting  the automatic stay) ratified\r\n\nthe  earlier state  court judgment.   BCU  served  this so-called\r\n\nclarification  motion on  the  attorney, Williamson,  but not  on\r\n\nSoares.2   In a margin  order entered on February  9, 1996, Judge\r\n\nKenner addressed the question of retroactivity for the first time\r\n\nand vacated  the automatic  stay retroactive to  March 24,  1995,\r\n\n\"such that  the [state]  judgment and movant's  foreclosure shall\r\n\nnot be deemed to have violated the automatic stay.\"\r\n\n          Less  than  three  weeks  later  Soares, through  newly\r\n\nretained counsel, filed a motion to reconsider both  the February\r\n\n9 order and the original grant of relief from the automatic stay.\r\n\nJudge Kenner denied the reconsideration motion on the merits3 and\r\n\nalso denied a companion motion to void the foreclosure sale.  The\r\n\njudge advanced three reasons for having lifted the automatic stay\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The title  \"clarification motion\"  is a misnomer.   Neither\r\nthe June 29 order nor  the motion leading up to it  mentioned the\r\nstate court judgment, and the order clearly had not been meant to\r\nratify the judgment.\r\n\n     3The  judge was  wise to  reach the  merits.   The so-called\r\nclarification motion had been served in derogation of  a standing\r\norder promulgated  by the  bankruptcy judges in  the District  of\r\nMassachusetts, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n          (a) All motions and  requests for orders must\r\n          be  served  on the  Chapter  13 trustee,  the\r\n          debtor,  the  debtor's attorney,  persons who\r\n          have requested  notice, and all creditors . .\r\n          . .\r\n\nJoint  Procedural Order    13.5  (Sept. 1,  1994).   Despite this\r\norder, BCU had not served the motion on the debtor.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nretroactively  on February  9.    First,  because BCU  \"had  done\r\n\neverything  right,\"   it  would  be  inequitable   to  upset  its\r\n\nexpectations.   Second,  because  the foreclosure  had wiped  out\r\n\njunior lienholders,  it would  be too complicated  to \"unscramble\r\n\nthe  egg.\"  Third, because Soares could not immediately repay the\r\n\nfunds  that BCU had expended to  clear title to the property, the\r\n\neconomic realities favored ratification of the foreclosure.\r\n\n          Soares appealed.  The district court temporarily stayed\r\n\nfurther  proceedings  (blocking both  a  planned  eviction and  a\r\n\npossible  resale  of the  property).    Eventually, however,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court    although finding  that BCU  had neglected  its\r\n\nresponsibility  to   apprise  the  state   tribunal  of   Soares'\r\n\nbankruptcy  (an error  which it  termed \"harmless\")    determined\r\n\nthat  the  retroactive  lifting  of the  automatic  stay  did not\r\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.\r\n\n          Soares again appealed.  We enlarged the earlier stay on\r\n\ncondition  that Soares make monthly  payments to BCU  for use and\r\n\noccupancy of  the premises (to  be credited against  the mortgage\r\n\nindebtedness, should Soares prevail on appeal).\r\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\r          II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          To the extent that the threshold inquiries in this case\r\n\ninvolve   questions  of  statutory  interpretation,  we  exercise\r\n\nplenary review.4   See In re  Jarvis, 53 F.3d 416,  419 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4A different  standard of  review applies to  the bankruptcy\r\ncourt's  discretionary  decision  to  lift  the   automatic  stay\r\nretroactively.   See Part II(B)(4), infra.  We review that ruling\r                                                   \r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See Tringali v. Hathaway Mach. Co., 796\r                                                                      \r\nF.2d 553, 561 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n1995).   From this vantage  point we first  address the purported\r\n\nexemption  for \"ministerial  acts,\" as  it is  only necessary  to\r\n\nreach the retroactivity question if a violation of  the automatic\r\n\nstay in fact occurred.\r\n\n           A.  The Nature of the State Court's Actions.\r                     A.  The Nature of the State Court's Actions.\r                                                                \r\n\n          The  parties clash head-on in respect to classification\r\n\nof the state court's actions.   The debtor claims that  the state\r\n\ncourt  order and judgment  transgressed the automatic  stay.  The\r\n\ncreditor  claims  that  these  entries,  though  occurring  post-\r\n\npetition, were purely ministerial and, thus, not offensive to the\r\n\nstay.  The debtor has the better argument.\r\n\n          Section 362(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides  that\r\n\nthe filing  of a  bankruptcy petition  stays the commencement  or\r\n\ncontinuation  of all  nonbankruptcy judicial  proceedings against\r\n\nthe debtor.5  Here, the state court default order eventuated more\r\n\nthan  two  weeks  after  Soares  filed  for  bankruptcy  and  the\r                                 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Leaving to one side exceptions inapplicable to this appeal,\r\nthe statute provides that a filed bankruptcy petition\r\n\n          operates  as  a   stay,  applicable  to   all\r\n          entities, of  \r\n               (1)     the     commencement     or\r\n               continuation,     including     the\r\n               issuance or  employment of process,\r\n               of  a judicial,  administrative, or\r\n               other action  or proceeding against\r\n               the debtor  that was or  could have\r\n               been    commenced     before    the\r\n               commencement of the case under this\r\n               title,  or  to   recover  a   claim\r\n               against   the  debtor   that  arose\r\n               before the commencement of the case\r\n               under this title; . . . .\r\n\n11 U.S.C.   362(a)(1).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nforeclosure judgment one week later.  The issue, then, is whether\r\n\nthese entries contravened the mandate  of section 362(a)(1).  BCU\r\n\nasserts that they did not because the stay was not in effect when\r\n\nthe creditor requested  the state  court to act  and because  the\r\n\nstate court's actions, when taken, constituted ministerial acts.\r\n\n          The  creditor's first  assertion  is mere  buzznacking.\r\n\nThe focus  here is whether or not the state court's actions, when\r\n\neffected, transgressed the automatic stay.  The date on which the\r\n\ncreditor  asked  the state  court to  act,  while material  to an\r\n\nassessment of  the creditor's good faith (which  is not seriously\r\n\nquestioned  here),  does  not  bear  on  whether  the  activities\r\n\nthemselves constituted  the forbidden continuation  of a judicial\r\n\nproceeding.\r\n\n          BCU's   second   assertion    is   more    substantial.\r\n\nMinisterial  acts,  even  if   undertaken  in  a  state  judicial\r\n\nproceeding subsequent to a bankruptcy filing,  do not fall within\r\n\nthe  proscription of the  automatic stay.   See Rexnord Holdings,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc. v.

But the  state\r                  \r\n\ncourt's actions in this case cannot properly be  characterized as\r\n\nministerial.\r\n\n          A ministerial  act is one that  is essentially clerical\r\n\nin nature.  See Black's Law Dictionary 996 (6th ed. 1990).

Such acts can usefully be visualized as the antithesis\r\n\nof judicial acts,  inasmuch as the essence  of a judicial  act is\r\n\nthe  exercise  of  discretion  or  judgment.    See  Black's  Law\r                                                                           \r\n\nDictionary, supra, at 846.\r                           \r\n\n          Virtually by definition, a judicial proceeding does not\r\n\nconclude until the judicial function is completed, that is, until\r\n\nthe  judicial decision is made.  See, e.g., Bidermann, 21 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n528  (holding  that the  judicial function  is completed  \"at the\r\n\nmoment  the judge  direct[s]  entry of  judgment\").

E.D.N.Y. 1994) (stating that \"entry of a judgment will\r\n\nconstitute a  `ministerial act'  where the judicial  function has\r\n\nbeen  completed  and the  clerk has  merely  to perform  the rote\r\n\nfunction  of entering the judgment upon the court's docket\").  By\r\n\nthe  same token,  however,  acts  undertaken  in  the  course  of\r\n\ncarrying out the core judicial function  are not ministerial and,\r\n\nif essayed after bankruptcy filing, will be deemed to violate the\r\n\nautomatic stay.\r\n\n          Bidermann   captures  this  distinction.    There,  the\r                             \r\n\ndistrict judge ruled  ora sponte and endorsed  the motion papers.\r                                          \r\n\nThe  defendant then  sought  refuge in  bankruptcy.   The  Second\r\n\nCircuit held  the clerk's subsequent, post-petition  entry of the\r\n\njudgment  on  the  docket  to  be  ministerial  (and,  therefore,\r\n\nunaffected by the automatic stay).   21 F.3d at 528.  Other cases\r\n\nare  to the same effect.  See  Heikkila v. Carver (In re Carver),\r                                                                         \r\n\n828  F.2d 463,  464  (8th Cir.  1987)  (holding that  a  \"routine\r\n\ncertification\"  by  the  clerk,  entered  post-petition, did  not\r\n\ntransgress the automatic stay); Capgro Leasing, 169 B.R. at  315-\r                                                        \r\n\n16 (holding the  clerk's entry of  judgment on the  docket to  be\r\n\nministerial  when, prior to the bankruptcy  filing, the court had\r\n\nordered  summary judgment).  A  parallel line of cases reinforces\r\n\nthe notion that the compendium of ministerial acts excludes those\r\n\ninvolving  deliberation,  discretion,  or  judicial  involvement.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Ellis  v. Consolidated  Diesel Elec.  Corp., 894  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n371, 372-73  (10th Cir.  1990) (invalidating a  judicial decision\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthat  granted  summary  judgment  two weeks  after  a  bankruptcy\r\n\nfiling);  Knightsbridge  Dev.,  884   F.2d  at  148  (voiding  an\r                                       \r\n\narbitration award  because the bulk of  the panel's deliberations\r\n\noccurred  after the stay arose);  Ellison v.

See ICC v. Holmes Transp.,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 931 F.2d 984, 987 (1st Cir. 1991).  Confining the exemption\r              \r\n\nfor  ministerial  acts to  those  actions  which are  essentially\r\n\nclerical, as  opposed to judicial, honors  this principle because\r\n\nsuch  an  interpretation  comports  precisely with  the  text  of\r\n\nsection  362(a)(1).   In  the bargain,  this interpretation  also\r\n\nfacilitates the statute's due administration.\r\n\n          Silhouetted against this legal landscape, it is readily\r\n\napparent that the state court's actions in ordering a default and\r\n\ndirecting the entry of a judgment possess a distinctly  judicial,\r\n\nrather  than a  ministerial, character.   The  record is  totally\r\n\nbarren  of any  evidence that  the state  court judge  decided to\r\n\ngrant BCU's request prior  to the date of the  bankruptcy filing,\r\n\nand all visible signs point in the opposite direction.  The judge\r\n\ndid  not enter the default order until  more than two weeks after\r\n\nSoares  sought the protection of the bankruptcy court and she did\r\n\nnot  direct the entry of a judgment authorizing foreclosure until\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nanother week had  elapsed.  Moreover,  the judge indicated  after\r\n\nthe fact  that she waited  to confirm Soares'  nonmilitary status\r\n\nbefore  directing   the  entry  of  judgment.     This  indicates\r\n\ndeliberativeness   and  a  concomitant  willingness  to  exercise\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n          Nor does  the fact  that the judge  later characterized\r\n\nher entry of the foreclosure judgment  as \"ministerial\" require a\r\n\ndifferent result.   An appellate  court is  not bound by  a trial\r\n\njudge's unsupported  description, see,  e.g., Estate of  Soler v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRodriguez, 63  F.3d 45,  47 n.1  (1st Cir.  1995);  In re  G.S.F.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp., 938 F.2d 1467,  1473-74 (1st Cir. 1991), and we  are aware\r               \r\n\nof no reason  why that  salutary principle would  not apply  with\r\n\nequal vigor to our assessment of a state court's actions when the\r\n\nunderlying question relates to the effect of  those actions under\r                                                                           \r\n\nfederal law.  Hence, we decline to adopt the label that the state\r                     \r\n\ncourt judge chose in hindsight to affix to her activities.\r\n\n          We summarize succinctly.   Because  the decision  which\r\n\nanimated the entry of  the order and judgment occurred  after the\r\n\nstay  was in  force, those actions  continued the  state judicial\r\n\nproceeding    within   the   meaning    of   section   362(a)(1).\r\n\nConsequently,  the actions  violated the  automatic stay.   Given\r\n\nthis  infraction,  we now  must  assess  the  availability  of  a\r\n\nretroactive cure.\r\n\n             B.  The Operation of the Automatic Stay.\r                       B.

This  semantic\r                                   \r\n\ndifference    has    practical    consequences     because    the\r\n\ncharacterization of an infringing  action as \"void\" or \"voidable\"\r\n\ninfluences the burden of going forward.  Treating an action taken\r\n\nin  contravention of the automatic stay as void places the burden\r\n\nof validating the action after the fact squarely on the shoulders\r\n\nof the offending creditor.  In contrast, treating an action taken\r\n\nin contravention  of the  automatic stay as  voidable places  the\r\n\nburden  of challenging  the action  on the  offended debtor.   We\r\n\nthink that  the former  paradigm,  rather than  the latter,  best\r\n\nharmonizes  with  the  nature  of  the  automatic  stay  and  the\r\n\nimportant  purposes that it serves.

Indeed,  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  11  U.S.C.     362(d),\r\n\nexpressly authorizes courts to  lift it in particular situations.\r\n\nWhether  this  statutory  authorization  encompasses  retroactive\r\n\nrelief is not entirely clear.

The only  plausible distinction between the two  verbs in\r\n\nthis   context   is  that   terminating   the   stay  blunts   it\r\n\nprospectively, from the moment  the court's order enters, whereas\r\n\nannulling the  stay erases it  retrospectively, as  of some  date\r\n\nprior to the entry of the court's order (reaching as  far back as\r\n\nthe  date when the debtor  filed the bankruptcy  petition, if the\r\n\ncourt so elects).\r\n\n          Seen from this perspective,  Congress' grant of a power\r\n\nof annulment is meaningful only if the court may thereby validate\r\n\nactions taken before  the date on which the court  rules.  On any\r                              \r\n\nother construction, annulment lacks any independent significance;\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The statute provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n          On request  of a party in  interest and after\r\n          notice and  a hearing, the court  shall grant\r\n          relief  from  the stay  .  .  ., such  as  by\r\n          terminating,    annulling,   modifying,    or\r\n          conditioning such stay  \r\n               (1) for cause,  including the  lack\r\n               of   adequate   protection  of   an\r\n               interest in property of  such party\r\n               in interest; . . . .\r\n\n11 U.S.C.   362(d).\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nit merely  replicates termination.

We turn next\r\n\nto this inquiry.\r\n\n          Once again,  the overarching  purpose of  the automatic\r\n\nstay informs our  analysis.   Because the stay  is a  fundamental\r\n\nprotection for all parties  affected by the filing of  a petition\r\n\nin bankruptcy,  it should not be dismantled  without good reason.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Little  Creek Dev. Co. v.  Commonwealth Mortgage Corp.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(In  re Little  Creek Dev.

Congress intended the stay to afford\r\n\ndebtors  breathing  room and  to  assure  creditors of  equitable\r\n\ndistribution.   See  H.R. Rep.  No. 95-595,  supra, at  340, 1978\r                                                            \r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N.  at   6296-97.    If   retroactive  relief   becomes\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\ncommonplace,  creditors    anticipating post  facto validation   \r                                                             \r\n\nwill be  tempted to pursue  claims against bankrupts  heedless of\r\n\nthe stay, leaving debtors with  no choice but to defend for  fear\r\n\nthat   post-petition   default   judgments   routinely   may   be\r\n\nresuscitated.\r\n\n          We believe that Congress  created the automatic stay to\r\n\nward off scenarios of  this sort.  Thus, if  congressional intent\r\n\nis  to be  honored  and  the  integrity  of  the  automatic  stay\r\n\npreserved, retroactive relief should  be the long-odds exception,\r\n\nnot  the general rule.  In our  view, only a strict standard will\r\n\nensure  the  accomplishment  of  these objectives.    See  Albany\r                                                                           \r\n\nPartners,  749  F.2d  at  675  (explaining  that  \"the  important\r                  \r\n\ncongressional policy  behind  the  automatic  stay  demands  that\r\n\ncourts be  especially hesitant to validate  acts committed during\r\n\nthe  pendency of  the  stay\").    We  conclude,  therefore,  that\r\n\nalthough courts possess a limited discretion to grant retroactive\r\n\nrelief from the  automatic stay, instances in which  the exercise\r\n\nof that  discretion is  justified are  likely to be  few and  far\r\n\nbetween.\r\n\n          We do not  suggest that  we can write  a standard  that\r\n\nlends itself to mechanical application.  Each case is sui generis\r\n\nand must be judged  accordingly.  But, while it is  not practical\r\n\nto  anticipate and  catalogue the  varied circumstances  in which\r\n\nretroactive relief from the automatic stay may be warranted, some\r\n\nexamples may be helpful.\r\n\n          When  a creditor  inadvertently violates  the automatic\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nstay in ignorance of a pending bankruptcy, courts sometimes  have\r\n\nafforded retroactive relief.  See, e.g., Jones, 63 F.3d at 412-13\r                                                        \r\n\n(affirming retroactive validation of a foreclosure sale where the\r\n\nmortgagee had no notice of the bankruptcy filing); Mutual Benefit\r                                                                           \r\n\nLife Ins.

By like token, debtors who act\r\n\nin  bad faith may create situations that are ripe for retroactive\r\n\nrelief.   See, e.g., Calder, 907 F.2d at 956; Easley, 990 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n911; Albany Partners, 749 F.2d at 675-76.\r                              \r\n\n          These  examples    a  creditor's  lack of  notice  or a\r\n\ndebtor's bad  faith   clearly  do not exhaust  the possibilities.\r\n\nBut  they   illustrate  that  a  rarely   dispensed  remedy  like\r\n\nretroactive relief from the  automatic stay must rest on a set of\r\n\nfacts  that is both unusual  and unusually compelling.   The case\r\n\nlaw  echoes  this conclusion.   See  Mataya  v. Kissinger  (In re\r                                                                           \r\n\nKissinger), 72 F.3d 107, 109 (9th Cir. 1995) (stating that courts\r                   \r\n\nshould   indulge   retroactive   annulment   only    in   extreme\r\n\ncircumstances); In re Pulley, 196 B.R. 502, 504 (Bankr.

Applying  the  Standard.\r                                                \r\n\nlimiting principle, we now  consider whether the bankruptcy court\r\n\nerred  in  validating the  foreclosure  judgment  which had  been\r\n\nobtained in violation of the automatic stay.  We conclude that no\r\n\nproper  predicate existed  for doing  so and that  the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt therefore  abused  its discretion  in ordering  retroactive\r\n\nrelief.   See Anderson v.  Beatrice Foods Co.,  900 F.2d 388, 394\r                                                       \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\n(1st Cir.)

Bankruptcy law  forbids creditors  from\r\n\ncontinuing  judicial proceedings against bankrupts, see 11 U.S.C.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  362(a)(1), and, accordingly, it is the creditor's obligation to\r\n\ninform other courts  of the situation, see In re  Timbs, 178 B.R.\r                                                                 \r\n\n989, 991 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 1989) (collecting cases).  Here, both\r\n\nBCU's knowledge and its failure to act are undisputed; the debtor\r\n\nimmediately notified BCU  of the bankruptcy filing,  but BCU kept\r\n\nquiet and permitted the superior court to proceed in ignorance of\r\n\nthe  stay.   We are  reluctant to  reward creditors  who, despite\r\n\nnotice  of a bankruptcy filing, fail for no discernible reason to\r\n\nnotify  courts in  which they  have initiated proceedings  of the\r\n\nchanged circumstances.\r\n\n          The other facts  are no more conducive to  the bestowal\r\n\nof retroactive relief.   The creditor was  represented by counsel\r\n\nthroughout and  does not claim that it  misapprehended the effect\r\n\nof the filing.  The bankruptcy court made no finding  that Soares\r\n\nacted in bad faith, and, at any rate, the record does not contain\r\n\nany basis for such a finding.  The procedural errors committed by\r\n\nboth parties, such as BCU's failure to serve Soares with the  so-\r\n\ncalled clarification  motion and Soares' failure  to lodge timely\r\n\nobjections at various points in the proceedings, seemingly cancel\r\n\neach  other  out.   And BCU's  entreaty  that the  equities favor\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nretroactive relief rings unmistakably hollow; though BCU expended\r\n\nfunds to clear title and maintain the property after foreclosing,\r\n\nthis financial  hardship is the  natural consequence  of its  own\r\n\nfailure to abide by the terms of the automatic stay.  Thus, it is\r\n\nunredressable.   See K-Mart  Corp. v.  Oriental Plaza,  Inc., 875\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  907,  916  (1st Cir.  1989)  (declining  to  deny permanent\r\n\ninjunctive relief which would  require substantial demolition  of\r\n\nan  expensive  structure where  \"appellant's  wound,  deep as  it\r\n\nappears,  was self-inflicted\").  In the last analysis, BCU is the\r\n\nauthor of its own misfortune.\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          To sum up, we hold that the state court's post-petition\r\n\nissuance of  a foreclosure judgment violated  the automatic stay;\r\n\nthat bankruptcy courts ordinarily must hold those  who defile the\r\n\nautomatic stay  to the predictable consequences  of their actions\r\n\nand can grant retroactive relief only sparingly and in compelling\r\n\ncircumstances;   and   that,  because   this  case   involves  no\r\n\nsufficiently unusual  circumstances, the bankruptcy  court abused\r\n\nits discretion in granting  retroactive relief from the automatic\r\n\nstay.7\r\n\n          In  an abundance of caution, we note that our review is\r\n\nconfined to the order granting the so-called clarification motion\r\n\nand the retroactive relief awarded therein.   Although Soares may\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7We recognize  the difficulties  that attend the  undoing of\r\nthe  foreclosure sale  and  the restoration  of the  pre-petition\r\nstatus  quo, but  that problem  cannot in  and of  itself justify\r\noverlooking BCU's unexcused violation of the automatic stay.

Eliot, The Waste Land, I, The Burial of the Dead (1922).  Like a shade tree, the automatic stay which attends the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a) (1994), must be nurtured if it is to retain its vitality.  This appeal, which pits a Chapter 13 debtor bent on saving his home against a creditor bent on enforcing its rights under a mortgage, raises issues which touch upon the degree of judicial protection that the automatic stay invites.  These issues are whether the automatic stay precludes a state court from undertaking ministerial acts after a bankruptcy filing;  if not, what acts are exempt under that rubric;  whether a bankruptcy court may grant retroactive relief from the automatic stay;  and if so, what legal standard it should apply in prescribing such an anodyne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. LAYING THE FOUNDATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by retracing the labyrinthine corridors through which this litigation has passed.  In 1990 the debtor, Napoleon G. Soares, purchased a home in Brockton, Massachusetts.  He executed a $70,000 promissory note to the Brockton Credit Union (BCU) and secured the note by a first mortgage on the real estate.  After sustaining injuries in a motorcycle accident, Soares lagged in his monthly payments.  BCU grew restive and commenced foreclosure proceedings in the state superior court.  Soares did not file an answer.  On March 22, 1995, BCU sent a letter to the clerk of court seeking an order of default and a judgment authorizing foreclosure.  Two days later Soares filed a bankruptcy petition, thus triggering the automatic stay.  He immediately gave notice to BCU, but neither party alerted the state court.  On April 10, with the stay still firmly in place, a judge of that court issued the requested default order.  One week later, she authorized the entry of a foreclosure judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares missed some post-petition mortgage payments.  On June 14, 1995, BCU, without apprising the bankruptcy court of the orders previously obtained in the state proceedings, filed a motion seeking relief from the automatic stay.  The debtor's then-counsel, Gerard Williamson, neglected to oppose BCU's motion.  The bankruptcy court granted the unopposed motion on June 29 (the same day, coincidentally, that Soares, unbeknownst to the judge, paid the post-petition arrearage).  The court subsequently refused to entertain a belated objection filed by Williamson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Soares missed his November payment, BCU activated the state court judgment.  At the ensuing foreclosure sale, held on November 29, BCU itself bid in the mortgaged premises and paid approximately $14,200 in overdue municipal taxes to clear the title.  Soares thereafter sought relief in the state court on the ground that the foreclosure judgment had been issued in contravention of the automatic stay.  The court denied the motion, saying that its post-petition actions had been \"ministerial\" and that any error was harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares' unsuccessful foray apparently rang warning bells for BCU, which asked the bankruptcy court to clarify whether the June 29 order (lifting the automatic stay) ratified the earlier state court judgment.  BCU served this so-called clarification motion on the attorney, Williamson, but not on Soares.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In a margin order entered on February 9, 1996, Judge Kenner addressed the question of retroactivity for the first time and vacated the automatic stay retroactive to March 24, 1995, \"such that the [state] judgment and movant's foreclosure shall not be deemed to have violated the automatic stay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than three weeks later Soares, through newly retained counsel, filed a motion to reconsider both the February 9 order and the original grant of relief from the automatic stay.  Judge Kenner denied the reconsideration motion on the merits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and also denied a companion motion to void the foreclosure sale.  The judge advanced three reasons for having lifted the automatic stay retroactively on February 9.  First, because BCU \"had done everything right,\" it would be inequitable to upset its expectations.  Second, because the foreclosure had wiped out junior lienholders, it would be too complicated to \"unscramble the egg.\"   Third, because Soares could not immediately repay the funds that BCU had expended to clear title to the property, the economic realities favored ratification of the foreclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares appealed.  The district court temporarily stayed further proceedings (blocking both a planned eviction and a possible resale of the property).  Eventually, however, the district court--although finding that BCU had neglected its responsibility to apprise the state tribunal of Soares' bankruptcy (an error which it termed \"harmless\")--determined that the retroactive lifting of the automatic stay did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares again appealed.  We enlarged the earlier stay on condition that Soares make monthly payments to BCU for use and occupancy of the premises (to be credited against the mortgage indebtedness, should Soares prevail on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the threshold inquiries in this case involve questions of statutory interpretation, we exercise plenary review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See In re Jarvis, 53 F.3d 416, 419 (1st Cir.1995).  From this vantage point we first address the purported exemption for \"ministerial acts,\" as it is only necessary to reach the retroactivity question if a violation of the automatic stay in fact occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>A. The Nature of the State Court's Actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties clash head-on in respect to classification of the state court's actions.  The debtor claims that the state court order and judgment transgressed the automatic stay.  The creditor claims that these entries, though occurring post-petition, were purely ministerial and, thus, not offensive to the stay.  The debtor has the better argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 362(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition stays the commencement or continuation of all nonbankruptcy judicial proceedings against the debtor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Here, the state court default order eventuated more than two weeks after Soares filed for bankruptcy and the foreclosure judgment one week later.  The issue, then, is whether these entries contravened the mandate of section 362(a)(1).  BCU asserts that they did not because the stay was not in effect when the creditor requested the state court to act and because the state court's actions, when taken, constituted ministerial acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The creditor's first assertion is mere buzznacking.  The focus here is whether or not the state court's actions, when effected, transgressed the automatic stay.  The date on which the creditor asked the state court to act, while material to an assessment of the creditor's good faith (which is not seriously questioned here), does not bear on whether the activities themselves constituted the forbidden continuation of a judicial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BCU's second assertion is more substantial.  Ministerial acts, even if undertaken in a state judicial proceeding subsequent to a bankruptcy filing, do not fall within the proscription of the automatic stay.  See Rexnord Holdings, Inc. v. Bidermann, 21 F.3d 522, 527 (2d Cir.1994);   Savers Fed.  Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. McCarthy Constr.  Co. (In re Knightsbridge Dev.  Co.), 884 F.2d 145, 148 (4th Cir.1989).  But the state court's actions in this case cannot properly be characterized as ministerial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A ministerial act is one that is essentially clerical in nature.  See Black's Law Dictionary 996 (6th ed. 1990).  Thus, when an official's duty is delineated by, say, a law or a judicial decree with such crystalline clarity that nothing is left to the exercise of the official's discretion or judgment, the resultant act is ministerial.  See United States ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur, 283 U.S. 414, 420, 51 S.Ct. 502, 504, 75 L.Ed. 1148 (1931) (indicating that a duty is ministerial if \"the obligation to act [is] peremptory, and plainly defined\");  Neal v. Regan, 587 F.Supp. 1558, 1562 (N.D.Ind.1984) (describing a ministerial act as \"one which 'the law prescribes and defines ... with such precision as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment' \") (citation omitted).  Such acts can usefully be visualized as the antithesis of judicial acts, inasmuch as the essence of a judicial act is the exercise of discretion or judgment.  See Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually by definition, a judicial proceeding does not conclude until the judicial function is completed, that is, until the judicial decision is made.  See, e.g., Bidermann, 21 F.3d at 528 (holding that the judicial function is completed \"at the moment the judge direct[s] entry of judgment\").  Frequently, routine scrivening, such as recordation or entry on the docket, follows on the heels of a judicial decision.  Such actions--taken in obedience to the judge's peremptory instructions or otherwise precisely defined and nondiscretionary--are ministerial and, consequently, do not themselves violate the automatic stay even if undertaken after an affected party files for bankruptcy.  See, e.g., Knightsbridge Dev., 884 F.2d at 148 (suggesting that merely recording a previously decided award would be a \"clerical act\" and therefore would not infract the automatic stay);  In re Capgro Leasing Assocs., 169 B.R. 305, 315-16 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1994) (stating that \"entry of a judgment will constitute a 'ministerial act' where the judicial function has been completed and the clerk has merely to perform the rote function of entering the judgment upon the court's docket\").  By the same token, however, acts undertaken in the course of carrying out the core judicial function are not ministerial and, if essayed after bankruptcy filing, will be deemed to violate the automatic stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bidermann captures this distinction.  There, the district judge ruled ora sponte and endorsed the motion papers.  The defendant then sought refuge in bankruptcy.  The Second Circuit held the clerk's subsequent, post-petition entry of the judgment on the docket to be ministerial (and, therefore, unaffected by the automatic stay).  21 F.3d at 528.   Other cases are to the same effect.  See Heikkila v. Carver (In re Carver ), 828 F.2d 463, 464 (8th Cir.1987) (holding that a \"routine certification\" by the clerk, entered post-petition, did not transgress the automatic stay);  Capgro Leasing, 169 B.R. at 315-16 (holding the clerk's entry of judgment on the docket to be ministerial when, prior to the bankruptcy filing, the court had ordered summary judgment).  A parallel line of cases reinforces the notion that the compendium of ministerial acts excludes those involving deliberation, discretion, or judicial involvement.  See, e.g., Ellis v. Consolidated Diesel Elec. Corp., 894 F.2d 371, 372-73 (10th Cir.1990) (invalidating a judicial decision that granted summary judgment two weeks after a bankruptcy filing);  Knightsbridge Dev., 884 F.2d at 148 (voiding an arbitration award because the bulk of the panel's deliberations occurred after the stay arose);  Ellison v. Northwest Eng'g Co., 707 F.2d 1310, 1311 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that while the automatic stay was in effect a court could not render a decision in a case which had been briefed and argued pre-petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of demarcation makes perfectly good sense.  The statutory proviso which gives rise to the automatic stay says what it means and means what it says.  See ICC v. Holmes Transp., Inc., 931 F.2d 984, 987 (1st Cir.1991).  Confining the exemption for ministerial acts to those actions which are essentially clerical, as opposed to judicial, honors this principle because such an interpretation comports precisely with the text of section 362(a)(1).  In the bargain, this interpretation also facilitates the statute's due administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silhouetted against this legal landscape, it is readily apparent that the state court's actions in ordering a default and directing the entry of a judgment possess a distinctly judicial, rather than a ministerial, character.  The record is totally barren of any evidence that the state court judge decided to grant BCU's request prior to the date of the bankruptcy filing, and all visible signs point in the opposite direction.  The judge did not enter the default order until more than two weeks after Soares sought the protection of the bankruptcy court and she did not direct the entry of a judgment authorizing foreclosure until another week had elapsed.  Moreover, the judge indicated after the fact that she waited to confirm Soares' nonmilitary status before directing the entry of judgment.  This indicates deliberativeness and a concomitant willingness to exercise discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the fact that the judge later characterized her entry of the foreclosure judgment as \"ministerial\" require a different result.  An appellate court is not bound by a trial judge's unsupported description, see, e.g., Estate of Soler v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 45, 47 n. 1 (1st Cir.1995);  In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d 1467, 1473-74 (1st Cir.1991), and we are aware of no reason why that salutary principle would not apply with equal vigor to our assessment of a state court's actions when the underlying question relates to the effect of those actions under federal law.   Hence, we decline to adopt the label that the state court judge chose in hindsight to affix to her activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly.  Because the decision which animated the entry of the order and judgment occurred after the stay was in force, those actions continued the state judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 362(a)(1).  Consequently, the actions violated the automatic stay.  Given this infraction, we now must assess the availability of a retroactive cure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>B. The Operation of the Automatic Stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We subdivide this part of our discussion into four segments.  In each segment, our comments reflect our awareness that bankruptcy courts traditionally pay heed to equitable principles.  See Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99, 103, 87 S.Ct. 274, 277, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966);  Jarvis, 53 F.3d at 419.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Nature of the Stay.   The automatic stay is among the most basic of debtor protections under bankruptcy law.  See Midlantic Nat'l Bank v. New Jersey Dep't of Envtl.  Protection, 474 U.S. 494, 503, 106 S.Ct. 755, 760, 88 L.Ed.2d 859 (1986);  see also S.Rep. No. 95-989, at 54 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5840.   It is intended to give the debtor breathing room by \"stop[ping] all collection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure actions.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, at 340 (1977), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6296-97;  see also Holmes Transp., 931 F.2d at 987;  In re Smith Corset Shops, Inc., 696 F.2d 971, 977 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stay springs into being immediately upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition:  \"[b]ecause the automatic stay is exactly what the name implies--'automatic'--it operates without the necessity for judicial intervention.\"  Sunshine Dev., Inc. v. FDIC, 33 F.3d 106, 113 (1st Cir.1994).  It remains in force until a federal court either disposes of the case, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(c)(2), or lifts the stay, see id. &#167; 362(d)-(f).  This respite enables debtors to resolve their debts in a more orderly fashion, see In re Siciliano, 13 F.3d 748, 750 (3d Cir.1994), and at the same time safeguards their creditors by preventing \"different creditors from bringing different proceedings in different courts, thereby setting in motion a free-for-all in which opposing interests maneuver to capture the lion's share of the debtor's assets.\"  Sunshine Dev., 33 F.3d at 114;  see generally 3 Collier on Bankruptcy p 362.03 (15th rev. ed. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to secure these important protections, courts must display a certain rigor in reacting to violations of the automatic stay.  See Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S. 433, 438-39, 60 S.Ct. 343, 345-46, 84 L.Ed. 370 (1940);  Holmes Transp., 931 F.2d at 987-88;  Smith Corset Shops, 696 F.2d at 976.   The circuits are split on whether actions taken in derogation of the automatic stay are merely \"voidable\" or, more accurately, \"void.\"   Some courts characterize unauthorized postpetition proceedings as \"voidable.\"   See, e.g., Jones v. Garcia (In re Jones ), 63 F.3d 411, 412 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1566, 134 L.Ed.2d 666 (1996);  Bronson v. United States, 46 F.3d 1573, 1578-79 (Fed.Cir.1995);  Easley v. Pettibone Mich.  Corp., 990 F.2d 905, 911 (6th Cir.1993).  Other courts--a majority, insofar as we can tell--call such actions \"void,\" but recognize that equitable considerations may alter some outcomes.  See, e.g., Siciliano, 13 F.3d at 751;  In re Schwartz, 954 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir.1992);   Job v. Calder (In re Calder ), 907 F.2d 953, 956 (10th Cir.1990) (per curiam);  48th St. Steakhouse, Inc. v. Rockefeller Group, Inc.  (In re 48th St. Steakhouse, Inc.), 835 F.2d 427, 431 (2d Cir.1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1035, 108 S.Ct. 1596, 99 L.Ed.2d 910 (1988);  Albany Partners Ltd. v. Westbrook (In re Albany Partners, Ltd.), 749 F.2d 670, 675 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our earlier opinions--which we today reaffirm--align us with the majority view.  See Holmes Transp., 931 F.2d at 987-88;  Smith Corset Shops, 696 F.2d at 976.   This semantic difference has practical consequences because the characterization of an infringing action as \"void\" or \"voidable\" influences the burden of going forward.  Treating an action taken in contravention of the automatic stay as void places the burden of validating the action after the fact squarely on the shoulders of the offending creditor.  In contrast, treating an action taken in contravention of the automatic stay as voidable places the burden of challenging the action on the offended debtor.  We think that the former paradigm, rather than the latter, best harmonizes with the nature of the automatic stay and the important purposes that it serves.  See generally 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, p 362.11 &amp; n. 1 (observing that most courts hold violations void and terming this the better view).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Availability of Retroactive Relief.   While the automatic stay is significant, it is not an immutable article of faith.  Indeed, the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(d), expressly authorizes courts to lift it in particular situations.  Whether this statutory authorization encompasses retroactive relief is not entirely clear.  We previously hinted that a court may set aside the automatic stay retroactively in an appropriate case.  See Smith Corset Shops, 696 F.2d at 976-77.   We now confirm Smith 's adumbration, holding that 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(d) permits bankruptcy courts to lift the automatic stay retroactively and thereby validate actions which otherwise would be void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 362(d) confers upon courts discretionary power in certain circumstances to terminate, annul, modify, or place conditions upon the automatic stay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In drafting the law, Congress chose to include both the power to terminate the stay and the power to annul it.  When construing this language, we must try to give independent meaning to each word.  See United States Dep't of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, 504 n. 6, 113 S.Ct. 2202, 2210 n. 6, 124 L.Ed.2d 449 (1993);  United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985).  The only plausible distinction between the two verbs in this context is that terminating the stay blunts it prospectively, from the moment the court's order enters, whereas annulling the stay erases it retrospectively, as of some date prior to the entry of the court's order (reaching as far back as the date when the debtor filed the bankruptcy petition, if the court so elects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seen from this perspective, Congress' grant of a power of annulment is meaningful only if the court may thereby validate actions taken before the date on which the court rules.  On any other construction, annulment lacks any independent significance;  it merely replicates termination.  It follows, therefore, that section 362(d) authorizes retroactive relief from the automatic stay.  Accord Siciliano, 13 F.3d at 751;  Albany Partners, 749 F.2d at 675;  see also Franklin Sav. Ass'n v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 31 F.3d 1020, 1023 (10th Cir.1994) (recognizing the authority to annul the stay and thereby grant retroactive relief);  Sikes v. Global Marine, Inc., 881 F.2d 176, 178-79 (5th Cir.1989) (same);  see generally 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, p 362.11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The Limiting Principle.   Recognizing the discretionary authority of bankruptcy courts to relieve creditors and other interested parties retroactively from the operation of the automatic stay tells us nothing about the yardstick by which attempts to secure such relief should be measured.  We turn next to this inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, the overarching purpose of the automatic stay informs our analysis.  Because the stay is a fundamental protection for all parties affected by the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, it should not be dismantled without good reason.  See, e.g., Little Creek Dev.  Co. v. Commonwealth Mortgage Corp.  (In re Little Creek Dev.  Co.), 779 F.2d 1068, 1072 (5th Cir.1986).  Undoing the stay retroactively should require a measurably greater showing.  Congress intended the stay to afford debtors breathing room and to assure creditors of equitable distribution.  See H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 340, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6296-97.   If retroactive relief becomes commonplace, creditors--anticipating post facto validation--will be tempted to pursue claims against bankrupts heedless of the stay, leaving debtors with no choice but to defend for fear that post-petition default judgments routinely may be resuscitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Congress created the automatic stay to ward off scenarios of this sort.  Thus, if congressional intent is to be honored and the integrity of the automatic stay preserved, retroactive relief should be the long-odds exception, not the general rule.  In our view, only a strict standard will ensure the accomplishment of these objectives.  See Albany Partners, 749 F.2d at 675 (explaining that \"the important congressional policy behind the automatic stay demands that courts be especially hesitant to validate acts committed during the pendency of the stay\").  We conclude, therefore, that although courts possess a limited discretion to grant retroactive relief from the automatic stay, instances in which the exercise of that discretion is justified are likely to be few and far between.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not suggest that we can write a standard that lends itself to mechanical application.  Each case is sui generis and must be judged accordingly.  But, while it is not practical to anticipate and catalogue the varied circumstances in which retroactive relief from the automatic stay may be warranted, some examples may be helpful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a creditor inadvertently violates the automatic stay in ignorance of a pending bankruptcy, courts sometimes have afforded retroactive relief.  See, e.g., Jones, 63 F.3d at 412-13 (affirming retroactive validation of a foreclosure sale where the mortgagee had no notice of the bankruptcy filing);  Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Pinetree, Ltd.  (In re Pinetree, Ltd.), 876 F.2d 34, 37 (5th Cir.1989) (similar).  By like token, debtors who act in bad faith may create situations that are ripe for retroactive relief.  See, e.g., Calder, 907 F.2d at 956;  Easley, 990 F.2d at 911;  Albany Partners, 749 F.2d at 675-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These examples--a creditor's lack of notice or a debtor's bad faith--clearly do not exhaust the possibilities.  But they illustrate that a rarely dispensed remedy like retroactive relief from the automatic stay must rest on a set of facts that is both unusual and unusually compelling.  The case law echoes this conclusion.  See Mataya v. Kissinger (In re Kissinger ), 72 F.3d 107, 109 (9th Cir.1995) (stating that courts should indulge retroactive annulment only in extreme circumstances);  In re Pulley, 196 B.R. 502, 504 (Bankr.W.D.Ark.1996) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Applying the Standard.   Having constructed the limiting principle, we now consider whether the bankruptcy court erred in validating the foreclosure judgment which had been obtained in violation of the automatic stay.  We conclude that no proper predicate existed for doing so and that the bankruptcy court therefore abused its discretion in ordering retroactive relief.  See Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., 900 F.2d 388, 394 (1st Cir.)  (equating abuse of discretion with a meaningful error in judgment), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 891, 111 S.Ct. 233, 112 L.Ed.2d 193 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to BCU's importunings, it is the creditor's knowledge, not the state court's nescience, that is relevant to the question at hand.  Bankruptcy law forbids creditors from continuing judicial proceedings against bankrupts, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(1), and, accordingly, it is the creditor's obligation to inform other courts of the situation, see In re Timbs, 178 B.R. 989, 991 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn.1994) (collecting cases).  Here, both BCU's knowledge and its failure to act are undisputed;  the debtor immediately notified BCU of the bankruptcy filing, but BCU kept quiet and permitted the superior court to proceed in ignorance of the stay.  We are reluctant to reward creditors who, despite notice of a bankruptcy filing, fail for no discernible reason to notify courts in which they have initiated proceedings of the changed circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other facts are no more conducive to the bestowal of retroactive relief.  The creditor was represented by counsel throughout and does not claim that it misapprehended the effect of the filing.  The bankruptcy court made no finding that Soares acted in bad faith, and, at any rate, the record does not contain any basis for such a finding.  The procedural errors committed by both parties, such as BCU's failure to serve Soares with the so-called clarification motion and Soares' failure to lodge timely objections at various points in the proceedings, seemingly cancel each other out.  And BCU's entreaty that the equities favor retroactive relief rings unmistakably hollow;  though BCU expended funds to clear title and maintain the property after foreclosing, this financial hardship is the natural consequence of its own failure to abide by the terms of the automatic stay.  Thus, it is unredressable.  See K-Mart Corp. v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we hold that the state court's post-petition issuance of a foreclosure judgment violated the automatic stay;  that bankruptcy courts ordinarily must hold those who defile the automatic stay to the predictable consequences of their actions and can grant retroactive relief only sparingly and in compelling circumstances;  and that, because this case involves no sufficiently unusual circumstances, the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in granting retroactive relief from the automatic stay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an abundance of caution, we note that our review is confined to the order granting the so-called clarification motion and the retroactive relief awarded therein.  Although Soares may ask the bankruptcy court to reconsider its decision to lift the automatic stay, BCU can request a new foreclosure judgment in the state court unless and until the bankruptcy court reinstates the stay.

Eliot, The Waste Land, I, The Burial of the Dead (1922).  Like a shade tree, the automatic stay which attends the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a) (1994), must be nurtured if it is to retain its vitality.  This appeal, which pits a Chapter 13 debtor bent on saving his home against a creditor bent on enforcing its rights under a mortgage, raises issues which touch upon the degree of judicial protection that the automatic stay invites.  These issues are whether the automatic stay precludes a state court from undertaking ministerial acts after a bankruptcy filing;  if not, what acts are exempt under that rubric;  whether a bankruptcy court may grant retroactive relief from the automatic stay;  and if so, what legal standard it should apply in prescribing such an anodyne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. LAYING THE FOUNDATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by retracing the labyrinthine corridors through which this litigation has passed.  In 1990 the debtor, Napoleon G. Soares, purchased a home in Brockton, Massachusetts.  He executed a $70,000 promissory note to the Brockton Credit Union (BCU) and secured the note by a first mortgage on the real estate.  After sustaining injuries in a motorcycle accident, Soares lagged in his monthly payments.  BCU grew restive and commenced foreclosure proceedings in the state superior court.  Soares did not file an answer.  On March 22, 1995, BCU sent a letter to the clerk of court seeking an order of default and a judgment authorizing foreclosure.  Two days later Soares filed a bankruptcy petition, thus triggering the automatic stay.  He immediately gave notice to BCU, but neither party alerted the state court.  On April 10, with the stay still firmly in place, a judge of that court issued the requested default order.  One week later, she authorized the entry of a foreclosure judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares missed some post-petition mortgage payments.  On June 14, 1995, BCU, without apprising the bankruptcy court of the orders previously obtained in the state proceedings, filed a motion seeking relief from the automatic stay.  The debtor's then-counsel, Gerard Williamson, neglected to oppose BCU's motion.  The bankruptcy court granted the unopposed motion on June 29 (the same day, coincidentally, that Soares, unbeknownst to the judge, paid the post-petition arrearage).  The court subsequently refused to entertain a belated objection filed by Williamson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Soares missed his November payment, BCU activated the state court judgment.  At the ensuing foreclosure sale, held on November 29, BCU itself bid in the mortgaged premises and paid approximately $14,200 in overdue municipal taxes to clear the title.  Soares thereafter sought relief in the state court on the ground that the foreclosure judgment had been issued in contravention of the automatic stay.  The court denied the motion, saying that its post-petition actions had been \"ministerial\" and that any error was harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares' unsuccessful foray apparently rang warning bells for BCU, which asked the bankruptcy court to clarify whether the June 29 order (lifting the automatic stay) ratified the earlier state court judgment.  BCU served this so-called clarification motion on the attorney, Williamson, but not on Soares.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In a margin order entered on February 9, 1996, Judge Kenner addressed the question of retroactivity for the first time and vacated the automatic stay retroactive to March 24, 1995, \"such that the [state] judgment and movant's foreclosure shall not be deemed to have violated the automatic stay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Less than three weeks later Soares, through newly retained counsel, filed a motion to reconsider both the February 9 order and the original grant of relief from the automatic stay.  Judge Kenner denied the reconsideration motion on the merits<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and also denied a companion motion to void the foreclosure sale.  The judge advanced three reasons for having lifted the automatic stay retroactively on February 9.  First, because BCU \"had done everything right,\" it would be inequitable to upset its expectations.  Second, because the foreclosure had wiped out junior lienholders, it would be too complicated to \"unscramble the egg.\"   Third, because Soares could not immediately repay the funds that BCU had expended to clear title to the property, the economic realities favored ratification of the foreclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares appealed.  The district court temporarily stayed further proceedings (blocking both a planned eviction and a possible resale of the property).  Eventually, however, the district court--although finding that BCU had neglected its responsibility to apprise the state tribunal of Soares' bankruptcy (an error which it termed \"harmless\")--determined that the retroactive lifting of the automatic stay did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soares again appealed.  We enlarged the earlier stay on condition that Soares make monthly payments to BCU for use and occupancy of the premises (to be credited against the mortgage indebtedness, should Soares prevail on appeal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the threshold inquiries in this case involve questions of statutory interpretation, we exercise plenary review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See In re Jarvis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196044\"><a href=\"/opinion/196044/jarvis-v-debtor-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span>, 419 (1st Cir.1995).  From this vantage point we first address the purported exemption for \"ministerial acts,\" as it is only necessary to reach the retroactivity question if a violation of the automatic stay in fact occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>A. The Nature of the State Court's Actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties clash head-on in respect to classification of the state court's actions.  The debtor claims that the state court order and judgment transgressed the automatic stay.  The creditor claims that these entries, though occurring post-petition, were purely ministerial and, thus, not offensive to the stay.  The debtor has the better argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 362(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition stays the commencement or continuation of all nonbankruptcy judicial proceedings against the debtor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Here, the state court default order eventuated more than two weeks after Soares filed for bankruptcy and the foreclosure judgment one week later.  The issue, then, is whether these entries contravened the mandate of section 362(a)(1).  BCU asserts that they did not because the stay was not in effect when the creditor requested the state court to act and because the state court's actions, when taken, constituted ministerial acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The creditor's first assertion is mere buzznacking.  The focus here is whether or not the state court's actions, when effected, transgressed the automatic stay.  The date on which the creditor asked the state court to act, while material to an assessment of the creditor's good faith (which is not seriously questioned here), does not bear on whether the activities themselves constituted the forbidden continuation of a judicial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BCU's second assertion is more substantial.  Ministerial acts, even if undertaken in a state judicial proceeding subsequent to a bankruptcy filing, do not fall within the proscription of the automatic stay.  See Rexnord Holdings, Inc. v. Bidermann, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667582\"><a href=\"/opinion/667582/rexnord-holdings-inc-v-maurice-bidermann/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 527 (2d Cir.1994);   Savers Fed.  Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. McCarthy Constr.  Co. (In re Knightsbridge Dev.  Co.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528467\"><a href=\"/opinion/528467/in-re-knightsbridge-development-co-inc-debtor-savers-federal-savings/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 148 (4th Cir.1989).  But the state court's actions in this case cannot properly be characterized as ministerial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A ministerial act is one that is essentially clerical in nature.  See Black's Law Dictionary 996 (6th ed. 1990).  Thus, when an official's duty is delineated by, say, a law or a judicial decree with such crystalline clarity that nothing is left to the exercise of the official's discretion or judgment, the resultant act is ministerial.  See United States ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101747\"><a href=\"/opinion/101747/united-states-ex-rel-mclennan-v-wilbur/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 420, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101747\"><a href=\"/opinion/101747/united-states-ex-rel-mclennan-v-wilbur/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span> (1931) (indicating that a duty is ministerial if \"the obligation to act [is] peremptory, and plainly defined\");  Neal v. Regan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1753236\"><a href=\"/opinion/1753236/neal-v-regan/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1558</span></a></span>, 1562 (N.D.Ind.1984) (describing a ministerial act as \"one which 'the law prescribes and defines ... with such precision as to leave nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment' \") (citation omitted).  Such acts can usefully be visualized as the antithesis of judicial acts, inasmuch as the essence of a judicial act is the exercise of discretion or judgment.  See Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at 846.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virtually by definition, a judicial proceeding does not conclude until the judicial function is completed, that is, until the judicial decision is made.  See, e.g., Bidermann, 21 F.3d at 528 (holding that the judicial function is completed \"at the moment the judge direct[s] entry of judgment\").  Frequently, routine scrivening, such as recordation or entry on the docket, follows on the heels of a judicial decision.  Such actions--taken in obedience to the judge's peremptory instructions or otherwise precisely defined and nondiscretionary--are ministerial and, consequently, do not themselves violate the automatic stay even if undertaken after an affected party files for bankruptcy.  See, e.g., Knightsbridge Dev., 884 F.2d at 148 (suggesting that merely recording a previously decided award would be a \"clerical act\" and therefore would not infract the automatic stay);  In re Capgro Leasing Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1828491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1828491/in-re-capgro-leasing-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 315-16 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y.1994) (stating that \"entry of a judgment will constitute a 'ministerial act' where the judicial function has been completed and the clerk has merely to perform the rote function of entering the judgment upon the court's docket\").  By the same token, however, acts undertaken in the course of carrying out the core judicial function are not ministerial and, if essayed after bankruptcy filing, will be deemed to violate the automatic stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bidermann captures this distinction.  There, the district judge ruled ora sponte and endorsed the motion papers.  The defendant then sought refuge in bankruptcy.  The Second Circuit held the clerk's subsequent, post-petition entry of the judgment on the docket to be ministerial (and, therefore, unaffected by the automatic stay).  21 F.3d at 528.   Other cases are to the same effect.  See Heikkila v. Carver (In re Carver ), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493947\"><a href=\"/opinion/493947/17-collier-bankrcas2d-771-bankr-l-rep-p-71977-in-re-russell-carver/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 464 (8th Cir.1987) (holding that a \"routine certification\" by the clerk, entered post-petition, did not transgress the automatic stay);  Capgro Leasing, 169 B.R. at 315-16 (holding the clerk's entry of judgment on the docket to be ministerial when, prior to the bankruptcy filing, the court had ordered summary judgment).  A parallel line of cases reinforces the notion that the compendium of ministerial acts excludes those involving deliberation, discretion, or judicial involvement.  See, e.g., Ellis v. Consolidated Diesel Elec. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535327\"><a href=\"/opinion/535327/keith-ellis-linda-ellis-thomas-l-curry-dennis-hodnett-and-sandra-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 372-73 (10th Cir.1990) (invalidating a judicial decision that granted summary judgment two weeks after a bankruptcy filing);  Knightsbridge Dev., 884 F.2d at 148 (voiding an arbitration award because the bulk of the panel's deliberations occurred after the stay arose);  Ellison v. Northwest Eng'g Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418827\"><a href=\"/opinion/418827/willie-ellison-and-mary-ellison-v-northwest-engineering-company-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1310</span></a></span>, 1311 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that while the automatic stay was in effect a court could not render a decision in a case which had been briefed and argued pre-petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of demarcation makes perfectly good sense.  The statutory proviso which gives rise to the automatic stay says what it means and means what it says.  See ICC v. Holmes Transp., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560357\"><a href=\"/opinion/560357/bankr-l-rep-p-73966-interstate-commerce-commission-v-holmes/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 987 (1st Cir.1991).  Confining the exemption for ministerial acts to those actions which are essentially clerical, as opposed to judicial, honors this principle because such an interpretation comports precisely with the text of section 362(a)(1).  In the bargain, this interpretation also facilitates the statute's due administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silhouetted against this legal landscape, it is readily apparent that the state court's actions in ordering a default and directing the entry of a judgment possess a distinctly judicial, rather than a ministerial, character.  The record is totally barren of any evidence that the state court judge decided to grant BCU's request prior to the date of the bankruptcy filing, and all visible signs point in the opposite direction.  The judge did not enter the default order until more than two weeks after Soares sought the protection of the bankruptcy court and she did not direct the entry of a judgment authorizing foreclosure until another week had elapsed.  Moreover, the judge indicated after the fact that she waited to confirm Soares' nonmilitary status before directing the entry of judgment.  This indicates deliberativeness and a concomitant willingness to exercise discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the fact that the judge later characterized her entry of the foreclosure judgment as \"ministerial\" require a different result.  An appellate court is not bound by a trial judge's unsupported description, see, e.g., Estate of Soler v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196244\"><a href=\"/opinion/196244/estate-of-soler-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 47 n. 1 (1st Cir.1995);  In re G.S.F.

Hence, we decline to adopt the label that the state court judge chose in hindsight to affix to her activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize succinctly.  Because the decision which animated the entry of the order and judgment occurred after the stay was in force, those actions continued the state judicial proceeding within the meaning of section 362(a)(1).  Consequently, the actions violated the automatic stay.  Given this infraction, we now must assess the availability of a retroactive cure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>B.

This semantic difference has practical consequences because the characterization of an infringing action as \"void\" or \"voidable\" influences the burden of going forward.  Treating an action taken in contravention of the automatic stay as void places the burden of validating the action after the fact squarely on the shoulders of the offending creditor.  In contrast, treating an action taken in contravention of the automatic stay as voidable places the burden of challenging the action on the offended debtor.  We think that the former paradigm, rather than the latter, best harmonizes with the nature of the automatic stay and the important purposes that it serves.  See generally 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, p 362.11 &amp; n. 1 (observing that most courts hold violations void and terming this the better view).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Availability of Retroactive Relief.   While the automatic stay is significant, it is not an immutable article of faith.  Indeed, the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(d), expressly authorizes courts to lift it in particular situations.  Whether this statutory authorization encompasses retroactive relief is not entirely clear.  We previously hinted that a court may set aside the automatic stay retroactively in an appropriate case.  See Smith Corset Shops, 696 F.2d at 976-77.   We now confirm Smith 's adumbration, holding that 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(d) permits bankruptcy courts to lift the automatic stay retroactively and thereby validate actions which otherwise would be void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 362(d) confers upon courts discretionary power in certain circumstances to terminate, annul, modify, or place conditions upon the automatic stay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In drafting the law, Congress chose to include both the power to terminate the stay and the power to annul it.  When construing this language, we must try to give independent meaning to each word.  See United States Dep't of Treasury v. Fabe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112880\"><a href=\"/opinion/112880/department-of-treasury-v-fabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 504 n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112880\"><a href=\"/opinion/112880/department-of-treasury-v-fabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2202</span></a></span>, 2210 n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112880\"><a href=\"/opinion/112880/department-of-treasury-v-fabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span> (1993);  United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450368\"><a href=\"/opinion/450368/united-states-v-ven-fuel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985).  The only plausible distinction between the two verbs in this context is that terminating the stay blunts it prospectively, from the moment the court's order enters, whereas annulling the stay erases it retrospectively, as of some date prior to the entry of the court's order (reaching as far back as the date when the debtor filed the bankruptcy petition, if the court so elects).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seen from this perspective, Congress' grant of a power of annulment is meaningful only if the court may thereby validate actions taken before the date on which the court rules.  On any other construction, annulment lacks any independent significance;  it merely replicates termination.  It follows, therefore, that section 362(d) authorizes retroactive relief from the automatic stay.  Accord Siciliano, 13 F.3d at 751;  Albany Partners, 749 F.2d at 675;  see also Franklin Sav. Ass'n v. Office of Thrift Supervision, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675844\"><a href=\"/opinion/675844/franklin-savings-association-a-kansas-savings-and-loan-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1023 (10th Cir.1994) (recognizing the authority to annul the stay and thereby grant retroactive relief);  Sikes v.

The Limiting Principle.   Recognizing the discretionary authority of bankruptcy courts to relieve creditors and other interested parties retroactively from the operation of the automatic stay tells us nothing about the yardstick by which attempts to secure such relief should be measured.  We turn next to this inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, the overarching purpose of the automatic stay informs our analysis.  Because the stay is a fundamental protection for all parties affected by the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, it should not be dismantled without good reason.  See, e.g., Little Creek Dev.  Co. v. Commonwealth Mortgage Corp.  (In re Little Creek Dev.  Co.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462471\"><a href=\"/opinion/462471/in-the-matter-of-little-creek-development-company-debtor-little-creek/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>, 1072 (5th Cir.1986).  Undoing the stay retroactively should require a measurably greater showing.  Congress intended the stay to afford debtors breathing room and to assure creditors of equitable distribution.  See H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 340, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6296-97.   If retroactive relief becomes commonplace, creditors--anticipating post facto validation--will be tempted to pursue claims against bankrupts heedless of the stay, leaving debtors with no choice but to defend for fear that post-petition default judgments routinely may be resuscitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that Congress created the automatic stay to ward off scenarios of this sort.  Thus, if congressional intent is to be honored and the integrity of the automatic stay preserved, retroactive relief should be the long-odds exception, not the general rule.  In our view, only a strict standard will ensure the accomplishment of these objectives.  See Albany Partners, 749 F.2d at 675 (explaining that \"the important congressional policy behind the automatic stay demands that courts be especially hesitant to validate acts committed during the pendency of the stay\").  We conclude, therefore, that although courts possess a limited discretion to grant retroactive relief from the automatic stay, instances in which the exercise of that discretion is justified are likely to be few and far between.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not suggest that we can write a standard that lends itself to mechanical application.  Each case is sui generis and must be judged accordingly.  But, while it is not practical to anticipate and catalogue the varied circumstances in which retroactive relief from the automatic stay may be warranted, some examples may be helpful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a creditor inadvertently violates the automatic stay in ignorance of a pending bankruptcy, courts sometimes have afforded retroactive relief.  See, e.g., Jones, 63 F.3d at 412-13 (affirming retroactive validation of a foreclosure sale where the mortgagee had no notice of the bankruptcy filing);  Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Pinetree, Ltd.  (In re Pinetree, Ltd.), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524140\"><a href=\"/opinion/524140/bankr-l-rep-p-72961-in-the-matter-of-pinetree-ltd-debtor-the-mutual/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 37 (5th Cir.1989) (similar).  By like token, debtors who act in bad faith may create situations that are ripe for retroactive relief.  See, e.g., Calder, 907 F.2d at 956;  Easley, 990 F.2d at 911;  Albany Partners, 749 F.2d at 675-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These examples--a creditor's lack of notice or a debtor's bad faith--clearly do not exhaust the possibilities.  But they illustrate that a rarely dispensed remedy like retroactive relief from the automatic stay must rest on a set of facts that is both unusual and unusually compelling.  The case law echoes this conclusion.  See Mataya v. Kissinger (In re Kissinger ), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709595\"><a href=\"/opinion/709595/in-re-michael-j-kissinger-debtor-thomas-mataya-creditor-appellee-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 109 (9th Cir.1995) (stating that courts should indulge retroactive annulment only in extreme circumstances);  In re Pulley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1931897\"><a href=\"/opinion/1931897/in-re-pulley/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 504 (Bankr.W.D.Ark.1996) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Applying the Standard.   Having constructed the limiting principle, we now consider whether the bankruptcy court erred in validating the foreclosure judgment which had been obtained in violation of the automatic stay.  We conclude that no proper predicate existed for doing so and that the bankruptcy court therefore abused its discretion in ordering retroactive relief.  See Anderson v. Beatrice Foods Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539792\"><a href=\"/opinion/539792/anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 394 (1st Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span> (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to BCU's importunings, it is the creditor's knowledge, not the state court's nescience, that is relevant to the question at hand.  Bankruptcy law forbids creditors from continuing judicial proceedings against bankrupts, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(1), and, accordingly, it is the creditor's obligation to inform other courts of the situation, see In re Timbs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1917531\"><a href=\"/opinion/1917531/in-re-timbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span>, 991 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn.1994) (collecting cases).  Here, both BCU's knowledge and its failure to act are undisputed;  the debtor immediately notified BCU of the bankruptcy filing, but BCU kept quiet and permitted the superior court to proceed in ignorance of the stay.  We are reluctant to reward creditors who, despite notice of a bankruptcy filing, fail for no discernible reason to notify courts in which they have initiated proceedings of the changed circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other facts are no more conducive to the bestowal of retroactive relief.  The creditor was represented by counsel throughout and does not claim that it misapprehended the effect of the filing.  The bankruptcy court made no finding that Soares acted in bad faith, and, at any rate, the record does not contain any basis for such a finding.  The procedural errors committed by both parties, such as BCU's failure to serve Soares with the so-called clarification motion and Soares' failure to lodge timely objections at various points in the proceedings, seemingly cancel each other out.  And BCU's entreaty that the equities favor retroactive relief rings unmistakably hollow;  though BCU expended funds to clear title and maintain the property after foreclosing, this financial hardship is the natural consequence of its own failure to abide by the terms of the automatic stay.  Thus, it is unredressable.  See K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524046\"><a href=\"/opinion/524046/k-mart-corporation-v-oriental-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 916 (1st Cir.1989) (declining to deny permanent injunctive relief which would require substantial demolition of an expensive structure where \"appellant's wound, deep as it appears, was self-inflicted\").  In the last analysis, BCU is the author of its own misfortune.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we hold that the state court's post-petition issuance of a foreclosure judgment violated the automatic stay;  that bankruptcy courts ordinarily must hold those who defile the automatic stay to the predictable consequences of their actions and can grant retroactive relief only sparingly and in compelling circumstances;  and that, because this case involves no sufficiently unusual circumstances, the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in granting retroactive relief from the automatic stay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an abundance of caution, we note that our review is confined to the order granting the so-called clarification motion and the retroactive relief awarded therein.  Although Soares may ask the bankruptcy court to reconsider its decision to lift the automatic stay, BCU can request a new foreclosure judgment in the state court unless and until the bankruptcy court reinstates the stay.

The so-called clarification motion had been served in derogation of a standing order promulgated by the bankruptcy judges in the District of Massachusetts, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>(a) All motions and requests for orders must be served on the Chapter 13 trustee, the debtor, the debtor's attorney, persons who have requested notice, and all creditors....</p>\n        <p>Joint Procedural Order &#167; 13.5 (Sept. 1, 1994).  Despite this order, BCU had not served the motion on the debtor.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> A different standard of review applies to the bankruptcy court's discretionary decision to lift the automatic stay retroactively.
