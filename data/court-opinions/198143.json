MANGONE,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Bruce Green on brief for appellant.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, Paul G. Levenson and\r\nVictor A. Wild, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nSeptember 28, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Richard D. Mangone appeals from a ruling\r\nmade during his resentencing, following a remand ordered by\r\nthis court. See United States v. Mangone, 105 F.3d 29 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  He does not appeal from the sentence itself, which was\r\nwithin the applicable guideline sentencing range.  The specific\r\nissue is whether the district court erred in refusing Mangone's\r\nrequest at his resentencing hearing that the proceedings be\r\nconducted before a different judge.  The request stemmed from\r\ndefense counsel's contention that arguments that the government\r\nmade in its sentencing memorandum violated a stipulation\r\nentered by the parties regarding the amount of the loss\r\nattributable to Mangone for purposes of calculating an offense\r\nlevel under the fraud guideline. See U.S.S.G.  2F1.1. \r\n          At Mangone's initial sentencing, the parties informed\r\nthe court that they had agreed upon the following stipulation:\r\n          The parties stipulate . . . that for the\r\n          purposes of calculating loss under the\r\n          Section 2F1.1, that the loss attributable\r\n          to Mr. Mangone's offense is in the range\r\n          of ten to $20 million.  The stipulation\r\n          reserves for the defendant the right to\r\n          argue that even those numbers overstate\r\n          the seriousness of the offense, and the\r\n          stipulation reserves for the government\r\n          the right to seek restitution in an amount\r\n          above $20 million, on the grounds that the\r\n          actual losses attributable to a variety of\r\n          causes, but related to loan, fraudulent\r\n          loans, were above the $20 million figure.\r\n\nAddendum to Appellant's Brief, pp. 14-15.  The stipulation was\r\nentered after Mangone was tried and convicted.  It was not made\r\nas part of a guilty plea.\r\n          Mangone argues on appeal, as he did below at his\r\nresentencing hearing, that the government violated the terms of\r\nthe stipulation by arguing in its sentencing memorandum that 1)\r\nthe actual loss exceeded the amount stipulated to, and 2) the\r\ndollar amount of the loss understated the harmfulness and\r\nseriousness of Mangone's conduct. See U.S.S.G. 2F1.1, comment.\r\n(n.9) (1990).\r\n          I. Actual Loss Exceeded Stipulated Loss Amount\r\n          On appeal, Mangone argues that the government\r\n\"challenge[d] the existence of a fact to which they stipulated\r\nto.\"  Appellant's Brief, p. 10.  The \"fact\" that the parties\r\nstipulated to, however, was that \"for the purposes of\r\ncalculating loss under the Section 2F1.1, . . . the loss\r\nattributable to Mr. Mangone's offense is in the range of ten to\r\n$20 million.\"  The parties did not stipulate that the actualloss, or the loss for any other purposes, was within that\r\nrange.  To the contrary, the stipulation articulated the\r\ngovernment's position that the \"actual\" amount of the loss, for\r\npurposes of calculating restitution, exceeded $20 million.  The\r\nstipulation did not bar the government from restating that\r\nposition in its sentencing memorandum, where it expressly\r\nstated that an upward departure on that basis would not be\r\ndefensible.\r\n          II. Dollar Loss Understates Seriousness of Offense\r\n          Although there is no express promise to the effect,\r\nMangone argues that the stipulation contained an implied\r\npromise that the government would not argue for an upward\r\ndeparture on the ground that the stipulated loss amount\r\nunderstates the seriousness of the offense.  He argues that the\r\npromise should be inferred from his specific reservation of the\r\nright to make the opposite argument: that the stipulated loss\r\namount overstates the seriousness of the offense.\r\n          Neither the guidelines nor logic alone supports\r\nMangone's argument.  There is nothing necessarily contradictory\r\nabout agreeing to a dollar amount of the loss but arguing, as\r\nthe government did in its sentencing memorandum, that the\r\nmonetary calculation understates the seriousness of the offense\r\nas measured by non-economic factors: \"impact on individuals and\r\nupon the community.\" Appellee's Addendum, p. 7.  The guidelines\r\nexpressly recognize that \"[d]ollar loss often does not fully\r\ncapture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct.\"\r\n2F1.1, comment. (n.9).  Therefore, merely that the stipulation\r\ncontained an agreement to the dollar amount of the loss for\r\npurposes of calculating the offense level under 2F1.1 is not\r\nreason to assume that the stipulation barred the parties from\r\narguing that the dollar amount under- or overstated the\r\nseriousness of the offense.\r\n          Neither does Mangone's express reservation of the\r\nright to argue that the dollar amount of the loss overstates\r\nthe seriousness of the offense compel a finding that the\r\ngovernment had no right to make the reciprocal argument that\r\nthe seriousness of the offense was understated by the dollar\r\namount of the loss.  It is equally reasonable to assume that if\r\nMangone had the right to make his overstatement argument, the\r\ngovernment was not prohibited from making the opposite\r\nargument.  Mangone has failed to adequately explain why the\r\ncourt should read into the stipulation a promise that is not\r\ncontained therein and does not logically follow from the\r\nparties' stipulation to the dollar amount of the loss for\r\npurposes of 2F1.1. \r\n          \"[T]o be availing, a party's expectation must be\r\nreasonable.\" United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d 386, 388 (1st\r\nCir. 1988).  We conclude that it was unreasonable for Mangone\r\nto read into the stipulation to the dollar amount of the loss,\r\na promise that the government would not argue that the dollar\r\namount understates the seriousness of the offense.  Therefore,\r\nMangone's argument that the government broke that promise is\r\nwithout merit.  See United States v. Connolly, 51 F.3d 1, 4\r\n(1st Cir. 1995) (rejecting defendant's interpretation of plea\r\nagreement where it \"would not be reasonable to read the\r\nagreement to establish . . . a promise by the government not to\r\nmove for a departure\"); United States v. Miller, 993 F.2d 16,\r\n20 (2d Cir. 1993) (no breach where there was \"no basis in the\r\nGuidelines or in logic for Miller's proposition that an\r\nagreement by the government not to oppose a defendant's motion\r\nfor a downward departure should, in the absence of an express\r\nagreement, bar the government from seeking an upward departure\r\non appropriate grounds\").  The district court did not err in\r\ndenying Mangone's request to be resentenced by a different\r\njudge.\r\n          Mangone's sentence is affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
