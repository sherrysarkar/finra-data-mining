R. Crim. P. 33 while a criminal case is\r\n\npending  on  direct  appeal,   and,  relatedly,  to  examine  the\r\n\ninterplay between Rule 33 and a  defendant's guilty plea.  In the\r\n\nend, we affirm the sentence and deny the motion.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          Because appellant's conviction and sentence stem from a\r\n\nguilty  plea rather than a verdict, we derive the pertinent facts\r\n\nfrom  the presentence  investigation  report  (PSI  Report),  the\r\n\ngovernment's  statement   served  pursuant  to  D.P.R.

Loc.  R. 418.2(a).   In this case,  the defendant did  not\r\nobject to the statement submitted by the government.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          On  or about  January 14,  1992, appellant  arranged to\r\n\nsell  one-eighth of a kilogram of crack  cocaine (125 grams) to a\r\n\ncustomer who was,  in reality,  a government operative.   On  the\r\n\nevening of January 15,  appellant's courier, Carlos Delgado Rojas\r\n\n(Delgado),  told the agent  that appellant  could not  supply the\r\n\nfull  125 grams of crack then  and there; instead, he proposed to\r\n\ndeliver  approximately  80  grams of  crack  and  45-50 grams  of\r\n\npowdered cocaine.  Once the agent agreed to the substitution, the\r\n\nparties  consummated  the  transaction.   Subsequent  measurement\r\n\nrevealed  that Delgado had delivered 85.3 grams of crack and 54.4\r\n\ngrams of cocaine powder.\r\n\n          The agent  expressed an interest  in future  purchases.\r\n\nAppellant  agreed to  sell him  a half-kilogram  of crack,  to be\r\n\ndelivered  on January 24.  At the appointed time, Delgado, armed,\r\n\nappeared  at the  delivery site  accompanied by  Juan Encarnacion\r\n\nCastro  (Encarnacion)  and a  juvenile  (G.R.M.).   The  men were\r\n\napprehended and  the arresting  officers seized a  loaded pistol.\r\n\nThe officers also  seized three plastic bags  containing a white,\r\n\npowdery  substance  later  determined  to  be  sugar.2    Further\r\n\ninvestigation revealed that appellant  gave the seized firearm to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Appellant eventually admitted that  he had agreed to purvey\r\nthe half-kilogram of crack,  and stated that he had  prepared for\r\nthe transaction by  \"cooking\" that  amount of cocaine.   He  then\r\nsubstituted sugar  for crack, claiming that he  had a premonition\r\nthat  he might  be apprehended.   The circumstances  suggest that\r\nsomething more sinister might have been afoot.

(\"Honor,  even among\r                  \r\nthieves,  may all  too often be,  in the  bard's phrase,  `a mere\r\nscutcheon.'\") (quoting William Shakespeare,  Henry IV Part I, act\r                                                                      \r\nV, sc. 1 (1598)), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 895 (1990).\r                                        \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nDelgado for protection during the drug transaction.\r\n\n          The   grand  jury   indicted  Graciani,   Delgado,  and\r\n\nEncarnacion on a medley of charges.  Appellant was named in seven\r\n\ncounts of the  superseding indictment.   He eventually agreed  to\r\n\nplead guilty to count 1 (which charged  the unlawful distribution\r\n\nof 85.3 grams  of crack cocaine on January 15  in violation of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.     841(a)(1)) and  count  7 (which  charged  the unlawful\r\n\ncarriage   of  a  firearm  during  and  in  relation  to  a  drug\r\n\ntrafficking offense in  violation of  18 U.S.C.    924(c)).   The\r\n\nplea  agreement  left  the  sentence in  the  court's  discretion\r\n\n(subject, of course, to the constraints imposed by the sentencing\r\n\nguidelines).\r\n\n          The   district  court   took   appellant's   plea   and\r\n\ncommissioned  a  PSI  Report.   The  court  originally  sentenced\r\n\nappellant on  July 7, 1992,3  but then reconsidered.   We do  not\r\n\nconcern ourselves with the withdrawn sentence, but focus upon the\r\n\nsecond disposition hearing (held  on August 2, 1994).   The court\r\n\nattributed  to appellant  (a)  the weight  of  the crack  cocaine\r\n\nactually supplied on January  15, (b) the weight of  the powdered\r\n\ncocaine actually supplied on that date, and (c) the weight of the\r\n\ncrack cocaine promised for  delivery on January 24.   Then, using\r\n\nthe  Drug Quantity Table, the  court set appellant's base offense\r\n\nlevel (BOL)  at  36.   See U.S.S.G.   2D1.1(c)(4) (Drug  Quantity\r                                    \r\n\nTable) (specifying a BOL of 36 for offenses involving \"[a]t least\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The court dismissed the remaining five counts at  that time\r\nas  per the plea agreement.   The ensuing  reconsideration of the\r\nsentence did not implicate the dismissed counts.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Cocaine Base\").\r\n\n          The  court  added six  levels     four for  appellant's\r\n\naggravating role in the  offense, see id.  3B1.1(a), and  two for\r                                                   \r\n\nobstruction of  justice, see  id.  3C1.1    and subtracted  three\r                                           \r\n\nlevels for acceptance of responsibility, see id.  3E1.1, bringing\r                                                          \r\n\nthe total offense level (TOL) to 39.  Given appellant's status as\r\n\na  first  offender,  these   computations  yielded  a   guideline\r\n\nsentencing  range (GSR) of 262-327  months.  The  court imposed a\r\n\n280-month incarcerative sentence on count 1, and added a 60-month\r\n\nconsecutive  sentence  on  count  7 to  accommodate  a  mandatory\r\n\nminimum.  See 18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).  This appeal ensued.\r                       \r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                            Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Appellant advances a myriad  of arguments in support of\r\n\nthe  appeal and  the  concomitant motion.

See United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSepulveda,  15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 114\r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct. 2714 (1995); United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 15 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1992); United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1990).  In this case, appellant castigates the district court for\r\n\nattributing to  him a drug  quantity in excess  of the amount  of\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ncrack cocaine  involved in the count of  conviction.  Appellant's\r\n\nfusillade lands well wide of the target.\r\n\n          Under   the  guidelines,   the   aggregate  amount   of\r\n\nattributed drugs  is to  be derived  from  the sum  total of  all\r\n\nrelevant  conduct.    The  proper figure  can  only  be computed,\r\n\ntherefore, by careful consideration  of all acts \"that were  part\r\n\nof the same  course of conduct  or common scheme  or plan as  the\r\n\noffense  of  conviction.\"    U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(2).    \"Relevant\r\n\nconduct is not limited  to the counts of conviction\";  rather, it\r\n\nincludes both the charged conduct to which a defendant pleads and\r\n\nalso any other conduct that qualifies under the relevancy rubric.\r\n\nTejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 110; see also Garcia, 954 F.2d at  15;\r                                                         \r\n\nBradley, 917  F.2d at  605; U.S.S.G.  1B1.3,  comment.

See Tejada-Beltran, 50  F.3d at 110;\r                                                         \r\n\nGarcia, 954 F.2d at 15.\r                \r\n\n          That ends the  matter.  In the usual case,  we review a\r\n\nsentencing court's  drug quantity  determination  only for  clear\r\n\nerror.

We see no error.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          By  like token,  the  fact that  the government  seized\r\n\nsugar,  and  never  recovered  the half-kilogram  of  crack  that\r\n\nappellant  promised to supply on January 24, does not sweeten the\r\n\nbottom line by precluding reference to the agreed quantity in the\r\n\nsentencing determination.   Indeed, \"every court  to consider the\r\n\nissue,  including this one, has concluded that an amount of drugs\r\n\nwhich  a  defendant  negotiates  to  sell may  be  considered  as\r\n\nrelevant  conduct for  base offense  level  purposes even  if the\r\n\ndrugs are never produced.\" Bradley, 917 F.2d at 604.4\r                                            \r\n\n          For these  reasons, we conclude that  the lower court's\r\n\ndrug quantity calculation cannot be faulted.\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r                                            \r\n\n                         Drug Equivalency\r                                   Drug Equivalency\r                                                   \r\n\n          Appellant's next  protestation, now familiar in all the\r\n\ncircuits,   criticizes  the   fact  that   the  guidelines,   and\r\n\nspecifically  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1,  equate  one  kilogram  of  crack\r\n\ncocaine  to  one  hundred   kilograms  of  powdered  cocaine  for\r\n\nsentencing purposes.5  We have  squarely rejected claims that the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4To be sure, there  are exceptions to this rule,  see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\nU.S.S.G.    2D1.1,  comment.

See McDowell,  918 F.2d at  1011 (urging  \"that\r                                        \r\n\nconsiderable  respect  be paid  to the  views  of the  nisi prius\r\n\ncourt\" in  connection with such findings)  (quoting United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

In this case, we\r                   \r\n\nsee no hint  of clear  error in the  trial court's  determination\r\n\nthat appellant was the  leader of an enterprise of  the requisite\r\n\nsize.\r\n\n          Appellant   strives  to  avoid  clear-error  review  by\r\n\nisolating  a supposed mistake  of law.   He  says that  the court\r\n\nerred  in making  its scope  determination; there could  not have\r\n\nbeen  \"five   or  more   participants\"  because   only  convicted\r\n\nindividuals can be counted, and, here, the government indicted no\r\n\nmore than  three  persons (Graciani,  Delgado, and  Encarnacion).\r\n\nThe argument cannot withstand  the mildest scrutiny.  The  law is\r\n\npellucid that a scope  determination under section 3B1.1(a) turns\r\n\nnot on  the number  of people  convicted, but  on  the number  of\r\n\npersons  involved  in  the  criminal  activity,  whether  or  not\r\n\nindicted (let alone convicted).

For\r\n\nexample, in Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 374 (1982), the Supreme\r                                    \r\n\nCourt upheld a 40-year prison sentence for possessing nine ounces\r\n\nof  marijuana with distributive  intent.  More  recently, a clear\r\n\nmajority  of the  Justices in  Harmelin, while  differing on  the\r                                                 \r\n\nconstitutional   status   of   proportionality    review,   found\r\n\ninsufficient disproportionality to forestall a mandatory sentence\r\n\nof  life without  parole  for possession  of  over 650  grams  of\r\n\ncocaine.  Recent opinions  of the courts of  appeals are to  like\r\n\neffect.  See, e.g., Munoz,  36 F.3d at 1239 (holding that  a 240-\r                                   \r\n\nmonth  sentence meted  out for  participation in  a crack-selling\r\n\nconspiracy involving less than 900 grams of cocaine base accorded\r\n\nwith  the Harmelin standard);  United States v.  Wesley, 990 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n360, 367 (8th. Cir. 1993) (holding that 100-to-1 sentencing ratio\r\n\nbetween  cocaine and  crack cocaine does  not violate  the Eighth\r\n\nAmendment).  With  these cases as a  reference point, appellant's\r\n\nsentence  cannot  successfully  be attacked  on  Eighth Amendment\r\n\ngrounds.\r\n\n                                E.\r                                          E.\r                                            \r\n\n                       The Motion To Remand\r                                 The Motion To Remand\r                                                     \r\n\n          Following  the submission  of  the  parties'  appellate\r\n\nbriefs,  appellant's new  counsel filed  a  motion in  this court\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nasking  us  to  withhold decision  and  remand  the  case to  the\r\n\ndistrict court for  a hearing on \"newly  discovered evidence\" and\r\n\nfor a new trial.8  The  motion was accompanied by an affidavit of\r\n\nG.R.M.  (now identified as German  R. Maldonado) that purports to\r\n\nabsolve  appellant   of  responsibility  for   the  offenses   of\r\n\nconviction.    The motion  asserts  that  this \"newly  discovered\r\n\nevidence\" warrants the relief requested.  We think not.\r\n\n          In  the first place, appellant puts the cart before the\r\n\nhorse.   Concededly, a  motion  for a  new trial  based on  newly\r\n\ndiscovered  evidence  can be  brought  while a  criminal  case is\r\n\npending on  direct  appeal.   See  Fed. R.  Crim.  P. 33.9    The\r                                           \r\n\nquestion remains,  however, whether the  court of appeals  is the\r\n\nappropriate  forum in  which  a criminal  defendant may  initiate\r\n\nreview of a Rule 33 motion by the district court, and, relatedly,\r\n\nwhether  a remand  is  necessary before  the  district court  can\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8In  point of fact, counsel filed two motions, both of which\r\nrely on the same affidavit.  To the extent that the second motion\r\ncan be  read as  requesting different  relief   a  hearing as  to\r\nwhether  the plea agreement  is null  and void  (and, presumably,\r\nwhether the appellant should be permitted to withdraw his plea)  \r\nwe deny it without prejudice  to the filing of a proper  petition\r\nunder  28 U.S.C.   2255 (1988).  The plea-withdrawal argument was\r\nnot raised below and, in the absence of essential factfinding, we\r\ndecline to entertain it on direct appeal.\r\n\n     9The rule states in pertinent part:\r\n\n          A motion for a new trial based  on the ground\r\n          of newly discovered evidence may be made only\r\n          before  or  within   two  years  after  final\r\n          judgment,  but if  an appeal  is  pending the\r\n          court may grant the  motion only on remand of\r\n          the case.\r\n\nFed.

In general,  both parts  of this\r\n\ninquiry evoke a negative response.\r\n\n          A  criminal defendant  who  aspires to  employ Rule  33\r\n\nwhile his conviction is  pending on direct appeal is  not obliged\r\n\neither to file a motion  for remand in the court of appeals or to\r\n\nseek any  type of leave  from that court.   To the  contrary, the\r\n\nproper procedure  under such circumstances is  for the defendant,\r\n\nwithout further ado,  to file his Rule 33 motion  in the district\r\n\ncourt.  See  United States v.  Phillips, 558 F.2d  363, 363  (6th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1977) (per curiam).  Once  the motion has been so  docketed,\r\n\nthe   district   court   has   jurisdiction   to   entertain   it\r\n\nnotwithstanding  the pendency of the appeal,  and may either deny\r\n\nit  on the  merits or  indicate an  intention to  grant it.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.

If  the district court\r\n\ndenies the motion, the  defendant may take a further  appeal; and\r\n\nif the court  proposes to  grant the motion,  it ordinarily  will\r\n\nissue a written statement  to that effect so that  the defendant,\r\n\narmed with the advisory, may then request an order of remand from\r\n\nthe appellate court.  See Frame, 454 F.2d at 1138.\r                                         \r\n\n          We adopt this protocol,  requiring a Rule 33 motion  to\r\n\nbe filed initially in the district court when  a direct appeal of\r\n\na  criminal conviction is pending, for four main reasons.  First,\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nthe  protocol accords with the  weight of authority.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nPhillips,  supra; Frame,  supra.   Second, it  comports with  the\r                                         \r\n\ndiscernible  intention of the drafters of  the 1944 amendments to\r\n\nRule 33.   See, e.g.,  Frame, 454 F.2d  at 1138 (discussing  1944\r                                      \r\n\namendments).   Third, it coheres with  our established procedural\r\n\nparadigm for handling parallel situations on the civil side.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nToscano  v.  Chandris,  934   F.2d  383,  386  (1st   Cir.  1991)\r                               \r\n\n(explaining  that \"if an appeal  is pending, a  Rule 60(b) motion\r\n\nshould first be filed in the trial court, and the district judge,\r\n\nif inclined to allow it, may then request remand\");  Commonwealth\r                                                                           \r\n\nof Puerto Rico v.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nFrame, 454 F.2d at 1138.  The protocol we adopt  today meets this\r               \r\n\nobjective.   It takes advantage  of the district  court's greater\r\n\nfamiliarity with  the case; it husbands  judicial resources, thus\r\n\neliminating  the  need  for  a  time-consuming  remand  in  those\r\n\nsituations  in  which  the  trial  court  discerns no  basis  for\r\n\ngranting a new trial; and, finally, it ensures that the merits of\r\n\nthe motion for new trial will be heard rapidly, while at the same\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ntime keeping the earlier appeal on track.10\r\n\n          Since appellant did not  follow this protocol in moving\r\n\nto remand, his motion must in all events be denied for procedural\r\n\nreasons.   But, there is an  added wrinkle.  If  the problem were\r\n\npurely procedural,  we  would simply  deny the  motion to  remand\r\n\nwithout prejudice to appellant's pursuit of redress under Rule 33\r\n\nin  the district  court.  See  United States v.  Boberg, 565 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1059,  1063 (8th  Cir. 1977)  (affirming conviction  in analogous\r\n\ncircumstances \"without  prejudice to  any motion to  the district\r\n\ncourt  for a  new  trial  on  the  grounds  of  newly  discovered\r\n\nevidence\").  Here, however, the vice is more profound; the motion\r\n\nis also substantively infirm.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          By  its express  terms, Rule  33 is  confined  to those\r\n\nsituations in  which a trial has  been had.  In  the court below,\r\n\nappellant  admitted his guilt, abjuring a trial.  A defendant who\r                             \r\n\nenters a guilty plea cannot thereafter use Rule 33 as  a wedge to\r\n\nundo  his acknowledgement  that he  committed  the offense.

He also belatedly moves to remand on the basis of newly discovered evidence--an initiative that requires us to set out for the first time the procedural framework that pertains to a motion brought under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 while a criminal case is pending on direct appeal, and, relatedly, to examine the interplay between Rule 33 and a defendant's guilty plea.  In the end, we affirm the sentence and deny the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant's conviction and sentence stem from a guilty plea rather than a verdict, we derive the pertinent facts from the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), the government's statement served pursuant to D.P.R.Loc.R. 418.2(a),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the transcripts of the change-of-plea and disposition hearings.  See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 107 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about January 14, 1992, appellant arranged to sell one-eighth of a kilogram of crack cocaine (125 grams) to a customer who was, in reality, a government operative.  On the evening of January 15, appellant's courier, Carlos Delgado Rojas (Delgado), told the agent that appellant could not supply the full 125 grams of crack then and there;  instead, he proposed to deliver approximately 80 grams of crack and 45-50 grams of powdered cocaine.  Once the agent agreed to the substitution, the parties consummated the transaction.  Subsequent measurement revealed that Delgado had delivered 85.3 grams of crack and 54.4 grams of cocaine powder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agent expressed an interest in future purchases.  Appellant agreed to sell him a half-kilogram of crack, to be delivered on January 24.  At the appointed time, Delgado, armed, appeared at the delivery site accompanied by Juan Encarnacion Castro (Encarnacion) and a juvenile (G.R.M.).  The men were apprehended and the arresting officers seized a loaded pistol.  The officers also seized three plastic bags containing a white, powdery substance later determined to be sugar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Further investigation revealed that appellant gave the seized firearm to Delgado for protection during the drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury indicted Graciani, Delgado, and Encarnacion on a medley of charges.  Appellant was named in seven counts of the superseding indictment.  He eventually agreed to plead guilty to count 1 (which charged the unlawful distribution of 85.3 grams of crack cocaine on January 15 in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1)) and count 7 (which charged the unlawful carriage of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)).  The plea agreement left the sentence in the court's discretion (subject, of course, to the constraints imposed by the sentencing guidelines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took appellant's plea and commissioned a PSI Report.  The court originally sentenced appellant on July 7, 1992,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> but then reconsidered.  We do not concern ourselves with the withdrawn sentence, but focus upon the second disposition hearing (held on August 2, 1994).  The court attributed to appellant (a) the weight of the crack cocaine actually supplied on January 15, (b) the weight of the powdered cocaine actually supplied on that date, and (c) the weight of the crack cocaine promised for delivery on January 24.  Then, using the Drug Quantity Table, the court set appellant's base offense level (BOL) at 36.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(4) (Drug Quantity Table) (specifying a BOL of 36 for offenses involving \"[a]t least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Cocaine Base\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court added six levels--four for appellant's aggravating role in the offense, see id. Sec. 3B1.1(a), and two for obstruction of justice, see id. Sec. 3C1.1--and subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility, see id. Sec. 3E1.1, bringing the total offense level (TOL) to 39.  Given appellant's status as a first offender, these computations yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 262-327 months.  The court imposed a 280-month incarcerative sentence on count 1, and added a 60-month consecutive sentence on count 7 to accommodate a mandatory minimum.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant advances a myriad of arguments in support of the appeal and the concomitant motion.  We deal with these arguments seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Relevant Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The method of the sentencing guidelines makes the quantity of narcotics attributable to a convicted drug trafficker a key datum in constructing his sentence.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1995);  United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1990).  In this case, appellant castigates the district court for attributing to him a drug quantity in excess of the amount of crack cocaine involved in the count of conviction.  Appellant's fusillade lands well wide of the target.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the guidelines, the aggregate amount of attributed drugs is to be derived from the sum total of all relevant conduct.  The proper figure can only be computed, therefore, by careful consideration of all acts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  \"Relevant conduct is not limited to the counts of conviction\";  rather, it includes both the charged conduct to which a defendant pleads and also any other conduct that qualifies under the relevancy rubric.  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 110;  see also Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15;  Bradley, 917 F.2d at 605;  U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3, comment.  (backg'd).  Specifically--and in direct contradiction to the position asserted by appellant--relevant conduct may include both uncharged conduct and conduct underbracing counts that have been charged and then dropped.  See</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 110;  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  In the usual case, we review a sentencing court's drug quantity determination only for clear error.  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1196;  Bradley, 917 F.2d at 605.   Here, the district court supportably found that the delivery of the crack and powdered cocaine on January 15, and the agreement to sell additional crack cocaine on January 24, were all part of the same course of criminal activity, and, thus, relevant conduct.  We see no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, the fact that the government seized sugar, and never recovered the half-kilogram of crack that appellant promised to supply on January 24, does not sweeten the bottom line by precluding reference to the agreed quantity in the sentencing determination.  Indeed, \"every court to consider the issue, including this one, has concluded that an amount of drugs which a defendant negotiates to sell may be considered as relevant conduct for base offense level purposes even if the drugs are never produced.\"  Bradley, 917 F.2d at 604.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the lower court's drug quantity calculation cannot be faulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Drug Equivalency</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's next protestation, now familiar in all the circuits, criticizes the fact that the guidelines, and specifically U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1, equate one kilogram of crack cocaine to one hundred kilograms of powdered cocaine for sentencing purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We have squarely rejected claims that the conversion formula has a greater impact on African-Americans, and, thus, transgresses the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  See United States v. Singleterry, 29 F.3d 733 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 647, 130 L.Ed.2d 552 (1994).  There, we held the sentencing distinction between crack and powdered cocaine to be constitutional, finding no significantly probative evidence that either Congress or the Sentencing Commission harbored a racial animus or discriminatory intent.  Id. at 741.   We also found a sufficient rational basis for the conversion formula and the resultant sentencing scheme.  See id. at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that, \"[i]n a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels are, for the most part, bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.\"  Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.1995), petition for cert. filed, 63 U.S.L.W. 3819 (U.S. May 2, 1995) (No. 94-1804-CFX).  This principle applies in criminal as well as civil cases.  See, e.g., United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 969, 112 S.Ct. 441, 116 L.Ed.2d 460 (1991);  see also Lacy v. Gardino, 791 F.2d 980, 985 (1st Cir.)  (applying principle in habeas corpus context), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 888, 107 S.Ct. 284, 93 L.Ed.2d 259 (1986).  Because Singleterry is controlling on this issue, we dismiss appellant's claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Other Adjustments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant complains of two upward adjustments to his BOL, one for role in the offense and one for obstruction of justice.  Neither of these complaints need occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Role in the Offense.   U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a) provides for elevating a defendant's BOL by four levels if the district court makes both a status determination (that the defendant was \"an organizer or leader of a criminal activity\") and a scope determination (\"that the defendant's criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\").  We have explicated this proviso in a series of opinions, see, e.g., United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 413-14 (1st Cir.1995);  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 110-12;  United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1011-12 (1st Cir.1990), and it would be pleonastic to rehearse that jurisprudence here.  Two comments should suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the determination of a defendant's role in an offense is necessarily fact-specific.  Appellate courts review such determinations only for clear error.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 18;  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52.   Thus, absent a mistake of law, battles over a defendant's status and over the scope of the criminal enterprise will almost always be won or lost in the district court.  See McDowell, 918 F.2d at 1011 (urging \"that considerable respect be paid to the views of the nisi prius court\" in connection with such findings) (quoting United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir.1990)).  In this case, we see no hint of clear error in the trial court's determination that appellant was the leader of an enterprise of the requisite size.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant strives to avoid clear-error review by isolating a supposed mistake of law.  He says that the court erred in making its scope determination;  there could not have been \"five or more participants\" because only convicted individuals can be counted, and, here, the government indicted no more than three persons (Graciani, Delgado, and Encarnacion).  The argument cannot withstand the mildest scrutiny.  The law is pellucid that a scope determination under section 3B1.1(a) turns not on the number of people convicted, but on the number of persons involved in the criminal activity, whether or not indicted (let alone convicted).  See Dietz, 950 F.2d at 53.   That is, the defendant's BOL may be elevated under section 3B1.1(a) \"as long as the record permits the sentencing court to make 'a specific finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence, which pinpoints [the participants] with enough particularity to give credence to the upward adjustment.' \"  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 113 (quoting McDowell, 918 F.2d at 1011).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record before us clears this hurdle with room to spare.  In addition to Delgado, Encarnacion, G.R.M., and appellant himself, the PSI Report states without contradiction that appellant was the leader and organizer of a band, mostly comprised of juveniles, that was involved, inter alia, in drug trafficking activities.  The numerosity requirement was, therefore, satisfied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 48 (1st Cir.)  (approving similar role-in-the-offense adjustment despite lack of express identification of all co-participants), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 862, 110 S.Ct. 177, 107 L.Ed.2d 133 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice.   The district court increased appellant's BOL by two levels under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  The court predicated the enhancement on a finding that appellant threatened both a confidential informant and a cooperating codefendant in an effort to influence their testimony against him.  Appellant now challenges the adjustment on the basis that he was not charged with obstruction of justice and did not admit to committing the underlying conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This challenge is too little, too late.  Appellant never advanced this objection in the court below.  It is black letter law that, \"in connection with sentencing as in other contexts, ... arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time in an appellate venue.\"  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 55;  accord United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 620 n. 6 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995);  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1202.   Consequently, appellant's challenge is foreclosed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <p>The Eighth Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that a 280-month sentence for the distribution of so paltry an amount of crack cocaine constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in derogation of the Eighth Amendment.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eighth Amendment does not require a precise calibration of crime and punishment in noncapital cases.  See United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 788 (1st Cir.1995).  At most, the Eighth Amendment gives rise to a \"narrow proportionality principle,\" Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 997, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 2702, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (opinion of Kennedy, J.), forbidding only extreme sentences that are significantly disproportionate to the underlying crime.  See id. at 1001, 111 S.Ct. at 2705;  see also Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 288, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 3008, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983);  Saccoccia, 58 F.3d at 788;  United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1239 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1164, 130 L.Ed.2d 1120 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, unsurprising that, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, courts have repulsed Eighth Amendment challenges to lengthy incarcerative sentences in drug cases.  For example, in Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 374, 102 S.Ct. 703, 705-06, 70 L.Ed.2d 556 (1982), the Supreme Court upheld a 40-year prison sentence for possessing nine ounces of marijuana with distributive intent.  More recently, a clear majority of the Justices in Harmelin, while differing on the constitutional status of proportionality review, found insufficient disproportionality to forestall a mandatory sentence of life without parole for possession of over 650 grams of cocaine.  Recent opinions of the courts of appeals are to like effect.  See, e.g., Munoz, 36 F.3d at 1239 (holding that a 240-month sentence meted out for participation in a crack-selling conspiracy involving less than 900 grams of cocaine base accorded with the Harmelin standard);  United States v. Wesley, 990 F.2d 360, 367 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that 100-to-1 sentencing ratio between cocaine and crack cocaine does not violate the Eighth Amendment).  With these cases as a reference point, appellant's sentence cannot successfully be attacked on Eighth Amendment grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E.</p>\n    <p>The Motion To Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the submission of the parties' appellate briefs, appellant's new counsel filed a motion in this court asking us to withhold decision and remand the case to the district court for a hearing on \"newly discovered evidence\" and for a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The motion was accompanied by an affidavit of G.R.M.  (now identified as German R. Maldonado) that purports to absolve appellant of responsibility for the offenses of conviction.  The motion asserts that this \"newly discovered evidence\" warrants the relief requested.  We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, appellant puts the cart before the horse.  Concededly, a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence can be brought while a criminal case is pending on direct appeal.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The question remains, however, whether the court of appeals is the appropriate forum in which a criminal defendant may initiate review of a Rule 33 motion by the district court, and, relatedly, whether a remand is necessary before the district court can entertain a Rule 33 motion.  In general, both parts of this inquiry evoke a negative response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal defendant who aspires to employ Rule 33 while his conviction is pending on direct appeal is not obliged either to file a motion for remand in the court of appeals or to seek any type of leave from that court.  To the contrary, the proper procedure under such circumstances is for the defendant, without further ado, to file his Rule 33 motion in the district court.  See United States v. Phillips, 558 F.2d 363, 363 (6th Cir.1977) (per curiam).  Once the motion has been so docketed, the district court has jurisdiction to entertain it notwithstanding the pendency of the appeal, and may either deny it on the merits or indicate an intention to grant it.  See United States v. Fuentes-Lozano, 580 F.2d 724, 725-26 (5th Cir.1978) (per curiam);  United States v. Frame, 454 F.2d 1136, 1138 (9th Cir.)  (per curiam), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 1794, 32 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972);  see also United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 666 n. 42, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2051 n. 42, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984) (noting correct procedural progression).  If the district court denies the motion, the defendant may take a further appeal;  and if the court proposes to grant the motion, it ordinarily will issue a written statement to that effect so that the defendant, armed with the advisory, may then request an order of remand from the appellate court.  See Frame, 454 F.2d at 1138.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt this protocol, requiring a Rule 33 motion to be filed initially in the district court when a direct appeal of a criminal conviction is pending, for four main reasons. First, the protocol accords with the weight of authority.  See, e.g., Phillips, supra; Frame, supra.   Second, it comports with the discernible intention of the drafters of the 1944 amendments to Rule 33.  See, e.g., Frame, 454 F.2d at 1138 (discussing 1944 amendments).  Third, it coheres with our established procedural paradigm for handling parallel situations on the civil side.  See Toscano v. Chandris, 934 F.2d 383, 386 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that \"if an appeal is pending, a Rule 60(b) motion should first be filed in the trial court, and the district judge, if inclined to allow it, may then request remand\");  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. S.S. Zoe Colocotroni, 601 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir.1979) (ordaining comparable procedure when, during the pendency of an appeal from a final judgment, a party claims to have discovered an exogenous basis for relief from the judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last but not least, principles of sound judicial administration counsel that the district court should be allowed to exercise its discretion to the fullest extent permissible under Rule 33 before the court of appeals becomes enmeshed.  See Frame, 454 F.2d at 1138.   The protocol we adopt today meets this objective.  It takes advantage of the district court's greater familiarity with the case;  it husbands judicial resources, thus eliminating the need for a time-consuming remand in those situations in which the trial court discerns no basis for granting a new trial;  and, finally, it ensures that the merits of the motion for new trial will be heard rapidly, while at the same time keeping the earlier appeal on track.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellant did not follow this protocol in moving to remand, his motion must in all events be denied for procedural reasons.  But, there is an added wrinkle.  If the problem were purely procedural, we would simply deny the motion to remand without prejudice to appellant's pursuit of redress under Rule 33 in the district court.  See United States v. Boberg, 565 F.2d 1059, 1063 (8th Cir.1977) (affirming conviction in analogous circumstances \"without prejudice to any motion to the district court for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence\").  Here, however, the vice is more profound;  the motion is also substantively infirm.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its express terms, Rule 33 is confined to those situations in which a trial has been had.  In the court below, appellant admitted his guilt, abjuring a trial.  A defendant who enters a guilty plea cannot thereafter use Rule 33 as a wedge to undo his acknowledgement that he committed the offense.  See United States v. Collins, 898 F.2d 103, 104 (9th Cir.1989) (per curiam);  United States v. Lambert, 603 F.2d 808, 809 (10th Cir.1979);  Williams v. United States, 290 F.2d 217, 218 (5th Cir.1961) (per curiam);  see also United States v. Prince, 533 F.2d 205, 208 (5th Cir.1976) (applying same principle in bar of proffered Rule 33 motion following plea of nolo contendere);  see generally 3 Charles A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 556, at 313 (2d ed.1982);  cf. United States v. Cordero, 42 F.3d 697, 698 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that a defendant, by entering an unconditional plea of guilty, waives any right to challenge his conviction on the basis of earlier, non-jurisdictional rulings).  In fine, Rule 33 \"applies only to cases in which a trial, either to the court or to a jury, has taken place.\"  Lambert, 603 F.2d at 809.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Because Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 cannot be invoked to undermine a conviction predicated upon a guilty plea, we deny appellant's motion to remand.  To do otherwise would promote an exercise in futility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The local rule provides:</p>\n        <p>In all cases where a Presentence Investigation Report is ordered ... counsel for the government shall file with the Court and serve upon the defendant's counsel, a statement setting forth the government's version of the facts leading to the acceptance of criminal responsibility.</p>\n        <p>D.P.R.Loc.R. 418.2(a).

On the evening of January 15, appellant's courier, Carlos Delgado Rojas (Delgado), told the agent that appellant could not supply the full 125 grams of crack then and there;  instead, he proposed to deliver approximately 80 grams of crack and 45-50 grams of powdered cocaine.  Once the agent agreed to the substitution, the parties consummated the transaction.  Subsequent measurement revealed that Delgado had delivered 85.3 grams of crack and 54.4 grams of cocaine powder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agent expressed an interest in future purchases.  Appellant agreed to sell him a half-kilogram of crack, to be delivered on January 24.  At the appointed time, Delgado, armed, appeared at the delivery site accompanied by Juan Encarnacion Castro (Encarnacion) and a juvenile (G.R.M.).  The men were apprehended and the arresting officers seized a loaded pistol.  The officers also seized three plastic bags containing a white, powdery substance later determined to be sugar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Further investigation revealed that appellant gave the seized firearm to Delgado for protection during the drug transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grand jury indicted Graciani, Delgado, and Encarnacion on a medley of charges.  Appellant was named in seven counts of the superseding indictment.  He eventually agreed to plead guilty to count 1 (which charged the unlawful distribution of 85.3 grams of crack cocaine on January 15 in violation of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(a)(1)) and count 7 (which charged the unlawful carriage of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)).  The plea agreement left the sentence in the court's discretion (subject, of course, to the constraints imposed by the sentencing guidelines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court took appellant's plea and commissioned a PSI Report.  The court originally sentenced appellant on July 7, 1992,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> but then reconsidered.  We do not concern ourselves with the withdrawn sentence, but focus upon the second disposition hearing (held on August 2, 1994).  The court attributed to appellant (a) the weight of the crack cocaine actually supplied on January 15, (b) the weight of the powdered cocaine actually supplied on that date, and (c) the weight of the crack cocaine promised for delivery on January 24.  Then, using the Drug Quantity Table, the court set appellant's base offense level (BOL) at 36.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2D1.1(c)(4) (Drug Quantity Table) (specifying a BOL of 36 for offenses involving \"[a]t least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Cocaine Base\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court added six levels--four for appellant's aggravating role in the offense, see id. Sec. 3B1.1(a), and two for obstruction of justice, see id. Sec. 3C1.1--and subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility, see id. Sec. 3E1.1, bringing the total offense level (TOL) to 39.  Given appellant's status as a first offender, these computations yielded a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of 262-327 months.  The court imposed a 280-month incarcerative sentence on count 1, and added a 60-month consecutive sentence on count 7 to accommodate a mandatory minimum.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1).

In this case, appellant castigates the district court for attributing to him a drug quantity in excess of the amount of crack cocaine involved in the count of conviction.

The proper figure can only be computed, therefore, by careful consideration of all acts \"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 1B1.3(a)(2).  \"Relevant conduct is not limited to the counts of conviction\";  rather, it includes both the charged conduct to which a defendant pleads and also any other conduct that qualifies under the relevancy rubric.

In the usual case, we review a sentencing court's drug quantity determination only for clear error.  See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1196;  Bradley, 917 F.2d at 605.   Here, the district court supportably found that the delivery of the crack and powdered cocaine on January 15, and the agreement to sell additional crack cocaine on January 24, were all part of the same course of criminal activity, and, thus, relevant conduct.

Indeed, \"every court to consider the issue, including this one, has concluded that an amount of drugs which a defendant negotiates to sell may be considered as relevant conduct for base offense level purposes even if the drugs are never produced.\"  Bradley, 917 F.2d at 604.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the lower court's drug quantity calculation cannot be faulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Drug Equivalency</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's next protestation, now familiar in all the circuits, criticizes the fact that the guidelines, and specifically U.S.S.G.

U.S.S.G. Sec. 3B1.1(a) provides for elevating a defendant's BOL by four levels if the district court makes both a status determination (that the defendant was \"an organizer or leader of a criminal activity\") and a scope determination (\"that the defendant's criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\").  We have explicated this proviso in a series of opinions, see, e.g., United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 413-14 (1st Cir.1995);  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 110-12;  United States v.

Two comments should suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the determination of a defendant's role in an offense is necessarily fact-specific.  Appellate courts review such determinations only for clear error.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 18;  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52.   Thus, absent a mistake of law, battles over a defendant's status and over the scope of the criminal enterprise will almost always be won or lost in the district court.  See McDowell, 918 F.2d at 1011 (urging \"that considerable respect be paid to the views of the nisi prius court\" in connection with such findings) (quoting United States v. Ocasio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 333 (1st Cir.1990)).  In this case, we see no hint of clear error in the trial court's determination that appellant was the leader of an enterprise of the requisite size.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant strives to avoid clear-error review by isolating a supposed mistake of law.  He says that the court erred in making its scope determination;  there could not have been \"five or more participants\" because only convicted individuals can be counted, and, here, the government indicted no more than three persons (Graciani, Delgado, and Encarnacion).  The argument cannot withstand the mildest scrutiny.  The law is pellucid that a scope determination under section 3B1.1(a) turns not on the number of people convicted, but on the number of persons involved in the criminal activity, whether or not indicted (let alone convicted).  See Dietz, 950 F.2d at 53.   That is, the defendant's BOL may be elevated under section 3B1.1(a) \"as long as the record permits the sentencing court to make 'a specific finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence, which pinpoints [the participants] with enough particularity to give credence to the upward adjustment.' \"  Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 113 (quoting McDowell, 918 F.2d at 1011).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record before us clears this hurdle with room to spare.  In addition to Delgado, Encarnacion, G.R.M., and appellant himself, the PSI Report states without contradiction that appellant was the leader and organizer of a band, mostly comprised of juveniles, that was involved, inter alia, in drug trafficking activities.

Obstruction of Justice.   The district court increased appellant's BOL by two levels under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1.  The court predicated the enhancement on a finding that appellant threatened both a confidential informant and a cooperating codefendant in an effort to influence their testimony against him.  Appellant now challenges the adjustment on the basis that he was not charged with obstruction of justice and did not admit to committing the underlying conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This challenge is too little, too late.

For example, in Hutto v.

More recently, a clear majority of the Justices in Harmelin, while differing on the constitutional status of proportionality review, found insufficient disproportionality to forestall a mandatory sentence of life without parole for possession of over 650 grams of cocaine.  Recent opinions of the courts of appeals are to like effect.  See, e.g., Munoz, 36 F.3d at 1239 (holding that a 240-month sentence meted out for participation in a crack-selling conspiracy involving less than 900 grams of cocaine base accorded with the Harmelin standard);  United States v.

(now identified as German R. Maldonado) that purports to absolve appellant of responsibility for the offenses of conviction.  The motion asserts that this \"newly discovered evidence\" warrants the relief requested.  We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, appellant puts the cart before the horse.  Concededly, a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence can be brought while a criminal case is pending on direct appeal.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The question remains, however, whether the court of appeals is the appropriate forum in which a criminal defendant may initiate review of a Rule 33 motion by the district court, and, relatedly, whether a remand is necessary before the district court can entertain a Rule 33 motion.  In general, both parts of this inquiry evoke a negative response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal defendant who aspires to employ Rule 33 while his conviction is pending on direct appeal is not obliged either to file a motion for remand in the court of appeals or to seek any type of leave from that court.  To the contrary, the proper procedure under such circumstances is for the defendant, without further ado, to file his Rule 33 motion in the district court.  See United States v. Phillips, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"347005\"><a href=\"/opinion/347005/united-states-v-arthur-lawrence-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span>, 363 (6th Cir.1977) (per curiam).

If the district court denies the motion, the defendant may take a further appeal;  and if the court proposes to grant the motion, it ordinarily will issue a written statement to that effect so that the defendant, armed with the advisory, may then request an order of remand from the appellate court.  See Frame, 454 F.2d at 1138.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt this protocol, requiring a Rule 33 motion to be filed initially in the district court when a direct appeal of a criminal conviction is pending, for four main reasons. First, the protocol accords with the weight of authority.  See, e.g., Phillips, supra; Frame, supra.   Second, it comports with the discernible intention of the drafters of the 1944 amendments to Rule 33.  See, e.g., Frame, 454 F.2d at 1138 (discussing 1944 amendments).  Third, it coheres with our established procedural paradigm for handling parallel situations on the civil side.  See Toscano v. Chandris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562036\"><a href=\"/opinion/562036/frank-toscano-v-chandris-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 386 (1st Cir.1991) (explaining that \"if an appeal is pending, a Rule 60(b) motion should first be filed in the trial court, and the district judge, if inclined to allow it, may then request remand\");  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.

See Frame, 454 F.2d at 1138.   The protocol we adopt today meets this objective.  It takes advantage of the district court's greater familiarity with the case;  it husbands judicial resources, thus eliminating the need for a time-consuming remand in those situations in which the trial court discerns no basis for granting a new trial;  and, finally, it ensures that the merits of the motion for new trial will be heard rapidly, while at the same time keeping the earlier appeal on track.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellant did not follow this protocol in moving to remand, his motion must in all events be denied for procedural reasons.  But, there is an added wrinkle.  If the problem were purely procedural, we would simply deny the motion to remand without prejudice to appellant's pursuit of redress under Rule 33 in the district court.  See United States v. Boberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350718\"><a href=\"/opinion/350718/united-states-v-ernest-b-boberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span>, 1063 (8th Cir.1977) (affirming conviction in analogous circumstances \"without prejudice to any motion to the district court for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence\").
