George A.

Upon careful review of the briefs and\n\nthe record, we conclude that the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying the appellant's motion for\n\nreconsideration and motion to amend his complaint to comply\n\nwith Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1.                Insofar as the motion for\n\nreconsideration sought relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e),\n\ndenial was required because the motion was untimely.                   See\n\nVargas v. Gonzalez, 926 F.2d 916, 917 (1st Cir. 1992).                 The\n\nmotion for reconsideration stated no grounds for relief\n\ncognizable under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).              See Feinstein v.\n\nMoses, 951 F.2d 16, 19 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1991)(motions which\n\nseek to set aside judgment as legally erroneous are properly\n\ntreated under Rule 59(e)).              Absent a reopened judgment,\n\ndenial of leave to amend was wholly proper.                  See, e.g.,\n\nMirpuri v. Act Mfg., Inc., 212 F.3d 624, 628 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)(\"'[A] district court cannot allow an amended pleading\n\nwhere   a   final   judgment      has    been   rendered    unless    that\n\njudgment    is    first   set     aside    or   vacated    pursuant     to\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 59 or 60.'\")(citation omitted).
