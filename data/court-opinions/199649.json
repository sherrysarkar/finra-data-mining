Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n               and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for\nappellant.\n     Peter E. Papps, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nGretchen Leah Witt, United States Attorney, and Jean B. Weld,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 25, 2001\n\f\f            STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.             Defendant Richard Lewko\n\nchallenges his convictions under the Child Support Recovery Act\n\nof 1992 (CSRA), 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(1), and the Deadbeat Parents\n\nPunishment Act of 1998 (DPPA), 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(3). In this\n\nappeal,    Lewko   argues   that,      in    light    of   United   States    v.\n\nMorrison,    529 U.S. 598 (2000), this Court should reconsider its\n\nruling in United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), reh'g en banc denied, 110 F.3d 132 (1st Cir. 1997), which\n\nrejected a Commerce Clause challenge to the CSRA, and likewise\n\nshould    strike   down   the   DPPA    as   unconstitutional.        For    the\n\nfollowing reasons, we find the defendant's arguments to be\n\nwithout merit and affirm his convictions.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            In 1982, Richard Lewko married Roxanne Medina during\n\na mass marriage ceremony conducted at Madison Square Garden in\n\nNew York City by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.              Four years later, the\n\ncouple moved to Derry, New Hampshire.           In 1997, Medina initiated\n\ndivorce proceedings against Lewko in Rockingham Superior Court,\n\nand was awarded custody of their three minor children.                  Lewko\n\nwas ordered to pay all household expenses, and child support of\n\n$397 per month divided into weekly payments.               On June 23, 1997,\n\nthe child support order was amended to $65 per week, and an\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fadditional $30 per week to pay a then-outstanding arrearage of\n\n$794.\n\n            Subsequently, Lewko filed an affidavit with the marital\n\nmaster in the divorce case, stating that he had moved to Boston,\n\nthat he had voluntarily quit his job, and that he could only\n\nafford to pay $75 per week in child support.1               He also claimed\n\nthat, unless the court granted him custody of the children, he\n\nwould not make any child support payments.               Following a hearing\n\non August 12, 1997, the marital master found Lewko in contempt\n\nfor   failure    to    make   mortgage    and    child    support   payments.\n\nAlthough the August 1997 finding was purged after Lewko made a\n\nlump-sum payment, by October 1997, Lewko had fallen into arrears\n\nof $19,659.      Also, as a result of Lewko's failure to make his\n\ncourt-ordered         payments,   the     bank    commenced     foreclosure\n\nproceedings on the family homestead where Medina lived with the\n\nchildren.       Because of his continued flaunting of the court\n\norder, Lewko was incarcerated twelve days for contempt and\n\nordered to pay $2,100 in arrearage.              This payment was made by\n\nchurch members on his behalf.           In March 1998, Lewko was ordered\n\nto appear for another contempt hearing for his ongoing failure\n\nto make support payments, but Medina requested that the contempt\n\n\n\n      1   Prior to Medina's filing for divorce, the defendant had\nworked continuously at an income in excess of $100,000 per year.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fmotion be dismissed after Lewko assured her that he would get a\n\njob   and    start         to    “help     out.”     However,   as     with      previous\n\nassurances, Lewko reneged on this promise.\n\n             After the divorce was finalized on July 30, 1998,\n\nMedina turned to the New Hampshire Division of Child Support\n\nServices for assistance in forcing Lewko to make his court-\n\nordered payments.               Because Lewko was no longer residing in New\n\nHampshire, neither the arrest warrant nor the contempt capias\n\nissued      by       the    New       Hampshire     courts   was     to    any    avail.\n\nUltimately, the case was turned over to the U.S. Department of\n\nHealth and Human Services.                  A federal arrest warrant was issued\n\non March 8, 2000, and was executed on Lewko in Landover Hills,\n\nMaryland, on March 23, 2000.\n\n             Defendant was indicted on three counts: (1) willfully\n\nand unlawfully failing to pay a support obligation of a state\n\ncourt that has been outstanding for over two years and is\n\ngreater than $10,000, 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(3); (2) moving and\n\ntraveling in interstate and foreign                   commerce with the intent to\n\nevade a state court-ordered support obligation,                           18 U.S.C. §\n\n228(a)(2); and (3) willfully and unlawfully failing to pay a\n\nsupport obligation of a state court that has been outstanding\n\nfor   over       a   year       and   is   greater   than    $5,000,      18   U.S.C.   §\n\n228(a)(1).           Lewko filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss Counts 1\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\fand 3 as unconstitutional exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause2\n\nauthority.    The district court denied the motion, but, upon the\n\nconclusion of the government's case, dismissed Count 2 of the\n\nindictment, finding that there was no evidence to support the\n\nallegation that Lewko had crossed state lines for the purpose of\n\nevading his support obligations.3     Lewko was convicted by a jury\n\non Counts 1 and 3, and received concurrent sentences of five\n\nyears probation with twelve months home incarceration, and was\n\nordered to pay $56,762.23 in arrearage as restitution.4\n\n                                II.\n\n            In his appeal, Lewko argues that this Court should\n\nrevisit United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)    (upholding CSRA against Commerce Clause challenge), reh'g\n\nen banc denied, 110 F.3d 132 (1st Cir. 1997), and strike down\n\nthe CSRA and the DPPA in light of the Supreme Court's most\n\nrecent elucidation of Commerce Clause jurisprudence in United\n\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), which invalidated a\n\n\n\n     2      U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 3.\n     3    Consequently, defendant does not challenge the\nconstitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(2) in this appeal.\n     4    The CSRA made the failure to pay a court-ordered child\nsupport obligation a Class B misdemeanor offense, punishable by\nup to six months imprisonment. The DPPA increased the offense\nlevel to a Class E felony, with a maximum possible term of two\nyears imprisonment.\n\n                                -6-\n\ffederal statute providing a civil remedy to female victims of\n\ngender-motivated           violence          as     insufficiently           related       to\n\ninterstate        commerce       to     justify        Congressional            regulation.\n\nSpecifically,        Lewko        asserts         that      Congress       has     violated\n\nfundamental principles of federalism by encroaching on an area\n\nreserved     to    the    states       --    namely,       family   law     and    domestic\n\nrelations     --    through       the       enactment      of    these     child   support\n\ncollection provisions.             Accordingly, he asks this Court, first,\n\nto   overrule        the       prior        panel's      decision        affirming        the\n\nconstitutionality of the CSRA, and, second, to invalidate the\n\nDPPA.\n\n             According to the “law of the circuit” doctrine, a prior\n\npanel   decision         shall    not       be    disturbed       “absent       either    the\n\noccurrence of a controlling intervening event (e.g., a Supreme\n\nCourt opinion on the point; a ruling of the circuit, sitting en\n\nbanc;   or    a    statutory          overruling)          or,    in     extremely       rare\n\ncircumstances, where non-controlling but persuasive case law\n\nsuggests such a course.”                United States v. Chhien, No. 00-2230,\n\n2001 WL 1097766, at *8 (1st Cir. Sept. 24, 2001).                                     Lewko\n\nmaintains     that       the     Supreme         Court's      decision     in     Morrison,\n\nlimiting     the    ability       of    Congress         to     regulate    non-economic\n\nactivity that may affect interstate commerce, was one such\n\nintervening event.\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\f         Lewko argues that the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Faasse, 227 F.3d 660 (6th Cir. 2000), reh'g en\n\nbanc granted, opinion vacated by 234 F.3d 312 (6th Cir. 2000),\n\noffered “non-controlling but persuasive case law” that would\n\njustify revisiting    Bongiorno.   In   Faasse, Judge Batchelder,\n\nwriting for a unanimous panel, ruled that the CSRA fell outside\n\nthe scope of Congress' Commerce Clause authority because these\n\nprovisions, which allow prosecutions in cases where the deadbeat\n\nparent resides in a different state from the child, lacked a\n\nsufficient   nexus    with   interstate    commerce   to   sustain\n\njurisdiction.   Lewko maintains that the Bongiorno panel would\n\nhave reached a different conclusion had it had the benefit of\n\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Morrison and Judge Batchelder's\n\nanalysis in Faasse.   See United States v. Royal, 174 F.3d 1, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (noting that “authority that postdates the\n\noriginal decision, although not directly controlling, [may]\n\nnevertheless offer[] a sound reason for believing that the\n\nformer panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its\n\ncollective mind”) (quoting Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45\n\nF.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995)).\n\n         Prior to the oral argument in this case, the Sixth\n\nCircuit, sitting en banc, reversed the decision of the Faasse\n\npanel, and sustained the CSRA against any challenge raised\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fpursuant to the Commerce Clause.               United States v. Faasse, No.\n\n98-2337, 2001 WL 1058237 (6th Cir. Sept. 14, 2001) (en banc).\n\nNotwithstanding the en banc reversal, Lewko still maintains that\n\nthe Morrison opinion standing alone offers a sufficient basis\n\nfor this Court to revisit the decision of the Bongiorno panel.\n\nWe are not convinced.\n\n                                        III.\n\n            We review the decisions of district courts regarding\n\nchallenges to a statute's constitutionality de novo.                See United\n\nStates v.       Marenghi, 109 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1997).                   The\n\nSupreme Court has “identified three broad categories of activity\n\nthat   Congress       may   regulate    under    its    commerce   power”:   (1)\n\nCongress may regulate the use of the “channels of interstate\n\ncommerce;”      (2)    Congress   may    regulate       “instrumentalities    of\n\ninterstate commerce or things in interstate commerce,” even if\n\nthe    threat    may    come   only    from     intrastate     activities;   (3)\n\nCongress may regulate “those activities having a substantial\n\nrelation to interstate commerce. . . .”                 Morrison, 529 U.S. at\n\n608-09 (quoting United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558-59\n\n(1995)).     When Congress legislates pursuant to a valid exercise\n\nof its Commerce Clause authority, we scrutinize the enactment\n\naccording to rational basis review.                    See   Hodel v.   Virginia\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fSurface Mining & Reclamation Ass'n, Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 276\n\n(1981).\n\n            The Morrison court deployed the three-prong test from\n\nLopez to determine whether Congress had exceeded its power under\n\nthe Commerce Clause when enacting the Violence Against Women Act\n\n(VAWA), 42 U.S.C. § 13981.          As important as Morrison is to our\n\nunderstanding of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is equally\n\nimportant to recognize from the outset what Morrison did not\n\npurport to address.        Early in its opinion, the Supreme Court\n\nacknowledged that neither prong one nor prong two of the Lopez\n\nCommerce Clause test was implicated by the statute challenged in\n\nMorrison.       Rather, the Court focused on whether VAWA could\n\nsatisfy the third prong of the Lopez inquiry, otherwise known as\n\nthe “substantial effects” test.5            This fact alone satisfies us\n\nthat Morrison provides no basis for overruling Bongiorno, where\n\nwe   affirmed     the   validity   of   the   CSRA   as    a    constitutional\n\nexercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority according to the\n\nsecond    prong    of   Lopez,     finding    that   the       statute   was   a\n\n\n      5   See Morrison, 529 U.S. at 609 (“Petitioners do not\ncontend that these cases fall within either of the first two of\nthese categories of Commerce Clause regulation. They seek to\nsustain § 13981 as a regulation of activity that substantially\naffects interstate commerce. Given § 13981's focus on\ngender-motivated violence wherever it occurs (rather than\nviolence directed at the instrumentalities of interstate\ncommerce, interstate markets, or things or persons in interstate\ncommerce), we agree that this is the proper inquiry.”).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fpermissible regulation of a “thing” in commerce.            Bongiorno, 106\n\nF.3d at 1033.\n\n            Nevertheless, we believe that it would be useful to\n\nexamine       the      defendant's          arguments   regarding      the\n\nconstitutionality of the CSRA and the DPPA on the merits, rather\n\nthan simply to rely on principles of stare decisis, or “law of\n\nthe circuit.”       As we explain infra, these statutory provisions\n\nare undoubtedly      constitutional exercises of Congress' Commerce\n\nClause authority under two of the prongs of Lopez.\n\n            The CSRA and the DPPA easily satisfy the second prong\n\nof Lopez.    In order for either of these statutory provisions to\n\nbe triggered, the non-paying parent must reside in a different\n\nstate than the child owed support, meaning that the payment will\n\nnecessarily need to cross state lines in order to reach the\n\nintended recipient.         With that in mind, we have no difficulty\n\nfinding     that    “[a]n   interstate      court-ordered   child   support\n\npayment is clearly a 'thing' in interstate commerce.”               Faasse,\n\n2001 WL 1058237, at *9; see also United States v. Johnson, 114\n\nF.3d 476, 480 (4th Cir. 1997); United States v. Bailey, 115 F.3d\n\n1222, 1229 (5th Cir. 1997); United States v. Crawford, 115 F.3d\n\n1397, 1400 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Sage, 92 F.3d 101,\n\n107 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v. Mussari, 95 F.3d 787, 790\n\n(9th Cir. 1996).\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            At oral argument, Lewko acknowledged not only that a\n\nchild support payment is a “thing,” but also that this thing\n\nmust cross state lines in order to satisfy the court order.\n\nDespite these concessions, however, he still maintains that a\n\nchild support payment is not a “thing in interstate commerce,”\n\nrelying primarily on Judge Smith's dissent in Bailey.                      See 115\n\nF.3d at 1236-37 (Smith, J., dissenting).                First, he argues that\n\na child support payment is a wholly different type of “thing”\n\nbecause it emanates from family law.                  Specifically, defendant\n\nasserts that a child support order is unique because it is a\n\nunilateral,      rather     than    a   reciprocal,          obligation.      This\n\ncharacterization, however, is not entirely accurate.                       Although\n\nthe   non-custodial        parent   has    a   duty     to    provide   financial\n\nsupport, the custodial parent must also demonstrate that he or\n\nshe is using that money for the care and upbringing of the\n\nchild.    Regardless, a child support obligation arising from a\n\ncourt order, whether family court or another civil court, is a\n\ndebt that may be enforced through civil remedies.                    See Mussari,\n\n95 F.3d at 790 (“True, the court order arises from the family\n\nrelation.     Once in place, the order creates a debt.                  Like any\n\nother    debt,   it   is    a   thing     of   value,    one    of   millions    of\n\nobligations that make up the stream of commerce subject to\n\ncongressional control.”); see also Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at 1032\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f(holding         that    state-court-imposed         child       support      orders    are\n\n“functionally equivalent to interstate contracts” and rejecting\n\nidea    that       child     support       payment    obligations            are   somehow\n\n“different”)            (citing    Sage,    92     F.3d    at    106).         Therefore,\n\ndefendant's attempt to carve out child support payments from\n\nother types of interstate monetary transfers in satisfaction of\n\na financial obligation fails.\n\n                 Second, defendant insists that this Court should limit\n\nthe application of Bongiorno to cases where a party has engaged\n\nin some affirmative activity, such as absconding across state\n\nlines       to   avoid     their    support      obligation,       as    covered       by    §\n\n228(a)(2).         Lewko characterizes his crime, on the other hand, as\n\none    of    omission,       in    that    he    refused    to    put    a    payment       in\n\ninterstate commerce.              However, the Supreme Court has refused to\n\ndraw a categorical distinction between crimes of omission and\n\ncommission. See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United\n\nStates, 379 U.S. 241, 257-58 (1964); United States v. Green, 350\n\nU.S. 415, 420 (1956); United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 115\n\n(1941); Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 68\n\n(1911).      Defendant attempts to distinguish these cases by noting\n\nthat Congress has historically engaged in regulation of labor\n\nrelations (Darby) and the practices of common carriers such as\n\nhotels (Heart of Atlanta).                  Likewise, defendant argues, the\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fHobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, (Green) and the Sherman Antitrust\n\nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 1, 2, (Standard Oil) explicitly target conduct\n\nfalling within the conventional understanding of “commerce.”\n\nThe DPPA and the CSRA, on the other hand, encroach on the\n\ntraditionally     local    concerns        of    family    law     and    domestic\n\nrelations, and therefore should not be viewed with the same\n\ndeference.\n\n           This argument also misses the mark.               Neither the CSRA\n\nnor the DPPA have either the purpose or effect of establishing\n\na national, uniform “family law.”                 They address neither the\n\ndegree (i.e., amount) nor duty of support owed (i.e., when a\n\nduty of support shall be triggered or terminated).                   Rather, the\n\nprovisions   of    these   two     acts    are    designed    to    protect      the\n\nintegrity of state court judgments, in light of the fact that\n\nparties   attempting       to     enforce       these     court    orders       face\n\nsignificant difficulties when the non-paying party flees the\n\nordering jurisdiction.          See Bailey, 115 F.3d at 1230 (“Congress\n\ndid not impose the underlying obligation to pay child support.\n\nThe CSRA applies only when the defendant has violated a state\n\ncourt order imposing upon him that obligation.”); see also\n\nFaasse,   2001    WL   1058237,    at     *8    (rejecting   claim       that   CSRA\n\nattempts to create “federal family law”).                     The defendant's\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\finvocation of the uniquely local concerns of family law are\n\ninapposite and do not bear the weight of his argument.\n\n           A slightly more refined version of defendant's argument\n\nwould posit that a child support payment is a thing, but it is\n\nnot significant enough to implicate interstate commerce, because\n\nit is merely ancillary to a family court judgment.                     As a\n\npreliminary matter, we note that there is no “materiality”\n\nrequirement embedded in Lopez's prong two analysis.                 Even if\n\nthere were, however, the statutes on their face incorporate a\n\n“materiality” requirement by establishing threshold amounts of\n\n$5,000 (CSRA) and $10,000 (DPPA) before federal enforcement\n\nmechanisms become available.            As we have already explained\n\nabove,   the    fact   that   the   obligation   stems   from   a   judgment\n\narising out of a domestic dispute is insignificant.             Therefore,\n\nprong two is clearly satisfied.\n\n           Under prong one of Lopez, Congress may also regulate\n\nthe use of the “channels of interstate commerce.”               Just as we\n\nhave previously determined that the payment is a “thing in\n\ninterstate commerce,” we similarly have no trouble finding that\n\nthe   payment    must    travel     through   “channels    of   interstate\n\ncommerce” to reach the deserving party, and therefore falls\n\nwithin the purview of Congress' Commerce Clause authority.

In this appeal, Lewko argues that, in light of United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), this Court should reconsider its ruling in United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027 (1st Cir. 1997), reh'g en banc denied, 110 F.3d 132 (1st Cir. 1997), which rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to the CSRA, and likewise should strike down the DPPA as unconstitutional. For the following reasons, we find the defendant's arguments to be without merit and affirm his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, Richard Lewko married Roxanne Medina during a mass marriage ceremony conducted at Madison Square Garden in New York City by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Four years later, the couple moved to Derry, New Hampshire. In 1997, Medina initiated divorce proceedings against Lewko in Rockingham Superior Court, and was awarded custody of their three minor children. Lewko was ordered to pay all household expenses, and child support of $397 per month divided into weekly payments. On June 23, 1997, the child support order was amended to $65 per week, and an additional $30 per week to pay a then-outstanding arrearage of $794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Lewko filed an affidavit with the marital master in the divorce case, stating that he had moved to Boston, that he had voluntarily quit his job, and that he could only afford to pay $75 per week in child support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He also claimed that, unless the court granted him custody of the children, he would not make any child support payments. Following a hearing on August 12, 1997, the marital master found Lewko in contempt for failure to make mortgage and child support payments. Although the August 1997 finding was purged after Lewko made a lump-sum payment, by October 1997, Lewko had fallen into arrears of $19,659. Also, as a result of Lewko's failure to make his court-ordered payments, the bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the family homestead where Medina lived with the children. Because of his continued flaunting of the court order, Lewko was incarcerated twelve days for contempt and ordered to pay $2,100 in arrearage. This payment was made by church members on his behalf. In March 1998, Lewko was ordered to appear for another contempt hearing for his ongoing failure to make support payments, but Medina requested that the contempt motion be dismissed after Lewko assured her that he would get a job and start to \"help out.\" However, as with previous assurances, Lewko reneged on this promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the divorce was finalized on July 30, 1998, Medina turned to the New Hampshire Division of Child Support Services for assistance in forcing Lewko to make his court-ordered payments. Because Lewko was no longer residing in New Hampshire, neither the arrest warrant nor the contempt capias issued by the New Hampshire courts was to any avail. Ultimately, the case was turned over to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A federal arrest warrant was issued on March 8, 2000, and was executed on Lewko in Landover Hills, Maryland, on March 23, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was indicted on three counts: (1) willfully and unlawfully failing to pay a support obligation of a state court that has been outstanding for over two years and is greater than $10,000, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228(a)(3); (2) moving and traveling in interstate and foreign commerce with the intent to evade a state court-ordered support obligation, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228(a)(2); and (3) willfully and unlawfully failing to pay a support obligation of a state court that has been outstanding for over a year and is greater than $5,000, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228(a)(1). Lewko filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 as unconstitutional exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> authority. The district court denied the motion, but, upon the conclusion of the government's case, dismissed Count 2 of the indictment, finding that there was no evidence to support the allegation that Lewko had crossed state lines for the purpose of evading his support obligations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Lewko was convicted by a jury on Counts 1 and 3, and received concurrent sentences of five years probation with twelve months home incarceration, and was ordered to pay $56,762.23 in arrearage as restitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his appeal, Lewko argues that this Court should revisit United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027 (1st Cir. 1997) (upholding CSRA against Commerce Clause challenge), reh'g en banc denied, 110 F.3d 132 (1st Cir. 1997), and strike down the CSRA and the DPPA in light of the Supreme Court's most recent elucidation of Commerce Clause jurisprudence in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), which invalidated a federal statute providing a civil remedy to female victims of gender-motivated violence as insufficiently related to interstate commerce to justify Congressional regulation. Specifically, Lewko asserts that Congress has violated fundamental principles of federalism by encroaching on an area reserved to the states -- namely, family law and domestic relations -- through the enactment of these child support collection provisions. Accordingly, he asks this Court, first, to overrule the prior panel's decision affirming the constitutionality of the CSRA, and, second, to invalidate the DPPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the \"law of the circuit\" doctrine, a prior panel decision shall not be disturbed \"absent either the occurrence of a controlling intervening event (e.g., a Supreme Court opinion on the point; a ruling of the circuit, sitting en banc; or a statutory overruling) or, in extremely rare circumstances, where non-controlling but persuasive case law suggests such a course.\" United States v. Chhien, No. 00-2230, 266 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. Sept. 24, 2001). Lewko maintains that the Supreme Court's decision in Morrison, limiting the ability of Congress to regulate non-economic activity that may affect interstate commerce, was one such intervening event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewko argues that the Sixth Circuit's decision in United States v. Faasse, 227 F.3d 660 (6th Cir. 2000), reh'g en banc granted, opinion vacated by 234 F.3d 312 (6th Cir. 2000), offered \"non-controlling but persuasive case law\" that would justify revisiting Bongiorno. In Faasse, Judge Batchelder, writing for a unanimous panel, ruled that the CSRA fell outside the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause authority because these provisions, which allow prosecutions in cases where the deadbeat parent resides in a different state from the child, lacked a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to sustain jurisdiction. Lewko maintains that the Bongiorno panel would have reached a different conclusion had it had the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision in Morrison and Judge Batchelder's analysis in Faasse. See United States v. Royal, 174 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, [may] nevertheless offer[] a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind\") (quoting Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the oral argument in this case, the Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed the decision of the Faasse panel, and sustained the CSRA against any challenge raised pursuant to the Commerce Clause. United States v. Faasse, No. 98-2337, 265 F.3d 475 (6th Cir. Sept. 14, 2001) (en banc). Notwithstanding the en banc reversal, Lewko still maintains that the Morrison opinion standing alone offers a sufficient basis for this Court to revisit the decision of the Bongiorno panel. We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the decisions of district courts regarding challenges to a statute's constitutionality de novo. See United States v. Marenghi, 109 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1997). The Supreme Court has \"identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power\": (1) Congress may regulate the use of the \"channels of interstate commerce;\" (2) Congress may regulate \"instrumentalities of interstate commerce or things in interstate commerce,\" even if the threat may come only from intrastate activities; (3) Congress may regulate \"those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce. . . .\" Morrison, 529 U.S. at 608-09 (quoting United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558-59 (1995)). When Congress legislates pursuant to a valid exercise of its Commerce Clause authority, we scrutinize the enactment according to rational basis review. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass'n, Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 276 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Morrison court deployed the three-prong test from Lopez to determine whether Congress had exceeded its power under the Commerce Clause when enacting the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 13981. As important as Morrison is to our understanding of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is equally important to recognize from the outset what Morrison did not purport to address. Early in its opinion, the Supreme Court acknowledged that neither prong one nor prong two of the Lopez Commerce Clause test was implicated by the statute challenged in Morrison. Rather, the Court focused on whether VAWA could satisfy the third prong of the Lopez inquiry, otherwise known as the \"substantial effects\" test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This fact alone satisfies us that Morrison provides no basis for overruling Bongiorno, where we affirmed the validity of the CSRA as a constitutional exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority according to the second prong of Lopez, finding that the statute was a permissible regulation of a \"thing\" in commerce. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at 1033.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we believe that it would be useful to examine the defendant's arguments regarding the constitutionality of the CSRA and the DPPA on the merits, rather than simply to rely on principles of stare decisis, or \"law of the circuit.\" As we explain infra, these statutory provisions are undoubtedly constitutional exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause authority under two of the prongs of Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CSRA and the DPPA easily satisfy the second prong of Lopez. In order for either of these statutory provisions to be triggered, the non-paying parent must reside in a different state than the child owed support, meaning that the payment will necessarily need to cross state lines in order to reach the intended recipient. With that in mind, we have no difficulty finding that \"[a]n interstate court-ordered child support payment is clearly a 'thing' in interstate commerce.\" Faasse, 265 F.3d at 489; see also United States v. Johnson, 114 F.3d 476, 480 (4th Cir. 1997); United States v. Bailey, 115 F.3d 1222, 1229 (5th Cir. 1997); United States v. Crawford, 115 F.3d 1397, 1400 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Sage, 92 F.3d 101, 107 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v. Mussari, 95 F.3d 787, 790 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Lewko acknowledged not only that a child support payment is a \"thing,\" but also that this thing must cross state lines in order to satisfy the court order. Despite these concessions, however, he still maintains that a child support payment is not a \"thing in interstate commerce,\" relying primarily on Judge Smith's dissent in Bailey. See 115 F.3d at 1236-37 (Smith, J., dissenting). First, he argues that a child support payment is a wholly different type of \"thing\" because it emanates from family law. Specifically, defendant asserts that a child support order is unique because it is a unilateral, rather than a reciprocal, obligation. This characterization, however, is not entirely accurate. Although the non-custodial parent has a duty to provide financial support, the custodial parent must also demonstrate that he or she is using that money for the care and upbringing of the child. Regardless, a child support obligation arising from a court order, whether family court or another civil court, is a debt that may be enforced through civil remedies. See Mussari, 95 F.3d at 790 (\"True, the court order arises from the family relation. Once in place, the order creates a debt. Like any other debt, it is a thing of value, one of millions of obligations that make up the stream of commerce subject to congressional control.\"); see also Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at 1032 (holding that state-court-imposed child support orders are \"functionally equivalent to interstate contracts\" and rejecting idea that child support payment obligations are somehow \"different\") (citing Sage, 92 F.3d at 106). Therefore, defendant's attempt to carve out child support payments from other types of interstate monetary transfers in satisfaction of a financial obligation fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendant insists that this Court should limit the application of Bongiorno to cases where a party has engaged in some affirmative activity, such as absconding across state lines to avoid their support obligation, as covered by &#167; 228(a)(2). Lewko characterizes his crime, on the other hand, as one of omission, in that he refused to put a payment in interstate commerce. However, the Supreme Court has refused to draw a categorical distinction between crimes of omission and commission. See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 257-58 (1964); United States v. Green, 350 U.S. 415, 420 (1956); United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 115 (1941); Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 68 (1911). Defendant attempts to distinguish these cases by noting that Congress has historically engaged in regulation of labor relations (Darby) and the practices of common carriers such as hotels (Heart of Atlanta). Likewise, defendant argues, the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951, (Green) and the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1, 2, (Standard Oil) explicitly target conduct falling within the conventional understanding of \"commerce.\" The DPPA and the CSRA, on the other hand, encroach on the traditionally local concerns of family law and domestic relations, and therefore should not be viewed with the same deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument also misses the mark. Neither the CSRA nor the DPPA have either the purpose or effect of establishing a national, uniform \"family law.\" They address neither the degree (i.e., amount) nor duty of support owed (i.e., when a duty of support shall be triggered or terminated). Rather, the provisions of these two acts are designed to protect the integrity of state court judgments, in light of the fact that parties attempting to enforce these court orders face significant difficulties when the non-paying party flees the ordering jurisdiction. See Bailey, 115 F.3d at 1230 (\"Congress did not impose the underlying obligation to pay child support. The CSRA applies only when the defendant has violated a state court order imposing upon him that obligation.\"); see also Faasse, 265 F.3d at 488 (rejecting claim that CSRA attempts to create \"federal family law\"). The defendant's invocation of the uniquely local concerns of family law are inapposite and do not bear the weight of his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A slightly more refined version of defendant's argument would posit that a child support payment is a thing, but it is not significant enough to implicate interstate commerce, because it is merely ancillary to a family court judgment. As a preliminary matter, we note that there is no \"materiality\" requirement embedded in Lopez's prong two analysis. Even if there were, however, the statutes on their face incorporate a \"materiality\" requirement by establishing threshold amounts of $5,000 (CSRA) and $10,000 (DPPA) before federal enforcement mechanisms become available. As we have already explained above, the fact that the obligation stems from a judgment arising out of a domestic dispute is insignificant. Therefore, prong two is clearly satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under prong one of Lopez, Congress may also regulate the use of the \"channels of interstate commerce.\" Just as we have previously determined that the payment is a \"thing in interstate commerce,\" we similarly have no trouble finding that the payment must travel through \"channels of interstate commerce\" to reach the deserving party, and therefore falls within the purview of Congress' Commerce Clause authority. See Bailey, 115 F.3d at 1227. Whether transmitted via wire transfer or through the mails, these payments necessarily change hands as a result of travel through interstate commercial channels.

Sun Myung Moon. Four years later, the couple moved to Derry, New Hampshire. In 1997, Medina initiated divorce proceedings against Lewko in Rockingham Superior Court, and was awarded custody of their three minor children. Lewko was ordered to pay all household expenses, and child support of $397 per month divided into weekly payments. On June 23, 1997, the child support order was amended to $65 per week, and an additional $30 per week to pay a then-outstanding arrearage of $794.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Lewko filed an affidavit with the marital master in the divorce case, stating that he had moved to Boston, that he had voluntarily quit his job, and that he could only afford to pay $75 per week in child support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He also claimed that, unless the court granted him custody of the children, he would not make any child support payments. Following a hearing on August 12, 1997, the marital master found Lewko in contempt for failure to make mortgage and child support payments. Although the August 1997 finding was purged after Lewko made a lump-sum payment, by October 1997, Lewko had fallen into arrears of $19,659. Also, as a result of Lewko's failure to make his court-ordered payments, the bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on the family homestead where Medina lived with the children. Because of his continued flaunting of the court order, Lewko was incarcerated twelve days for contempt and ordered to pay $2,100 in arrearage. This payment was made by church members on his behalf. In March 1998, Lewko was ordered to appear for another contempt hearing for his ongoing failure to make support payments, but Medina requested that the contempt motion be dismissed after Lewko assured her that he would get a job and start to \"help out.\" However, as with previous assurances, Lewko reneged on this promise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the divorce was finalized on July 30, 1998, Medina turned to the New Hampshire Division of Child Support Services for assistance in forcing Lewko to make his court-ordered payments. Because Lewko was no longer residing in New Hampshire, neither the arrest warrant nor the contempt capias issued by the New Hampshire courts was to any avail. Ultimately, the case was turned over to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A federal arrest warrant was issued on March 8, 2000, and was executed on Lewko in Landover Hills, Maryland, on March 23, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was indicted on three counts: (1) willfully and unlawfully failing to pay a support obligation of a state court that has been outstanding for over two years and is greater than $10,000, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228(a)(3); (2) moving and traveling in interstate and foreign commerce with the intent to evade a state court-ordered support obligation, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228(a)(2); and (3) willfully and unlawfully failing to pay a support obligation of a state court that has been outstanding for over a year and is greater than $5,000, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228(a)(1). Lewko filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss Counts 1 and 3 as unconstitutional exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> authority. The district court denied the motion, but, upon the conclusion of the government's case, dismissed Count 2 of the indictment, finding that there was no evidence to support the allegation that Lewko had crossed state lines for the purpose of evading his support obligations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Lewko was convicted by a jury on Counts 1 and 3, and received concurrent sentences of five years probation with twelve months home incarceration, and was ordered to pay $56,762.23 in arrearage as restitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his appeal, Lewko argues that this Court should revisit United States v.

Specifically, Lewko asserts that Congress has violated fundamental principles of federalism by encroaching on an area reserved to the states -- namely, family law and domestic relations -- through the enactment of these child support collection provisions. Accordingly, he asks this Court, first, to overrule the prior panel's decision affirming the constitutionality of the CSRA, and, second, to invalidate the DPPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the \"law of the circuit\" doctrine, a prior panel decision shall not be disturbed \"absent either the occurrence of a controlling intervening event (e.g., a Supreme Court opinion on the point; a ruling of the circuit, sitting en banc; or a statutory overruling) or, in extremely rare circumstances, where non-controlling but persuasive case law suggests such a course.\" United States v.

In Faasse, Judge Batchelder, writing for a unanimous panel, ruled that the CSRA fell outside the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause authority because these provisions, which allow prosecutions in cases where the deadbeat parent resides in a different state from the child, lacked a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to sustain jurisdiction. Lewko maintains that the Bongiorno panel would have reached a different conclusion had it had the benefit of the Supreme Court's decision in Morrison and Judge Batchelder's analysis in Faasse.

The Supreme Court has \"identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power\": (1) Congress may regulate the use of the \"channels of interstate commerce;\" (2) Congress may regulate \"instrumentalities of interstate commerce or things in interstate commerce,\" even if the threat may come only from intrastate activities; (3) Congress may regulate \"those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce. . . .\" Morrison, 529 U.S. at 608-09 (quoting United States v.

When Congress legislates pursuant to a valid exercise of its Commerce Clause authority, we scrutinize the enactment according to rational basis review. See Hodel v.

As important as Morrison is to our understanding of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, it is equally important to recognize from the outset what Morrison did not purport to address. Early in its opinion, the Supreme Court acknowledged that neither prong one nor prong two of the Lopez Commerce Clause test was implicated by the statute challenged in Morrison. Rather, the Court focused on whether VAWA could satisfy the third prong of the Lopez inquiry, otherwise known as the \"substantial effects\" test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This fact alone satisfies us that Morrison provides no basis for overruling Bongiorno, where we affirmed the validity of the CSRA as a constitutional exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority according to the second prong of Lopez, finding that the statute was a permissible regulation of a \"thing\" in commerce. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at 1033.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we believe that it would be useful to examine the defendant's arguments regarding the constitutionality of the CSRA and the DPPA on the merits, rather than simply to rely on principles of stare decisis, or \"law of the circuit.\" As we explain infra, these statutory provisions are undoubtedly constitutional exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause authority under two of the prongs of Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CSRA and the DPPA easily satisfy the second prong of Lopez. In order for either of these statutory provisions to be triggered, the non-paying parent must reside in a different state than the child owed support, meaning that the payment will necessarily need to cross state lines in order to reach the intended recipient. With that in mind, we have no difficulty finding that \"[a]n interstate court-ordered child support payment is clearly a 'thing' in interstate commerce.\" Faasse, 265 F.3d at 489; see also United States v.

Despite these concessions, however, he still maintains that a child support payment is not a \"thing in interstate commerce,\" relying primarily on Judge Smith's dissent in Bailey. See 115 F.3d at 1236-37 (Smith, J., dissenting). First, he argues that a child support payment is a wholly different type of \"thing\" because it emanates from family law. Specifically, defendant asserts that a child support order is unique because it is a unilateral, rather than a reciprocal, obligation. This characterization, however, is not entirely accurate. Although the non-custodial parent has a duty to provide financial support, the custodial parent must also demonstrate that he or she is using that money for the care and upbringing of the child. Regardless, a child support obligation arising from a court order, whether family court or another civil court, is a debt that may be enforced through civil remedies. See Mussari, 95 F.3d at 790 (\"True, the court order arises from the family relation. Once in place, the order creates a debt. Like any other debt, it is a thing of value, one of millions of obligations that make up the stream of commerce subject to congressional control.\"); see also Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at 1032 (holding that state-court-imposed child support orders are \"functionally equivalent to interstate contracts\" and rejecting idea that child support payment obligations are somehow \"different\") (citing Sage, 92 F.3d at 106). Therefore, defendant's attempt to carve out child support payments from other types of interstate monetary transfers in satisfaction of a financial obligation fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendant insists that this Court should limit the application of Bongiorno to cases where a party has engaged in some affirmative activity, such as absconding across state lines to avoid their support obligation, as covered by &#167; 228(a)(2). Lewko characterizes his crime, on the other hand, as one of omission, in that he refused to put a payment in interstate commerce. However, the Supreme Court has refused to draw a categorical distinction between crimes of omission and commission. See, e.g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></span>, 257-58 (1964); United States v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105362\"><a href=\"/opinion/105362/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 420 (1956); United States v. Darby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103442\"><a href=\"/opinion/103442/united-states-v-darby/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 115 (1941); Standard Oil Co. v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 68 (1911). Defendant attempts to distinguish these cases by noting that Congress has historically engaged in regulation of labor relations (Darby) and the practices of common carriers such as hotels (Heart of Atlanta). Likewise, defendant argues, the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951, (Green) and the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1, 2, (Standard Oil) explicitly target conduct falling within the conventional understanding of \"commerce.\" The DPPA and the CSRA, on the other hand, encroach on the traditionally local concerns of family law and domestic relations, and therefore should not be viewed with the same deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument also misses the mark. Neither the CSRA nor the DPPA have either the purpose or effect of establishing a national, uniform \"family law.\" They address neither the degree (i.e., amount) nor duty of support owed (i.e., when a duty of support shall be triggered or terminated). Rather, the provisions of these two acts are designed to protect the integrity of state court judgments, in light of the fact that parties attempting to enforce these court orders face significant difficulties when the non-paying party flees the ordering jurisdiction. See Bailey, 115 F.3d at 1230 (\"Congress did not impose the underlying obligation to pay child support. The CSRA applies only when the defendant has violated a state court order imposing upon him that obligation.\"); see also Faasse, 265 F.3d at 488 (rejecting claim that CSRA attempts to create \"federal family law\"). The defendant's invocation of the uniquely local concerns of family law are inapposite and do not bear the weight of his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A slightly more refined version of defendant's argument would posit that a child support payment is a thing, but it is not significant enough to implicate interstate commerce, because it is merely ancillary to a family court judgment. As a preliminary matter, we note that there is no \"materiality\" requirement embedded in Lopez's prong two analysis. Even if there were, however, the statutes on their face incorporate a \"materiality\" requirement by establishing threshold amounts of $5,000 (CSRA) and $10,000 (DPPA) before federal enforcement mechanisms become available. As we have already explained above, the fact that the obligation stems from a judgment arising out of a domestic dispute is insignificant. Therefore, prong two is clearly satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under prong one of Lopez, Congress may also regulate the use of the \"channels of interstate commerce.\" Just as we have previously determined that the payment is a \"thing in interstate commerce,\" we similarly have no trouble finding that the payment must travel through \"channels of interstate commerce\" to reach the deserving party, and therefore falls within the purview of Congress' Commerce Clause authority. See Bailey, 115 F.3d at 1227. Whether transmitted via wire transfer or through the mails, these payments necessarily change hands as a result of travel through interstate commercial channels. See also Mussari, 95 F.3d at 790.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Accordingly, we find that Congress acted well within its Commerce Clause authority when it enacted the CSRA and the DPPA, and that these provisions are rationally related to a legitimate federal objective, the payment of court-ordered child support obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's convictions under both the DPPA and the CSRA are hereby affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Prior to Medina's filing for divorce, the defendant had worked continuously at an income in excess of $100,000 per year.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  U.S. Const., art.
