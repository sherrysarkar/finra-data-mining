This   appeal   concerns   the   judgment\r                           \r\n\ndismissing a 42 U.S.C.   1983 complaint as untimely under the\r\n\napplicable Puerto  Rico statute of limitations.   We write to\r\n\nclarify that, applying  Puerto Rico law, the  day plaintiffs'\r\n\naction accrued should not be counted  as the first day of the\r\n\nlimitations  period and that the limitations period begins to\r\n\nrun on  the following day.  The prior decisions of this court\r\n\nand the district court for Puerto Rico may have been somewhat\r\n\ninconsistent  on  that   point.    Therefore  we   take  this\r\n\nopportunity to resolve any uncertainty.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                    I.  Background\r\n\n     Plaintiffs'   brother  was   shot  and  killed   by  the\r\n\ndefendants,  policemen  in  Puerto  Rico  on  May  19,  1994.\r\n\nPlaintiffs learned of the death on May 20,  1994.  They filed\r\n\ntheir   1983 complaint on May 22, 1995. \r\n\n     Defendants moved to dismiss based on the applicable one-\r\n\nyear statute  of limitations,  Article 1868(2)  of the  Civil\r\n\nCode,  P.R.  Laws  Ann.  tit.  31,     5298(2).    Plaintiffs\r\n\nresponded that  they did  not know of  their cause  of action\r\n\nuntil they received an autopsy report in early May 1995.  The\r\n\ndistrict court rejected  plaintiffs' analysis and  determined\r\n\nthat the action accrued on May 20,  1994.  The district court\r\n\nfurther  concluded that the complaint filed  on May 22, 1995,\r\n\nwas two days too late  and so entered judgment dismissing the\r\n\ncomplaint.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     Plaintiffs moved  to vacate  the judgment  of dismissal,\r\n\narguing that the day  of accrual, May 20, 1994, should not be\r\n\ncounted, so that the 365-day limitations period ran from  May\r\n\n21, 1994, until Saturday, May  20, 1995.  They further argued\r\n\nthat  their complaint  was  timely filed  on Monday,  May 22,\r\n\n1995,  the  next court  day.   The  district  court summarily\r\n\ndenied that motion.\r\n\n     This  appeal  followed.   The  parties'  briefs  did not\r\n\nadequately  address the question  whether the day  of accrual\r\n\nshould be counted as the first day of the limitations period,\r\n\nand so supplemental briefs were  ordered.  Now that the issue\r\n\nhas been fully  briefed, and as the facts  are fully laid out\r\n\nupon the record, we are prepared to decide the appeal without\r\n\nfurther argument.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 34.1(a)(2)(iii).\r                                  \r\n\n                       II.  Discussion\r                                   II.  Discussion\r\n\n     The  limitation period for  filing this    1983 claim is\r\n\ngoverned by the  applicable state statute of  limitations for\r\n\npersonal injury actions.  See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261,\r                                                          \r\n\n278-80  (1985).   In Puerto  Rico  the applicable  limitation\r\n\nperiod for tort actions is one year.  Article 1868(2)  of the\r\n\nCivil  Code, P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit. 31,    5298(2);  Torres v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSuperintendent of Police, 893 F.2d  404, 406 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                    \r\n\nOne year  means 365 days,  or 366 days  in leap year.   Olivo\r                                                                         \r\n\nAyala v. Lopez  Feliciano, 729 F.Supp.  9, 10 (D.P.R.  1990);\r                                     \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nYeinsip  v. Lufthansa German  Airlines, 725 F.Supp.  113, 115\r                                                  \r\n\n(D.P.R. 1989).\r\n\n     Although  the limitations period  is determined by state\r\n\nlaw,  the date  of accrual  is a federal  law question.   The\r\n\naccrual period  for a    1983 action \"ordinarily  starts when\r\n\nthe plaintiff knows, or has reason to know, of  the injury on\r\n\nwhich  the  action  is based.\"    Rivera-Muriente  v. Agosto-\r                                                                         \r\n\nAlicea,  959  F.2d  349,  353  (1st  Cir.  1992).    In  this\r                  \r\n\nparticular case, it is clear that the date of accrual  is May\r\n\n20, 1994,  the  date on  which  plaintiffs learned  of  their\r\n\nbrother's death.\r\n\n     The  question that  concerns  us  here  is  whether  the\r\n\nlimitations  period begins  on  the date  of  accrual or  the\r\n\nfollowing day.  In this    1983 case brought in Puerto  Rico,\r\n\nPuerto Rico law governs the limitations period, including the\r\n\n\"closely  related  questions  of  . .  .  application.\"   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWilson,  471 U.S.  at  269.   Thus,  when  the federal  court\r                  \r\n\nborrows the state statute of  limitations, so too the date on\r\n\nwhich   the  limitations  period  starts  to  run  should  be\r\n\ndetermined by the state law defining the \"application\" of the\r\n\nlimitations period.   Accordingly, we determine  the question\r\n\nunder Puerto Rico law.1\r                                  1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1To the extent that Puerto  Rico law provides that the day\r               1\r\nthat an action accrues is not counted as the first day of the\r\nlimitations period,  it is  consistent with  Fed. R.  Civ. R.\r\n6(a), which provides:\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     The prior opinions of the Puerto Rico district court and\r\n\nthis court may have been somewhat inconsistent in determining\r\n\nthe first day of the limitations period.  The inconsistencies\r\n\nappear  to stem from differing applications of two provisions\r\n\nof Puerto Rico law and a Puerto Rico court rule.  Article 388\r\n\nof the Political Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1,   72, provides:\r\n\n          The time in which any act provided by law\r\n          is to  be done is  computed by  excluding\r\n          the first  day, and  including the  last,\r\n          unless the  last day  is  a holiday,  and\r\n          then it is also excluded.\r\n\nSimilarly, as relevant here, Rule 68.1 provides:\r\n\n          In   computing   any   period   of   time\r\n          prescribed or allowed  by these rules, by\r\n          order  of the court, or by any applicable\r\n          statute,  the  day of  the act,  event or\r\n          default from which  the designated period\r\n          of  time  begins  to  run  shall  not  be\r\n          included. . . .\r\n\nIn contrast, Article  1869 of the Civil Code,  P.R. Laws Ann.\r\n\ntit. 31,   5299, provides: \r\n\n          The time  for  the  prescription  of  all\r\n          kinds  of  actions,   when  there  is  no\r\n          special provision to  the contrary, shall\r\n          be  counted from  the day  on which  they\r\n          could have been instituted.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          In   computing   any   period   of   time\r\n          prescribed  or  allowed  by  .  .  .  any\r\n          applicable statute, the  day of the  act,\r\n          event   or   default   from   which   the\r\n          designated period  of time begins  to run\r\n          shall not be included.\r\nTherefore, the result here would  be the same whether federal\r\nlaw or Puerto Rico law were applied.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     In  some  federal  cases, with  which  we  now disagree,\r\n\nArticle 1869 was thought to  prevail, so that the limitations\r\n\nperiod  was held  to include  the first  day that  the action\r\n\ncould  have been  instituted.   See Ramirez  Morales v.  Rosa\r                                                                         \r\n\nViera, 632 F.Supp. 491, 492 (D.P.R. 1986), aff'd, 815 F.2d 2,\r                                                            \r\n\n4-5 (1st Cir.  1987); Olivo Ayala, 729 F.Supp.  at 10; Dennis\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

And in dicta this court has  equated the\r\n\ndate of accrual with the first day of the limitations period:\r\n\n\"[The]  date   of  accrual,  i.e.,  the  day   on  which  the\r                                             \r\n\nlimitations  clock begins to tick, is determined by reference\r\n\nto federal  law.\"   Muniz-Cabrero v.

R. 34.1(a)(2)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limitation period for filing this &#167; 1983 claim is governed by the applicable state statute of limitations for personal injury actions.  See Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 278-80, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1948-49, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985).  In Puerto Rico the applicable limitation period for tort actions is one year.  Article 1868(2) of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5298(2);  Torres v. Superintendent of Police, 893 F.2d 404, 406 (1st Cir.1990).  One year means 365 days, or 366 days in leap year.  Olivo Ayala v. Lopez Feliciano, 729 F.Supp. 9, 10 (D.P.R.1990);  Yeinsip v. Lufthansa German Airlines, 725 F.Supp. 113, 115 (D.P.R.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the limitations period is determined by state law, the date of accrual is a federal law question.  The accrual period for a &#167; 1983 action \"ordinarily starts when the plaintiff knows, or has reason to know, of the injury on which the action is based.\"  Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 353 (1st Cir.1992).  In this particular case, it is clear that the date of accrual is May 20, 1994, the date on which plaintiffs learned of their brother's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question that concerns us here is whether the limitations period begins on the date of accrual or the following day.  In this &#167; 1983 case brought in Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico law governs the limitations period, including the \"closely related questions of ... application.\"   See Wilson, 471 U.S. at 269, 105 S.Ct. at 1943.   Thus, when the federal court borrows the state statute of limitations, so too the date on which the limitations period starts to run should be determined by the state law defining the \"application\" of the limitations period.  Accordingly, we determine the question under Puerto Rico law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prior opinions of the Puerto Rico district court and this court may have been somewhat inconsistent in determining the first day of the limitations period.  The inconsistencies appear to stem from differing applications of two provisions of Puerto Rico law and a Puerto Rico court rule.  Article 388 of the Political Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167; 72, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The time in which any act provided by law is to be done is computed by excluding the first day, and including the last, unless the last day is a holiday, and then it is also excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, as relevant here, Rule 68.1 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, Article 1869 of the Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 5299, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>The time for the prescription of all kinds of actions, when there is no special provision to the contrary, shall be counted from the day on which they could have been instituted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In some federal cases, with which we now disagree, Article 1869 was thought to prevail, so that the limitations period was held to include the first day that the action could have been instituted.  See Ramirez Morales v. Rosa Viera, 632 F.Supp. 491, 492 (D.P.R.1986), aff'd, 815 F.2d 2, 4-5 (1st Cir.1987);  Olivo Ayala, 729 F.Supp. at 10;  Dennis v. Figueroa, 642 F.Supp. 959, 961 (D.P.R.1986);  de la Cruz LaChapel v. Chevere Ortiz, 637 F.Supp. 43, 44 (D.P.R.1986);  see also Altair Corp. v. Pesquera de Busquets, 769 F.2d 30, 33 (1st Cir.1985).  And in dicta this court has equated the date of accrual with the first day of the limitations period:  \"[The] date of accrual, i.e., the day on which the limitations clock begins to tick, is determined by reference to federal law.\"  Muniz-Cabrero v. Ruiz, 23 F.3d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1994) (precise dates were not dispositive in that case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in other cases, with which we now agree, Article 388 prevailed, so that the limitations period began on the day following the date of accrual.  See Salamanca v. American Airlines, Inc., 920 F.Supp. 24, 26 (D.P.R.1996);  Conde v. Beltran Pena, 793 F.Supp. 33, 35-36 (D.P.R.1992);  Yeinsip, 725 F.Supp. at 115;  see also Silva-Wiscovich v. Weber Dental Manufacturing Co., 835 F.2d 409, 409 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now conclude that the method of computing the limitations period followed in Salamanca, Conde, and Yeinsip applies in this &#167; 1983 action filed in the district court for Puerto Rico:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>the day in which a tort cause of action arises counts in the sense that it provides the starting point for the computation of the prescriptive term;  it is not, however, counted within that term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salamanca, 920 F.Supp. at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reach this conclusion because, as the district court in Salamanca noted, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has held that Article 388 (not counting the first day) applies to the statute of limitations for tort actions, which statute also prescribes this &#167; 1983 action.  E.g., Comunidad Agricola Bianchi v. Superior Court, 99 P.R.Dec. 366, 368 (1970);  Ortiz v. American Railroad Co., 62 P.R.Dec. 171, 176-77 (1943);  Cintron v. Insular Industrial &amp; Agricultural Exposition Ass'n, 58 P.R.Dec. 821, 828 (1941);  see also Escalera v. Andino, 76 P.R.Dec. 251, 254 (1954).  As the district court in Yeinsip explained, Article 1869 \"is a suppletory [provision], to be applied only if no special law over the matter has been adopted,\" and Article 388 \"is a specific statute which regulates the computation of legal periods of time,\" so that Article 388 controls.  725 F.Supp. at 115.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, applying the correct rule to compute the prescriptive period, plaintiffs' action accrued on May 20, 1994, but the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the next day, May 21, 1994.  The applicable 365-day period would have expired on Saturday, May 20, 1995, but, excluding the weekend days, the limitations period extended to the following Monday.  It follows that plaintiffs' complaint was timely filed on Monday, May 22, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To the extent that Puerto Rico law provides that the day that an action accrues is not counted as the first day of the limitations period, it is consistent with Fed.  R. Civ. R. 6(a), which provides:</p>\n        <p>In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by ... any applicable statute, the day of the act, event or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.</p>\n        <p>Therefore, the result here would be the same whether federal law or Puerto Rico law were applied.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

E.g., Comunidad Agricola Bianchi v. Superior Court, 99 P.R.Dec. 366, 368 (1970);  Ortiz v. American Railroad Co., 62 P.R.Dec. 171, 176-77 (1943);  Cintron v. Insular Industrial &amp; Agricultural Exposition Ass'n, 58 P.R.Dec. 821, 828 (1941);  see also Escalera v. Andino, 76 P.R.Dec. 251, 254 (1954).  As the district court in Yeinsip explained, Article 1869 \"is a suppletory [provision], to be applied only if no special law over the matter has been adopted,\" and Article 388 \"is a specific statute which regulates the computation of legal periods of time,\" so that Article 388 controls.  725 F.Supp. at 115.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, applying the correct rule to compute the prescriptive period, plaintiffs' action accrued on May 20, 1994, but the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the next day, May 21, 1994.  The applicable 365-day period would have expired on Saturday, May 20, 1995, but, excluding the weekend days, the limitations period extended to the following Monday.  It follows that plaintiffs' complaint was timely filed on Monday, May 22, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To the extent that Puerto Rico law provides that the day that an action accrues is not counted as the first day of the limitations period, it is consistent with Fed.  R. Civ. R. 6(a), which provides:</p>\n        <p>In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by ... any applicable statute, the day of the act, event or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.</p>\n        <p>Therefore, the result here would be the same whether federal law or Puerto Rico law were applied.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
