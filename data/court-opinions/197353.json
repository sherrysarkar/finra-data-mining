The  dispute  in  this  case\r                                        \r\n\nconcerns Michael Wood's claim for partial disability payments\r\n\nfrom  his former  employer, Bath  Iron Works,  Inc. (\"Bath\").\r\n\nHis benefits were terminated on the ground that Wood had been\r\n\noffered  his pre-injury  wages  and more  by  Bath in  a  new\r\n\ncapacity at Bath's shipyard in Bath, Maine, but  had declined\r\n\nthe job offer because he had relocated to another state.  The\r\n\nproblem posed is obvious; the solution is not.\r\n\n     The  underlying facts are  largely undisputed.  Starting\r\n\nin January 1988,  Wood worked  as an insulator  at the  Bath,\r\n\nMaine  shipyard,  installing  fiberglass  and  polyamide foam\r\n\nmaterials.  In October 1988, he developed breathing and sinus\r\n\nproblems, and a skin rash, apparently as a result of exposure\r\n\nto dusts and fumes in his job at Bath.  Bath kept him on in a\r\n\nposition that  did not  involve contact with  these materials\r\n\nuntil December 1988, when Wood was terminated. \r\n\n     In May 1989, Wood  filed a claim with the  Department of\r\n\nLabor's  Office of  Workers'  Compensation Programs  (\"OWCP\")\r\n\nseeking disability  benefits under  the Longshore and  Harbor\r\n\nWorkers' Compensation Act (\"the  Act\"), 33 U.S.C.    901-950.\r\n\nThat statute creates a familiar statutory scheme for no-fault\r\n\ncompensation, financed by  the employer,  where the  employee\r\n\nsuffers a job  related disability.  In  February 1990, before\r\n\nthe claim was resolved,  Wood returned to Bath as  a delivery\r\n\ntruck driver.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     In March 1991, an Administrative Law  Judge in the Labor\r\n\nDepartment awarded  Wood  total disability  payments for  two\r\n\ndays in  December 1988, immediately  following his  dismissal\r\n\nfrom  Bath,  33  U.S.C.     908(a),  and  partial  disability\r\n\npayments  for  about  two  months  thereafter  based  on  the\r\n\ndifference between the $356 weekly pay Woods had earned as an\r\n\ninsulator  at Bath  and  his actual  wages earned  thereafter\r\n\n(working  for  other employers).    33  U.S.C.    908(c)(21).\r\n\nBecause the new job Wood took with Bath  as a delivery driver\r\n\nin February 1990 paid  more than his old insulator  wages, he\r\n\nwas awarded  no disability  benefits  after his  reemployment\r\n\ndate.  \r\n\n     In August  1991, Wood was again laid off by Bath, due in\r\n\npart to his lack of seniority.   In October 1991, having been\r\n\nadvised  by  Bath's  personnel  office that  his  layoff  was\r\n\n\"permanent,\" and having  found no other suitable job in Bath,\r\n\nWood  moved to Shortsville, New York, the town in the western\r\n\npart of  that  state where  he  had grown  up  and where  his\r\n\nimmediate family still lived.  With his  brothers' help, Wood\r\n\nlanded a series of auto mechanic jobs, making $300-315 weekly\r\n\non  a fairly steady basis from November 1991 through at least\r\n\nApril 1993.  \r\n\n     During  this  period  in  Shortsville,  Wood  was  twice\r\n\noffered reemployment by Bath.  In March 1992,  Bath contacted\r\n\nWood to offer him  a position similar to the  delivery driver\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\njob he had held earlier.  But  when Wood went to Maine for  a\r\n\nphysical  examination, he  discovered that  the recall  was a\r\n\nmistake, caused by a Bath hiring employee's mistaken reliance\r\n\non job type seniority rather than overall union seniority. \r\n\n     In February 1993, Bath recalled  Wood a second time, but\r\n\nhe  failed  to  report  to  Bath  for  a scheduled  physical.\r\n\nAlthough  Bath   repeated  the  offer  several   times,  Wood\r\n\ndeclined, apparently  for several  reasons:  an  inability to\r\n\nrelocate soon enough  to report  for work in  March, as  Bath\r\n\nrequired;  the fact that the job was only \"guaranteed\" for 30\r\n\ndays;  and Wood's  increasing ties to  Shortsville, including\r\n\ncare  of his  then-hospitalized mother.   As  a result,  Bath\r\n\nterminated Wood's seniority-based rights to future employment\r\n\npursuant to the union contract.\r\n\n     In  the  meantime,  Wood   had  renewed  his  claim  for\r\n\ndisability  benefits.    In  August  1991,  Wood  sought  new\r\n\nbenefits for partial disability under 33 U.S.C.   908(c)(21);\r\n\nthe Act  defines disability as \"incapacity  because of injury\r\n\nto earn the  wages which  the employee was  receiving at  the\r\n\ntime of  injury.\"   Id.    902(10).   Wood  claimed that  his\r                                   \r\n\nShortsville earnings accurately reflected his present earning\r\n\ncapacity,  see id.     908(h),  and  asked that  his  earlier\r                              \r\n\ndisability award be modified, as provided by 33 U.S.C.   922,\r\n\nbased on the gap between his pre-injury Bath  insulator wages\r\n\nand his lower Shortsville earnings.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     In October 1993,  a different  Administrative Law  Judge\r\n\nrendered the decision that is now before us on appeal.  As to\r\n\nthe period between August  1991 and March 1993, the  ALJ held\r\n\nthat Bath had failed  to show that Wood's actual  earnings in\r\n\nShortsville underrepresented  his earning capacity.  He ruled\r\n\nthat Wood  was therefore entitled to  disability payments for\r\n\nthat  period based on the difference between the wages he had\r\n\nearned  as a  Bath insulator  in 1988  and his  lesser actual\r\n\nwages in Shortsville.\r\n\n     However, the ALJ also  found that in February  and March\r\n\n1993  Bath had made Wood  a bona fide  reemployment job offer\r                                                 \r\n\nthat would  have paid more  than Wood's pre-injury  wage, and\r\n\nthat  Wood declined the offer for his own personal and family\r\n\nreasons.   The ALJ held that the offer established that, from\r\n\nthis time  forward, Wood's earning capacity  was not impaired\r\n\nas a result  of his  disability.  Wood's  testimony had  made\r\n\nclear,  said the ALJ, that  Wood would not  have accepted the\r\n\nBath job  even if  it had been  offered as  a permanent  one.\r\n\nAccordingly, Wood's  partial disability benefits were cut off\r\n\nafter that date. \r\n\n     In  December  1993, Wood  appealed  the  portion of  the\r\n\ndecision  denying  benefits after  March  1993  to the  Labor\r\n\nDepartment's Benefits Review Board, as allowed by 33 U.S.C.  \r\n\n921(b).   On September 12, 1996, the Review Board sent Wood a\r\n\nnotice pursuant to Pub. L. 104-134,   101(d), 110 Stat. 1321-\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n219 (1996), stating  that the decision  was to be  considered\r\n\naffirmed for  purposes of appeal to this court.  Wood filed a\r\n\nmotion for reconsideration which the Review Board denied.  He\r\n\nthen filed a  notice of appeal  to this court pursuant  to 33\r\n\nU.S.C.   921(c).\r\n\n     In  reviewing such  compensation  decisions, this  court\r\n\nnormally accepts the  ALJ's findings of  fact where they  are\r\n\nsupported   by  substantial   evidence,  and   reviews  legal\r\n\nquestions de novo.  CNA Ins. Co. v. Legrow, 935 F.2d 430, 433\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).   The  central issue in  our case,  however,\r\n\ndoes  not neatly fit within these polar categories.  Our main\r\n\ntask  here is  to discern  standards--an amalgam  of law  and\r\n\npolicy--to   cope  with   a  recurring   problem  with   many\r\n\nvariations:   how earning capacity should  be calculated when\r\n\nthe employee, after the injury, moves to a new community.  \r\n\n     We begin with  the Act.   For some partial  disabilities\r\n\n(e.g., the loss of a finger), the Act schedules a payment, 33\r                 \r\n\nU.S.C.    908(c)(1)-(20),  but for unscheduled  injuries such\r\n\nas  Wood's,  the Act  requires  that  the employee's  reduced\r\n\nearning capacity be determined; the employer is then required\r\n\nto pay  regularly two  thirds of  the difference  between the\r\n\nemployee's  pre-injury  wages  and  his  post-injury  reduced\r\n\nearning capacity.   Id.    908(c)(21), 908(e).   Actual post-\r                                   \r\n\ninjury  earnings  are  evidence   of  capacity  but  are  not\r\n\nconclusive.  Id.   908(h).\r                            \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     Wood's earnings  in Shortsville were less  than his pre-\r\n\ninjury wages  as a insulator at  Bath.  The  employer has the\r\n\nburden  of proving  that the  claimant's earning  capacity is\r\n\ngreater than  his actual earnings.   Avondale Shipyards, Inc.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Guidry, 967  F.2d 1039,  1042-43 (5th Cir.  1992).   Here,\r                     \r\n\nBath  does  not claim  that Wood  could  have earned  more in\r\n\nShortsville; but it  says that  its own offer  shows that  he\r\n\ncould  have exceeded his own  pre-injury wages in  Bath.  The\r\n\nALJ so found, at least implicitly, and Wood does not directly\r\n\ndispute the finding.\r\n\n     But  the statute itself  does not tell  us where earning\r                                                                 \r\n\ncapacity  is to  be  measured.    The  closest  it  comes  to\r\n\naddressing  the issue at all--and it is not very close--is as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n          The  wage-earning  capacity   of  an   injured\r\n     employee  in  cases  of  partial  disability  under\r\n     subsection  (c)(21)  of   this  section  or   under\r\n     subsection (e) of this  section shall be determined\r\n     by  his actual  earnings  if such  actual  earnings\r\n     fairly  and  reasonably represent  his wage-earning\r\n     capacity:   Provided, however, That if the employee\r                                                                    \r\n     has no  actual earnings  or his actual  earnings do\r                                                                    \r\n     not  fairly  and  reasonably  represent  his  wage-\r                                                                    \r\n     earning capacity,  the deputy commissioner  may, in\r                                                                    \r\n     the  interest  of  justice,  fix  such wage-earning\r                                                                    \r\n     capacity as shall be reasonable, having due  regard\r                                                \r\n     to the nature of his injury, the degree of physical\r\n     impairment, his  usual  employment, and  any  other\r\n     factors  or  circumstances in  the  case  which may\r\n     affect his  capacity to earn wages  in his disabled\r\n     condition, including the effect of disability as it\r\n     may naturally extend into the future.  \r\n\n33 U.S.C.   908(h) (emphasis added).\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     This  is  a  typical  problem  presented in  an  age  of\r\n\nstatutes;  the Act's  language does  not squarely  answer the\r\n\nquestion  posed,  and  often  enough Congress  never  gave  a\r\n\nthought to the issue.  Sometimes the responsible agency fills\r\n\nin  such lacunae through regulation,  but not so  here.  Even\r\n\nso,  in  the  normal   case,  the  agency's  individual  case\r\n\ndecisions  tend   to  mark   out  a  pattern   that  deserves\r\n\nsubstantial  deference, see  SEC v.  Chenery Corp.,  332 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n194, 202-03  (1947), and the agency's  application of general\r\n\nstandards to specific facts  is usually upheld if \"reasonably\r\n\ndefensible.\"   Sure-Tan,  Inc. v.

In October 1991, having been advised by Bath's personnel office that his layoff was \"permanent,\" and having found no other suitable job in Bath, Wood moved to Shortsville, New York, the town in the western part of that state where he had grown up and where his immediate family still lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With his brothers' help, Wood landed a series of auto mechanic jobs, making $300-315 weekly on a fairly steady basis from November 1991 through at least April 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period in Shortsville, Wood was twice offered reemployment by Bath.  In March 1992, Bath contacted Wood to offer him a position similar to the delivery driver job he had held earlier.  But when Wood went to Maine for a physical examination, he discovered that the recall was a mistake, caused by a Bath hiring employee's mistaken reliance on job type seniority rather than overall union seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, Bath recalled Wood a second time, but he failed to report to Bath for a scheduled physical.  Although Bath repeated the offer several times, Wood declined, apparently for several reasons:  an inability to relocate soon enough to report for work in March, as Bath required;  the fact that the job was only \"guaranteed\" for 30 days;  and Wood's increasing ties to Shortsville, including care of his then-hospitalized mother.  As a result, Bath terminated Wood's seniority-based rights to future employment pursuant to the union contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Wood had renewed his claim for disability benefits.  In August 1991, Wood sought new benefits for partial disability under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(c)(21);  the Act defines disability as \"incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\"  Id. &#167; 902(10).  Wood claimed that his Shortsville earnings accurately reflected his present earning capacity, see id. &#167; 908(h), and asked that his earlier disability award be modified, as provided by 33 U.S.C. &#167; 922, based on the gap between his pre-injury Bath insulator wages and his lower Shortsville earnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, a different Administrative Law Judge rendered the decision that is now before us on appeal.  As to the period between August 1991 and March 1993, the ALJ held that Bath had failed to show that Wood's actual earnings in Shortsville underrepresented his earning capacity.  He ruled that Wood was therefore entitled to disability payments for that period based on the difference between the wages he had earned as a Bath insulator in 1988 and his lesser actual wages in Shortsville.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the ALJ also found that in February and March 1993 Bath had made Wood a bona fide reemployment job offer that would have paid more than Wood's pre-injury wage, and that Wood declined the offer for his own personal and family reasons.  The ALJ held that the offer established that, from that time forward, Wood's earning capacity was not impaired as a result of his disability.  Wood's testimony had made clear, said the ALJ, that Wood would not have accepted the Bath job even if it had been offered as a permanent one.  Accordingly, Wood's partial disability benefits were cut off after that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1993, Wood appealed the portion of the decision denying benefits after March 1993 to the Labor Department's Benefits Review Board, as allowed by 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(b).  On September 12, 1996, the Review Board sent Wood a notice pursuant to Pub.L. 104-134, &#167; 101(d), 110 Stat. 1321-219 (1996), stating that the decision was to be considered affirmed for purposes of appeal to this court.  Wood filed a motion for reconsideration which the Review Board denied.  He then filed a notice of appeal to this court pursuant to 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing such compensation decisions, this court normally accepts the ALJ's findings of fact where they are supported by substantial evidence, and reviews legal questions de novo.  CNA Ins. Co. v. Legrow, 935 F.2d 430, 433 (1st Cir.1991).  The central issue in our case, however, does not neatly fit within these polar categories.  Our main task here is to discern standards--an amalgam of law and policy--to cope with a recurring problem with many variations:  how earning capacity should be calculated when the employee, after the injury, moves to a new community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the Act.  For some partial disabilities (e.g., the loss of a finger), the Act schedules a payment, 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 908(c)(1)-(20), but for unscheduled injuries such as Wood's, the Act requires that the employee's reduced earning capacity be determined;  the employer is then required to pay regularly two thirds of the difference between the employee's pre-injury wages and his post-injury reduced earning capacity.  Id. &#167;&#167; 908(c)(21), 908(e).  Actual post-injury earnings are evidence of capacity but are not conclusive.  Id. &#167; 908(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wood's earnings in Shortsville were less than his pre-injury wages as a insulator at Bath.  The employer has the burden of proving that the claimant's earning capacity is greater than his actual earnings.  Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Guidry, 967 F.2d 1039, 1042-43 (5th Cir.1992).  Here, Bath does not claim that Wood could have earned more in Shortsville;  but it says that its own offer shows that he could have exceeded his own pre-injury wages in Bath.  The ALJ so found, at least implicitly, and Wood does not directly dispute the finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the statute itself does not tell us where earning capacity is to be measured.  The closest it comes to addressing the issue at all--and it is not very close--is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wage-earning capacity of an injured employee in cases of partial disability under subsection (c)(21) of this section or under subsection (e) of this section shall be determined by his actual earnings if such actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity:  Provided, however, That if the employee has no actual earnings or his actual earnings do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity, the deputy commissioner may, in the interest of justice, fix such wage-earning capacity as shall be reasonable, having due regard to the nature of his injury, the degree of physical impairment, his usual employment, and any other factors or circumstances in the case which may affect his capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition, including the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(h) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a typical problem presented in an age of statutes;  the Act's language does not squarely answer the question posed, and often enough Congress never gave a thought to the issue.  Sometimes the responsible agency fills in such lacunae through regulation, but not so here.  Even so, in the normal case, the agency's individual case decisions tend to mark out a pattern that deserves substantial deference, see SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 202-03, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580-81, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947), and the agency's application of general standards to specific facts is usually upheld if \"reasonably defensible.\"  Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883, 891, 104 S.Ct. 2803, 2808, 81 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem of deference in our case is more complicated than it is under the ordinary regulatory statute.  Administrative authority under the Act has been assumed by the Secretary of Labor, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 939, delegated to an assistant secretary, and redelegated in turn to the director of the OWCP. 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 701.201-.203.  But neither the Secretary nor the director reviews the decisions of the ALJs or the Review Board, which by statute are now reviewable only in the courts of appeal.  33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, contrary to the usual administrative scheme, it is unclear to what extent the ALJ and Review Board reflect the policymaker's viewpoint.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has declared that \"the Benefits Review Board is not a policymaking agency;  its interpretation of the [Act] thus is not entitled to any special deference from the courts.\"  Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Director, OWCP, 449 U.S. 268, 278 n. 18, 101 S.Ct. 509, 515 n. 18, 66 L.Ed.2d 446 (1980);  see Director, OWCP v. General Dynamics Corp., 982 F.2d 790, 794-95 (2d Cir.1992) (deference due to OWCP but not Review Board);  see also Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 152-57, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 1176-79, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, we turn to the problem at hand, which is actually a multiplicity of problems.  Moves by partly disabled employees are not uncommon, nor is it rare for them to move back to communities where family members can lend support.  The disability payment itself creates an odd incentive for the former employee to seek out a lower cost community, knowing that lower wages in the area will be offset (although only in part) by the employer's continuing payment.  A different incentive, and sometimes union agreements, encourage the original employer to persist in trying to rehire the employee where feasible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And there are countless variations in the underlying circumstances:  an employee may move for good reasons or bad;  reasons may be economic or highly personal;  a new job offer may require a move back or elsewhere, and may come from the old employer or a new one;  and a refusal to move again may reflect any of these various reasons.  Similarly, the financial impact on the claimant and the employer will vary greatly from case to case, depending in part on the difference in costs and wage rates in two communities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Review Board's lack of policy authority, we would be sorely tempted to follow its lead if its decisions on the relocation issue scythed a clear and consistent path.  Twelve circuit courts are no substitute for one coherent agency policy.  But so far as we can discern, the Review Board tends to resolve these cases on their facts, with one major qualification:  little if any weight is given to so-called \"personal\" reasons of the employee for choosing to move or refusing to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only circuit court precedent directly on point endorses an \"on the facts\" approach.  See v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375 (4th Cir.1994).  There the court ruled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>[T]he ALJ's determination of the relevant labor market should include consideration of such factors as the claimant's residence at the time of his filing for disability benefits, his motivation for relocation after the accident, the legitimacy of that motivation, the duration of his stay in that new community, his ties to that new community, the availability of suitable job opportunities in the new community as opposed to those in his former residence, and the degree of undue prejudice to the employer in proving suitable alternative employment in the claimant's new community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See, 36 F.3d at 383.   Notably, one recent Review Board decision has embraced See 's multifactor approach.  Wilson v. Crowley Maritime, 30 B.R.B.S.  (Bender) 199, 203-04 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Labor itself had argued in See that \"a legitimately motivated postaccident relocation can create a new relevant labor market.\"  See, 36 F.3d at 383.   We have obtained the brief submitted by the Department in See and discovered that the Department also wrote in its brief:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[C]onsideration should be afforded to such factors as whether the claimant has relocated for a proper purpose, or in an effort to frustrate an employer's ability to establish suitable alternative employment, and whether a finding that the relevant labor market is the community to which the claimant has relocated would unduly prejudice the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brief of the Respondent Director, OWCP at 22.  The Department's litigating position is not a binding administrative determination, 1 Davis &amp; Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 3.5 (3d ed.  1994 &amp; Supp.1995), but it is informative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are content to follow the lead of See, the Secretary's brief and the latest Review Board decision and also endorse an \"on the facts\" approach.  But to provide some structure for analysis, we think that the employee's chosen community is presumptively the proper choice for determining earning capacity, and that the employer bears the burden of showing that the original move, or a refusal to move again, is unjustified.  Cf. Avondale Shipyards, 967 F.2d at 1042-43.   Of course, where knowledge about reasons is possessed only by the employee, his silence may be telling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to what constitutes justification, we agree that economic judgments ought generally to control.  Care for an aged parent is to be commended;  but a claimant who turns down a better job elsewhere for personal reasons has a much weaker claim to be subsidized by the employer.  See Nguyen, 19 B.R.B.S. at 145.  Some state courts may be more liberal;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  but until Congress (or possibly the Secretary) decides otherwise, we think that the Review Board's economic emphasis is consistent with the Act's own goals of fair compensation and encouragement of work.  See New Orleans (Gulfwide) Stevedores v. Turner, 661 F.2d 1031, 1042 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the employee's reasons are economically sound, both See and the Secretary's brief suggest that in some cases the employer may still suffer undue \"prejudice\" if the disparity in wages between the new and old locations is extreme.  Possibly, the statutory language of section 908(h), quoted above, is broad enough to permit some equitable adjustment (e.g., pegging the earning capacity at some intermediate level).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  However this may be, we accept that the \"prejudice\" concept may be a reasonable safeguard in extreme cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to the decision of the ALJ in this case.  While the ALJ may have no \"policy\" authority, deference is still ordinarily due to the frontline adjudicator in applying general standards to particular facts.  See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464-65, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).  This is a different kind of respect than deference to a policymaker.  It is the deference ordinarily accorded by appeals courts to trial courts, based on their superior feel for the facts and the situation, even where the standards to be applied are well settled.  See, e.g., United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But despite this deference, the present decision needs to be reexamined.  The ALJ in this case effectively adopted a legal rule that makes a bona fide higher-pay offer by the original employer almost conclusive even where it compels relocation back to the original job site.  Indeed, the ALJ cited Review Board precedent for the view that any suitable job in the original location of injury could be used to cap the employee's disability benefits.  E.g., Nguyen, 19 B.R.B.S. at 145.  If this is the Review Board's view, we think that it goes too far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already said, it seems to us that the employee's community is presumptively the place for measuring his earning capacity, unless and until the employer shows that the move to the community was unreasonable, or that a refusal to move again is unreasonable, or that (reasonableness aside), the prejudice to the employer is just too severe.  Bath has not claimed here that it was unreasonable for Wood to move to Shortsville, and we are at least skeptical that the difference between Wood's insulator wages and his Shortsville income suggests severe prejudice to Bath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the issue probably comes down to whether it was reasonable for Wood to refuse to move back to take the proffered job in Bath, while insisting on continued payments for partial disability.  The ALJ thought not, primarily because he viewed Wood as having refused to move solely upon personal grounds.  We agree that the personal grounds are not an excuse for refusing to take a better job.  Still, it is not clear why Wood's personal motives should count against him if the job actually offered did not warrant a move back to Bath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This comparison is primarily economic, as we gloss the Act, but the higher wages in Bath can hardly be conclusive.  Here, it appears from the record that Wood was earning reasonably good wages in Shortsville with no apparent risk of layoff and with some prospect of promotion.  Bath's offer of somewhat better pay at the old location, but apparently with minimal formal security as to tenure, was not on the surface plainly a better offer, even from a strictly economic standpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This surface impression is open to correction.  There is some record evidence, not mentioned by the ALJ, that the job offered by Bath was likely to endure longer than the 30-day guarantee (the test is what Wood knew, not what happened later).  But other evidence, also not mentioned, indicates that Wood might have foregone promotion opportunities by moving.  Possibly, under a standard of reasonableness, the ALJ might have decided the case either way.  But that standard of reasonableness, and not some automatic right of the employer to require a move back, ought to govern until Congress or the Secretary says otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chenery doctrine--that the agency must be judged upon the grounds it has given--thus warrants a remand for further proceedings.  See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87-88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459-60, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).  Wood's move to Shortsville has not been challenged.  Thus, on remand the ALJ should treat Shortsville as presumptively the relevant community for determining Wood's earning capacity, unless and until Bath proves that his decision to remain there was unreasonable, taking account centrally of economic factors, or that this is the rare case of undue prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We intend no criticism of the ALJ who deemed himself bound by earlier Review Board precedent.  If that precedent had been blessed by the Secretary, we might also defer;  but the Secretary's position appears closer to that of See, and even the Review Board has now moved in that direction.  These new developments, which post-date the ALJ's decision, reinforce our view that this case needs a fresh look.  We do not say that it necessarily requires a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the ALJ, affirmed by the Review Board through inaction, is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with the standards set forth in this opinion.  Whether any further evidentiary hearing is required is a matter within the sound discretion of the ALJ.  Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Vasquez v.

(\"Bath\").  His benefits were terminated on the ground that Wood had been offered his pre-injury wages and more by Bath in a new capacity at Bath's shipyard in Bath, Maine, but had declined the job offer because he had relocated to another state.  The problem posed is obvious;  the solution is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying facts are largely undisputed.  Starting in January 1988, Wood worked as an insulator at the Bath, Maine shipyard, installing fiberglass and polyamide foam materials.  In October 1988, he developed breathing and sinus problems, and a skin rash, apparently as a result of exposure to dusts and fumes in his job at Bath.  Bath kept him on in a position that did not involve contact with these materials until December 1988, when Wood was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1989, Wood filed a claim with the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (\"OWCP\") seeking disability benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (\"the Act\"), 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 901-950.  That statute creates a familiar statutory scheme for no-fault compensation, financed by the employer, where the employee suffers a job-related disability.  In February 1990, before the claim was resolved, Wood returned to Bath as a delivery truck driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1991, an Administrative Law Judge in the Labor Department awarded Wood total disability payments for two days in December 1988, immediately following his dismissal from Bath, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(a), and partial disability payments for about two months thereafter based on the difference between the $356 weekly pay Woods had earned as an insulator at Bath and his actual wages earned thereafter (working for other employers).  33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(c)(21).  Because the new job Wood took with Bath as a delivery driver in February 1990 paid more than his old insulator wages, he was awarded no disability benefits after his reemployment date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1991, Wood was laid off by Bath, due in part to his lack of seniority.  In October 1991, having been advised by Bath's personnel office that his layoff was \"permanent,\" and having found no other suitable job in Bath, Wood moved to Shortsville, New York, the town in the western part of that state where he had grown up and where his immediate family still lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With his brothers' help, Wood landed a series of auto mechanic jobs, making $300-315 weekly on a fairly steady basis from November 1991 through at least April 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period in Shortsville, Wood was twice offered reemployment by Bath.  In March 1992, Bath contacted Wood to offer him a position similar to the delivery driver job he had held earlier.  But when Wood went to Maine for a physical examination, he discovered that the recall was a mistake, caused by a Bath hiring employee's mistaken reliance on job type seniority rather than overall union seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1993, Bath recalled Wood a second time, but he failed to report to Bath for a scheduled physical.  Although Bath repeated the offer several times, Wood declined, apparently for several reasons:  an inability to relocate soon enough to report for work in March, as Bath required;  the fact that the job was only \"guaranteed\" for 30 days;  and Wood's increasing ties to Shortsville, including care of his then-hospitalized mother.  As a result, Bath terminated Wood's seniority-based rights to future employment pursuant to the union contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Wood had renewed his claim for disability benefits.  In August 1991, Wood sought new benefits for partial disability under 33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(c)(21);  the Act defines disability as \"incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\"  Id. &#167; 902(10).  Wood claimed that his Shortsville earnings accurately reflected his present earning capacity, see id. &#167; 908(h), and asked that his earlier disability award be modified, as provided by 33 U.S.C. &#167; 922, based on the gap between his pre-injury Bath insulator wages and his lower Shortsville earnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, a different Administrative Law Judge rendered the decision that is now before us on appeal.  As to the period between August 1991 and March 1993, the ALJ held that Bath had failed to show that Wood's actual earnings in Shortsville underrepresented his earning capacity.  He ruled that Wood was therefore entitled to disability payments for that period based on the difference between the wages he had earned as a Bath insulator in 1988 and his lesser actual wages in Shortsville.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the ALJ also found that in February and March 1993 Bath had made Wood a bona fide reemployment job offer that would have paid more than Wood's pre-injury wage, and that Wood declined the offer for his own personal and family reasons.  The ALJ held that the offer established that, from that time forward, Wood's earning capacity was not impaired as a result of his disability.  Wood's testimony had made clear, said the ALJ, that Wood would not have accepted the Bath job even if it had been offered as a permanent one.  Accordingly, Wood's partial disability benefits were cut off after that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1993, Wood appealed the portion of the decision denying benefits after March 1993 to the Labor Department's Benefits Review Board, as allowed by 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(b).  On September 12, 1996, the Review Board sent Wood a notice pursuant to Pub.L. 104-134, &#167; 101(d), 110 Stat. 1321-219 (1996), stating that the decision was to be considered affirmed for purposes of appeal to this court.  Wood filed a motion for reconsideration which the Review Board denied.  He then filed a notice of appeal to this court pursuant to 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing such compensation decisions, this court normally accepts the ALJ's findings of fact where they are supported by substantial evidence, and reviews legal questions de novo.  CNA Ins. Co. v. Legrow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562614\"><a href=\"/opinion/562614/cna-insurance-company-carrier-v-harry-legrow-and-director-office-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 433 (1st Cir.1991).  The central issue in our case, however, does not neatly fit within these polar categories.  Our main task here is to discern standards--an amalgam of law and policy--to cope with a recurring problem with many variations:  how earning capacity should be calculated when the employee, after the injury, moves to a new community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the Act.  For some partial disabilities (e.g., the loss of a finger), the Act schedules a payment, 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 908(c)(1)-(20), but for unscheduled injuries such as Wood's, the Act requires that the employee's reduced earning capacity be determined;  the employer is then required to pay regularly two thirds of the difference between the employee's pre-injury wages and his post-injury reduced earning capacity.  Id. &#167;&#167; 908(c)(21), 908(e).  Actual post-injury earnings are evidence of capacity but are not conclusive.  Id. &#167; 908(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wood's earnings in Shortsville were less than his pre-injury wages as a insulator at Bath.  The employer has the burden of proving that the claimant's earning capacity is greater than his actual earnings.  Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Guidry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585828\"><a href=\"/opinion/585828/avondale-shipyards-inc-v-ronald-j-guidry-and-director-office-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span>, 1042-43 (5th Cir.1992).  Here, Bath does not claim that Wood could have earned more in Shortsville;  but it says that its own offer shows that he could have exceeded his own pre-injury wages in Bath.  The ALJ so found, at least implicitly, and Wood does not directly dispute the finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the statute itself does not tell us where earning capacity is to be measured.  The closest it comes to addressing the issue at all--and it is not very close--is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wage-earning capacity of an injured employee in cases of partial disability under subsection (c)(21) of this section or under subsection (e) of this section shall be determined by his actual earnings if such actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity:  Provided, however, That if the employee has no actual earnings or his actual earnings do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity, the deputy commissioner may, in the interest of justice, fix such wage-earning capacity as shall be reasonable, having due regard to the nature of his injury, the degree of physical impairment, his usual employment, and any other factors or circumstances in the case which may affect his capacity to earn wages in his disabled condition, including the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(h) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a typical problem presented in an age of statutes;  the Act's language does not squarely answer the question posed, and often enough Congress never gave a thought to the issue.  Sometimes the responsible agency fills in such lacunae through regulation, but not so here.  Even so, in the normal case, the agency's individual case decisions tend to mark out a pattern that deserves substantial deference, see SEC v. Chenery Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104462\"><a href=\"/opinion/104462/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 202-03, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104462\"><a href=\"/opinion/104462/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Administrative authority under the Act has been assumed by the Secretary of Labor, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 939, delegated to an assistant secretary, and redelegated in turn to the director of the OWCP. 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 701.201-.203.  But neither the Secretary nor the director reviews the decisions of the ALJs or the Review Board, which by statute are now reviewable only in the courts of appeal.  33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, contrary to the usual administrative scheme, it is unclear to what extent the ALJ and Review Board reflect the policymaker's viewpoint.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has declared that \"the Benefits Review Board is not a policymaking agency;  its interpretation of the [Act] thus is not entitled to any special deference from the courts.\"  Potomac Elec.

Moves by partly disabled employees are not uncommon, nor is it rare for them to move back to communities where family members can lend support.  The disability payment itself creates an odd incentive for the former employee to seek out a lower cost community, knowing that lower wages in the area will be offset (although only in part) by the employer's continuing payment.  A different incentive, and sometimes union agreements, encourage the original employer to persist in trying to rehire the employee where feasible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And there are countless variations in the underlying circumstances:  an employee may move for good reasons or bad;  reasons may be economic or highly personal;  a new job offer may require a move back or elsewhere, and may come from the old employer or a new one;  and a refusal to move again may reflect any of these various reasons.  Similarly, the financial impact on the claimant and the employer will vary greatly from case to case, depending in part on the difference in costs and wage rates in two communities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Review Board's lack of policy authority, we would be sorely tempted to follow its lead if its decisions on the relocation issue scythed a clear and consistent path.  Twelve circuit courts are no substitute for one coherent agency policy.  But so far as we can discern, the Review Board tends to resolve these cases on their facts, with one major qualification:  little if any weight is given to so-called \"personal\" reasons of the employee for choosing to move or refusing to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only circuit court precedent directly on point endorses an \"on the facts\" approach.  See v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678824\"><a href=\"/opinion/678824/elwood-l-see-v-washington-metropolitan-area-transit-authority-director/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1994).  There the court ruled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>[T]he ALJ's determination of the relevant labor market should include consideration of such factors as the claimant's residence at the time of his filing for disability benefits, his motivation for relocation after the accident, the legitimacy of that motivation, the duration of his stay in that new community, his ties to that new community, the availability of suitable job opportunities in the new community as opposed to those in his former residence, and the degree of undue prejudice to the employer in proving suitable alternative employment in the claimant's new community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">See, 36 F.3d at 383.   Notably, one recent Review Board decision has embraced See 's multifactor approach.  Wilson v. Crowley Maritime, 30 B.R.B.S.

We have obtained the brief submitted by the Department in See and discovered that the Department also wrote in its brief:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[C]onsideration should be afforded to such factors as whether the claimant has relocated for a proper purpose, or in an effort to frustrate an employer's ability to establish suitable alternative employment, and whether a finding that the relevant labor market is the community to which the claimant has relocated would unduly prejudice the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brief of the Respondent Director, OWCP at 22.  The Department's litigating position is not a binding administrative determination, 1 Davis &amp; Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise &#167; 3.5 (3d ed.  1994 &amp; Supp.1995), but it is informative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are content to follow the lead of See, the Secretary's brief and the latest Review Board decision and also endorse an \"on the facts\" approach.  But to provide some structure for analysis, we think that the employee's chosen community is presumptively the proper choice for determining earning capacity, and that the employer bears the burden of showing that the original move, or a refusal to move again, is unjustified.  Cf. Avondale Shipyards, 967 F.2d at 1042-43.   Of course, where knowledge about reasons is possessed only by the employee, his silence may be telling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to what constitutes justification, we agree that economic judgments ought generally to control.  Care for an aged parent is to be commended;  but a claimant who turns down a better job elsewhere for personal reasons has a much weaker claim to be subsidized by the employer.  See Nguyen, 19 B.R.B.S. at 145.  Some state courts may be more liberal;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  but until Congress (or possibly the Secretary) decides otherwise, we think that the Review Board's economic emphasis is consistent with the Act's own goals of fair compensation and encouragement of work.  See New Orleans (Gulfwide) Stevedores v. Turner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396152\"><a href=\"/opinion/396152/new-orleans-gulfwide-stevedores-and-employers-national-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span>, 1042 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the employee's reasons are economically sound, both See and the Secretary's brief suggest that in some cases the employer may still suffer undue \"prejudice\" if the disparity in wages between the new and old locations is extreme.  Possibly, the statutory language of section 908(h), quoted above, is broad enough to permit some equitable adjustment (e.g., pegging the earning capacity at some intermediate level).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  However this may be, we accept that the \"prejudice\" concept may be a reasonable safeguard in extreme cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn finally to the decision of the ALJ in this case.  While the ALJ may have no \"policy\" authority, deference is still ordinarily due to the frontline adjudicator in applying general standards to particular facts.  See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span>, 488, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></span> (1951).  This is a different kind of respect than deference to a policymaker.  It is the deference ordinarily accorded by appeals courts to trial courts, based on their superior feel for the facts and the situation, even where the standards to be applied are well settled.  See, e.g., United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196554\"><a href=\"/opinion/196554/united-states-v-cruz-quilan/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But despite this deference, the present decision needs to be reexamined.  The ALJ in this case effectively adopted a legal rule that makes a bona fide higher-pay offer by the original employer almost conclusive even where it compels relocation back to the original job site.  Indeed, the ALJ cited Review Board precedent for the view that any suitable job in the original location of injury could be used to cap the employee's disability benefits.  E.g., Nguyen, 19 B.R.B.S. at 145.  If this is the Review Board's view, we think that it goes too far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have already said, it seems to us that the employee's community is presumptively the place for measuring his earning capacity, unless and until the employer shows that the move to the community was unreasonable, or that a refusal to move again is unreasonable, or that (reasonableness aside), the prejudice to the employer is just too severe.  Bath has not claimed here that it was unreasonable for Wood to move to Shortsville, and we are at least skeptical that the difference between Wood's insulator wages and his Shortsville income suggests severe prejudice to Bath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the issue probably comes down to whether it was reasonable for Wood to refuse to move back to take the proffered job in Bath, while insisting on continued payments for partial disability.  The ALJ thought not, primarily because he viewed Wood as having refused to move solely upon personal grounds.  We agree that the personal grounds are not an excuse for refusing to take a better job.  Still, it is not clear why Wood's personal motives should count against him if the job actually offered did not warrant a move back to Bath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This comparison is primarily economic, as we gloss the Act, but the higher wages in Bath can hardly be conclusive.  Here, it appears from the record that Wood was earning reasonably good wages in Shortsville with no apparent risk of layoff and with some prospect of promotion.  Bath's offer of somewhat better pay at the old location, but apparently with minimal formal security as to tenure, was not on the surface plainly a better offer, even from a strictly economic standpoint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This surface impression is open to correction.  There is some record evidence, not mentioned by the ALJ, that the job offered by Bath was likely to endure longer than the 30-day guarantee (the test is what Wood knew, not what happened later).  But other evidence, also not mentioned, indicates that Wood might have foregone promotion opportunities by moving.  Possibly, under a standard of reasonableness, the ALJ might have decided the case either way.  But that standard of reasonableness, and not some automatic right of the employer to require a move back, ought to govern until Congress or the Secretary says otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Chenery doctrine--that the agency must be judged upon the grounds it has given--thus warrants a remand for further proceedings.  See SEC v. Chenery Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 87-88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 459-60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103770\"><a href=\"/opinion/103770/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span> (1943).  Wood's move to Shortsville has not been challenged.  Thus, on remand the ALJ should treat Shortsville as presumptively the relevant community for determining Wood's earning capacity, unless and until Bath proves that his decision to remain there was unreasonable, taking account centrally of economic factors, or that this is the rare case of undue prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We intend no criticism of the ALJ who deemed himself bound by earlier Review Board precedent.  If that precedent had been blessed by the Secretary, we might also defer;  but the Secretary's position appears closer to that of See, and even the Review Board has now moved in that direction.  These new developments, which post-date the ALJ's decision, reinforce our view that this case needs a fresh look.  We do not say that it necessarily requires a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the ALJ, affirmed by the Review Board through inaction, is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with the standards set forth in this opinion.  Whether any further evidentiary hearing is required is a matter within the sound discretion of the ALJ.  Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Vasquez v.
