Benjamin, Jr. with whom Thompson &amp; Bowie was on\r\nbrief for appellee Town of Winthrop.\r\n\nApril 29, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This is an appeal from the\r\ndistrict court's dismissal of a complaint filed by Alfred and Gale\r\nHasenfus, on behalf of themselves and their minor child Jamie\r\nHasenfus, arising out of Jamie's attempted suicide at school.  The\r\ncomplaint set forth claims under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and state law\r\nagainst the Town of Winthrop, Maine, and others.  The facts alleged\r\nin the complaint are as follows.\r\nIn the spring of 1996, Jamie was a 14-year-old student in\r\nthe 8th grade of the Winthrop Middle School.  On May 2 of that\r\nyear, Jamie was reprimanded by her teacher, Carlo Kempton, for\r\nmisconduct during a physical education class on the school softball\r\nfield.  Kempton told Jamie to return to the locker room.  No one\r\nfrom the school staff was supervising the locker room.  After\r\nreturning to the locker room, Jamie tried to hang herself. \r\nClassmates found Jamie and called for emergency help.  Jamie\r\nsurvived but, at first in a coma, spent several weeks in the\r\nhospital and was left with permanent impairments.  \r\nThe complaint describes two other incidents as background\r\nto the attempted suicide.  One was that Jamie had been raped when\r\nshe was 13 and later underwent the further trauma of testifying\r\nagainst the rapist.  School officials were aware of the rape. \r\nJamie had reported it to the school nurse, Jackie Kempton (wife of\r\nthe gym teacher, Carlo Kempton), and was later counseled by the\r\nschool nurse and school guidance counselor.  According to the\r\ncomplaint, Carlo Kempton knew or should have known of the rape and\r\nshould not have sent Jamie \"alone and unsupervised away from the\r\narea he was monitoring when he knew or should reasonably have known\r\nthat she was despondent or distressed.\" \r\nThe other background event was that seven other students\r\nin the Winthrop Middle School had also attempted suicide in the\r\nthree months prior to May 1996.  Several of those attempts had\r\noccurred at school or school events, and Jamie apparently knew or\r\nwas associated with at least two of those students.  According to\r\nthe complaint, the school failed to take various possible measures\r\nto cope with the epidemic, such as offering special counseling and\r\nmonitoring programs within the school and providing more\r\ninformation to parents about the outbreak.\r\nOn April 30, 1998, just short of two years after Jamie's\r\nsuicide attempt, the Hasenfus parents brought suit in the district\r\ncourt on behalf of Jamie and themselves.  The defendants, in\r\naddition to the town and its board of education, included three\r\nindividuals:  the superintendent of schools, the principal of\r\nJamie's school, and the gym teacher (Carlo Kempton).  The counts\r\nwith which we are centrally concerned were based upon section 1983;\r\nthey charged that specific  acts and omissions by defendants acting\r\nunder color of state law deprived Jamie of her Fourteenth Amendment\r\nrights, including, inter alia, rights to life and physical safety. \r\nThe parents alleged the infringement of their right to family\r\nintegrity.  \r\nThe gist of the wrongful acts charged to the town, school\r\nboard, superintendent, and principal were the failure to take a\r\nrange of preventive actions listed in the complaint to cope with\r\nthe suicide epidemic and, specifically as to Jamie, three narrower\r\nfailures or mistakes discussed at the end of this opinion.  Carlo\r\nKempton's alleged wrongful acts were reprimanding Jamie in front of\r\nher classmates and sending her alone to the locker room.  The same\r\nfacts were alleged as violations of the Maine Constitution and as\r\ncommon law torts of negligence and negligent infliction of\r\nemotional distress.\r\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the section 1983 counts\r\nfor failure to state a claim, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and asked\r\nthat the state claims then be dismissed for lack of federal\r\njurisdiction, Wagner v. Devine, 122 F.3d 53, 57-58 (1st Cir. 1997),\r\ncert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 880 (1998).  The magistrate judge\r\nrecommended this course (with one variation irrelevant here), and\r\nthe district court thereafter approved the recommendation.  This\r\nappeal followed.  On review, we take the factual allegations of the\r\ncomplaint as true, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the\r\nplaintiffs.  Garita Hotel L.P. v. Ponce Fed. Bank, FSB, 958 F.2d\r\n15, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThe central question for us on this appeal is whether the \r\nconduct attributed to the defendants violates the federal\r\nConstitution so far as it protects against state action depriving\r\none of life or liberty without \"due process of law.\"  The most\r\nfamiliar dimension of due process is protection of procedural\r\nrights, but the due process concept has been extended by the\r\nSupreme Court to incorporate substantive protections.  See\r\nWashington v. Glucksberg, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 2267 (1997).  These\r\ninclude not only a selected set taken from the Bill of Rights but\r\nalso a generalized protection sometimes labeled \"substantive due\r\nprocess.\"  Nowak and Rotunda, Constitutional Law  11.3-11.4, at\r\n374-93 (5th ed. 1995).\r\nIn the district court and in their opening brief on\r\nappeal, the Hasenfuses argued forcefully that--contrary to the\r\ndistrict court's view--the school had an affirmative duty to\r\nprotect Jamie as a student entrusted to its care.  In their reply\r\nbrief, the Hasenfuses suddenly purport to abandon reliance on this\r\ntheory, saying that they prefer to concentrate their appeal on\r\nKempton's alleged danger-creating conduct.  But elsewhere the reply\r\nbrief itself returns to the allegation that school officials acted\r\nrecklessly \"by standing by throughout the suicide epidemic and\r\ndoing nothing to identify at-risk students or to train personnel to\r\neffectively deal with these students at risk.\"\r\nIn the complaint, the principal conduct charged against\r\nthe defendants--apart from Kempton--was their failure to take\r\nmeasures to cope with the rash of attempted suicides at the school. \r\nUnder common law, inaction rarely gives rise to liability unless\r\nsome special duty of care exists.  Restatement (Second) of Torts \r\n314 &amp; cmt. a (1965).  In DeShaney v. Winnebago County, 489 U.S. 189\r\n(1989), the Supreme Court took the same view of substantive due\r\nprocess obligations, holding that ordinarily a state's failure to\r\nintervene to prevent harm to an individual by a private actor is\r\nnot a constitutional violation.\r\nThe main exceptions to this proposition are incarcerated\r\nprisoners or involuntarily committed mental patients for whom a set\r\nof unique rules has developed.  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97\r\n(1976); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  In such cases,\r\nfailures to act--e.g., to provide medical care or to stop one\r\ninmate from assaulting another--may comprise a due process or other\r\nconstitutional violation because the state-imposed circumstance of\r\nconfinement prevents such individuals from helping themselves. \r\nLiability then arises under section 1983 if the plaintiff shows\r\nthat the inaction was malicious or reflected the official's\r\n\"deliberate indifference\" to the welfare of  the prisoner or\r\ninmate.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994).\r\nThe plaintiffs urge that Jamie is similar to the\r\nprisoners and patients because school attendance is compulsory and\r\nbecause in some measure the school authorities act in loco\r\nparentis.  The circuits that have confronted this issue have\r\nuniformly rejected this argument, holding that school children are\r\nnot captives of the school authorities and the basic responsibility\r\nfor their care remains with their parents.  The Hasenfuses'\r\nposition is especially difficult to accept outright since the\r\nSupreme Court has come pretty close to rejecting it in a recent\r\ndictum which specifically contrasted DeShaney:\r\n  [W]e do not, of course, suggest that public\r\nschools as a general matter have such a degree\r\nof control over children as to give rise to a \r\nconstitutional \"duty to protect.\"\r\n\nVernonia Sch. Dist. v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 655 (1995). See also\r\nWyke, 129 F.3d at 569.\r\nNevertheless, we are loath to conclude now and forever\r\nthat inaction by a school toward a pupil could never give rise to\r\na due process violation.  From a commonsense vantage, Jamie is not\r\njust like a prisoner in custody who may be owed broad (but far from\r\nabsolute) \"duty to protect.\"  But neither is she just like the\r\nyoung child in DeShaney who was at home in his father's custody and\r\nmerely subject to visits by busy social workers who neglected to\r\nintervene.  For limited purposes and for a portion of the day,\r\nstudents are entrusted by their parents to control and supervision\r\nof teachers in situations where--at least as to very young\r\nchildren--they are manifestly unable to look after themselves.\r\nThus, when Vernonia says that the schools do not \"as a\r\ngeneral matter\" have a constitutional \"duty to protect,\" perhaps in\r\nnarrow circumstances there might be a \"specific\" duty.  If Jamie\r\nhad suffered a heart attack in the classroom, and the teacher knew\r\nof her peril, could the teacher merely leave her there to die\r\nwithout summoning help?  If a six-year old child fell down an\r\nelevator shaft, could the school principal ignore the matter?  Of\r\ncourse, school officials might be held liable in tort for such\r\nomissions, but common law liability aside, we hesitate to say for\r\ncertain that substantive due process plays no role.\r\nYet even if we assume arguendo that in narrow\r\ncircumstances the Supreme Court might find a due process obligation\r\nof the school or school employees to render aid to a student in\r\nperil--and Vernonia invites some caution--it would require pungent\r\nfacts.  The basic due process constraint, where substance and not\r\nprocedure is involved, is against behavior so extreme as to \"shock\r\nthe conscience.\"  County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 118 S. Ct. 1708,\r\n1717-19 (1998); Rochin v. People of California, 342 U.S. 165, 172\r\n(1952).  Outside of a few narrow categories, like the safeguarding\r\nof prisoners who have been wholly disabled from self-protection,\r\nthis means conduct that is truly outrageous, uncivilized, and\r\nintolerable.  Lewis, 118 S. Ct. at 1717.\r\nThe Supreme Court has regularly cited Rochin's test with\r\napproval, see Lewis, 118 S. Ct. at 1717 (citing cases), but has\r\nalmost never found it to be violated even where the state has\r\naffirmatively caused the harm.  The few circuit cases that have\r\nfound or posited possible liability under a shock-the-conscience\r\nrubric since Rochin have usually involved egregious facts.  E.g.,\r\nRogers v. City of Little Rock, 152 F.3d 790 (8th Cir. 1998) (rape\r\nby police officer in connection with car stop); Armstrong v.\r\nSquadrito, 152 F.3d 564 (7th Cir. 1998) (57-day unlawful detention\r\ndespite repeated requests).  The omissions charged against the\r\nschool authorities here are not even close to violating this\r\noutrageousness standard.\r\nThe outcome here would be no different under the more\r\nplaintiff-friendly standard developed in prison cases.  Even under\r\nthis standard, courts have been very reluctant to find prison\r\nguards liable for failing to prevent suicides unless confronted\r\nwith specific imminent threats.  E.g., Bowen v. City of Manchester,\r\n966 F.2d 13, 16-18 (1st Cir. 1992); Manarite v. City of\r\nSpringfield, 957 F.2d 953 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 837\r\n(1992).  The Supreme Court has recently equated \"deliberate\r\nindifference\" in prison cases with criminal recklessness, Farmer,\r\n511 U.S. at 837-39, which is certainly not present here.  Further,\r\nin Lewis the court declined to employ a deliberate indifference\r\nstandard at all in a non-prison case where the situation involved\r\na complicated balancing of factors and choices rather than a clear\r\nright or wrong answer.  Lewis, 118 S. Ct. at 1720.\r\nAttempted suicide by school-age children is no slight\r\nmatter; but it has no single cause and no infallible solution.  \r\nSee Governor's Task Force on Adolescent Suicide &amp; Self-Destructive\r\nBehaviors, Adolescent Suicide 42-61 (1996).  Different schools will\r\nreact differently, depending upon resources, available information,\r\nand the judgment of school and public health authorities, who may\r\nfear making a bad situation worse.  Absent a showing that the\r\nschool affirmatively caused a suicide, the primary responsibility\r\nfor safeguarding children from this danger, as from most others, is\r\nthat of their parents; and even they, with direct control and\r\nintimate knowledge, are often helpless.  Possibly there was school\r\nnegligence here--one would need more information to make a\r\njudgment--but negligence is not a due process violation.  Daniels\r\nv. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 332-33 (1986).\r\nWe turn now from the charge of inaction made against the\r\ntown and other school officials to the claims against Carlo Kempton\r\nthat do charge him with affirmative acts, specifically, the public\r\nreprimand of Jamie and her banishment to the unsupervised locker\r\nroom.  Here, DeShaney does not even arguably foreclose liability\r\nwhich is presumably why this issue is stressed in the reply brief.\r\nWhere a state official acts so as to create or even markedly\r\nincrease a risk, due process constraints may exist, even if\r\ninaction alone would raise no constitutional concern.  But once\r\nagain, the behavior must be conscience-shocking or outrageous.  See\r\nLewis, 118 S. Ct. at 1717-19.\r\nKempton reprimanded a 14-year-old student for misbehavior\r\nand sent her out of class, something that occurs pretty regularly\r\nat schools across the country.  For the first time at oral\r\nargument, plaintiffs' counsel described the circumstances of\r\nJamie's dismissal from the gym class.  Counsel said that several of\r\nJamie's classmates had been harassing Jamie about the rape she had\r\nsuffered and about her decision to testify against the perpetrator. \r\nIn response to the harassment on this occasion, Jamie became highly\r\nagitated, shouting obscenities and threatening unspecified acts of\r\nviolence against those around her.\r\nOn appeal, the granting of a motion to dismiss is tested\r\nagainst the factual allegations in the complaint.  Gooley v. Mobil\r\nOil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir. 1988).  Even if these\r\nadditional facts had been mentioned in the complaint--and they were\r\nnot--it is not alleged that Jamie threatened to kill herself then\r\nor at any other time known to Kempton.  At most, he may have known\r\nthat she had suffered a rape a year before and that some other\r\nstudents at the school had attempted suicide.  It would be hard to\r\nwrest even a claim of negligence out of these facts.  To say that\r\nKempton acted maliciously to cause harm to Jamie, or otherwise\r\nacted in a way that should shock the conscience, is not a remotely\r\nplausible interpretation of the facts alleged in the complaint and\r\nat oral argument.\r\nOnly one circuit case cited to us has found a triable\r\nissue on anything remotely like these facts and its own facts were\r\nmore aggravated.  In Armijo, 159 F.3d 1253, school officials sent\r\nhome a 16-year-old special education student for violent behavior\r\nat school.  The student had earlier threatened to kill himself and,\r\ncontrary to school policy, the officials did not notify his parents\r\nthat he had been sent home, where the student had access to\r\nfirearms--a fact school officials were alleged to have known. \r\nAlone at home, the student shot himself.  His parents then sued,\r\nalleging inter alia a substantive due process claim, and the case\r\nwent to the Tenth Circuit on an interlocutory appeal.   \r\nThe Tenth Circuit held that DeShaney barred any\r\naffirmative duty to protect based on a \"custodial relationship\"\r\nbetween student and school.  Armijo, 159 F.3d at 1261-62.  But the\r\ncourt also said liability might be based on the school's\r\naffirmative act--sending the student home alone--if it increased\r\nthe danger to the child and also met the \"shocks-the-conscience\"\r\ntest.  Id. at 1262.  The court said that the latter test might be\r\nmet if at trial the school officials were also shown to have known\r\nthat the child in question had previously threatened suicide, was\r\nnow distraught, was a special education pupil not fully able to\r\ncare for himself, and had access at home to firearms.  Id. at 1263-\r\n64.\r\nWhether or not one agrees with the Tenth Circuit that\r\nsuch behavior would be conscience-shocking and not merely seriously\r\nnegligent, the assumed facts are at least very troubling,\r\nespecially as to any participating official who knew both of the\r\nsuicide threat and the available gun.  Even so, the facts in that\r\ncase go a step beyond the typical endangerment cases cited by the\r\nTenth Circuit, cases that involve manifestly outrageous behavior by\r\nthe authorities certain to cause harm.  See Dwares, 985 F.2d at 96\r\n(police encourage skinheads to beat up flag-burning demonstrators);\r\nRoss, 910 F.2d at 1429-34 (deliberate state interference with\r\nprivate rescue attempt).  If sound, the Tenth Circuit decision is\r\nat the outer limit, and does not come close to embracing Kempton's\r\nactions.\r\nThree other alleged mistakes are all attributed to the\r\nschool authorities in the complaint apart from their failure to\r\nprevent Jamie's suicide attempt.  Two of the three--the failure to\r\ndiscover Jamie in timely fashion and the failure to act reasonably\r\nand appropriately when she was discovered--are bare conclusions and\r\nare not supported by any factual allegations in the complaint or\r\nelsewhere in the district court.  DM Research v. College of\r\nAmerican Pathologists, 1999 WL 104446 *2-3, to be reported at 170\r\nF.3d 53 (1st Cir. 1999).  The third claim, that the school told\r\nother parents that Jamie had attempted suicide, is not a due\r\nprocess violation.  Cf. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 711-12 (1976).\r\nIn closing, we emphasize again that the due process\r\nclause is not a surrogate for local tort law or state statutory and\r\nadministrative remedies. The federal courts have no general\r\nauthority to decide when school administrators should introduce\r\nsuicide prevention programs, or whether an unruly or upset school\r\nchild should be sent out of class, or what should be said to other\r\nparents about a tragic incident at school.  Substantive due process\r\nis not a license for judges to supersede the decisions of local\r\nofficials and elected legislators on such matters.  Cf. Collins v.\r\nCity of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 128-29 (1992).  \r\nIn principle, Maine law does allow civil claims by\r\ncitizens for serious misconduct by state or local officials, and\r\nthe district court's dismissal in this case was without prejudice\r\nto the assertion of the Hasenfuses' state claims in state court. \r\nAs is quite common, Maine provides broad immunity protection for\r\nits officials, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14,  8104-D, 8111, grants\r\ngovernmental entities immunity from civil suit with certain\r\nexceptions possibly not applicable here, id.  8103, 8104-A, and\r\nplaces a monetary cap on the amount of damages available against\r\nindividual employees and the government itself, id.  8104-D,\r\n8105.  Whether Maine should be more generous is a matter for its\r\ncitizens to decide.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

The complaint set forth claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and state law against the Town of Winthrop, Maine, and others.

Jamie had reported it to the school nurse, Jackie Kempton (wife of the gym teacher, Carlo Kempton), and was later counseled by the school nurse and school guidance counselor.  According to the complaint, Carlo Kempton knew or should have known of the rape and should not have sent Jamie \"alone and unsupervised away from the area he was monitoring when he knew or should reasonably have known that she was despondent or distressed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other background event was that seven other students in the Winthrop Middle School had also attempted suicide in the three months prior to May 1996.

The same facts were alleged as violations of the Maine Constitution and as common law torts of negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss the section 1983 counts for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and asked that the state claims then be dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction, Wagner v. Devine, 122 F.3d 53, 57-58 (1st Cir.1997), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 880, 139 L.Ed.2d 869 (1998).  The magistrate judge recommended this course (with one variation irrelevant here), and the district court thereafter approved the recommendation.  This appeal followed.  On review, we take the factual allegations of the complaint as true, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.  Garita Hotel L.P. v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, FSB, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central question for us on this appeal is whether the conduct attributed to the defendants violates the federal Constitution so far as it protects against state action depriving one of life or liberty without \"due process of law.\"   The most familiar dimension of due process is protection of procedural rights, but the due process concept has been extended by the Supreme Court to incorporate substantive protections.  See Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 2267, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997).  These include not only a selected set taken from the Bill of Rights but also a generalized protection sometimes labeled \"substantive due process.\"   Nowak and Rotunda, Constitutional Law &#167;&#167; 11.3-11.4, at 374-93 (5th ed.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court and in their opening brief on appeal, the Hasenfuses argued forcefully that--contrary to the district court's view--the school had an affirmative duty to protect Jamie as a student entrusted to its care.  In their reply brief, the Hasenfuses suddenly purport to abandon reliance on this theory, saying that they prefer to concentrate their appeal on Kempton's alleged danger-creating conduct.  But elsewhere the reply brief itself returns to the allegation that school officials acted recklessly \"by standing by throughout the suicide epidemic and doing nothing to identify at-risk students or to train personnel to effectively deal with these students at risk.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the complaint, the principal conduct charged against the defendants--apart from Kempton--was their failure to take measures to cope with the rash of attempted suicides at the school.  Under common law, inaction rarely gives rise to liability unless some special duty of care exists.  Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 314 &amp; cmt. a (1965).  In DeShaney v. Winnebago County, 489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), the Supreme Court took the same view of substantive due process obligations, holding that ordinarily a state's failure to intervene to prevent harm to an individual by a private actor is not a constitutional violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main exceptions to this proposition are incarcerated prisoners or involuntarily committed mental patients for whom a set of unique rules has developed.  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976);  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982).  In such cases, failures to act--e.g., to provide medical care or to stop one inmate from assaulting another--may comprise a due process or other constitutional violation because the state-imposed circumstance of confinement prevents such individuals from helping themselves.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Liability then arises under section 1983 if the plaintiff shows that the inaction was malicious or reflected the official's \"deliberate indifference\" to the welfare of the prisoner or inmate.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs urge that Jamie is similar to the prisoners and patients because school attendance is compulsory and because in some measure the school authorities act in loco parentis.   The circuits that have confronted this issue have uniformly rejected this argument, holding that school children are not captives of the school authorities and the basic responsibility for their care remains with their parents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Hasenfuses' position is especially difficult to accept outright since the Supreme Court has come pretty close to rejecting it in a recent dictum which specifically contrasted DeShaney:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e do not, of course, suggest that public schools as a general matter have such a degree of control over children as to give rise to a constitutional \"duty to protect.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernonia Sch. Dist. v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 655, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995).  See also Wyke, 129 F.3d at 569.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we are loath to conclude now and forever that inaction by a school toward a pupil could never give rise to a due process violation.  From a commonsense vantage, Jamie is not just like a prisoner in custody who may be owed broad (but far from absolute) \"duty to protect.\"   But neither is she just like the young child in DeShaney who was at home in his father's custody and merely subject to visits by busy social workers who neglected to intervene.  For limited purposes and for a portion of the day, students are entrusted by their parents to control and supervision of teachers in situations where--at least as to very young children--they are manifestly unable to look after themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, when Vernonia says that the schools do not \"as a general matter\" have a constitutional \"duty to protect,\" perhaps in narrow circumstances there might be a \"specific\" duty.  If Jamie had suffered a heart attack in the classroom, and the teacher knew of her peril, could the teacher merely leave her there to die without summoning help?   If a six-year old child fell down an elevator shaft, could the school principal ignore the matter?   Of course, school officials might be held liable in tort for such omissions, but common law liability aside, we hesitate to say for certain that substantive due process plays no role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet even if we assume arguendo that in narrow circumstances the Supreme Court might find a due process obligation of the school or school employees to render aid to a student in peril--and Vernonia invites some caution--it would require pungent facts.  The basic due process constraint, where substance and not procedure is involved, is against behavior so extreme as to \"shock the conscience.\"  County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1717-19, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998);  Rochin v. People of California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952).  Outside of a few narrow categories, like the safeguarding of prisoners who have been wholly disabled from self-protection, this means conduct that is truly outrageous, uncivilized, and intolerable.  Lewis, 118 S.Ct. at 1717.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has regularly cited Rochin 's test with approval, see Lewis, 118 S.Ct. at 1717 (citing cases), but has almost never found it to be violated even where the state has affirmatively caused the harm.  The few circuit cases that have found or posited possible liability under a shock-the-conscience rubric since Rochin have usually involved egregious facts.  E.g., Rogers v. City of Little Rock, 152 F.3d 790 (8th Cir.1998) (rape by police officer in connection with car stop);  Armstrong v. Squadrito, 152 F.3d 564 (7th Cir.1998) (57-day unlawful detention despite repeated requests).  The omissions charged against the school authorities here are not even close to violating this outrageousness standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outcome here would be no different under the more plaintiff-friendly standard developed in prison cases.  Even under this standard, courts have been very reluctant to find prison guards liable for failing to prevent suicides unless confronted with specific imminent threats.  E.g., Bowen v. City of Manchester, 966 F.2d 13, 16-18 (1st Cir.1992);  Manarite v. City of Springfield, 957 F.2d 953 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 837, 113 S.Ct. 113, 121 L.Ed.2d 70 (1992).  The Supreme Court has recently equated \"deliberate indifference\" in prison cases with criminal recklessness, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837-39, 114 S.Ct. 1970, which is certainly not present here.  Further, in Lewis the court declined to employ a deliberate indifference standard at all in a non-prison case where the situation involved a complicated balancing of factors and choices rather than a clear right or wrong answer.  Lewis, 118 S.Ct. at 1720.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempted suicide by school-age children is no slight matter;  but it has no single cause and no infallible solution.  See Governor's Task Force on Adolescent Suicide &amp; Self-Destructive Behaviors, Adolescent Suicide 42-61 (1996).  Different schools will react differently, depending upon resources, available information, and the judgment of school and public health authorities, who may fear making a bad situation worse.  Absent a showing that the school affirmatively caused a suicide, the primary responsibility for safeguarding children from this danger, as from most others, is that of their parents;  and even they, with direct control and intimate knowledge, are often helpless.  Possibly there was school negligence here--one would need more information to make a judgment--but negligence is not a due process violation.  Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 332-33, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now from the charge of inaction made against the town and other school officials to the claims against Carlo Kempton that do charge him with affirmative acts, specifically, the public reprimand of Jamie and her banishment to the unsupervised locker room.  Here, DeShaney does not even arguably foreclose liability which is presumably why this issue is stressed in the reply brief.  Where a state official acts so as to create or even markedly increase a risk, due process constraints may exist, even if inaction alone would raise no constitutional concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  But once again, the behavior must be conscience-shocking or outrageous.  See Lewis, 118 S.Ct. at 1717-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kempton reprimanded a 14-year-old student for misbehavior and sent her out of class, something that occurs pretty regularly at schools across the country.  For the first time at oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel described the circumstances of Jamie's dismissal from the gym class.  Counsel said that several of Jamie's classmates had been harassing Jamie about the rape she had suffered and about her decision to testify against the perpetrator.  In response to the harassment on this occasion, Jamie became highly agitated, shouting obscenities and threatening unspecified acts of violence against those around her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the granting of a motion to dismiss is tested against the factual allegations in the complaint.  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir.1988).  Even if these additional facts had been mentioned in the complaint--and they were not--it is not alleged that Jamie threatened to kill herself then or at any other time known to Kempton.  At most, he may have known that she had suffered a rape a year before and that some other students at the school had attempted suicide.  It would be hard to wrest even a claim of negligence out of these facts.  To say that Kempton acted maliciously to cause harm to Jamie, or otherwise acted in a way that should shock the conscience, is not a remotely plausible interpretation of the facts alleged in the complaint and at oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only one circuit case cited to us has found a triable issue on anything remotely like these facts and its own facts were more aggravated.  In Armijo, 159 F.3d 1253, school officials sent home a 16-year-old special education student for violent behavior at school.  The student had earlier threatened to kill himself and, contrary to school policy, the officials did not notify his parents that he had been sent home, where the student had access to firearms--a fact school officials were alleged to have known.  Alone at home, the student shot himself.  His parents then sued, alleging inter alia a substantive due process claim, and the case went to the Tenth Circuit on an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit held that DeShaney barred any affirmative duty to protect based on a \"custodial relationship\" between student and school.  Armijo, 159 F.3d at 1261-62.   But the court also said liability might be based on the school's affirmative act--sending the student home alone--if it increased the danger to the child and also met the \"shocks-the-conscience\" test.  Id. at 1262.   The court said that the latter test might be met if at trial the school officials were also shown to have known that the child in question had previously threatened suicide, was now distraught, was a special education pupil not fully able to care for himself, and had access at home to firearms.  Id. at 1263-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not one agrees with the Tenth Circuit that such behavior would be conscience-shocking and not merely seriously negligent, the assumed facts are at least very troubling, especially as to any participating official who knew both of the suicide threat and the available gun.  Even so, the facts in that case go a step beyond the typical endangerment cases cited by the Tenth Circuit, cases that involve manifestly outrageous behavior by the authorities certain to cause harm.  See Dwares, 985 F.2d at 96 (police encourage skinheads to beat up flag-burning demonstrators);  Ross, 910 F.2d at 1429-34 (deliberate state interference with private rescue attempt).  If sound, the Tenth Circuit decision is at the outer limit, and does not come close to embracing Kempton's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three other alleged mistakes are all attributed to the school authorities in the complaint apart from their failure to prevent Jamie's suicide attempt.  Two of the three--the failure to discover Jamie in timely fashion and the failure to act reasonably and appropriately when she was discovered--are bare conclusions and are not supported by any factual allegations in the complaint or elsewhere in the district court.  DM Research v. College of American Pathologists, 170 F.3d 53, 1999 WL 104446 * 2-3, to be reported at 170 F.3d 53 (1st Cir.1999).  The third claim, that the school told other parents that Jamie had attempted suicide, is not a due process violation.  Cf. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 711-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In closing, we emphasize again that the due process clause is not a surrogate for local tort law or state statutory and administrative remedies.  The federal courts have no general authority to decide when school administrators should introduce suicide prevention programs, or whether an unruly or upset school child should be sent out of class, or what should be said to other parents about a tragic incident at school.  Substantive due process is not a license for judges to supersede the decisions of local officials and elected legislators on such matters.  Cf. Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 128-29, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In principle, Maine law does allow civil claims by citizens for serious misconduct by state or local officials, and the district court's dismissal in this case was without prejudice to the assertion of the Hasenfuses' state claims in state court.  As is quite common, Maine provides broad immunity protection for its officials, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167;&#167; 8104-D, 8111, grants governmental entities immunity from civil suit with certain exceptions possibly not applicable here, id. &#167;&#167; 8103, 8104-A, and places a monetary cap on the amount of damages available against individual employees and the government itself, id.  &#167;&#167; 8104-D, 8105.  Whether Maine should be more generous is a matter for its citizens to decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In the case of convicted prisoners, the Eighth Amendment is usually the constitutional provision referred to by the courts;  but the substance of the protection is the same.

The complaint set forth claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and state law against the Town of Winthrop, Maine, and others.  The facts alleged in the complaint are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1996, Jamie was a 14-year-old student in the 8th grade of the Winthrop Middle School.  On May 2 of that year, Jamie was reprimanded by her teacher, Carlo Kempton, for misconduct during a physical education class on the school softball field.  Kempton told Jamie to return to the locker room.  No one from the school staff was supervising the locker room.  After returning to the locker room, Jamie tried to hang herself.  Classmates found Jamie and called for emergency help.  Jamie survived but, at first in a coma, spent several weeks in the hospital and was left with permanent impairments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint describes two other incidents as background to the attempted suicide.  One was that Jamie had been raped when she was 13 and later underwent the further trauma of testifying against the rapist.  School officials were aware of the rape.  Jamie had reported it to the school nurse, Jackie Kempton (wife of the gym teacher, Carlo Kempton), and was later counseled by the school nurse and school guidance counselor.  According to the complaint, Carlo Kempton knew or should have known of the rape and should not have sent Jamie \"alone and unsupervised away from the area he was monitoring when he knew or should reasonably have known that she was despondent or distressed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other background event was that seven other students in the Winthrop Middle School had also attempted suicide in the three months prior to May 1996.  Several of those attempts had occurred at school or school events, and Jamie apparently knew or was associated with at least two of those students.  According to the complaint, the school failed to take various possible measures to cope with the epidemic, such as offering special counseling and monitoring programs within the school and providing more information to parents about the outbreak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 30, 1998, just short of two years after Jamie's suicide attempt, the Hasenfus parents brought suit in the district court on behalf of Jamie and themselves.  The defendants, in addition to the town and its board of education, included three individuals:  the superintendent of schools, the principal of Jamie's school, and the gym teacher (Carlo Kempton).  The counts with which we are centrally concerned were based upon section 1983;  they charged that specific acts and omissions by defendants acting under color of state law deprived Jamie of her Fourteenth Amendment rights, including, inter alia, rights to life and physical safety.  The parents alleged the infringement of their right to family integrity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gist of the wrongful acts charged to the town, school board, superintendent, and principal were the failure to take a range of preventive actions listed in the complaint to cope with the suicide epidemic and, specifically as to Jamie, three narrower failures or mistakes discussed at the end of this opinion.

From a commonsense vantage, Jamie is not just like a prisoner in custody who may be owed broad (but far from absolute) \"duty to protect.\"   But neither is she just like the young child in DeShaney who was at home in his father's custody and merely subject to visits by busy social workers who neglected to intervene.

If Jamie had suffered a heart attack in the classroom, and the teacher knew of her peril, could the teacher merely leave her there to die without summoning help?   If a six-year old child fell down an elevator shaft, could the school principal ignore the matter?   Of course, school officials might be held liable in tort for such omissions, but common law liability aside, we hesitate to say for certain that substantive due process plays no role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet even if we assume arguendo that in narrow circumstances the Supreme Court might find a due process obligation of the school or school employees to render aid to a student in peril--and Vernonia invites some caution--it would require pungent facts.

See Governor's Task Force on Adolescent Suicide &amp; Self-Destructive Behaviors, Adolescent Suicide 42-61 (1996).  Different schools will react differently, depending upon resources, available information, and the judgment of school and public health authorities, who may fear making a bad situation worse.  Absent a showing that the school affirmatively caused a suicide, the primary responsibility for safeguarding children from this danger, as from most others, is that of their parents;  and even they, with direct control and intimate knowledge, are often helpless.  Possibly there was school negligence here--one would need more information to make a judgment--but negligence is not a due process violation.  Daniels v.

Here, DeShaney does not even arguably foreclose liability which is presumably why this issue is stressed in the reply brief.  Where a state official acts so as to create or even markedly increase a risk, due process constraints may exist, even if inaction alone would raise no constitutional concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  But once again, the behavior must be conscience-shocking or outrageous.

For the first time at oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel described the circumstances of Jamie's dismissal from the gym class.  Counsel said that several of Jamie's classmates had been harassing Jamie about the rape she had suffered and about her decision to testify against the perpetrator.  In response to the harassment on this occasion, Jamie became highly agitated, shouting obscenities and threatening unspecified acts of violence against those around her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the granting of a motion to dismiss is tested against the factual allegations in the complaint.

Even if these additional facts had been mentioned in the complaint--and they were not--it is not alleged that Jamie threatened to kill herself then or at any other time known to Kempton.  At most, he may have known that she had suffered a rape a year before and that some other students at the school had attempted suicide.  It would be hard to wrest even a claim of negligence out of these facts.  To say that Kempton acted maliciously to cause harm to Jamie, or otherwise acted in a way that should shock the conscience, is not a remotely plausible interpretation of the facts alleged in the complaint and at oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only one circuit case cited to us has found a triable issue on anything remotely like these facts and its own facts were more aggravated.

The student had earlier threatened to kill himself and, contrary to school policy, the officials did not notify his parents that he had been sent home, where the student had access to firearms--a fact school officials were alleged to have known.  Alone at home, the student shot himself.  His parents then sued, alleging inter alia a substantive due process claim, and the case went to the Tenth Circuit on an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit held that DeShaney barred any affirmative duty to protect based on a \"custodial relationship\" between student and school.  Armijo, 159 F.3d at 1261-62.   But the court also said liability might be based on the school's affirmative act--sending the student home alone--if it increased the danger to the child and also met the \"shocks-the-conscience\" test.  Id. at 1262.   The court said that the latter test might be met if at trial the school officials were also shown to have known that the child in question had previously threatened suicide, was now distraught, was a special education pupil not fully able to care for himself, and had access at home to firearms.  Id. at 1263-64.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not one agrees with the Tenth Circuit that such behavior would be conscience-shocking and not merely seriously negligent, the assumed facts are at least very troubling, especially as to any participating official who knew both of the suicide threat and the available gun.  Even so, the facts in that case go a step beyond the typical endangerment cases cited by the Tenth Circuit, cases that involve manifestly outrageous behavior by the authorities certain to cause harm.  See Dwares, 985 F.2d at 96 (police encourage skinheads to beat up flag-burning demonstrators);  Ross, 910 F.2d at 1429-34 (deliberate state interference with private rescue attempt).  If sound, the Tenth Circuit decision is at the outer limit, and does not come close to embracing Kempton's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three other alleged mistakes are all attributed to the school authorities in the complaint apart from their failure to prevent Jamie's suicide attempt.  Two of the three--the failure to discover Jamie in timely fashion and the failure to act reasonably and appropriately when she was discovered--are bare conclusions and are not supported by any factual allegations in the complaint or elsewhere in the district court.

The federal courts have no general authority to decide when school administrators should introduce suicide prevention programs, or whether an unruly or upset school child should be sent out of class, or what should be said to other parents about a tragic incident at school.  Substantive due process is not a license for judges to supersede the decisions of local officials and elected legislators on such matters.  Cf. Collins v.

As is quite common, Maine provides broad immunity protection for its officials, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167;&#167; 8104-D, 8111, grants governmental entities immunity from civil suit with certain exceptions possibly not applicable here, id. &#167;&#167; 8103, 8104-A, and places a monetary cap on the amount of damages available against individual employees and the government itself, id.  &#167;&#167; 8104-D, 8105.  Whether Maine should be more generous is a matter for its citizens to decide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In the case of convicted prisoners, the Eighth Amendment is usually the constitutional provision referred to by the courts;  but the substance of the protection is the same.
