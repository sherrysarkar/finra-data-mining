Arthur D'Amario, III, has appealed an order\r                           \r\n\nof the district court, dated January 7, 1997, that denied his\r\n\nmotion filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.  60(b).  That denial\r\n\nis  well  supported  by  the November  12,  1996  Report  and\r\n\nRecommendation  of the  magistrate judge, which  the district\r\n\ncourt  accepted and adopted.   Upon our review of appellant's\r\n\nbrief  and  the  record  on appeal,  we  affirm  that denial,\r\n\nessentially for the reasons stated in the magistrate's report\r\n\nand recommendation.\r\n\n     The  January 7, 1997  district court order  also recited\r\n\nthat \"any pleadings, motions, complaints, or other  documents\r\n\nwhich  the plaintiff  hereafter files in  this court  will be\r\n\nimmediately dismissed or  stricken from the record  unless he\r\n\nfiles an  affidavit, under  oath,\" that he  has paid  in full\r\n\n\"all outstanding sanctions imposed over the years in a number\r                \r\n\nof  frivolous  cases  he  has  filed.\"     (Emphasis  in  the\r\n\noriginal).  We  construe this language as  enjoining D'Amario\r\n\nfrom  filing any  pleadings,  motions, complaints,  or  other\r\n\ndocuments that arise from and/or  relate to his claim that he\r\n\nhas a  right to photograph  concerts at the  Providence Civic\r\n\nCenter, including  filings relating  to satellite  litigation\r\n\nthat  D'Amario has  repeatedly initiated  since his  original\r\n\ncomplaint  in  1983.   So  construed,  we  find no  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion in the imposition of  this injunction.  See Cok v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFamily Court of Rhode Island, 985 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 1993)\r                                        \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n(reciting    that   \"[f]ederal    courts   plainly    possess\r\n\ndiscretionary  powers  to  regulate  the conduct  of  abusive\r\n\nlitigants).   We add  that  we have  previously affirmed  the\r\n\ndismissal of a prior lawsuit  for failure to comply with past\r\n\norders  directing  D'Amario   to  pay  attorney's   fees  and\r\n\nsanctions in  his related suits.
