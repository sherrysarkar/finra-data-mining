Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                               \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r                                                      \r\n                Cyr and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r                                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nKevin Robert James on brief pro se.\r                              \r\nChristopher C.

Plaintiff's  papers,   liberally\r                                  \r\n\nconstrued, could be  read as complaining about both  the type\r\n\nof   dental  treatment   supplied   (e.g.,  fillings   versus\r\n\nextraction) and the delay in furnishing it.  It is clear from\r\n\nplaintiff's appellate brief that  he is no longer challenging\r\n\nthe decision to save  his teeth rather than to  extract them,\r\n\nand  plaintiff  has  instead   redirected  his  focus  on  an\r\n\nallegedly  unconstitutional  delay  in furnishing  treatment.\r\n\nHis complaint,  however, failed   to  allege  that the  named\r                                                                         \r\n\ndefendants  were  responsible  for  the  delay.    In  short,\r                      \r\n\nplaintiff failed adequately to allege deliberate indifference\r\n\non the part of the  named defendants.  The magistrate-judge's\r\n\nreport alerted  plaintiff to the deficiency  in general terms\r\n\nand,  effectively,  afforded  plaintiff  an   opportunity  to\r\n\nsupplement his pleadings.  When plaintiff's objections to the\r\n\nmagistrate-judge's report failed to cure the  deficiency, the\r\n\ncourt  did  not  abuse   its  discretion  in  dismissing  the\r\n\ncomplaint.   See Purvis v.  Ponte, 929 F.2d  822, 826-27 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir.  1991) (upholding     1915(d) dismissal  of a  factually\r\n\ninadequate complaint where plaintiff failed,  despite notice,\r\n\nto remedy the omissions).\r\n\n     Plaintiff   contends  he   should  have   been  afforded\r\n\ndiscovery.  We  disagree.  Plaintiff failed  to allege enough\r\n\nto warrant  discovery.  Plaintiff  claimed to have  copies of\r\n\nhis  medical  request slips  and  responses to  them,  yet he\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nfailed to state, for  example, to whom he reported  his pain,\r\n\nwhen, and what the response (or lack of response) was. \r\n\n     Affirmed.
