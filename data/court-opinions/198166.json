Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Yemi Onayemi on Motion for Reactivation/Reconsideration pro\r\nse.\r\n\nOctober 13, 1998\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  We grant appellant's motion to reinstate\r\nthis appeal.  However, the appeal is limited to the district\r\ncourt's denial of appellant's motion for examination of special\r\nissues since this is the only order as to which the May 26,\r\n1998 notice of appeal (the sole notice of appeal in the record)\r\nis timely.  Because the appeal of this order does not present\r\na substantial question, we dispose of it now.\r\n           As this motion essentially sought further discovery,\r\nwe treat it as one filed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).  To be\r\nentitled to Rule 56(f) relief, a party \"must (1) articulate a\r\nplausible basis for the belief that discoverable materials\r\nexist which would raise a trialworthy issue and (2) demonstrate\r\ngood cause for failure to have conducted discovery earlier.\" \r\nReid v. State of New Hampshire, 56 F.3d 332, 341 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The district\r\ncourt's denial of such a motion is reviewed for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  Public Serv. Co. of New Hampshire v. Hudson Light\r\n&amp; Power Dep't, 938 F.2d 338, 346 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n           It is plain that appellant has not met the second\r\nrequirement in this case.  That is, he failed to provide anyexplanation in the motion as to why he waited over two months\r\nafter the district court had entered summary judgment to\r\nrequest further discovery.  We find, as a result, that the\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\r\nmotion.\r\n\n                              -2-\r\n           The judgment of the district court is summarily\r\naffirmed.
