Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Harry C. Batchelder, Jr., Henry H. Rossbacher, Tracy W. Young,\r\nand Rossbacher &amp; Associates on brief for appellant.\r\n Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, and Jean B. Weld,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition.\r\n\nDecember 23, 1998\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  Emilio Encarnacion appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty\r\nplea. He also seeks resentencing on the ground that the\r\ntestimony provided by cooperating witnesses at his sentencing\r\nhearing was obtained in exchange for leniency granted by the\r\ngovernment, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  201(c)(2).  The\r\ngovernment has moved for summary affirmance of appellant's\r\nconviction and sentence.  We grant the motion.\r\n          I.  Motion to Withdraw\r\n          The reason appellant has given for seeking withdrawal\r\nof his guilty plea is that he received ineffective assistance\r\nof counsel from the attorney who represented him in the months\r\nleading up to and including the time that he entered his plea. \r\n\"Even prior to sentencing, defendants who maintain such a\r\nposition must meet the accepted tests for ineffective\r\nassistance before being allowed to withdraw pleas on this\r\nbasis.\" United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1537-38 (1st\r\nCir. 1989).  The district court concluded that appellant had\r\nfailed to meet that test and found, instead, that appellant's\r\nattorney's \r\n          competence was in the range of competence\r\n          required of counsel in criminal cases and\r\n          that his performance did not fall below\r\n          the standard of performance of reasonably\r\n          proficient counsel.  Indeed, [the\r\n          attorney] performed his duties as counsel\r\n          well under the difficult circumstances\r\n          created by an uncooperative and\r\n          manipulative client.\r\n\nDistrict Court Order, February 26, 1998, Docket No. 99.\r\n                             -2-\r\n          We review the district court's determination under an\r\nabuse of discretion standard. See United States v. Isom, 85\r\nF.3d 831, 834 (1st Cir. 1996).  \"The trial court's subsidiary\r\nfactfinding in connection with plea-withdrawal motions can be\r\nset aside only for clear error.  As in kindred contexts,\r\n'[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\r\nfactfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.'\"\r\nPellerito, 878 F.2d at 1538 (citation omitted).  We have\r\ncarefully reviewed the entire record, including the transcripts\r\nof the guilty plea hearing and the hearing on appellant's\r\nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea.  Our review persuades us\r\nthat the district court's findings were not clearly erroneous. \r\nNor did the district court abuse its discretion in rejecting,\r\non the basis of those findings, appellant's motion to withdraw\r\nhis guilty plea.  The denial of that motion is affirmed.\r\n          II. Resentencing Request\r\n          Appellant argues that he should be resentenced\r\nbecause the testimony of the witnesses at his sentencing\r\nhearing \"was obtained through lenient treatment by the\r\ngovernment\" in violation of 18 U.S.C.  201. Appellant's Brief,\r\np. 24.  Because this argument was not raised before the\r\ndistrict court, we apply plain-error review. See United Statesv. Bradstreet, 135 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 118\r\nS.Ct. 1805 (1998); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  \"To be correctable\r\nunder Rule 52(b), an error or defect raised for the first time\r\non appeal must be 'plain,' meaning 'clear' or 'obvious,' at the\r\ntime of appellate consideration [among other requirements].\"\r\nId. (citations omitted).  The alleged error does not meet that\r\nstandard.  In support of his argument, appellant relies on a\r\ndecision by the Tenth Circuit which has been vacated and\r\nrehearing en banc granted. See United States v. Singleton, 144\r\nF.3d 1343 (10th Cir. 1998), rehearing en banc granted, opinion\r\nvacated (July 10, 1998).  Other courts addressing similar\r\nchallenges have rejected the reasoning of the Singletondecision.  See United States v. Juncal, 1998 WL 525800\r\n(S.D.N.Y.); United States v. Arana, et al., 1998 WL 420673\r\n(E.D.Mich.); United States v. Guillaume, 1998 WL 462199 (S.D.\r\nFla.). Under these circumstances, the error (if any) is not\r\n\"plain.\"  Appellant's request for resentencing is denied.\r\n          The government's motion for summary disposition is\r\ngranted. See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
