The district  court,\r\n\nsitting  without  a  jury,  found  that  Utica  indeed  acted\r\n\nunreasonably and in bad faith, but that First State failed to\r\n\nprove that  the underlying claim  could have been  settled at\r\n\nany   time  for   less   than  the   amount  actually   paid.\r\n\nConsequently, the  district  judge  ruled  that  First  State\r\n\nfailed  to prove that it  was harmed by  Utica's actions, and\r\n\nentered judgment  for defendant Utica.

This dispute between insurers\r\n\nis a by-product of  the tragic 1983 drowning of  a five-year-\r\n\nold boy at a  bridge construction site.  The  boy, attempting\r\n\nto traverse a plank leading to a bridge support pier, slipped\r\n\nand fell  into the  river  and drowned.    His body  was  not\r\n\nrecovered for several weeks.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          The  bridge  contractor  had  not   fenced  in  the\r\n\nconstruction site,  which was  adjacent to a  playground, nor\r\n\nhad  it hired security guards or posted the site with warning\r\n\nor  \"no trespassing\"  signs.    Prior  to the  accident,  the\r\n\ncontractor  was   aware  that   children  and  vandals   were\r\n\ntrespassing on the site.  The contractor found more than once\r\n\nthat someone had placed planks to allow access from the shore\r\n\nto the support piers in the middle of the river. \r\n\n          In  November 1983, the  parents, represented by the\r\n\nlaw firm of  Mardirosian &amp; Barber,  brought a wrongful  death\r\n\naction against the contractor in Massachusetts state court.\r\n\n            Utica,  the  primary  liability insurer  for  the\r\n\ncontractor, had  provided a $500,000 policy, of  which it had\r\n\nreinsured $300,000 with Prudential Reinsurance,  limiting its\r\n\nactual  loss exposure to $200,000.  First State had issued an\r\n\nexcess liability policy  to the contractor  in the amount  of\r\n\n$15,000,000.  Utica, as the primary carrier, was obligated to\r\n\nprovide  the contractor with a  defense, and in  late 1983 it\r\n\nretained the firm of Roche &amp; Heifetz for that purpose.\r\n\n          The wrongful  death case  proceeded at  a leisurely\r\n\npace.    During the  six years  following  the filing  of the\r\n\nclaim,   the  parties'   lawyers  had   several  inconclusive\r\n\nsettlement discussions.  On February 6, 1989, two days before\r\n\nthe start of trial, Utica offered its entire  $500,000 policy\r\n\nlimit to  settle the case.   The  offer was rejected.   Utica\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nthen tendered its policy  to First State, effectively turning\r\n\nover control  of the settlement negotiations  to First State.\r\n\nTrial began on February 8, 1989.  On the second day of trial,\r\n\nFirst State made  a $750,000 settlement  offer, but that  was\r\n\nrejected.   Subsequent  offers of  $1,000,000  and $1,100,000\r\n\nwere also rejected.  On the fifth day of trial, with the help\r\n\nof the trial  judge, the  case was settled  for $1,250,000  .\r\n\nUtica thus  paid $500,000 under the  primary policy ($300,000\r\n\nof which was reinsured)  and First State paid $750,000  under\r\n\nthe excess policy.\r\n\n          In November 1989,  First State brought  a diversity\r\n\naction against Utica in the  United States District Court for\r\n\nthe District of Massachusetts,  alleging that Utica's refusal\r\n\nto pursue a reasonable settlement  of the wrongful death case\r\n\ncaused First State  to lose  the $750,000 paid  in excess  of\r\n\nUtica's  policy  limit.   After  a six-day  bench  trial, the\r\n\ndistrict judge ruled that Utica had indeed acted unreasonably\r\n\nand in  bad faith in  not seriously pursuing  settlement long\r\n\nbefore  trial.  But the district judge found that First State\r\n\nhad failed  to prove  that the boy's  parents would  probably\r\n\nhave settled for less than  the $1,250,000 actually paid, and\r\n\nheld  therefore that First State  failed to show  it had been\r\n\nharmed by Utica's actions.\r\n\n          First  State asserts  on  appeal that  the  judge's\r\n\nfactual finding on the potential for a less-costly settlement\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nwas clearly erroneous.   This is a fact-bound appeal,  and we\r\n\nwill focus in  some detail  on the evidence  relevant to  the\r\n\nsettlement question.   Because appellee Utica  has not argued\r\n\nthat the  district judge erred in ruling  that Utica breached\r\n\nits  duty to  pursue  settlement reasonably,  we accept  that\r\n\nruling without  further analysis.   We do note,  though, that\r\n\nthe legal issue  in this case, the duty  of a primary insurer\r\n\nto  an excess  insurer,  is controlled  by Hartford  Casualty\r                                                                         \r\n\nInsurance Co.  v.

Where  there are\r\n          two  permissible  views of  the evidence,\r\n          the  factfinder's   choice  between  them\r\n          cannot be clearly erroneous.\r\n\nAnderson v.

We do not  set aside a district court's  findings of\r\n\nfact unless  \"on the whole of  the record, we form  a strong,\r\n\nunyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"  Cumpiano v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBanco  Santander Puerto  Rico,  902 F.2d  148, 152  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1990).    Because  the  record  in  this  case  supports  two\r\n\npermissible views of the evidence, we discern no clear error.\r\n\nA.   Was settlement  possible within Utica's  $500,000 policy\r                                                                         \r\n\nlimit?\r                  \r\n\n          A number of documents  presented at trial suggested\r\n\nthat the lawyers for the plaintiff-parents had, at one  time,\r\n\nvalued  the  case  in the  $200,000  to  $250,000  range.   A\r\n\nmemorandum  to  Utica  from  defense  attorney Therese  Roche\r\n\nreferred  to a  statement  in 1984  by  one of  the  parents'\r\n\nlawyers that  \"he  was seeking  well  over $100,000.\"    That\r\n\nmemorandum,  however, indicated  that the  parents  were \"not\r\n\nmaking a specific demand.\"   A Utica claims  manager recorded\r\n\nin  a March  1987  memorandum that  he  had spoken  with  the\r\n\nparents' counsel, who had assessed the \"full liability value\"\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nof the case at  $200,000 to $250,000.  Another  memorandum by\r\n\ndefense attorney  Roche to  Utica memorialized an  April 1988\r\n\ndiscussion between Roche and  another lawyer for the parents;\r\n\nthat discussion occurred at  the courthouse after a scheduled\r\n\nsettlement  conference  had  been canceled.    The memorandum\r\n\nstated that the parents'  \"current demand was $200,000, which\r\n\ndoes  not seem  too far out  of line.\"   While  none of these\r\n\ncommunications  were  formal  written  demands,  a factfinder\r\n\ncould reasonably  conclude from them that  a settlement could\r\n\nperhaps have been negotiated at roughly $250,000.      \r\n\n          Those memoranda  did not,  however,  compel such  a\r\n\nfinding;  other   evidence  at   trial  cast  doubt   on  the\r\n\nfeasibility  of  settlement  in  the  $250,000  range.    The\r\n\nplaintiffs  made no  written  demands until  much later,  and\r\n\nthose demands  were for a  significantly larger amount.   The\r\n\nlawyer who allegedly  said he sought \"well over $100,000\" was\r\n\nonly  on the case  a short while,  and he did  not testify in\r\n\nthis trial.  His successor, who was not the partner in charge\r\n\nof  the  case,  did  testify;  he had  purportedly  made  the\r\n\n$200,000  demand.   He  stated  that  he  could not  remember\r\n\ndiscussing any specific numbers, and  he stated that he would\r\n\nnever make a  demand without putting it in writing.   He also\r\n\ntestified that, based on his  personal evaluation of the case\r\n\nat  the time,  he  would have  recommended  that his  clients\r\n\nsettle for \"a figure in the  $250,000 range.\"  The partner in\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\ncharge  of the parents' case testified that he did not recall\r\n\ngiving any lawyer authority  to make a specific demand  or to\r\n\nsettle the case,  and he also testified that he  was not sure\r\n\nif he would have recommended that his clients accept $500,000\r\n\nto settle the  case.   Yet another attorney  testified as  an\r\n\nexpert that demands are  always made in writing.   Thus, from\r\n\nthis  evidence, the  district  judge was  amply justified  in\r\n\nfinding that the parents never authorized a settlement demand\r\n\nin the $200,000 to $500,000 range.  Moreover, the conflicting\r\n\nevidence about what was  said, and when, and what  was meant,\r\n\njustified  the district  judge's conclusion that  First State\r\n\nfailed to  prove the likelihood  of settlement for  less than\r\n\n$500,000.\r\n\n          That conclusion was reinforced  by evidence (and by\r\n\nFirst State's  arguments) that this wrongful  death case had,\r\n\nfrom the start,  obvious potential for  a major verdict,  one\r\n\nwell  over  $500,000,  perhaps  $1,000,000  or  more.    That\r\n\nevidence was critical to the district judge's conclusion that\r\n\nUtica was  unreasonable in not pursuing  an early settlement;\r\n\nthat  same evidence makes it less likely that the parents and\r\n\ntheir  lawyers  would  have  settled  for  $250,000  or  even\r\n\n$500,000.  Our careful review of the entire record  convinces\r\n\nus  that the district judge did not clearly err in concluding\r\n\nthat  First State  failed  to prove  that  the parents  would\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nprobably  have  settled for  an  amount  within the  $500,000\r\n\nprimary policy limits.\r\n\nB.  Was settlement possible between $500,000 and $1,250,000?\r                                                                        \r\n\n          First State  also argues  that  the district  judge\r\n\nerred by not  addressing whether the case  could have settled\r\n\nfor an  amount over $500,000,  but less  than the  $1,250,000\r\n\neventually paid,  had Utica  acted reasonably.   The district\r\n\njudge  recognized  that  question  to be  relevant,  however,\r\n\nframing the  dispositive  causation question  thus: \"[I]s  it\r\n\nprobable,  had Utica  reasonably pursued  a settlement  as it\r\n\nshould  have, that the case would have settled within Utica's\r\n\n$500,000  policy   limit  and,  if  not,   was  the  eventual\r\n\nsettlement of  $1,250,000 larger  than what  might reasonably\r\n\nhave been achieved but for Utica's misfeasance?\"  First State\r                                                                         \r\n\nIns.

In three  separate\r\n\nstatements, the  judge explained that his  judgment was based\r\n\non  his finding that First State had failed to prove that the\r\n\nparents would  have settled for $200,000 or  an amount within\r\n\nthe $500,000 policy limit.  See id. at 1178-79.  Although the\r                                               \r\n\ndistrict judge did not expressly find that First State failed\r\n\nto prove  a  likelihood  of settlement  in  the  $500,000  to\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n$1,250,000 range, our review  of the record reveals  that the\r\n\ncontrary conclusion -- that such a settlement was probable --\r\n\nlacks evidentiary support. \r\n\n          While  we  can speculate  that  a  settlement at  a\r\n\nfigure between  $500,000 and $1,250,000 may  indeed have been\r\n\nlikely,  First State  presented no  evidence to  that effect.\r\n\nThe finding that First  State seeks could be based  only upon\r\n\nspeculation  and surmise.   The  only evidence  of settlement\r\n\ndiscussions  in that  range was  the parents'  formal written\r\n\ndemand in August 1988  for $1,000,000.  That  offer, however,\r\n\nwas expressly based on the belief that the combined insurance\r\n\ncoverage  was  $1,000,000,  as the  defendant  contractor had\r\n\nerroneously stated  in an  interrogatory answer.   The demand\r\n\nwas increased  to $15,000,000  several months later  when the\r\n\nparents' lawyers learned that the total coverage was actually\r\n\n$15,500,000.\r\n\n          No other  evidence in  the record indicates  that a\r\n\nsettlement  between $500,000  and $1,250,000 would  have been\r\n\nacceptable to the parents  and their lawyers.   What evidence\r\n\nthere  is points  to the  opposite  conclusion.   The parents\r\n\nrejected  an offer  of $750,000  two days  before trial,  and\r\n\nrejected offers of  $1,000,000 and  $1,100,000 during  trial,\r\n\nbut  of course those rejections do not negate the prospect of\r\n\nsettlement at  like amounts at an earlier point in time.  The\r\n\ndistrict  judge  found,  as  First  State  argued,  that  the\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n$1,250,000  settlement  actually negotiated  by  First State,\r\n\nafter Utica had  tendered its policy, was reasonable  from an\r\n\ninsurer's perspective.  \r\n\n          It appears  to us  that the district  judge focused\r\n\nhis written opinion on the question of the alleged demand for\r\n\n$200,000 and the potential for settlement in the  $200,000 to\r\n\n$500,000 range, because  that was the thrust of First State's\r\n\nevidentiary presentation.  Because there was no evidence that\r\n\nsettlement in the $500,000  to $1,250,000 range was probable,\r\n\nthe district court did not err in omitting an express finding\r\n\nthat First State  failed to  prove the likelihood  of such  a\r\n\nsettlement.\r\n\nC.  Other Arguments\r                               \r\n\n          We find no merit in First State's argument that the\r\n\ndistrict judge erroneously believed  that, as a legal matter,\r\n\nthe case turned on whether a formal demand for settlement had\r\n\nbeen made by the parents.  The lack of a formal demand was an\r\n\nimportant factor  in the judge's  ruling, but the  opinion is\r\n\nexpressly clear that the  issue was whether settlement  for a\r                                                                  \r\n\nlesser  amount was probable,  not whether a  lower demand was\r                                                                     \r\n\nmade.  See  First State Ins. Co. v. Utica  Mut. Ins. Co., 870\r                                                                    \r\n\nF. Supp. at 1178.\r\n\n          All of the causes of action advanced by First State\r\n\nrequire a  showing that Utica's  action caused harm  to First\r\n\nState, i.e., that  a real  opportunity to settle  at a  lower\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\namount  was  wasted   due  to  Utica's  unreasonableness   or\r\n\nsubjective bad faith.  Because we affirm the district judge's\r\n\nfinding that First State failed  to prove that an opportunity\r\n\nfor  settlement was  lost,  we  need  not address  any  legal\r\n\ndistinctions between the several causes of action.\r\n\n          First  State also  claims that  the district  judge\r\n\nerred in  keeping under  seal documents that  were subpoenaed\r\n\ninto  court from  Prudential Reinsurance,  Utica's reinsurer.\r\n\nThe documents  were withheld from  First State because  of an\r\n\nassertion of  attorney-client privilege.   The district judge\r\n\nreviewed  the documents  in camera  and determined  that they\r                                              \r\n\nwere   not  relevant,   thereby  foreclosing   First  State's\r\n\nchallenge to the assertion of privilege.  \r\n\n          Having  reviewed  the  record  and   First  State's\r\n\narguments  on this  issue,  we find  that  any relevance  the\r\n\ndocuments may have  had concerned only  the issue of  Utica's\r\n\nreasonableness   and  good  faith   in  pursuing  settlement.\r\n\nBecause   the   district  judge   found   that  Utica   acted\r\n\nunreasonably and  in bad  faith, First State  cannot complain\r\n\nabout the sealing of documents relevant to that issue.  First\r\n\nState  made no proffer, nor has it argued on appeal, that the\r\n\ndocuments  contained  evidence probative  of  the dispositive\r\n\ncausation issue,  i.e., the likelihood  of a settlement  at a\r\n\nlower amount.   The critical  fact lacking  in First  State's\r\n\ncase  was  the parents'  willingness  to settle  for  a lower\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\namount,  and  it seems  unlikely that  correspondence between\r\n\nUtica  and Prudential Reinsurance  would contain  evidence on\r\n\nthat issue.  We conclude that there was no prejudice to First\r\n\nState  and thus there is  no reversible error  in the judge's\r\n\nruling on the disputed documents.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          For   the  foregoing   reasons,  the   judgment  is\r\n\naffirmed.

The district court, sitting without a jury, found that Utica indeed acted unreasonably and in bad faith, but that First State failed to prove that the underlying claim could have been settled at any time for less than the amount actually paid.   Consequently, the district judge ruled that First State failed to prove that it was harmed by Utica's actions, and entered judgment for defendant Utica.   First State appeals.   Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by summarizing the facts as found by the district court, reported in detail in First State Insurance Co. v. Utica Mutual Insurance Co., 870 F.Supp. 1168, 1169-74 (D.Mass.1994) (Stearns, J.).   This dispute between insurers is a by-product of the tragic 1983 drowning of a five-year-old boy at a bridge construction site.   The boy, attempting to traverse a plank leading to a bridge support pier, slipped and fell into the river and drowned.   His body was not recovered for several weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bridge contractor had not fenced in the construction site, which was adjacent to a playground, nor had it hired security guards or posted the site with warning or \"no trespassing\" signs.   Prior to the accident, the contractor was aware that children and vandals were trespassing on the site.   The contractor found more than once that someone had placed planks to allow access from the shore to the support piers in the middle of the river.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1983, the parents, represented by the law firm of Mardirosian &amp; Barber, brought a wrongful death action against the contractor in Massachusetts state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Utica, the primary liability insurer for the contractor, had provided a $500,000 policy, of which it had reinsured $300,000 with Prudential Reinsurance, limiting its actual loss exposure to $200,000.   First State had issued an excess liability policy to the contractor in the amount of $15,000,000.   Utica, as the primary carrier, was obligated to provide the contractor with a defense, and in late 1983 it retained the firm of Roche &amp; Heifetz for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wrongful death case proceeded at a leisurely pace.   During the six years following the filing of the claim, the parties' lawyers had several inconclusive settlement discussions.   On February 6, 1989, two days before the start of trial, Utica offered its entire $500,000 policy limit to settle the case.   The offer was rejected.   Utica then tendered its policy to First State, effectively turning over control of the settlement negotiations to First State.   Trial began on February 8, 1989.   On the second day of trial, First State made a $750,000 settlement offer, but that was rejected.   Subsequent offers of $1,000,000 and $1,100,000 were also rejected.   On the fifth day of trial, with the help of the trial judge, the case was settled for $1,250,000.  Utica thus paid $500,000 under the primary policy ($300,000 of which was reinsured) and First State paid $750,000 under the excess policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, First State brought a diversity action against Utica in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Utica's refusal to pursue a reasonable settlement of the wrongful death case caused First State to lose the $750,000 paid in excess of Utica's policy limit.   After a six-day bench trial, the district judge ruled that Utica had indeed acted unreasonably and in bad faith in not seriously pursuing settlement long before trial.   But the district judge found that First State had failed to prove that the boy's parents would probably have settled for less than the $1,250,000 actually paid, and held therefore that First State failed to show it had been harmed by Utica's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State asserts on appeal that the judge's factual finding on the potential for a less-costly settlement was clearly erroneous.   This is a fact-bound appeal, and we will focus in some detail on the evidence relevant to the settlement question.   Because appellee Utica has not argued that the district judge erred in ruling that Utica breached its duty to pursue settlement reasonably, we accept that ruling without further analysis.   We do note, though, that the legal issue in this case, the duty of a primary insurer to an excess insurer, is controlled by Hartford Casualty Insurance Co. v. New Hampshire Insurance Co., 628 N.E.2d 14, 16-19 (Mass.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as here, a district court sits as the trier of fact, its determinations are accorded great respect.  Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206, 1218 (1st Cir.1991).   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> dictates that we review such factual findings only for clear error.   The clear error test is rigorous:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.   Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985).   We do not set aside a district court's findings of fact unless \"on the whole of the record, we form a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"  Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990).   Because the record in this case supports two permissible views of the evidence, we discern no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A. Was settlement possible within Utica's $500,000 policy limit?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of documents presented at trial suggested that the lawyers for the plaintiff-parents had, at one time, valued the case in the $200,000 to $250,000 range.   A memorandum to Utica from defense attorney Therese Roche referred to a statement in 1984 by one of the parents' lawyers that \"he was seeking well over $100,000.\"   That memorandum, however, indicated that the parents were \"not making a specific demand.\"   A Utica claims manager recorded in a March 1987 memorandum that he had spoken with the parents' counsel, who had assessed the \"full liability value\" of the case at $200,000 to $250,000.   Another memorandum by defense attorney Roche to Utica memorialized an April 1988 discussion between Roche and another lawyer for the parents;  that discussion occurred at the courthouse after a scheduled settlement conference had been canceled.   The memorandum stated that the parents' \"current demand was $200,000, which does not seem too far out of line.\"   While none of these communications were formal written demands, a factfinder could reasonably conclude from them that a settlement could perhaps have been negotiated at roughly $250,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those memoranda did not, however, compel such a finding;  other evidence at trial cast doubt on the feasibility of settlement in the $250,000 range.   The plaintiffs made no written demands until much later, and those demands were for a significantly larger amount.   The lawyer who allegedly said he sought \"well over $100,000\" was only on the case a short while, and he did not testify in this trial.   His successor, who was not the partner in charge of the case, did testify;  he had purportedly made the $200,000 demand.   He stated that he could not remember discussing any specific numbers, and he stated that he would never make a demand without putting it in writing.   He also testified that, based on his personal evaluation of the case at the time, he would have recommended that his clients settle for \"a figure in the $250,000 range.\"   The partner in charge of the parents' case testified that he did not recall giving any lawyer authority to make a specific demand or to settle the case, and he also testified that he was not sure if he would have recommended that his clients accept $500,000 to settle the case.   Yet another attorney testified as an expert that demands are always made in writing.   Thus, from this evidence, the district judge was amply justified in finding that the parents never authorized a settlement demand in the $200,000 to $500,000 range.   Moreover, the conflicting evidence about what was said, and when, and what was meant, justified the district judge's conclusion that First State failed to prove the likelihood of settlement for less than $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That conclusion was reinforced by evidence (and by First State's arguments) that this wrongful death case had, from the start, obvious potential for a major verdict, one well over $500,000, perhaps $1,000,000 or more.   That evidence was critical to the district judge's conclusion that Utica was unreasonable in not pursuing an early settlement;  that same evidence makes it less likely that the parents and their lawyers would have settled for $250,000 or even $500,000.   Our careful review of the entire record convinces us that the district judge did not clearly err in concluding that First State failed to prove that the parents would probably have settled for an amount within the $500,000 primary policy limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>B. Was settlement possible between $500,000 and $1,250,000?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State also argues that the district judge erred by not addressing whether the case could have settled for an amount over $500,000, but less than the $1,250,000 eventually paid, had Utica acted reasonably.   The district judge recognized that question to be relevant, however, framing the dispositive causation question thus:  \"[I]s it probable, had Utica reasonably pursued a settlement as it should have, that the case would have settled within Utica's $500,000 policy limit and, if not, was the eventual settlement of $1,250,000 larger than what might reasonably have been achieved but for Utica's misfeasance?\"  First State Ins. Co. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 870 F.Supp. at 1178.   Although it is implicit in his judgment that the district judge answered \"no\" to both prongs of that question, several subsequent statements in the judge's opinion suggest that he did not focus on the second prong.   In three separate statements, the judge explained that his judgment was based on his finding that First State had failed to prove that the parents would have settled for $200,000 or an amount within the $500,000 policy limit.   See id. at 1178-79.   Although the district judge did not expressly find that First State failed to prove a likelihood of settlement in the $500,000 to $1,250,000 range, our review of the record reveals that the contrary conclusion--that such a settlement was probable--lacks evidentiary support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we can speculate that a settlement at a figure between $500,000 and $1,250,000 may indeed have been likely, First State presented no evidence to that effect.   The finding that First State seeks could be based only upon speculation and surmise.   The only evidence of settlement discussions in that range was the parents' formal written demand in August 1988 for $1,000,000.   That offer, however, was expressly based on the belief that the combined insurance coverage was $1,000,000, as the defendant contractor had erroneously stated in an interrogatory answer.   The demand was increased to $15,000,000 several months later when the parents' lawyers learned that the total coverage was actually $15,500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No other evidence in the record indicates that a settlement between $500,000 and $1,250,000 would have been acceptable to the parents and their lawyers.   What evidence there is points to the opposite conclusion.

Utica Mutual Insurance Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></span>, 1169-74 (D.Mass.1994) (Stearns, J.).   This dispute between insurers is a by-product of the tragic 1983 drowning of a five-year-old boy at a bridge construction site.   The boy, attempting to traverse a plank leading to a bridge support pier, slipped and fell into the river and drowned.   His body was not recovered for several weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bridge contractor had not fenced in the construction site, which was adjacent to a playground, nor had it hired security guards or posted the site with warning or \"no trespassing\" signs.   Prior to the accident, the contractor was aware that children and vandals were trespassing on the site.   The contractor found more than once that someone had placed planks to allow access from the shore to the support piers in the middle of the river.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1983, the parents, represented by the law firm of Mardirosian &amp; Barber, brought a wrongful death action against the contractor in Massachusetts state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Utica, the primary liability insurer for the contractor, had provided a $500,000 policy, of which it had reinsured $300,000 with Prudential Reinsurance, limiting its actual loss exposure to $200,000.   First State had issued an excess liability policy to the contractor in the amount of $15,000,000.   Utica, as the primary carrier, was obligated to provide the contractor with a defense, and in late 1983 it retained the firm of Roche &amp; Heifetz for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wrongful death case proceeded at a leisurely pace.   During the six years following the filing of the claim, the parties' lawyers had several inconclusive settlement discussions.   On February 6, 1989, two days before the start of trial, Utica offered its entire $500,000 policy limit to settle the case.   The offer was rejected.   Utica then tendered its policy to First State, effectively turning over control of the settlement negotiations to First State.   Trial began on February 8, 1989.   On the second day of trial, First State made a $750,000 settlement offer, but that was rejected.   Subsequent offers of $1,000,000 and $1,100,000 were also rejected.   On the fifth day of trial, with the help of the trial judge, the case was settled for $1,250,000.  Utica thus paid $500,000 under the primary policy ($300,000 of which was reinsured) and First State paid $750,000 under the excess policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, First State brought a diversity action against Utica in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Utica's refusal to pursue a reasonable settlement of the wrongful death case caused First State to lose the $750,000 paid in excess of Utica's policy limit.   After a six-day bench trial, the district judge ruled that Utica had indeed acted unreasonably and in bad faith in not seriously pursuing settlement long before trial.   But the district judge found that First State had failed to prove that the boy's parents would probably have settled for less than the $1,250,000 actually paid, and held therefore that First State failed to show it had been harmed by Utica's actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State asserts on appeal that the judge's factual finding on the potential for a less-costly settlement was clearly erroneous.   This is a fact-bound appeal, and we will focus in some detail on the evidence relevant to the settlement question.   Because appellee Utica has not argued that the district judge erred in ruling that Utica breached its duty to pursue settlement reasonably, we accept that ruling without further analysis.   We do note, though, that the legal issue in this case, the duty of a primary insurer to an excess insurer, is controlled by Hartford Casualty Insurance Co. v.

Because the record in this case supports two permissible views of the evidence, we discern no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>A. Was settlement possible within Utica's $500,000 policy limit?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of documents presented at trial suggested that the lawyers for the plaintiff-parents had, at one time, valued the case in the $200,000 to $250,000 range.   A memorandum to Utica from defense attorney Therese Roche referred to a statement in 1984 by one of the parents' lawyers that \"he was seeking well over $100,000.\"   That memorandum, however, indicated that the parents were \"not making a specific demand.\"   A Utica claims manager recorded in a March 1987 memorandum that he had spoken with the parents' counsel, who had assessed the \"full liability value\" of the case at $200,000 to $250,000.   Another memorandum by defense attorney Roche to Utica memorialized an April 1988 discussion between Roche and another lawyer for the parents;  that discussion occurred at the courthouse after a scheduled settlement conference had been canceled.   The memorandum stated that the parents' \"current demand was $200,000, which does not seem too far out of line.\"   While none of these communications were formal written demands, a factfinder could reasonably conclude from them that a settlement could perhaps have been negotiated at roughly $250,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those memoranda did not, however, compel such a finding;  other evidence at trial cast doubt on the feasibility of settlement in the $250,000 range.   The plaintiffs made no written demands until much later, and those demands were for a significantly larger amount.   The lawyer who allegedly said he sought \"well over $100,000\" was only on the case a short while, and he did not testify in this trial.   His successor, who was not the partner in charge of the case, did testify;  he had purportedly made the $200,000 demand.   He stated that he could not remember discussing any specific numbers, and he stated that he would never make a demand without putting it in writing.   He also testified that, based on his personal evaluation of the case at the time, he would have recommended that his clients settle for \"a figure in the $250,000 range.\"   The partner in charge of the parents' case testified that he did not recall giving any lawyer authority to make a specific demand or to settle the case, and he also testified that he was not sure if he would have recommended that his clients accept $500,000 to settle the case.   Yet another attorney testified as an expert that demands are always made in writing.   Thus, from this evidence, the district judge was amply justified in finding that the parents never authorized a settlement demand in the $200,000 to $500,000 range.   Moreover, the conflicting evidence about what was said, and when, and what was meant, justified the district judge's conclusion that First State failed to prove the likelihood of settlement for less than $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That conclusion was reinforced by evidence (and by First State's arguments) that this wrongful death case had, from the start, obvious potential for a major verdict, one well over $500,000, perhaps $1,000,000 or more.   That evidence was critical to the district judge's conclusion that Utica was unreasonable in not pursuing an early settlement;  that same evidence makes it less likely that the parents and their lawyers would have settled for $250,000 or even $500,000.   Our careful review of the entire record convinces us that the district judge did not clearly err in concluding that First State failed to prove that the parents would probably have settled for an amount within the $500,000 primary policy limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>B. Was settlement possible between $500,000 and $1,250,000?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First State also argues that the district judge erred by not addressing whether the case could have settled for an amount over $500,000, but less than the $1,250,000 eventually paid, had Utica acted reasonably.   The district judge recognized that question to be relevant, however, framing the dispositive causation question thus:  \"[I]s it probable, had Utica reasonably pursued a settlement as it should have, that the case would have settled within Utica's $500,000 policy limit and, if not, was the eventual settlement of $1,250,000 larger than what might reasonably have been achieved but for Utica's misfeasance?\"  First State Ins. Co. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 870 F.Supp. at 1178.   Although it is implicit in his judgment that the district judge answered \"no\" to both prongs of that question, several subsequent statements in the judge's opinion suggest that he did not focus on the second prong.   In three separate statements, the judge explained that his judgment was based on his finding that First State had failed to prove that the parents would have settled for $200,000 or an amount within the $500,000 policy limit.   See id. at 1178-79.   Although the district judge did not expressly find that First State failed to prove a likelihood of settlement in the $500,000 to $1,250,000 range, our review of the record reveals that the contrary conclusion--that such a settlement was probable--lacks evidentiary support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we can speculate that a settlement at a figure between $500,000 and $1,250,000 may indeed have been likely, First State presented no evidence to that effect.   The finding that First State seeks could be based only upon speculation and surmise.   The only evidence of settlement discussions in that range was the parents' formal written demand in August 1988 for $1,000,000.   That offer, however, was expressly based on the belief that the combined insurance coverage was $1,000,000, as the defendant contractor had erroneously stated in an interrogatory answer.   The demand was increased to $15,000,000 several months later when the parents' lawyers learned that the total coverage was actually $15,500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No other evidence in the record indicates that a settlement between $500,000 and $1,250,000 would have been acceptable to the parents and their lawyers.   What evidence there is points to the opposite conclusion.   The parents rejected an offer of $750,000 two days before trial, and rejected offers of $1,000,000 and $1,100,000 during trial, but of course those rejections do not negate the prospect of settlement at like amounts at an earlier point in time.   The district judge found, as First State argued, that the $1,250,000 settlement actually negotiated by First State, after Utica had tendered its policy, was reasonable from an insurer's perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears to us that the district judge focused his written opinion on the question of the alleged demand for $200,000 and the potential for settlement in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, because that was the thrust of First State's evidentiary presentation.   Because there was no evidence that settlement in the $500,000 to $1,250,000 range was probable, the district court did not err in omitting an express finding that First State failed to prove the likelihood of such a settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no merit in First State's argument that the district judge erroneously believed that, as a legal matter, the case turned on whether a formal demand for settlement had been made by the parents.   The lack of a formal demand was an important factor in the judge's ruling, but the opinion is expressly clear that the issue was whether settlement for a lesser amount was probable, not whether a lower demand was made.  See First State Ins. Co. v. Utica Mut. Ins.
