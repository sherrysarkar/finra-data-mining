Upon Appellees' Jorge O. and Judith\r\r\n\nSapere (\"Saperes\") motion, the bankruptcy court held Appellant\r\n\nHobby Horizons, Inc. (\"Hobby\") in contempt for willfully\r\n\nviolating the automatic stay,  see 11 U.S.C. S 362(a), and\r\n\nawarded compensatory damages to the Saperes, but declined to\r\n\naward punitive damages. The district court affirmed the\r\n\nbankruptcy court. Hobby now appeals the finding of contempt\r\n\nand the grant of a bankruptcy discharge to the Saperes. The\r\n\nSaperes appeal the denial of punitive damages. We affirm for\r\n\nsubstantially the same reasons as the district court and add\r\n\nonly a few additional comments. \r\n\n          We exercise independent review of the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt's decision in an appeal from a district court's review,\r\n\ngranting \"no special deference to the district court's\r\n\ndeterminations.\"  Grella v.

Typically we review the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's findings of fact for clear error, but\r\n\nsubject its conclusions of law to \r                                             de \r                                                novo review.

In\r\n\nthis case the bankruptcy court made no findings of fact,\r\n\nforcing the district court to make its own findings from the\r\n\nrecord. Accordingly, we independently reviewed the record in\r\n\nanalyzing this appeal. \r\n\n          We are satisfied that the record amply supported the\r\n\ndistrict court's findings of fact that Hobby willfully violated\r\n\nthe stay. Hobby continued pursuing the Saperes despite notice\r\n\nof the bankruptcy filing. On that basis, neither the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nbankruptcy court nor district court erred in holding Hobby in\r\n\ncontempt.

S 362(h) or other\r\n\ncommon law or statutory basis for liability). \r\n\n          We also find that both courts correctly determined\r\n\nthat the Saperes' debt to Hobby was discharged, despite the\r\n\nfact that the Saperes did not list Hobby as a creditor, because\r\n\nHobby had notice of the filing.   See 11 U.S.C. S 523(a)(3)\r\n\n(indicating that discharge is effective with respect to\r\n\nunlisted creditor who had notice or actual notice of the case\r\n\nin time to submit a timely proof of claim). Should Hobby\r\n\ncontinue to insist that this is not a no asset case, it may\r\n\nproceed in accordance with the bankruptcy rules and procedures\r\n\nin its efforts to establish that fact. \r\n\n          Finally, we affirm both courts' decisions not to\r\n\naward punitive damages to the Saperes. The bankruptcy court\r\n\ndeclined to impose punitive damages because it found that Hobby\r\n\nacted out of ignorance rather than malice. While we do not\r\n\ncondone Hobby's actions, we note that Hobby has been required\r\n\nto compensate the Saperes for its conduct.
