We  prefer, however, not to rely  on that portion\r\n\nof the district court's order  which gave res judicata effect\r                                                                  \r\n\nto  American's  internal grievance  procedure.   Instead,  we\r\n\nchoose to  affirm on the  grounds that Ramirez  was dismissed\r\n\nfor just cause under Puerto  Rico law and that Ramirez failed\r\n\nto set forth  sufficient evidence to trigger a presumption of\r\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation on the  part of American.

Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1987)  (explaining that  an  appellate  court can\r\n\naffirm  on  any  independent  ground  made  manifest  in  the\r\n\nrecord).\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.   Ramirez's  original district  court claims  included the\r\nFLSA claim  for retaliatory dismissal,  an age discrimination\r\nclaim   under  Puerto  Rico  law,  claims  for  wrongful  and\r\nretaliatory  dismissal  under  local  severance  law,  and  a\r\ndefamation claim.   Two of  these claims are not  included in\r\nthe  present appeal:  the  age  discrimination  claim,  which\r\nRamirez voluntarily  dismissed,  and  the  defamation  claim,\r\nwhich the district court rejected on grounds of privilege. \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          American  employed  Ramirez  from  1984-1997  as  a\r\n\nticket agent,  and, later, as  a baggage handler.   After two\r\n\nwritten performance advisories,  American terminated Ramirez,\r\n\nciting  as reasons  his failure  to follow  company time  and\r\n\nattendance procedures and  his attempt to  circumvent company\r\n\nrules to his own benefit.\r\n\n          Following  his   dismissal,  Ramirez   submitted  a\r\n\nwritten  grievance  to  American, pursuant  to  the  internal\r\n\ngrievance  procedure  set  forth  in the  employee  handbook.\r\n\nAmerican  upheld the termination and denied Ramirez an appeal\r\n\non  the basis  of tardy  application.   Ramirez  subsequently\r\n\nfiled suit in Puerto Rico district court, and now appeals the\r\n\norder of  summary judgment  rejecting the  FLSA claim  on the\r\n\nmerits  and  all  other  claims  under  the  doctrine of  res\r                                                                         \r\n\njudicata.

American Airlines  Inc.,  957 F.\r                                                                \r\n\nSupp.  359  (D.P.R.   1997)  (equating  American's  grievance\r\n\nprocedure with a binding arbitration).\r\n\n          We  review the award  of summary judgment  de novo,\r                                                                        \r\n\nand  draw  all  reasonable  inferences  in  Ramirez's  favor.\r\n\nGrenier v.  Vermont Log Bldgs.,  Inc., 96 F.3d 559,  562 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir.   1996).    The   record  is  replete   with  documented\r\n\nillustrations of Ramirez's  performance problems and repeated\r\n\nfailure  to   follow  American's  policies   and  procedures.\r\n\nMoreover, American had given Ramirez two  official advisories\r\n\nprior  to his dismissal.   Thus,  there can  be no  basis for\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ninferring that American's stated reason for the discharge was\r\n\nwrongful or pretextual under federal law.\r\n\n          The result is  no different under Puerto  Rico law,\r\n\nwhich provides that an employee  is not entitled to statutory\r\n\nwrongful discharge indemnity  if the employee  was terminated\r\n\nfor just cause.

See P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit 29    185b;  see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nMenzel  v. Western  Auto Supply  Co., 662  F. Supp.  731, 744\r                                                \r\n\n(D.P.R. 1987), aff'd, 848 F.2d 327 (1st Cir. 1988).  As noted\r                                \r\n\nabove,  the  record  here  admits  of  only  one  conclusion:\r\n\nRamirez's  repeated  transgressions  of  company  policy  and\r\n\nprocedures provided American with just cause for termination.\r\n\nSummary judgment  was,  therefore, properly  granted  to  the\r\n\ndefendant.\r\n\n          Although summary judgment  was properly awarded, we\r\n\nhave  some doubt  about  the  district  court's  ruling  that\r\n\nAmerican's internal company grievance procedure, set forth in\r\n\nits employee  handbook, is  the legal  equivalent of  binding\r\n\narbitration  and,  therefore,   bars  judicial  resolution of\r\n\npotential  statutory and constitutional  claims.   As Ramirez\r\n\npoints  out, there is  little in  the way  of back  and forth\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nbargaining  between a  company  and  its  employees  when  an\r\n\nemployment  handbook   is  created,  making   this  situation\r\n\ndistinguishable  from   the  arbitration   provisions  of   a\r\n\ncollective  bargaining  agreement.    This  is  especially so\r\n\nwhere, as  here, the handbook  expressly provides that  it is\r\n\nnot  a  contract  between  the  parties  and  is  subject  to\r\n\nunilateral amendments by American at any time.\r\n\n            Although the district court was correct in noting\r\n\nthe   existence   of  a   strong   federal   policy  favoring\r\n\narbitration, the threshold question for review must always be\r\n\nwhether the agreement to arbitrate was, indeed, voluntary and\r\n\nintentional.    Mitsubushi  Motors Corp.  v. Solar  Chrysler-\r                                                                         \r\n\nPlymouth  Inc.,  473  U.S.  614,   626  (1985).    Given  the\r                          \r\n\napparently  unilateral  and  adhesive  nature  of  American's\r\n\nemployee  handbook, we  do  not  embrace  the  argument  that\r\n\nRamirez voluntarily waived his right to pursue  his claims in\r\n\nfederal court.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    We note  that two  other Circuits  have recently  addressed this\r\nissue.   In Nelson v.  Cyprus Bagdad Copper  Corp., 119 F.3d  756 (9th\r                                                            \r\nCir. 1997), the Ninth Circuit held that signing an acknowledgment form\r\nwhich provided  that the  employee agrees to  \"read and  understand\" a\r\nrevised employee handbook  did not serve to  bind the employee to  the\r\nhandbook's  internal grievance  provisions.   Id. at  761.   The Ninth\r                                                           \r\nCircuit reasoned that: \r\n\n        Merely  signing  the  form  did  not  in  any  way\r\n        constitute a 'knowing agreement to arbitrate,' and\r\n        thereby  to surrender  [the employee's]  statutory\r\n        right [under  the ADA] to  a judicial forum .  . .\r\n        Any bargain to waive the right to a judicial forum\r\n        for civil  rights claims, including  those covered\r\n        by  the   ADA,  in  exchange  for   employment  or\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          Moreover,  we   have  strong  concerns   about  the\r\n\nfundamental  fairness  of  giving  preclusive effect  to  the\r\n\nparticular grievance  procedure  in this  case.   Arbitration\r\n\nproceedings must meet \"the minimal requirements of fairness--\r\n\nadequate notice, a hearing on the evidence, and  an impartial\r\n\ndecision  by the arbitrator.\"   Sunshine Mining Co. v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nSteelworkers, 823 F.2d  1289, 1295 (9th Cir.  1987) (internal\r                        \r\n\nquotations and citations omitted); Bowles Fin. Group, Inc. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nStifel, Nicolaus &amp;  Co., Inc., 22 F.3d 1010,  1013 (10th Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1994).\r\n\n          First, with respect to notice, we are not convinced\r\n\nthat  Ramirez's application  for a hearing  was appropriately\r\n\ndenied  for untimeliness because it appears that American may\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n        continued  employment, must  at least  be express:\r\n        the  choice must  be  explicitly presented  to the\r\n        employee and the employee must explicitly agree to\r\n        waive the specific right in question.  Id. at 761-\r                                                              \r\n        62 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \r\n\n   Similarly,  the  Eighth  Circuit  recently  instructed  that  the\r\nabsence of  such an express waiver precludes  a finding that there has\r\nbeen a  knowing agreement.   See Patterson v. Tenet  Healthcare, Inc.,\r                                                                               \r\n113  F.3d 832, 835  (8th Cir. 1997).   The Patterson  court upheld the\r                                                              \r\nemployee handbook arbitration provision because the arbitration clause\r\nwas both separate  and distinct from other provisions  in the handbook\r\nand was introduced by the heading, \"IMPORTANT!  Acknowledgment Form.\" \r\nId.   Unlike other  provisions  within the  handbook, the  arbitration\r             \r\nclause  used  contractual  language, such  as  \"I  understand\"  and \"I\r\nagree.\"  Id.   Moreover, the form  was signed by the employee, removed\r                      \r\nfrom the handbook,  and given to the Human Resources  Department to be\r\nstored in the employee's personnel file.  Id.  It was only because the\r                                                       \r\ncourt  deemed  these   actions  in  toto  sufficient  to   render  the\r                                                  \r\narbitration  clause \"separate and distinct\"  from the remainder of the\r\nhandbook,  that  the  court  held  that  the  internal  grievance  and\r\narbitration clause constituted an enforceable contract.  Id.       \r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nhave been equally, if not more, to blame for the late filing.\r\n\nSecond, there was no opportunity  for discovery.

We prefer, however, not to rely on that portion of the district court's order which gave res judicata effect to American's internal grievance procedure.  Instead, we choose to affirm on the grounds that Ramirez was dismissed for just cause under Puerto Rico law and that Ramirez failed to set forth sufficient evidence to trigger a presumption of discrimination or retaliation on the part of American.  See Polyplastics, Inc. v. Transconex, Inc., 827 F.2d 859, 860-61 (1st Cir.1987) (explaining that an appellate court can affirm on any independent ground made manifest in the record).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American employed Ramirez from 1984-1997 as a ticket agent, and, later, as a baggage handler.

American upheld the termination and denied Ramirez an appeal on the basis of tardy application.  Ramirez subsequently filed suit in Puerto Rico district court, and now appeals the order of summary judgment rejecting the FLSA claim on the merits and all other claims under the doctrine of res judicata.  See Ramirez v.

Grenier v. Vermont Log Bldgs., Inc., 96 F.3d 559, 562 (1st Cir.1996).  The record is replete with documented illustrations of Ramirez's performance problems and repeated failure to follow American's policies and procedures.  Moreover, American had given Ramirez two official advisories prior to his dismissal.  Thus, there can be no basis for inferring that American's stated reason for the discharge was wrongful or pretextual under federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result is no different under Puerto Rico law, which provides that an employee is not entitled to statutory wrongful discharge indemnity if the employee was terminated for just cause.

See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 &#167; 185b;  see also Menzel v. Western Auto Supply Co., 662 F.Supp. 731, 744 (D.P.R.1987), aff'd, 848 F.2d 327 (1st Cir.1988).  As noted above, the record here admits of only one conclusion:  Ramirez's repeated transgressions of company policy and procedures provided American with just cause for termination.  Summary judgment was, therefore, properly granted to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although summary judgment was properly awarded, we have some doubt about the district court's ruling that American's internal company grievance procedure, set forth in its employee handbook, is the legal equivalent of binding arbitration and, therefore, bars judicial resolution of potential statutory and constitutional claims.  As Ramirez points out, there is little in the way of back and forth bargaining between a company and its employees when an employment handbook is created, making this situation distinguishable from the arbitration provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.  This is especially so where, as here, the handbook expressly provides that it is not a contract between the parties and is subject to unilateral amendments by American at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court was correct in noting the existence of a strong federal policy favoring arbitration, the threshold question for review must always be whether the agreement to arbitrate was, indeed, voluntary and intentional.

Given the apparently unilateral and adhesive nature of American's employee handbook, we do not embrace the argument that Ramirez voluntarily waived his right to pursue his claims in federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we have strong concerns about the fundamental fairness of giving preclusive effect to the particular grievance procedure in this case.  Arbitration proceedings must meet \"the minimal requirements of fairness--adequate notice, a hearing on the evidence, and an impartial decision by the arbitrator.\"  Sunshine Mining Co. v. United Steelworkers, 823 F.2d 1289, 1295 (9th Cir.1987) (internal quotations and citations omitted);  Bowles Fin.  Group, Inc. v.

Second, there was no opportunity for discovery.  See Hoteles Condado Beach v. Union De Tronquistas Local 901, 763 F.2d 34, 39 (1st Cir.1985)(instructing that an arbitrator must afford each party an adequate opportunity to present both evidence and argument);  see also Williams v. Katten, 1996 WL 717447, at * 4-5, (N.D.Ill. Dec. 9, 1996) (discussion of the permissible parameters of limited discovery in an arbitration proceeding).  Third, the decision maker was not a disinterested party, but rather, an American managerial employee.  See Employers Ins. of Wausau v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 933 F.2d 1481, 1491 (9th Cir.1991)(stipulating that fair arbitration proceedings must include non-biased decisionmakers).  Finally, the record reveals that Ramirez was actually denied any review by a hearing officer or panel, which, following the district court's analysis, effectively rendered all of his claims res judicata on the basis of one manager's view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because American had ample just cause to terminate Ramirez's employment and Ramirez presented insufficient evidence to raise an inference of discrimination or retaliation, we uphold the award of summary judgment to American.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

In Nelson v. Cyprus Bagdad Copper Corp., 119 F.3d 756 (9th Cir.1997), the Ninth Circuit held that signing an acknowledgment form which provided that the employee agrees to \"read and understand\" a revised employee handbook did not serve to bind the employee to the handbook's internal grievance provisions.  Id. at 761.   The Ninth Circuit reasoned that:</p>\n        <p>Merely signing the form did not in any way constitute a 'knowing agreement to arbitrate,' and thereby to surrender [the employee's] statutory right [under the ADA] to a judicial forum ... Any bargain to waive the right to a judicial forum for civil rights claims, including those covered by the ADA, in exchange for employment or continued employment, must at least be express:  the choice must be explicitly presented to the employee and the employee must explicitly agree to waive the specific right in question.  Id. at 761-62 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n        <p>Similarly, the Eighth Circuit recently instructed that the absence of such an express waiver precludes a finding that there has been a knowing agreement.  See Patterson v. Tenet Healthcare, Inc., 113 F.3d 832, 835 (8th Cir.1997).  The Patterson court upheld the employee handbook arbitration provision because the arbitration clause was both separate and distinct from other provisions in the handbook and was introduced by the heading, \"IMPORTANT!   Acknowledgment Form.\"  Id.  Unlike other provisions within the handbook, the arbitration clause used contractual language, such as \"I understand\" and \"I agree.\"  Id. Moreover, the form was signed by the employee, removed from the handbook, and given to the Human Resources Department to be stored in the employee's personnel file.  Id.  It was only because the court deemed these actions in toto sufficient to render the arbitration clause \"separate and distinct\" from the remainder of the handbook, that the court held that the internal grievance and arbitration clause constituted an enforceable contract.  Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This is a distinctly different scenario from Garcia v.

In Garcia, the employee utilized step two of American's grievance procedure and, while represented by counsel, had an opportunity to appeal his dispute to a stateside hearing officer.  Id. at 66.   In contrast, Ramirez was denied any opportunity to present his claims to a hearing officer (step two) or panel (step three);  he simply spoke with the General Manager, and was denied any further appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561815\"><a href=\"/opinion/561815/employers-insurance-of-wausau-a-mutual-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1481</span></a></span>, 1491 (9th Cir.1991)(stipulating that fair arbitration proceedings must include non-biased decisionmakers).  Finally, the record reveals that Ramirez was actually denied any review by a hearing officer or panel, which, following the district court's analysis, effectively rendered all of his claims res judicata on the basis of one manager's view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because American had ample just cause to terminate Ramirez's employment and Ramirez presented insufficient evidence to raise an inference of discrimination or retaliation, we uphold the award of summary judgment to American.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

In Nelson v. Cyprus Bagdad Copper Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744130\"><a href=\"/opinion/744130/melton-nelson-lanita-nelson-v-cyprus-bagdad-copper-corporation-cyprus-amax/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1997), the Ninth Circuit held that signing an acknowledgment form which provided that the employee agrees to \"read and understand\" a revised employee handbook did not serve to bind the employee to the handbook's internal grievance provisions.  Id. at 761.   The Ninth Circuit reasoned that:</p>\n        <p>Merely signing the form did not in any way constitute a 'knowing agreement to arbitrate,' and thereby to surrender [the employee's] statutory right [under the ADA] to a judicial forum ... Any bargain to waive the right to a judicial forum for civil rights claims, including those covered by the ADA, in exchange for employment or continued employment, must at least be express:  the choice must be explicitly presented to the employee and the employee must explicitly agree to waive the specific right in question.  Id. at 761-62 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n        <p>Similarly, the Eighth Circuit recently instructed that the absence of such an express waiver precludes a finding that there has been a knowing agreement.  See Patterson v. Tenet Healthcare, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740545\"><a href=\"/opinion/740545/deborah-patterson-v-tenet-healthcare-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span>, 835 (8th Cir.1997).  The Patterson court upheld the employee handbook arbitration provision because the arbitration clause was both separate and distinct from other provisions in the handbook and was introduced by the heading, \"IMPORTANT!   Acknowledgment Form.\"  Id.  Unlike other provisions within the handbook, the arbitration clause used contractual language, such as \"I understand\" and \"I agree.\"  Id. Moreover, the form was signed by the employee, removed from the handbook, and given to the Human Resources Department to be stored in the employee's personnel file.  Id.  It was only because the court deemed these actions in toto sufficient to render the arbitration clause \"separate and distinct\" from the remainder of the handbook, that the court held that the internal grievance and arbitration clause constituted an enforceable contract.  Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This is a distinctly different scenario from Garcia v. American Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1557356\"><a href=\"/opinion/1557356/garcia-v-american-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1987), the case upon which the district court relied for its res judicata ruling.  In Garcia, the employee utilized step two of American's grievance procedure and, while represented by counsel, had an opportunity to appeal his dispute to a stateside hearing officer.  Id. at 66.   In contrast, Ramirez was denied any opportunity to present his claims to a hearing officer (step two) or panel (step three);  he simply spoke with the General Manager, and was denied any further appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
