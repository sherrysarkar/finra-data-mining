Assuming without  deciding  that we  have\r                            \r\n\njurisdiction  to  hear  this  appeal,  and  having  carefully\r\n\nreviewed the briefs and record, we find no clear error in the\r\n\norder of commitment pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   4241(d).  \r\n\n     We  will   not   second-guess   the   district   court's\r\n\ndetermination of  the credibility of the psychiatric reports,\r\n\neven  supposing  that  issue of  credibility  was  not waived\r\n\nbefore the district  court.  Further, in the  context of this\r\n\ninterlocutory  appeal from the   4241(d) commitment order, we\r\n\nhave  no  call  to review  defendant's  complaints  about his\r\n\nmedication and the underlying criminal charges.\r\n\n     The order is affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc.
