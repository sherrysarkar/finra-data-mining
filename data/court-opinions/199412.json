Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Selya, Boudin, and Lynch,\n\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jerrold J. Wohlgemuth, with whom Reppert, Kelly &\nWohlgemuth, LLP was on brief, for appellants.\n     Julian R. Rivera-Aspinall, with whom Rivera-Aspinall,\nGarriga & Fernandini, P.S.C. was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        April 25, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam.   These appeals stem from a dispute between\n\ndefendant-appellant       Furniture     Services,    Inc.     (FSI)    and\n\nplaintiff-appellee Joseph Macias, formerly FSI's exclusive sales\n\nrepresentative    in   Puerto   Rico.      When   FSI    terminated    the\n\narrangement, Macias invoked diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1332(a), and sued FSI (along with several related persons and\n\nfirms) for damages in the federal district court.\n\n            The district court, acting with commendable dispatch,\n\nset trial for June 19, 2000.      In the period from June 9 to June\n\n15, the court attempted to broker a settlement.                The judge\n\nbelieved that his efforts had borne fruit, and, accordingly,\n\nentered a judgment of dismissal.         The scheduled trial did not\n\ntranspire.\n\n            FSI promptly moved to vacate the judgment.              Macias\n\nacquiesced and urged the court to restore the case to the trial\n\ncalendar.    The district judge nonetheless denied the motion to\n\nvacate.\n\n            We have carefully considered the record, the parties'\n\nbriefs, and the attorneys' statements during oral argument.             We\n\nare   persuaded   that    the   district    court,      in   good   faith,\n\nmisunderstood the representations of FSI's counsel, and that the\n\ncourt therefore entered judgment based on a mistaken premise.\n\nA judgment resting on a clear mistake of fact, seasonably called\n\nto the trial court's attention, cannot be allowed to stand.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fAccordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for trial.\n\n\n\n          Vacated and remanded.   No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
