Plaintiffs appeal from the district court's\r                           \r\n\nsummary judgment dismissal of their claims,  most importantly\r\n\nthat stock options and other incentive compensation  promised\r\n\nby   their  employer,   Tambrands  Inc.,  should   have  been\r\n\naccelerated--rather than forfeited--when  Tambrands sold  its\r\n\nsubsidiary Hygeia  Sciences, Inc., the company  for which the\r\n\nplaintiffs directly worked.   Plaintiffs dispute the district\r\n\ncourt's  reading  of  the  underlying  contracts;  they  also\r\n\nchallenge several discovery rulings.\r\n\n     After reviewing  the briefs and the  record, we conclude\r\n\nthat the district court's thorough opinion correctly analyzed\r\n\nand  resolved  the  questions   presented.    We  affirm  for\r\n\nsubstantially  the reasons given below, separately discussing\r\n\nbelow only three points which  were not squarely addressed in\r\n\nthe  district court.   Some  of the  issues presented  by the\r\n\nappeal are fairly debatable,  but we see no reason  to repeat\r\n\nin our words explanations that have been ably provided by the\r\n\ndistrict court.  \r\n\n     1.  Plaintiffs argue on appeal that three plaintiffs who\r\n\ncontinued  working for Hygeia  until the date  on which their\r\n\noptions would have vested if  they had remained in Tambrands'\r\n\nemploy completed  the requisite vesting period.   They assert\r\n\nthat the  contractual  requirement of  two  years'  continued\r\n\nemployment with \"the Company,\"  defined as \"Tambrands and its\r\n\nsubsidiaries,\" should  be understood  to  mean employment  by\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nTambrands  and/or  the subsidiaries  it had  at the  time the\r\n\noptions were granted--not at the time of exercise.\r\n\n     This theory,  although mentioned in  the complaint,  was\r\n\nnot discussed at length by the magistrate judge, who directed\r\n\nhis  attention to  a  broader claim,  namely,  that the  sale\r\n\ntriggered an acceleration of  the options.  However, assuming\r\n\nthat  the present theory was  fully preserved, at  the end of\r\n\ntwo  years the plaintiffs  were no longer  working either for\r\n\nTambrands or  a subsidiary of Tambrands,  and therefore their\r\n\noptions  lapsed under  the  contract, which  allowed exercise\r\n\n\"only during the continuance of that Participant's employment\r\n\nby the Company.\"\r\n\n     2.   In  the  district  court,  in addition  to  express\r\n\ncontract claims,  the  plaintiffs pressed  implied  contract,\r\n\nunjust  enrichment and  quantum  meruit claims.   They  based\r\n\nthese latter claims  on their allegation  that they had  made\r\n\nunusual efforts  in  support of  the planned  sale of  Hygeia\r\n\nduring  1989  and  1990 and  as  a  result  deserve, or  were\r\n\nimpliedly  promised, the  reward  of  acceleration  of  their\r\n\noptions.   On appeal,  they have recast  this theory, arguing\r\n\nthat   their   contracts    were   impliedly   modified,   or\r\n\nalternatively that Tambrands'  continuation of its  incentive\r\n\ncompensation programs  during  1989 and  1990  either  estops\r\n\nTambrands from refusing acceleration or constitutes a  waiver\r\n\nof any right to refuse acceleration.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     However, we agree  with the district court's  conclusion\r\n\nthat  the plaintiffs could  not prove either  that they could\r\n\nreasonably have expected acceleration, or that the defendants\r\n\npromised acceleration, in  exchange for their  sales efforts.\r\n\nWe  think   that  this   conclusion  supports  dismissal   of\r\n\nplaintiffs' modification,  estoppel and waiver  arguments, as\r\n\nwell as the  implied contract and related claims more clearly\r\n\nasserted  in   the  district  court  and   addressed  by  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge's opinion.\r\n\n     3.   Finally, plaintiffs  contend on appeal  that public\r\n\npolicy  considerations  justify  accelerating their  options.\r\n\nThey  cite an  Iowa  case involving  somewhat similar  facts,\r\n\nHilgenberg v. Iowa Beef Packers, Inc., 175 N.W.2d 353, 362-63\r                                                 \r\n\n(Iowa  1970).   In  that case,  a  company that  had promised\r\n\noptions to employees  sold one  of its plants  to new  owners\r\n\nbefore the options  vested.  In  the subsequent lawsuit,  the\r\n\ncourt permitted  the  employees of  the plant  to exercise  a\r\n\nportion of  their options,  even though the  supposed vesting\r\n\noccurred after sale of  the plant.  The court  relied heavily\r\n\nupon public policy.\r\n\n     The difficulty is that the present agreement is governed\r\n\nby New York law  as to the contract claims  and Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw  as  to   noncontractual  claims.    The   New  York  and\r\n\nMassachusetts  cases that are cited  to us are  not in point,\r\n\nand our independent  research suggests that  the case law  in\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nthese two states  does not carry  the public policy  argument\r\n\nquite  as far  as Hilgenberg.
