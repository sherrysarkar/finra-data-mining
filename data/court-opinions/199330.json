Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Matthew A. Chiara on brief pro se.\n     Domenic S. Terranova on motion to appear as amicus curiae.\n     Patrick J. Costello and Merrick, Louison & Costello on brief\nfor appellees, Mayor Dennis Dizoglio; Maurice Lariviere, Jr.,\nCity Solicitor; Eugene O’Neil, Economic Development Director;\n\fJoseph Giarusso, Methuen Conservation Inspector; Methuen\nConservation Commission; Community Development Board; and City\nCouncilor William Manzi.\n     Kenneth A. Cossingham on brief for appellee Brian Sheehy.\n     Darlene M. Daniele on brief for appellee Pasquelina\nNapolitano.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 19, 2001\n\f           Per Curiam.        The district court understood the\n\ncomplaint as alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act and\n\nthe Americans with Disability Act, defamation, libel and\n\nslander.   The court correctly dismissed the complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim.\n\n           Plaintiff      here      characterizes        his     claims as\n\nasserting instead violations of procedural and substantive\n\ndue process.     Without attempting precisely to reiterate\n\nplaintiff's argument, seemingly he sees a violation of his\n\nconstitutional       rights   in    the    timing       or     sequence    of\n\nproceedings    and    decisions     on    his   proposals       before    the\n\nMethuen Town Council and the Conservation Commission.                      He\n\nasserts that a \"pre-determination\" of an environmental issue\n\nby the Conservation Commission was essential to obtaining a\n\n\"fair hearing\" on the proposed zoning change before the Town\n\nCouncil.\n\n           Having     read    and    re-read      the        complaint    and\n\nplaintiff's brief, we believe that we understand why the\n\ndistrict court did not mention the scattered references to\n\nthe Due Process Clause found in the complaint.                     At first\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fblush, the complaint's due process allegations seem to be\n\nmere surplusage.\n\n             Reviewing the complaint de novo in light of the\n\ngloss which plaintiff assigns on appeal, we conclude that it\n\ndoes not contain facts sufficient to make out a recognizable\n\nclaim under the Due Process Clause.                    As to procedural due\n\nprocess, there are no facts suggesting that State law or\n\nlocal ordinances facially deprive applicants of notice, a\n\nhearing, and an opportunity to be heard on proposed zoning\n\nchanges      and    related     environmental          permits.         Instead,\n\nplaintiff seems to argue that an administrative law judge in\n\nthe Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection\n\nerred in interpreting the regulations as allowing the wrong\n\nsequence of hearings and decisions.               Even if we assume that\n\nthe   administrative          judge's      interpretation         was     wrong,\n\nhowever,     this    does     not   give   rise    to    a   deprivation      of\n\nplaintiff's constitutional right to procedural due process,\n\n\"so   long    as    the   state     provides      an    adequate    means     of\n\nredress.\"      See Herwins v. City of Revere, 163 F.3d 15, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1087 (1999).                       State\n\nlaw provides a means to redress incorrect administrative\n\ndecisions through a motion for reconsideration and an appeal\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fto the courts, and there are no facts suggesting that the\n\nState process is inadequate.\n\n            As to \"substantive\" due process, we also fail to\n\nsee    facts sufficient to make out an understandable claim.\n\nWe hasten to add, in light of some arguments in defendants'\n\nbriefs, that we also do not construe plaintiff's gloss on\n\nappeal as asserting a \"regulatory taking\" nor an \"inverse\n\ncondemnation\"        claim.       Since      there   is   no   substantive\n\nviolation alleged, we need not reach defendants' suggestion\n\nthat we should make new law in this uncertain area.\n\n            Finally, we have stricken from the caption of this\n\nappeal the names of purported plaintiffs-appellants \"John\n\nSmith\" and \"Mary Smith.\"           Although an appearance on behalf\n\nof    the   Smiths    was     entered   by    Attorney    Terranova,   the\n\nattorney did not offer a brief.                Instead, under cover of\n\nplaintiff's pro se brief, Attorney Terranova has revealed\n\nthat the Smiths are \"fictitious\" persons who seek to \"join\"\n\nthe pro se brief as \"amicus curiae\" and representatives of\n\nan indistinct class of real persons.                 There was no motion\n\nfor certification of a plaintiff class in the district\n\ncourt, and it is unclear whether the fictitious identity of\n\nthe plaintiffs-Smiths was known to the court.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f         Construing Attorney Terranova's statement inside\n\nof plaintiff's brief as a motion on behalf of one or more\n\nreal or fictitious persons to appear as amicus curiae, the\n\nmotion is denied for a failure to comply with the provisions\n\nof Fed.
