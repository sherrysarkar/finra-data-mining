George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nJohn P. Conroy on briefs pro se.\r\nAnn S. Duross, Assistant General Counsel, Colleen B. Bombardier,\r\nSenior Counsel, Maria B. Valdez, Acting Senior Counsel, and Daniel Glenn\r\nLonergan, Counsel, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, on briefs for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        March 27, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n  Per Curiam.  John P. Conroy, on behalf of himself and his\r\nwife, Patricia E. Conroy, has filed two essentially duplicative\r\nappeals.  The first notice of appeal (No. 96-2372) was filed\r\nfrom a margin order granting the FDIC's motion to dismiss.  The\r\ngrant of dismissal was thereafter memorialized in a separate\r\npiece of paper as an Order of Dismissal and Conroy filed a\r\nsecond notice of appeal (No. 97-1502).  Although the appeals\r\nare duplicative, the parties have each filed a separate brief\r\nin each appeal.  Despite filing two appellate briefs, neither\r\nof Conroy's briefs effectively addresses the district court\r\ndecision and we, therefore, affirm.\r\n    Conroy's brief in No. 97-1502 is off-point.  The subject\r\nof this brief is an administrative proof of claim that post-\r\ndated the district court's final order of dismissal.  As\r\ndistrict court jurisdiction does not obtain prior to exhaustion\r\nof the administrative claims review process, see Forbes v.\r\nFDIC, 850 F. Supp. 94, 97 (D. Mass. 1994), the subject of that\r\nlater administrative claim was not properly before the district\r\ncourt, despite Conroy's attempt to raise the substance of this\r\nnew claim at the October 31, 1996 hearing on the FDIC's motion\r\nto dismiss.  Appropriately, the district court did not rule (or\r\nfor that matter, purport to rule) on the substance of this new\r\nclaim.  Accordingly, the subject of this new claim is not\r\nproperly before us in this appeal.\r\n    And, while Conroy's brief in No. 96-2372 at least appears\r\nfocused on the district court's dismissal order, it consists of\r\nfour sentences and is devoid of supported argument.  As we have\r\nreiterated on occasions too numerous to recount, \"issues\r\naverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some\r\neffort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived for\r\npurposes of appeal.\"  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Savs. Bank, 42\r\nF.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).  In any event, contrary to\r\nConroy's assertion, the fact that the district court later\r\nconcluded that it did not have jurisdiction over Conroy's\r\nclaims because they were either time-barred or had not been\r\npresented to the FDIC in its administrative claims review\r\nprocess does not demonstrate that the district court \"clearly\r\nviolat[ed] his [sic] earlier decision and clearly violat[ed]\r\ndue process.\"\r\n    The FDIC expresses understandable distress at Conroy's\r\ncontinuing delaying tactics which have frustrated its\r\nlegitimate right to proceed with the resolution of a\r\nforeclosure that occurred in September 1995 and asks us to\r\nenjoin Conroy from bringing any further claim seeking equitable\r\nand/or injunctive relief.  We decline to enter such an\r\ninjunction, at least at this time, leaving the appropriateness\r\nof entering such an injunction to the consideration of the\r\ndistrict court in the event of future litigation.  We point\r\nout, however, that, by failing to make any relevant,\r\nsubstantive arguments in these appeals, Conroy thereby\r\neffectively has waived any challenge to the district court's\r\nrulings, including its determination that the grant of\r\ninjunctive or equitable relief, including rescission, is barred\r\nby the anti-injunction statute, 12 U.S.C.  1821(j).  It would\r\nappear that, in any event, res judicata would play a\r\nsignificant, perhaps determinative, role in any future\r\nlitigation.\r\n    Conroy's request for oral argument is denied.  The case of\r\nBeach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 692 So. 2d 146 (Fla.), cert. granted,\r\n118 S. Ct. 294 (1997), currently pending before the Supreme\r\nCourt, does not involve the FDIC and, therefore, it is unlikely\r\nthat that Court will have to speak to the additional factor\r\npresented by the anti-injunction statute.  More importantly,\r\nbecause Conroy has presented no substantive argument to contest\r\nthe district court's decision (and instead seeks to raise an\r\nissue not properly before either the district court or this\r\ncourt), we need not reach the substance of the Truth-in-Lending\r\nAct claims he presented below.\r\n    Affirmed.\n",
