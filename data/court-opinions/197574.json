Appellant Steven J. Tenofsky claims that he\r\n\nwrongly was denied a discharge in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy case\r\n\nbased on his failure to maintain recorded information from which\r\n\nhis financial condition could be ascertained.    See 11 U.S.C. S\r\n\n727(a)(3). The bankruptcy judge's conclusion that appellant's\r\n\nrecords were inadequate and incomplete was affirmed by the First\r\n\nCircuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. Having reviewed the record, we\r\n\nfind ourselves in full agreement with the reasoning expressed in\r\n\nthe panel's thorough opinion, and also affirm. We add only the\r\n\nfollowing brief comments.\r\n\n     First, appellant's counsel emphasized at oral argument that\r\n\nthe bankruptcy judge could not possibly have reviewed the 3,000\r\n\npages of information contained in Mrs. Tenofsky's records during\r\n\nthe thirty-minute recess between the conclusion of trial and her\r\n\nruling, and that she therefore failed to consider carefully all of\r\n\nthe evidence before rendering a decision. The judge, however, had\r\n\nample time to review the nature of the material contained in Mrs.\r\n\nTenofsky's records, and to make a judgment that it did not fill the\r\n\ngaps about which she was concerned. That the judge did not refer\r\n\nto the records in her bench ruling speaks to their relevance, not\r\n\nto her lack of consideration of them. \r\n\n     Second, we may set aside the bankruptcy court's application of\r\n\nthe law to the facts only if we detect clear error in its\r\n\nassessment of the facts, use of an erroneous legal standard, or an\r\n\nerror or abuse of discretion in applying the law to the facts. \r                                                                        See\r\n\nIn  \r             re  \r                 DN  \r                    Associates, 3 F.3d 512, 515 (1st Cir. 1993). The\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nbankruptcy court here used the correct \"case-by-case analysis,\r\n\ntaking into account the particular facts and circumstances of the\r\n\ndebtor's case,\" In re Ridley, 115 B. R. 731, 733 (Bankr. D. Mass.\r\n\n1990). The judge's evaluation of the facts was informed by her\r\n\nview of appellant's credibility, \"a key element\" that she was in\r\n\nthe best position to assess.  See id. We find neither error nor\r\n\nabuse.\r\n\n     If appellant had a fighting chance to persuade the bankruptcy\r\n\njudge, and, though \"weak, indeed almost hopeless, [but not]\r\n\nfrivolous\" before the appellate panel, Lallemand v. University of\r\n\nRhode Island, 9 F.3d 214, 217-18 (1st Cir. 1993), the case surely\r\n\nhas lost all merit at this stage. We therefore order appellant to\r\n\nshow cause, within ten days from the issuance of this opinion, why\r\n\nwe should not award double costs to appellee. See Fed. R. App. P.\r\n\n38. \r\n\n     Affirmed. \r\n\n                               -4-\r\n",
