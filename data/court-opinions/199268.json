Edwin Gutierrez-Rentas appeals from\n\nconcurrent sentences entered following guilty pleas for\n\nthree separate drug offenses.         In its brief, the government\n\nasks that the appeals be summarily dismissed.\n\n         I. Background\n\n         The pleas were entered pursuant to written plea\n\nagreements     which    were       essentially       identical        (“the\n\nAgreements”).     The Agreements purported to be pursuant to\n\nFed.R.Crim.P.     11(e)(1)(C),      but    other    language     in    the\n\nAgreements     suggested    that    they   were     pursuant     to    Rule\n\n11(e)(1)(B).    Consistent with subsection (B), the Agreements\n\nstated that “the Court is not bound by this Plea Agreement,\n\nincluding but not limited to: the sentencing guidelines\n\ncalculations,          stipulations,            and/or         sentence\n\nrecommendations.” ¶ 7.\n\n         Consistent        with    subsection      (C),   however,     the\n\nAgreements provided that the appropriate prison sentence\n\nwithin the applicable guideline range was 144 months.                    In\n\narriving at that sentence, the parties agreed upon a base\n\noffense level of 34, which would be decreased by three\n\nlevels for acceptance of responsibility and that\n\n         [b]ased on the defendant’s role in the\n         offense as a manager the base offense\n\f            level shall       be   increased      by    Two   (2)\n            levels.\n\nThe Agreements, ¶ 8(d).            The district court in each case\n\nconstrued the Agreements as pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C),\n\naccepted    the   Agreements       and    sentenced     Gutierrez   to   144\n\nmonths in prison, the agreed upon sentence.\n\n            At sentencing and in his sentencing memoranda,\n\nGutierrez argued in all three cases that he should receive\n\na   lower   sentence   than    the       144   months   specified   in   the\n\nAgreements because there was not a factual basis to support\n\nthe agreed-upon two-level enhancement for his managerial\n\nrole in the offense.          He argued that the Agreements were\n\nambiguous with respect to whether they were entered pursuant\n\nto Rule 11(e)(1)(B) or (C) and, therefore, the district\n\ncourt could accept the Agreements but modify the sentence.\n\n            In his consolidated appeal, Gutierrez does not\n\nrepeat the argument that the Agreements should have been\n\nconstrued as pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(B).                But he persists\n\nin the other half of his argument: that he should not have\n\nreceived the two-level enhancement that he agreed to because\n\nthere is insufficient evidentiary support for a finding that\n\nhe was a manager within the meaning of U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c).\n\nThe government responds by arguing in its brief that because\n\nthe Agreements were entered pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C),\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\ftheir terms were binding upon the sentencing courts once the\n\nAgreements     were   accepted.            Therefore,          the   government\n\nasserts, the sentencing courts had no authority to modify\n\nthe   agreed   upon    sentences        and      the       appeals    should   be\n\nsummarily dismissed.       We agree with the government that the\n\nsentences in all three cases should be affirmed, although\n\nthe   different     circumstances       in    the      three    cases    require\n\nseparate explanations of our disposition in each case.\n\n            II. Discussion\n\n            As an initial matter, appellant’s failure to argue\n\non appeal that the district court erred in construing the\n\nAgreements as pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C) provides grounds\n\nfor affirming the sentences. Where a plea agreement is\n\nentered pursuant to subsection (C), the district court’s\n\nonly options are to accept or reject the plea under the\n\nterms agreed to by the parties.                  The court may not accept\n\nthe plea and then “unilaterally” impose a more lenient\n\nsentence    than    that     specified           in    a    Rule     11(e)(1)(C)\n\nagreement. See United States v. Moure-Ortiz, 184 F.3d 1, 3 -\n\n4 (1st Cir. 1999).     “After the district court provisionally\n\naccepted the agreement, its only recourse was to reject the\n\nagreement      if     it     found         the        negotiated        sentence\n\nunsatisfactory.”      Id.,    at   3;      see    also      United    States   v.\n\nBarnes, 83 F.3d 934, 941 (7th Cir. 1996) (“The district court\n\n                                     -4-\n\fdoes not have the power to retain the plea and discard the\n\nagreed-upon sentence, even if the sentence departs from what\n\nthe guidelines might prescribe”).\n\n               Appellant has never sought to withdraw his guilty\n\npleas.    Instead, he seeks only modification of the sentences\n\nentered pursuant to those pleas.               Neither the district court\n\nnor this court has authority to grant the relief requested\n\nby appellant. See id. (noting in context of Rule 11(e)(1)(C)\n\nagreement that “[i]f we rule that some provision of the plea\n\nagreement is invalid, we must discard the entire agreement\n\nand require the [defendant] and the government to begin\n\ntheir    bargaining       all    over     again”).       The    relief       that\n\nappellant       seeks    would    only    be    available      if    the     plea\n\nAgreements had been entered pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(B).\n\nAppellant waived the argument that the district courts erred\n\nin construing the Agreements as pursuant to subsection (C),\n\nhowever, by failing to explicitly make that argument in his\n\nbrief. See Airport Impact Relief, Inc. v. Wykle, 192 F.3d\n\n197,     207    (1st    Cir.    1999)    (“Issues    adverted        to    in    a\n\nperfunctory       manner,       unaccompanied       by   some       effort      at\n\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived for purposes of\n\nappeal”).\n\n               Even if Gutierrez had not waived it, the argument\n\nthat the district courts erred in construing the Agreements\n\n                                        -5-\n\fas pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C) would not have prevailed.\n\n“This court has held that a question of the interpretation\n\nof the terms of a plea agreement is an issue of fact to be\n\nresolved by the district court.” Giorgi, 840 F.2d at 1028.\n\nWe have upheld the district court’s construction of an\n\nambiguous    agreement   where   it    was   “consistent   with   the\n\nreasonable expectations of the parties.” Id.          The district\n\ncourts’ constructions of the Agreements met that standard in\n\neach of the three cases before us.\n\n            A. Appeal No. 99-1458\n\n            The transcripts of the change of plea hearing and\n\nsentencing hearing in this case leave no doubt that the\n\nparties understood the plea agreement to be pursuant to\n\nsubsection (C).    See United States v. Siedlik, 231 F.3d 744,\n\n748 n.1 (10th Cir. 2000)(relying on statements by parties at\n\nchange of plea hearing and sentencing to discern whether\n\nambiguous plea agreement was pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(B) or\n\n(C)); United States v. Kummer, 89 F.3d 1536, 1543 (11th Cir.\n\n1996)(same).\n\n            At the change of plea hearing, on October 28, 1998,\n\nthe government attorney clearly stated that the plea was\n\npursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(C).          Gutierrez did not dispute\n\nthat statement and acknowledged his understanding of the\n\ncourt’s explanation of the defining characteristics of a\n\n                                 -6-\n\fsubsection      (C)    agreement.            At   sentencing,        the    judge\n\nresponded to Gutierrez’ argument that the plea was ambiguous\n\nand should be construed as pursuant to subsection (B), by\n\nstating that the transcripts from the change of plea hearing\n\nmade it “very clear” that the plea was entered pursuant to\n\nsubsection (C).        Any ambiguity in the language of the plea\n\nagreement was resolved at the change of plea hearing in this\n\ncase.     The    district         court’s     construction      of    the       plea\n\nagreement as pursuant to subsection (C) at the sentencing\n\nhearing   was        consistent       with     the     parties’      reasonable\n\nexpectations.\n\n           Gutierrez’ sentence in this case is affirmed. See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n           B. Appeal No. 99-1457\n\n           In    this       case,    the     ambiguous     language        of   the\n\nAgreements was not resolved at the change of plea hearing.\n\nInstead, the district court’s statements exacerbated the\n\nambiguities by reiterating the contradictory terms included\n\nin the Agreements.          However, the change of plea hearing in\n\nthis case was held on November 4, 1998, only one week after\n\nthe change of plea hearing in Appeal No. 99-1458.                               The\n\nagreements      in    the   two     cases    were      virtually     identical.\n\nTherefore, Gutierrez was on notice that the Agreements had\n\nbeen    interpreted         as      pursuant      to     Rule     11(e)(1)(C).\n\n                                       -7-\n\fNonetheless, Gutierrez did not seek to clarify at the change\n\nof plea hearing whether the agreement was entered pursuant\n\nto subsection (B) or (C).\n\n             At       the    sentencing      hearing,       the     district        court\n\nstated that when it accepted Gutierrez’ guilty plea, it\n\n“considered the plea to be an 11(e)(1)(C) plea.”                               Arguably,\n\nthe district court ought to have acknowledged the ambiguous\n\nnature     of     the       plea   agreement       at   sentencing            and   given\n\nGutierrez the opportunity to withdraw his plea if he had not\n\nintended        to    plea     guilty       pursuant        to    subsection        (C).\n\nHowever, there would be little point in remanding now for\n\nthe court to offer appellant the chance to withdraw his\n\nplea.      Gutierrez seeks only to have his sentence modified,\n\nnot   to    withdraw         his    guilty    plea.         He    has    consistently\n\nmaintained that he does not wish to withdraw his guilty\n\npleas.      When offered the opportunity to do so during his\n\nsentencing        hearing      in    Appeal       No.   99-1680,         he    declined.\n\nTherefore,           remand    for    that        purpose        would    be    futile.\n\nGutierrez is not entitled to the relief he seeks.\n\n             Gutierrez’ sentence in this case is affirmed. See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n             C. Appeal No. 99-1680\n\n             In       this    case,    as    in     Appeal       No.     99-1457,     the\n\nambiguity in the language of the Agreements was not resolved\n\n                                            -8-\n\fat the change of plea hearing.               The district court merely\n\nrepeated    the    contradictory          language   in    the    Agreements,\n\nsuggesting that even if the court accepted the plea, it\n\nwould not be bound by the sentencing provisions therein.\n\nHere again, however, the change of plea hearing in this case\n\nfollowed shortly after the change of plea hearing in Appeal\n\nNo.   99-1458,         at   which   the     court    had    interpreted      a\n\npractically identical plea agreement as pursuant to Rule\n\n11(e)(1)(C).\n\n            At his sentencing hearing, Gutierrez argued that\n\nthe plea agreement should be construed as pursuant to Rule\n\n11(e)(1)(B) and that the court should not be bound by the\n\nstipulation       to    the   role-in-the-offense          enhancement.     In\n\nresponse to Gutierrez’ contention that he was not a manager\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, the sentencing court offered him the\n\nchance to withdraw his plea.              The court clearly stated that\n\nit interpreted the plea agreement as pursuant to subsection\n\n(C), but gave Gutierrez the opportunity to withdraw the\n\nplea, if he had not intended to enter a subsection (C)\n\nagreement.        Gutierrez declined to withdraw the plea and,\n\ninstead, withdrew his request to be “relieved of [his]\n\nadmission that [he] acted as manager.”\n\n            Under these circumstances, the district court did\n\nnot   err    in    construing       the     agreement      as    pursuant   to\n\n                                     -9-\n\fsubsection (C) at the time of sentencing.               The sentencing\n\njudge properly offered Gutierrez the opportunity to withdraw\n\nfrom the subsection (C) agreement if it did not represent\n\nhis true intentions.      However, Gutierrez declined to do so.\n\nThereafter,      in    treating   the    plea   as   pursuant      to   Rule\n\n11(e)(1)(C),     the    district    court       acted   in     a    manner\n\n“consistent    with     the   reasonable        expectations       of   the\n\nparties.” Giorgi, 840 F.2d at 1028.\n\n         Gutierrez’ sentence in this case is affirmed. See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",

Edwin Gutierrez-Rentas appeals from\n\nconcurrent sentences entered following guilty pleas for\n\nthree separate drug offenses.         In its brief, the government\n\nasks that the appeals be summarily dismissed.\n\n         I. Background\n\n         The pleas were entered pursuant to written plea\n\nagreements     which    were       essentially       identical        (“the\n\nAgreements”).

Where a plea agreement is\n\nentered pursuant to subsection (C), the district court’s\n\nonly options are to accept or reject the plea under the\n\nterms agreed to by the parties.                  The court may not accept\n\nthe plea and then “unilaterally” impose a more lenient\n\nsentence    than    that     specified           in    a    Rule     11(e)(1)(C)\n\nagreement.

Instead, he seeks only modification of the sentences\n\nentered pursuant to those pleas.               Neither the district court\n\nnor this court has authority to grant the relief requested\n\nby appellant. See id.

Gutierrez did not dispute\n\nthat statement and acknowledged his understanding of the\n\ncourt’s explanation of the defining characteristics of a\n\n                                 -6-\n\fsubsection      (C)    agreement.            At   sentencing,        the    judge\n\nresponded to Gutierrez’ argument that the plea was ambiguous\n\nand should be construed as pursuant to subsection (B), by\n\nstating that the transcripts from the change of plea hearing\n\nmade it “very clear” that the plea was entered pursuant to\n\nsubsection (C).        Any ambiguity in the language of the plea\n\nagreement was resolved at the change of plea hearing in this\n\ncase.     The    district         court’s     construction      of    the       plea\n\nagreement as pursuant to subsection (C) at the sentencing\n\nhearing   was        consistent       with     the     parties’      reasonable\n\nexpectations.\n\n           Gutierrez’ sentence in this case is affirmed. See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n           B. Appeal No. 99-1457\n\n           In    this       case,    the     ambiguous     language        of   the\n\nAgreements was not resolved at the change of plea hearing.\n\nInstead, the district court’s statements exacerbated the\n\nambiguities by reiterating the contradictory terms included\n\nin the Agreements.          However, the change of plea hearing in\n\nthis case was held on November 4, 1998, only one week after\n\nthe change of plea hearing in Appeal No. 99-1458.                               The\n\nagreements      in    the   two     cases    were      virtually     identical.\n\nTherefore, Gutierrez was on notice that the Agreements had\n\nbeen    interpreted         as      pursuant      to     Rule     11(e)(1)(C).\n\n                                       -7-\n\fNonetheless, Gutierrez did not seek to clarify at the change\n\nof plea hearing whether the agreement was entered pursuant\n\nto subsection (B) or (C).\n\n             At       the    sentencing      hearing,       the     district        court\n\nstated that when it accepted Gutierrez’ guilty plea, it\n\n“considered the plea to be an 11(e)(1)(C) plea.”                               Arguably,\n\nthe district court ought to have acknowledged the ambiguous\n\nnature     of     the       plea   agreement       at   sentencing            and   given\n\nGutierrez the opportunity to withdraw his plea if he had not\n\nintended        to    plea     guilty       pursuant        to    subsection        (C).\n\nHowever, there would be little point in remanding now for\n\nthe court to offer appellant the chance to withdraw his\n\nplea.      Gutierrez seeks only to have his sentence modified,\n\nnot   to    withdraw         his    guilty    plea.         He    has    consistently\n\nmaintained that he does not wish to withdraw his guilty\n\npleas.      When offered the opportunity to do so during his\n\nsentencing        hearing      in    Appeal       No.   99-1680,         he    declined.\n\nTherefore,           remand    for    that        purpose        would    be    futile.\n\nGutierrez is not entitled to the relief he seeks.\n\n             Gutierrez’ sentence in this case is affirmed. See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n             C. Appeal No. 99-1680\n\n             In       this    case,    as    in     Appeal       No.     99-1457,     the\n\nambiguity in the language of the Agreements was not resolved\n\n                                            -8-\n\fat the change of plea hearing.               The district court merely\n\nrepeated    the    contradictory          language   in    the    Agreements,\n\nsuggesting that even if the court accepted the plea, it\n\nwould not be bound by the sentencing provisions therein.\n\nHere again, however, the change of plea hearing in this case\n\nfollowed shortly after the change of plea hearing in Appeal\n\nNo.   99-1458,         at   which   the     court    had    interpreted      a\n\npractically identical plea agreement as pursuant to Rule\n\n11(e)(1)(C).\n\n            At his sentencing hearing, Gutierrez argued that\n\nthe plea agreement should be construed as pursuant to Rule\n\n11(e)(1)(B) and that the court should not be bound by the\n\nstipulation       to    the   role-in-the-offense          enhancement.     In\n\nresponse to Gutierrez’ contention that he was not a manager\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, the sentencing court offered him the\n\nchance to withdraw his plea.              The court clearly stated that\n\nit interpreted the plea agreement as pursuant to subsection\n\n(C), but gave Gutierrez the opportunity to withdraw the\n\nplea, if he had not intended to enter a subsection (C)\n\nagreement.        Gutierrez declined to withdraw the plea and,\n\ninstead, withdrew his request to be “relieved of [his]\n\nadmission that [he] acted as manager.”\n\n            Under these circumstances, the district court did\n\nnot   err    in    construing       the     agreement      as    pursuant   to\n\n                                     -9-\n\fsubsection (C) at the time of sentencing.               The sentencing\n\njudge properly offered Gutierrez the opportunity to withdraw\n\nfrom the subsection (C) agreement if it did not represent\n\nhis true intentions.      However, Gutierrez declined to do so.\n\nThereafter,      in    treating   the    plea   as   pursuant      to   Rule\n\n11(e)(1)(C),     the    district    court       acted   in     a    manner\n\n“consistent    with     the   reasonable        expectations       of   the\n\nparties.” Giorgi, 840 F.2d at 1028.\n\n         Gutierrez’ sentence in this case is affirmed. See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f</pre>",
