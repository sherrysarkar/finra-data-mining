That finding was\r\n\nsupported by the record  which included a financial affidavit\r\n\nfiled  in federal  court on  the date  of Thomas'  arrest and\r\n\ndocumentation of  Thomas' presence in juvenile  court several\r\n\ndays later.   The district  court did not  err in  concluding\r\n\nthat  the  shift  in  prosecution   resources  and  attention\r\n\nconstituted a \"significant hindrance\" within the meaning of  \r\n\n3C1.1, comment.  (n.4(a)). \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     That Thomas  eventually was  indicted by the  same grand\r\n\njury  as his codefendants, does  not preclude a  finding of a\r\n\nsignificant hindrance.   Prosecution resources  were diverted\r\n\nas a result  of Thomas' false  statements at the time  of his\r\n\narrest,  requiring  the  prosecution  of  Thomas  to  proceed\r\n\ndifferently  than if the false statements  had not been made.\r\n\nSee United States v. McCoy, 36 F.3d 740, 742 (8th Cir.  1994)\r                                      \r\n\n(affirming  two-level enhancement for  obstruction of justice\r\n\nwhere  \"additional  effort\"  was  expended  as  a  result  of\r\n\ndefendant's use of an alias at the time of a prior arrest).  \r\n\n     The  cases that Thomas  relies upon are  inapposite.  In\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Manning, 955  F.2d 770,  774-75 (1st  Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1992), we held  that defendant's  use of an  alias and  false\r\n\nbirthdate  at the  time of  his arrest  did not  constitute a\r\n\n\"significant  hindrance\"  where  it  was \"unclear  [from  the\r\n\nrecord]  that  the  investigation  would  have proceeded  any\r\n\ndifferently or any faster had Manning [told the truth] at the\r\n\ntime of his  arrest.\"  In this case,  by contrast, the record\r\n\nreveals that the federal prosecution of  Thomas was halted as\r\n\na  result of his misstatements to the arresting officers, and\r\n\nrecommenced  only  after  his  true  identity  and  age  were\r\n\ndiscovered.   See also United States  v. Bell, 953 F.2d  6, 9\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (\"there  was no showing or even  assertion by\r\n\nthe  government [that  the  investigation or  prosecution had\r\n\nbeen impeded]\").\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     Thomas argues that the enhancement does not apply to his\r\n\ncase  because he did  not \"willfully\" obstruct  or impede the\r\n\nadministration  of justice.  See U.S.S.G.   3C.1.  He alleges\r                                            \r\n\nthat his intent in lying about his name and age  was to avoid\r\n\nbeing  placed  in  an  adult prison,  not  to  avoid  federal\r\n\nprosecution.   Thomas'  conduct  appears to  fall within  the\r\n\nplain  language  of one  of  the listed  examples  of conduct\r\n\nmeriting the enhancement  because he did,  and did knowingly,\r\n\nprovide \"a  materially false  statement to a  law enforcement\r\n\nofficer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official\r\n\ninvestigation or  prosecution of the instant  offense.\"  Id.,\r                                                                        \r\n\ncomment. (n.3(g)).  On the other hand, there is case law that\r\n\nthe  defendant  must  have  a  specific  intent  to  obstruct\r                                                           \r\n\njustice,  \"i.e., . . . . the defendant consciously acted with\r                           \r\n\nthe purpose of obstructing justice.\"  United States  v. Reed,\r                                                                        \r\n\n49  F.3d 895, 900 (2d Cir. 1995).

The guideline\r\n\nitself  imposes  the enhancement  for willful  obstruction or\r\n\nattempted  obstruction  of  \"the  administration  of justice\"\r\n\nduring  the complete  proceeding  from investigation  through\r                  \r\n\nsentencing.      It   covers   not   only   obstructions   of\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n\"investigations,\" \"prosecutions\" or  \"sentencing\" but of  the\r\n\nentire  \"administration  of  justice\"  in  relation   to  the\r\n\ndefendant's case so long as the obstruction occurs during the\r\n\nperiod specified.\r\n\n     Thus, the  defendant's use  of a  false identity  in the\r\n\nhope  of being released on bail is an obstruction of justice,\r\n\nsee Mafanya, 24  F.3d at 415, because the  grant or denial of\r                       \r\n\nbail is part of the process.  A determination as to whether a\r\n\ndefendant  should  be  held in  an  adult  facility  or in  a\r\n\njuvenile  detention seems to us  scarcely less a  part of the\r\n\nadministration  of   justice   and  involves   policies   and\r\n\nconsequences that are far from trivial.  Since on Thomas' own\r\n\nversion of events  he did  have a specific  intent to  affect\r\n\nthis choice by lies as to his  age, we think that he had  the\r\n\nrequisite specific intent  to obstruct the administration  of\r\n\njustice, even assuming that something beyond  conduct falling\r\n\nwithin the commentary is required.\r\n\n     Affirmed.

McCoy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678868\"><a href=\"/opinion/678868/united-states-v-eugene-mccoy-also-known-as-lawrence-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 742 (8th Cir.1994) (affirming two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice where \"additional effort\" was expended as a result of defendant's use of an alias at the time of a prior arrest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases that Thomas relies upon are inapposite.   In United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577109\"><a href=\"/opinion/577109/united-states-v-charles-robert-manning-aka-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 774-75 (1st Cir.1992), we held that defendant's use of an alias and false birthdate at the time of his arrest did not constitute a \"significant hindrance\" where it was \"unclear [from the record] that the investigation would have proceeded any differently or any faster had Manning [told the truth] at the time of his arrest.\"   In this case, by contrast, the record reveals that the federal prosecution of Thomas was halted as a result of his misstatements to the arresting officers, and recommenced only after his true identity and age were discovered.   See also United States v. Bell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575208\"><a href=\"/opinion/575208/united-states-v-richard-harmon-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1992) (\"there was no showing or even assertion by the government [that the investigation or prosecution had been impeded]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thomas argues that the enhancement does not apply to his case because he did not \"willfully\" obstruct or impede the administration of justice.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C.1.  He alleges that his intent in lying about his name and age was to avoid being placed in an adult prison, not to avoid federal prosecution.   Thomas' conduct appears to fall within the plain language of one of the listed examples of conduct meriting the enhancement because he did, and did knowingly, provide \"a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\"   Id., comment.  (n.3(g)).   On the other hand, there is case law that the defendant must have a specific intent to obstruct justice, \"i.e., .... the defendant consciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice.\"  United States v. Reed, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691319\"><a href=\"/opinion/691319/united-states-v-mark-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span>, 900 (2d Cir.1995).   See also United States v. Gonzales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195106\"><a href=\"/opinion/195106/united-states-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 299-300 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide in this case whether this specific intent requirement should be superimposed on the explicit examples given in the guideline commentary, because the enhancement is valid even on such a premise.   The guideline itself imposes the enhancement for willful obstruction or attempted obstruction of \"the administration of justice\" during the complete proceeding from investigation through sentencing.   It covers not only obstructions of \"investigations,\" \"prosecutions\" or \"sentencing\" but of the entire \"administration of justice\" in relation to the defendant's case so long as the obstruction occurs during the period specified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the defendant's use of a false identity in the hope of being released on bail is an obstruction of justice, see Mafanya, 24 F.3d at 415, because the grant or denial of bail is part of the process.   A determination as to whether a defendant should be held in an adult facility or in a juvenile detention seems to us scarcely less a part of the administration of justice and involves policies and consequences that are far from trivial.   Since on Thomas' own version of events he did have a specific intent to affect this choice by lies as to his age, we think that he had the requisite specific intent to obstruct the administration of justice, even assuming that something beyond conduct falling within the commentary is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
