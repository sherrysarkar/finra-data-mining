Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Jorge L. Arroyo-Alejandro on brief for appellant.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\r\non Motion Requesting That The Instant Case Be Remanded, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nApril 21, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon consideration of the defendant's\r\nbrief, the government's motion for remand and the record, we\r\nconclude that the district court did consider the substance of\r\ndefendant's request for a departure under U.S.S.G.  4A1.3. \r\nThe district court determined that no departure would be\r\nwarranted in light of defendant's violent prior offenses and\r\nthat decision is not reviewable.  See United States v. Leblanc,\r\n24 F.3d 340, 348 (1st Cir. 1994).  We need not decide whether\r\nthe district court had authority to depart from the sentence\r\nspecified in the Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement.\r\n          Defendant's other claim--that his prior drug\r\ntrafficking sentence was related to the instant offense and\r\nshould not be counted as criminal history--is arguably\r\npreserved only for plain error review since the defendant did\r\nnot expressly dispute his criminal history category in the pre-\r\nsentence report and the relatedness claim was offered in the\r\ndistrict court only as an alternative ground for departure.  It\r\ncould also be questioned whether the counting of the prior\r\nsentence could be regarded as plain error since there may be\r\nnothing in the present record that compels the inference that\r\nthe sentence in no. 97cr011(pg) was for conduct that was \"part\"\r\nof the instant offense.  See U.S.S.G.  4A1.2(a)(1) &amp;\r\napplication note 1.  (It is this provision, and not \r\n4A1.2(a)(2) which is pertinent.  See United States v. Troncoso,\r\n23 F.3d 612, 616 (1st Cir. 1994).)\r\n          Nevertheless, the government's motion for remand\r\neffectively waives any claim that the defendant did not\r\nadequately preserve the issue.  And while we doubt that there\r\nwas plain error treating the two crimes as unrelated, this may\r\nor may not have been error and could have a significant effect\r\non the sentence.  The government's efforts to assure that\r\ndefendant is not sentenced beyond what he deserves is\r\ncommendable.  Accordingly, the government's motion for remand\r\nis granted and the district court is requested to make findings\r\nas to whether the sentence in no. 97cr011(pg) was properly\r\nreflected in defendant's criminal history.  If the court\r\nconcludes that the defendant's sentence should not be changed,\r\nwe request that it supplement the record for this appeal with\r\na written order stating its findings on the relatedness issue. \r\nIf it concludes that the sentence should be altered, it is free\r\nto modify the sentence and judgment accordingly, subject always\r\nto either side's right to seek further review.  We will retain\r\njurisdiction of this appeal pending the proceedings on remand.\r\n          It is so ordered.\n",
