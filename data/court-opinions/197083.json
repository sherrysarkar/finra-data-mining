Although the transactions underlying  this\r                           \r\n\nappeal  are complicated,  the  central events  may be  simply\r\n\ndescribed.  In 1985, defendant in the district court, Charles\r\n\nSerra, bought  two trucks, borrowing the funds  from the Bank\r\n\nof  New England  and  using the  trucks  as collateral.    In\r\n\nOctober  1986,  in  a  transaction  apparently  conducted  by\r\n\nSerra's agent, who  managed the trucks, the notes were rolled\r\n\nover  and new notes were  issued with some  changes in terms.\r\n\nThere was a default on the  notes.  Serra now claims that the\r\n\nagent did not have authority to roll over the notes.\r\n\n     In  the meantime, the trucks have been sold by the bank.\r\n\nThe present suit by a successor to the bank's interest is for\r\n\nthe deficiency.  In the district court, the magistrate  judge\r\n\ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiff.  On appeal, Serra\r\n\nclaims that the action was time-barred, that he is not liable\r\n\non  the assertedly unauthorized new  notes, and that the sale\r\n\nof the trucks was not commercially reasonable.  Our review is\r\n\nde  novo, and  we draw  factual inferences in  Serra's favor.\r                    \r\n\nGrenier  v. Vermont Log Bldgs.,  Inc., 96 F.3d  559, 562 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1996).\r\n\n     The  statute of  limitations claim  is easily  resolved.\r\n\nThe  four-year  statute of  limitations  relied  upon by  the\r\n\ndefendant does not apply to this promissory note secured by a\r\n\nchattel  mortgage, because it is not  a transaction in goods.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Universal  Underwriters  Ins. Co.  v. Ross,  1991\r                                                                  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nMass. App. Div. 23, 25 (Mass. Dist. Ct. 1991).  As to whether\r\n\nthe six-year or twenty-year statutory period applies, we need\r\n\nnot decide the question because both cover the present claim.\r\n\nEither  one   was  still   running  when  the   FDIC  assumed\r\n\nreceivership  in  January  1991,  extending  the  limitations\r\n\nperiod by an  additional six  years pursuant to  12 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1821(d)(14).\r\n\n     Turning to the validity of the new notes, Serra's denial\r\n\nof his agent's authority  to make them rests in  some measure\r\n\non  alleged unwritten  limitations  on the  written power  of\r\n\nattorney  used  by  the  agent,  which  was  presumably  made\r\n\navailable  to the  bank  at the  time  of refinancing.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court  magistrate  disregarded  these  limitations,\r\n\nrelying on D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co.  v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942)\r                                                    \r\n\nand its statutory counterpart, 12 U.S.C.   1823(e)(1).\r\n\n     We  see no reason to  pursue the interesting question of\r\n\nwhether  and  how  far   D'Oench,  Duhme  applies  to  secret\r                                                    \r\n\nagreements  that  were not  made with  a  bank but  which may\r\n\naffect a document that the bank relied on.   It is not at all\r\n\nclear  that the  power of  attorney  authorized the  agent to\r\n\nexecute both  of the new  notes.  Thus,  even if the  written\r\n\npower  of attorney  were read  literally, without  giving any\r\n\nweight  to the  alleged unwritten  limitations, it  might not\r\n\nshow  that Serra's agent did have authority to roll over both\r\n\nnotes.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     However,  we   see  no   need  to  remand   for  further\r\n\nproceedings to  determine the agent's actual  authority or to\r\n\nconsider claims  of apparent  authority or estoppel,  both of\r\n\nwhich would  require more factual development.   If the notes\r\n\nwere  rolled over  by  mistake or  without  authority, it  is\r\n\nnevertheless the  case that Serra benefited  directly because\r\n\nthe  cancellation of the old  notes discharged his  debt.  To\r\n\nallow  Serra to escape liability on the  new notes would be a\r\n\npatent case of unjust enrichment.\r\n\n     This principle is established in Massachusetts, and  its\r\n\napplication to  erroneous bank  transactions is plain.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., FDIC v.  Csongor, 464 N.E.2d 942,  945-46 (Mass. 1984);\r                                  \r\n\nNational Shawmut Bank of Boston v. Fidelity Mutual Life  Ins.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 61 N.E.2d 18,  22 (Mass. 1945); see also  Restatement of\r                                                                         \r\n\nRestitution   1 (1937).  Unjust enrichment was pleaded in the\r                       \r\n\ncomplaint  and nothing  in the  record suggests  any possible\r\n\nanswer  to the claim.  As the terms of the new notes are more\r\n\nfavorable to Serra, their enforcement--rather than any effort\r\n\nto revive the original notes--works in Serra's favor.\r\n\n     Finally, it is true that deficiencies in notice required\r\n\nthe  plaintiff to  show, pursuant  to Shawmut  Bank, N.A.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nChase,  609  N.E.2d 479,  483  (Mass.

It is not at all clear that the power of attorney authorized the agent to execute both of the new notes.  Thus, even if the written power of attorney were read literally, without giving any weight to the alleged unwritten limitations, it might not show that Serra's agent did have authority to roll over both notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we see no need to remand for further proceedings to determine the agent's actual authority or to consider claims of apparent authority or estoppel, both of which would require more factual development.  If the notes were rolled over by mistake or without authority, it is nevertheless the case that Serra benefited directly because the cancellation of the old notes discharged his debt.  To allow Serra to escape liability on the new notes would be a patent case of unjust enrichment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This principle is established in Massachusetts, and its application to erroneous bank transactions is plain.   See, e.g., FDIC v. Csongor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2140456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2140456/federal-deposit-ins-corp-v-csongor/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>, 945-46 (Mass.1984);   National Shawmut Bank of Boston v. Fidelity Mutual Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></span>, 22 (Mass.1945);  see also Restatement of Restitution &#167; 1 (1937).  Unjust enrichment was pleaded in the complaint and nothing in the record suggests any possible answer to the claim.  As the terms of the new notes are more favorable to Serra, their enforcement--rather than any effort to revive the original notes--works in Serra's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is true that deficiencies in notice required the plaintiff to show, pursuant to  Shawmut Bank, N.A. v. Chase, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243740\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243740/shawmut-bank-na-v-chase/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 483 (Mass.App.Ct.), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></span> (Mass.1993), that the professionally conducted auction at which the trucks were sold was commercially reasonable.  But we agree with the appraisal of the magistrate judge in concluding that such a showing had been made.   See Nadler v. Baybank Merrimack Valley, N.A., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435008\"><a href=\"/opinion/435008/harold-nadler-v-baybank-merrimack-valley-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 183-84 (1st Cir.1984).  Serra has been imaginatively defended but his liability is clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
