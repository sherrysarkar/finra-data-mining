This appeal grows out of a\n\nlengthy and complex dispute over commercial liability insurance\n\ncoverage.           At odds are the insured, Metropolitan Life Insurance\n\nCo.    (\"MetLife\")1        and    one   of     its   insurers,   Liberty   Mutual\n\nInsurance Co. (\"Liberty\").               MetLife claims that Liberty had a\n\nduty       to   defend    and    indemnify     MetLife    in   numerous   lawsuits\n\nrelating to the marketing of life insurance policies and real\n\nestate investments.             Liberty refused       coverage and prevailed in\n\nthe district court.             MetLife now appeals.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n                The    origins    of    this    dispute   lie    in   twenty-seven\n\nlawsuits brought against MetLife by dissatisfied customers.                    The\n\nlawsuits fall into three groups:\n\n                •        Sixteen individual \"vanishing premium\" lawsuits\n                         in Alabama state courts (the \"Alabama cases\");\n\n                •        Nine nationwide \"vanishing premium\" class\n                         actions in federal court (the \"class actions\");\n                         and\n\n                •        Two real estate investment cases arising out of\n                         dealings with Copley Real Estate Advisors, a\n                         MetLife subsidiary (the \"real estate cases\").\n\n\n       1\n     MetLife is the successor corporation to the original\ninsured, New England Mutual Insurance Co. MetLife merged with\nNew England Mutual in 1996 and, for simplicity's sake, this\ndecision refers throughout to MetLife.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fMetLife claims that the Commercial (previously \"Comprehensive\")\n\nGeneral    Liability    Insurance        (\"CGL\")       and   Umbrella     Excess\n\nLiability Insurance (\"UEL\") policies that it purchased from\n\nLiberty require that Liberty defend and indemnify MetLife.                      We\n\ndescribe each group of lawsuits in turn.\n\n            The   Alabama     Cases.      From   late    1994   through      1996,\n\nsixteen individuals filed suit against MetLife in Alabama state\n\ncourts     claiming    that     MetLife       sales     representatives        had\n\nnegligently or intentionally made misrepresentations concerning\n\nMetLife's life insurance policies.             In particular, the lawsuits\n\ncharged    that   representatives       had    told    buyers   that    if    they\n\nreinvested    their    yearly     life       insurance       dividends,      their\n\nobligation to pay premiums would \"vanish\" after eight to ten\n\nyears.    In fact, the buyers' payment obligations continued.                  The\n\nAlabama plaintiffs claimed that as a result of MetLife's actions\n\nthey suffered monetary damages and mental anguish.\n\n            Beginning in December 1994, MetLife began tendering\n\nthe Alabama cases to Liberty.          Based on the plaintiffs' \"mental\n\nanguish\" claims, MetLife argued that Liberty had a duty to\n\ndefend and indemnify MetLife because its CGL policy included\n\ncoverage    for   \"personal     injury\"      claims.     Initially,       Liberty\n\nagreed to defend the claims, but eventually it concluded that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe policies did not afford any coverage and notified MetLife\n\nthat it would neither defend nor indemnify.\n\n            In the litigation with the Alabama plaintiffs, MetLife\n\neventually paid legal fees of approximately $450,000 and settled\n\n15 of the 16 suits for roughly $2.7 million.              The last suit was\n\nstill   pending     when    the   present    federal    action     was   heard.\n\nMetLife seeks to hold Liberty liable for both the defense costs\n\nand the settlement payments.\n\n            The Class Actions.         The second group of suits also\n\narose     from   customer    complaints      about     vanishing    premiums.\n\nBeginning in October 1995, class actions were filed in various\n\nfederal and state courts against MetLife; all recited claims\n\nthat were similar to those in the Alabama cases.                 The federal\n\nclass actions were consolidated in the federal district court in\n\nMassachusetts.      The consolidated complaint alleged inter alia\n\nthat MetLife's misdescription of the vanishing premium concept\n\ncomprised    \"unfair   competition,\"        violating    the   Massachusetts\n\nConsumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §§ 2, 9\n\n(2000).\n\n            MetLife tendered the class action cases to Liberty on\n\nthe ground that the CGL policy provided coverage for claims of\n\nunfair competition arising out of advertising.              The advertising\n\nto   which       MetLife    pointed     were    the      computer-generated\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fillustrations      it    used    during    the   vanishing      premium       sales\n\nmeetings with customers.           Liberty declined to defend the class\n\nactions    or    indemnify      MetLife.      MetLife   spent   more   than      $4\n\nmillion in legal fees to defend the suits.                 Subsequent to its\n\ndecision    in    this   case,    the   district   court    approved      a    $155\n\nmillion settlement for the class actions.\n\n            The Real Estate Cases.            The final group of lawsuits\n\nstemmed from MetLife's sale of commercial real estate interests\n\nto two state pension fund boards.              In 1987, Copley Real Estate\n\nAdvisors, a MetLife subsidiary, sold $450 million worth of\n\ncommercial real estate to the Washington State Investment Board\n\n(the \"Washington board\") and $50 million worth of real estate to\n\nthe Ohio State Teachers Retirement Board (the \"Ohio board\").\n\nWashington also bought other real estate interests controlled by\n\nMetLife--one set of investments between 1984 and 1990 for about\n\n$185 million and another set between 1986 and 1988 for about $65\n\nmillion.\n\n            As national real estate markets declined in the late\n\n1980s, the investments quickly lost much of their value.                         In\n\n1993, Washington and Ohio sued MetLife in state court suits\n\nalleging numerous wrongs; one set of claims was that MetLife had\n\nmisrepresented the risks, fees, and other material aspects of\n\nthe investments.         In June 1995, MetLife notified Liberty of the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fWashington and Ohio lawsuits.         Because the false statements\n\ncomplained of by the Washington and Ohio boards appeared in\n\nMetLife's written promotional material, MetLife said that the\n\nsuits were covered by both the CGL and UEL policies' advertising\n\ninjury clauses.\n\n         Liberty concluded that it would not defend or indemnify\n\nMetLife as to any of these real estate suits; it said that the\n\npromotional materials were not advertising and, further, that\n\ncoverage was excluded under the policies' \"insurance and related\n\noperations exclusion\" (\"IROE\").       MetLife subsequently incurred\n\nnearly $7.75 million in legal expenses in the two suits and\n\nsettled both actions; the Washington claim settled for almost\n\n$120 million.     The record does not indicate the amount of the\n\nOhio settlement.\n\n         The Policies.     MetLife purchased eleven separate CGL\n\npolicies (1985-96) and three separate UEL policies (1986-89);\n\neach policy covered a single year.        The UEL policies provide\n\nhigher liability limits.   The coverage provisions are, so far as\n\npertinent here, the same except where otherwise indicated.      The\n\nkey policy provisions in dispute are included in an appendix to\n\nthis opinion.\n\n         The UEL and CGL policies provided coverage, subject to\n\nexclusions, for several broad categories of liability.           As\n\n\n                                -6-\n\falready noted, the liabilities for which MetLife sought coverage\n\nstemmed from MetLife's alleged misrepresentations in selling\n\nvanishing    premium   insurance    to   consumers   and   its   alleged\n\nmisrepresentations in the sale of real estate interests to the\n\nWashington and Ohio boards.         To establish coverage, MetLife\n\nmainly relied on provisions covering so-called \"advertising\n\ninjury,\" a phrase defined slightly differently in the CGL and\n\nUEL policies.     Further, in the Alabama cases, MetLife also\n\nrelied on a coverage provision for \"personal injury,\" which was\n\ncontained in the CGL policies, but not the UEL policies.\n\n            In addition to disputing initial coverage, the main\n\nexclusion invoked by Liberty was the multi-part IROE exclusion\n\nfrom both personal injury and advertising liability, captioned\n\n\"insurance and related operations.\"       The IROE, which was present\n\nin the CGL policies between 1985 and 1988 and all of the UEL\n\npolicies, contains two paragraphs pertinent here:          one excluding\n\nclaims concerning insurance or annuities, and another excluding\n\ninjury or liability resulting from professional services in\n\neffecting insurance, the conduct of an investment or acting as\n\na fiduciary for pension or welfare funds.\n\n            The District Court Proceedings.      In June 1997, after\n\nLiberty had refused to defend or indemnify in all three sets of\n\nsuits against MetLife, MetLife brought a state-court declaratory\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fjudgment action against Liberty in Alabama seeking defense and\n\nindemnification      for       the   twenty-seven    lawsuits.      Liberty\n\ncountered by filing its own declaratory judgment action in the\n\nfederal district court in Massachusetts, asserting that it had\n\nno duty to defend or indemnify MetLife.               After the district\n\ncourt denied MetLife's motion to dismiss or stay the federal\n\naction in deference to MetLife's Alabama action, MetLife filed\n\na counterclaim in federal court to establish coverage in all\n\nthree groups of suits.\n\n            Over the next two years, the district court supervised\n\nextensive discovery, heard numerous motions, and conducted a\n\nlengthy trial.      Although the trial began with MetLife ready to\n\ntry its claims as to all three sets of lawsuits, in the end the\n\nclaims submitted to the jury were greatly narrowed by two sets\n\nof rulings by the district court during trial--rulings that give\n\nrise to two of the three main issues pressed by MetLife on this\n\nappeal.\n\n            For the class action cases, MetLife asserted coverage\n\non the ground that the misrepresentations charged in those cases\n\nfell within the advertising injury coverage of the Liberty\n\npolicies.    Its theory of coverage under the CGL policies relied\n\non   the   fact   that   the    master   complaint   in   the   consolidated\n\nMassachusetts class action against MetLife included a cause of\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\faction for unfair competition under chapter 93A, and the CGL\n\npolicies included \"unfair competition\" within the definition of\n\n\"advertising injury.\"2\n\n          In a motion for summary judgment, Liberty asserted that\n\nthe CGL policy only covered claims of unfair competition when\n\nthey involved injury to an insured's competitors, and it invoked\n\nMassachusetts case law interpreting similar insurance clauses.\n\nThe district court denied Liberty's motion for a variety of\n\nreasons, but its decision did not squarely address the merits of\n\nLiberty's claim regarding unfair competition.         Liberty Mut. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 53 F. Supp. 2d 529, 533-34 (D.\n\nMass. 1999).   Liberty also failed in other efforts to forestall\n\ntrial on coverage for the class action suits.\n\n          On January 24, 2000, the first day of trial, Liberty\n\nrenewed its argument in a motion in limine to preclude MetLife\n\nfrom claiming any coverage for, or presenting any evidence\n\nrelating to, the unfair competition claim arising from the class\n\naction   suits.   To   MetLife's    surprise,   the    district   court\n\nprovisionally agreed with Liberty and prohibited MetLife from\n\n\n    2 The UEL policies did not include \"unfair competition\" as a\nform of advertising injury, but included in the definition other\nlanguage not appearing in the CGL, namely, coverage for any\n\"negligent act, error or omission in the use of advertising or\nmerchandising ideas.\" As to the UEL policies, MetLife relied on\nthis latter language to establish coverage.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fmaking any mention of unfair competition coverage in its opening\n\nargument.    MetLife was never able to persuade the court to alter\n\nits position, so no evidence relating to unfair competition\n\ncoverage           was       presented           at       trial.\n\n            The district court's other contested ruling, which cut\n\neven deeper, concerned MetLife's failure to allocate its damages\n\nin a manner satisfactory to the district court.    The issue first\n\narose when MetLife made a proffer of testimony of its in-house\n\ncounsel, Robert Jordan.      In cross examining Jordan, Liberty\n\nelicited the fact that some of the damages presented by MetLife\n\nmight be attributed to defense and settlement costs paid by\n\nMetLife on behalf of its independent sales agents, who were not\n\ncovered by Liberty's insurance.       The court expressed concern\n\nthat MetLife did not intend to allocate its damages between\n\nthese uninsured agents and the insured principal or between\n\nc o v e r e d      a n d     u n c o v e r e d    c l a i m s .\n\n            On the fifth day of the trial, the district judge\n\nreturned to this issue when he discussed the parties' proposed\n\njury instructions.    The district judge advised the parties that:\n\n            [I]f MetLife is only able to establish that there\n            is a policy coverage for a small minority of the\n            total of the claims within a particular lawsuit,\n            the idea that that triggers a duty to defend the\n            whole   lawsuit  at   Liberty  Mutual's   expense\n            entirely and also a duty to bear the costs of\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f           settlement         is,    I    think,       going   to     be     out    of\n           bounds.\n\nBecause MetLife had not yet attempted to present its damages\n\nevidence, the district court did not rule on whether and how\n\nMetLife would have to allocate its damages.\n\n           On     two   occasions          thereafter,         the    district        court\n\nprohibited MetLife from presenting evidence of damages.                              On the\n\nfirst    occasion,      the   district          court    disallowed         evidence       of\n\ndefense costs in the real estate cases on the ground that it did\n\nnot properly allocate costs between the Washington and Ohio\n\nlawsuits and between covered and uncovered claims within the\n\nWashington case; it also disallowed evidence of the Washington\n\nsettlement on the ground that the settlement figure did not\n\nallocate between covered and uncovered claims.                             On the second\n\noccasion, the district court did not allow evidence of MetLife's\n\nlegal bills for the Alabama cases and the class actions on the\n\nground    that    the   bills       were    not    relevant          until     they      were\n\nestablished as necessary by an expert witness.\n\n           At    the    close       of    all    evidence      the     district       court\n\nsuggested that MetLife might reopen its case for the purpose of\n\npresenting       damages      evidence          that     allocated         defense        and\n\nsettlement      costs   between          covered    and    not       covered       matters.\n\nHowever, when MetLife continued to proffer damages evidence in\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\funallocated form, the district court ultimately refused to allow\n\nMetLife to reopen the damages issue.       As a result of the\n\ndistrict court's preclusion of damages evidence, none of the\n\ndamage claims as to any of the three sets of lawsuits were\n\nsubmitted to the jury.\n\n         In the end, because of the district court's rulings,\n\nthe jury was asked to determine only whether Liberty had a\n\nfuture duty to defend or indemnify a single Alabama lawsuit\n\n(Loudermilch) that had not yet been resolved and whether it had\n\na future duty to defend or indemnify the still pending class\n\naction lawsuits under the UEL policy (but not under the CGL\n\npolicy, since the court had already rejected coverage based on\n\nits reading of the unfair competition language).    None of the\n\nclaims based on the real estate cases were submitted to the jury\n\nbecause MetLife conceded that it had not made out its prima\n\nfacie case since its damages evidence had been excluded.\n\n         After deliberating for several days, the jury found\n\nthat Liberty did not have a duty to defend or indemnify MetLife\n\non any of the claims submitted to the jury regarding Loudermilch\n\nor the class action cases.   In doing so, the jury answered 133\n\nspecial questions that detailed its reasoning.   The jury found\n\ninter alia that the Loudermilch case was not covered by the CGL\n\npolicy's \"personal injury\" clause, that the class actions were\n\n\n                              -12-\n\fnot covered by the UEL policy's \"advertising injury\" clause, and\n\nthat numerous exclusions barred MetLife from recovering defense\n\nor settlement costs for both sets of lawsuits.\n\n              On April 12, 2000, the district court issued a judgment\n\nin favor of Liberty on all counts, including those that had not\n\nbeen submitted to the jury.              In an accompanying unreported\n\nopinion, the court explained why certain questions had not been\n\nsubmitted to the jury and why it had ruled against MetLife on\n\nthose issues.      In particular, the court further explicated its\n\nruling on the class action lawsuits' unfair competition claim,\n\nthe need to allocate damages, and the general scope of Liberty's\n\nduty to defend.\n\n                               II. DISCUSSION\n\n              MetLife now appeals and makes three claims of error:\n\nthat    the    district    court   incorrectly       placed     the   burden   of\n\nallocating defense and indemnity costs between covered and non-\n\ncovered matters on the insured, thus effectively preventing\n\nMetLife from presenting its damages evidence; that the district\n\ncourt erred by not permitting MetLife to seek coverage for the\n\nclass actions' unfair competition claims; and that the district\n\ncourt   erroneously       instructed    the   jury    as   to   how   it   should\n\ninterpret exclusionary clauses in the insurance policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f           We address MetLife's arguments in turn, applying de\n\nnovo review to questions of law.         Speen v. Crown Clothing Corp.,\n\n102 F.3d 625, 628 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1276\n\n(1997).    Included in this category is the interpretation of the\n\ninsurance policies where relevant facts are not in dispute.\n\nU.S. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Bourbeau, 49 F.3d 786, 787 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).    The parties agree that this diversity action is governed\n\nby the substantive law of Massachusetts.\n\n           The Alabama Cases.         Two of MetLife's three claimed\n\nerrors are implicated in the Alabama cases:             the exclusion of\n\ndamages evidence because of the district court's ruling on\n\nallocation     and   the   district   court's    jury     instruction   on\n\ninterpreting    exclusionary    clauses.      Yet   the   jury's   special\n\nverdict specifically rejected coverage for the single Alabama\n\nlawsuit that it did consider (Loudermilch).          There is no reason\n\nto think that the result would have been any different if claims\n\nbased on the other fifteen Alabama lawsuits had been submitted\n\nto the jury.\n\n           The Loudermilch case was decided by the jury because,\n\nunlike the other fifteen Alabama lawsuits, the exclusion of\n\nMetLife's damages evidence did not undermine MetLife's claim\n\nthat Liberty had a continuing duty to defend and indemnify.\n\nThus, the jury was asked:\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f                 With respect to the duty to defend, was any\n          of the claims that a policyholder made against\n          MetLife in any of the lawsuits that various\n          policyholders brought against MetLife a claim\n          within the scope of a liability insurance\n          coverage as defined in the coverage provisions of\n          any of the various policies in evidence that\n          Liberty Mutual issued to MetLife (or New\n          England)?\n\n\nTo this, the jury answered \"no,\" thus rejecting any coverage for\n\nthe Loudermilch lawsuit independent of the exclusionary clauses.\n\nBecause   the   duty     to     defend   is    broader   than     the    duty   to\n\nindemnify, Ruggerio Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. Nat'l Grange Mut.\n\nIns. Co., 724 N.E.2d 295, 298 (Mass. 2000), the jury's finding\n\nalso negates a duty to indemnify.               Bagley v. Monticello Ins.\n\nCo., 720 N.E.2d 813, 817 (Mass. 1999).\n\n          The Loudermilch jury verdict against MetLife makes\n\nMetLife's claimed errors harmless.             See Brandt v. Wand Partners,\n\n242 F.3d 6, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2001); Fite v. Digital Equip. Corp.,\n\n232 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 2000).                 As MetLife conceded in its\n\nproposed jury instructions, all of the Alabama suits involved\n\n\"substantially        similar    claims.\"       A   review   of    the   sixteen\n\ncomplaints confirms this:            many are identical and all charge\n\nMetLife with the same improper conduct and rely on the same\n\nlegal theories for recovery.             And, since      Loudermilch failed\n\ninter   alia    for    lack     of   initial    coverage,    the    result      is\n\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\funaffected by any alleged error in instructing the jury as to\n\nexclusions.\n\n             In its reply brief, MetLife argues that Liberty has\n\nfailed to show that the Alabama cases \"are so similar that some\n\nform of estoppel should apply.\"              Its sole support for this\n\nposition is to say:       \"Indeed, they are not.\"          In any event,\n\nestoppel is not the issue; the question is whether there is any\n\nreason to believe that the claims as to the fifteen lawsuits\n\nwould have been resolved differently than the sixteenth lawsuit.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 61; Fed. R. Evid. 103;             Nieves-Villanueva v.\n\nSoto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir. 1997).              We have been\n\ngiven no reason to think that they would.\n\n             The Class Actions.      In the case of the class action\n\nlawsuits, two of MetLife's three claims of error are relevant:\n\nthe district court's decision not to allow MetLife to invoke\n\nunfair competition and the jury instruction on interpreting\n\nexclusionary clauses.      However, as with the Alabama lawsuits,\n\nthe   jury    verdict   saves   us    from   juxtaposing   state   unfair\n\ncompetition law with policy coverage because any supposed error\n\nmade by the district court was (once again) harmless.\n\n             Although the district court prohibited MetLife from\n\narguing that the class action lawsuits were covered by the CGL\n\npolicy's advertising injury clause, it permitted MetLife to\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fclaim coverage under the same clause in the UEL policy because,\n\nas already noted (see note 2, above), the two policies included\n\ndifferent     definitions          of   advertising      injury.       One       of   the\n\nquestions the jury was asked was whether:\n\n             the use of [MetLife] illustrations by sales\n             agents of [MetLife], as alleged in the underlying\n             class     action    complaints,     constitute[d]\n             advertising as used in the 1986-1989 [UEL]\n             policies.\n\nTo this, the jury answered \"no.\"\n\n             Where    there        is   no   advertising       there       can   be   no\n\nadvertising injury.          The policy language expressly requires that\n\nan injury arise from the \"insured's advertising activities.\"\n\nMetLife conceded as much when it said in its proposed jury\n\ninstructions that the first element of advertising injury under\n\nboth   the    CGL    and     UEL    policies       was   the    existence        of   \"an\n\nadvertising activity\" \"committed by\" MetLife.                        See also N.H.\n\nIns. Co. v. R.L. Chaides Constr. Co., Inc., 847 F. Supp. 1452,\n1455 (N.D. Cal. 1994).\n\n             The problem for MetLife is that the jury's conclusion--\n\nthat   the    illustrations         used     by    MetLife's     agents      were     not\n\n\"advertising\" under the UEL policies--applies with equal force\n\nto   MetLife's       claim    for       coverage    under      the   CGL    policies.\n\nAlthough the CGL claim did not go to the jury, the illustrations\n\nin question are the same as those in the UEL claim.                          The only\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fdifference between the two claims was the type of wrong alleged\n\nto have been caused by the illustrations; under the CGL the\n\nwrong was unfair competition, whereas under the UEL it was a\n\n\"negligent             act,        error           or      omission.\"\n\n              Thus, even if we assume that the district court misread\n\nMassachusetts unfair competition law and mistakenly precluded\n\nMetLife's claim for coverage under the CGL policy, that error\n\nwas harmless because there is no practical likelihood that the\n\nCGL   claim    could   have    succeeded    when    the   UEL   claim   failed.\n\nBrandt, 242 F.3d at 16-17.             The jury's verdict shows that\n\nMetLife's CGL claim would not have satisfied the first element\n\nof advertising coverage, and this failure would have doomed\n\nMetLife's claim without regard to exclusions.\n\n              The Washington and Ohio Lawsuits.           As to the insurance\n\nclaims based on the Washington and Ohio lawsuits, the district\n\ncourt directed a verdict for Liberty after concluding that the\n\ndamages evidence offered by MetLife failed to allocate amounts\n\nbetween   covered      and    non-covered    claims.       MetLife   says   the\n\ndistrict court got the rules on allocation exactly backward and\n\nthat its evidence on damages should have been admitted and the\n\nclaims submitted to the jury.               Liberty defends the district\n\ncourt's allocation ruling and says that, in any case, none of\n\nthe claims are covered under the policy.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f            It is not uncommon for a lawsuit against an insured to\n\nassert some claims that are covered by the insurance policy and\n\nothers that are not.     In Massachusetts, as elsewhere, an insurer\n\nmust defend the entire lawsuit if it has a duty to defend any of\n\nthe underlying counts in the complaint.          Mt. Airy Ins. Co. v.\n\nGreenbaum, 127 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing Aetna Cas. &\n\nSur. Co. v.    Cont'l Cas. Co., 604 N.E.2d 30, 32 n.1 (Mass.\n\n1992)).   And the general rule under Massachusetts law is that if\n\nthe insurer fails to defend the lawsuit, it is liable for all\n\ndefense   costs    and   (assuming    policy    coverage)     the   entire\n\nresulting    judgment    or   settlement,   unless   liability      can   be\n\nallocated among covered and uncovered claims.               Liquor Liab.\n\nJoint Underwriting Ass'n of Mass. v. Hermitage Ins. Co., 644\n\nN.E.2d 964, 968-69 (Mass. 1995); Palermo v. Fireman's Fund Ins.\n\nCo., 676 N.E.2d 1158, 1163-64 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997).\n\n            Massachusetts courts have not expressly decided which\n\nparty bears the burden of allocating defense costs, but when\n\nallocation    of   defense    costs   is    possible,   the   burden      of\n\nallocation generally falls on the insurer.           This is certainly\n\nthe rule as to allocation of indemnity costs, Liquor Liab. Joint\n\nUnderwriting Ass'n, 644 N.E.2d at 969; Palermo, 676 N.E.2d at\n\n1163, and this approach likely applies to defense costs, since\n\nthe insurer should have been in a position to properly allocate\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fboth types of costs had it defended the lawsuit.                  See Aerojet-\n\nGen. Corp. v. Transp. Indem. Co., 948 P.2d 909, 928 (Cal. 1998);\n\nWindt, Insurance Claims & Disputes § 4.13 at 204 (3d ed. 1995).\n\n           The district court may not have been wrong in thinking\n\nthat there must be limits to this general approach.                 Here, for\n\nexample, the district court thought some of the claimed expenses\n\nrelating    to   the     vanishing    premium   suits      were     to     defend\n\nindependent agents who were not insured and others were for\n\nsales outside the period covered by Liberty's policy.                    Possibly\n\nan insured who needlessly conflates expenses not covered by the\n\npolicy with expenses that arguably are covered would forfeit any\n\nclaim that the insurer should bear the burden of disaggregating\n\nthe asserted damage figures.\n\n           However, so far as we can tell, the gravamen of the\n\ndistrict court's misallocation objection in the real estate\n\nsuits was that some of the expenses incurred in defending claims\n\nby Washington were going to benefit MetLife's future defense of\n\nthe Ohio suit.      It is hard to view such a collateral benefit as\n\na misallocation:         so long as those costs were necessary for\n\ncovered    claims   in    the   Washington   suit,   the    fact     that     the\n\nresearch and discovery might be useful in some later case would\n\nhardly defeat full recovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f          The district court was apparently also concerned that\n\nmany of the complaint's theories of recovery in the Washington\n\nsuit could not conceivably come within the advertising coverage\n\nof the UEL policy.     However, where the theories relate to a\n\ncommon core of facts, defense costs are often hard to separate\n\nbetween theories--the witnesses and documents are often the\n\nsame--and this is ordinarily the classic case for imposing the\n\nallocation burden on the insurer who refused to defend a covered\n\ntheory.   See, e.g., Home Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins.\n\nCo., 229 F.3d 56, 65-66 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          However, any mistake by the district court on this\n\nallocation issue is irrelevant unless some real estate claim\n\nagainst MetLife was arguably covered by a Liberty policy--an\n\nissue to which we now turn.    An insurer has a duty to defend its\n\ninsured \"if the allegations in the third-party complaint are\n\nreasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or\n\nadumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.\"      Mt. Airy Ins.\n\nCo., 127 F.3d at 18-19 (quoting Sterilite Corp. v. Cont'l Cas.\n\nCo., 458 N.E.2d 338, 340 (Mass. App. Ct. 1983)).     Here, Liberty\n\nhas two separate arguments against coverage.\n\n          The first argument is that the real estate suits do not\n\neven   arguably   involve   \"advertising   activities\"   within   the\n\nmeaning of the coverage provisions of the policies, an issue on\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fwhich   MetLife   bears   the   burden.      Hakim   v.   Mass.    Insurers'\n\nInsolvency Fund, 675 N.E.2d 1161, 1166 n.13 (Mass. 1997).                   The\n\nCGL and UEL definitions of advertising injury contain slightly\n\ndifferent language; but in both cases, Liberty says that the\n\npromotional materials given to the Washington and Ohio boards,\n\nessentially    prospectuses     describing    the    multi-million-dollar\n\nreal estate packages, are not \"advertising\" in any common sense\n\nof the term.\n\n             There is a basic split in authority on this issue.\n\nSome courts have taken the term \"advertising\" in its ordinary\n\nusage   to   suggest   public    dissemination,      usually      to   a   wide\n\naudience; on this view, a prospectus tailored to one customer\n\nand one transaction, setting forth the terms of the proposed\n\ndeal and its supposed advantages, is not advertising but part of\n\nthe negotiation.       Other courts have said that advertising can\n\noccur in individual transactions, at least where the customer\n\nbase is small or where this is the customary practice in the\n\nindustry.     Peerless Lighting Corp. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., 82\n\nCal. App. 4th 995, 1008-09 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000) (collecting\n\ncases).\n\n             In Massachusetts there is only one leading case on\n\npoint and it very much adopts the former view.            Smartfoods, Inc.\n\nv. Northbrook Property & Casualty Co., 618 N.E.2d 1365 (Mass.\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fApp. Ct. 1993), concerned a letter from one company to another\n\nproposing terms for the latter to act as distributor of products\n\nfor the former; when litigation arose between the two companies,\n\nthe insured producer relied inter alia on an advertising injury\n\nclause similar to the CGL policy in this case.                       The Appeals\n\nCourt said that \"advertising means a public announcement to\n\nproclaim the qualities of a product or point of view\" and that\n\nadvertising's        objective   is    the     \"[w]ide     dissemination\"         of\n\ninformation about a product.           Id. at 1368.       It deemed the letter\n\nso unrelated to \"advertising\" as to defeat even a duty to\n\ndefend.   Id. at 1369.\n\n          MetLife counters that this case is distinguishable on\n\nits facts, because in the present real estate cases there were\n\n\"brochures     and     a   marketing    program      directed        at    multiple\n\ninstitutional investors.\"         Yet aside from Smartfoods's broad\n\nlanguage, Smartfoods is fairly close on its facts:                        apparently\n\nthe producer sent similar letters to six other distributors.\n\nFurthermore,     MetLife      concedes        that   it    had   a        continuing\n\nrelationship with the two state boards, making a proposal for a\n\nparticular transaction even less like advertising and more like\n\ncontinuing business.\n\n          MetLife also asserts that its UEL policy is broader in\n\ndefining advertising injury that the CGL language used both in\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fthe Liberty policy and the Smartfoods case.                It is true that the\n\nlatter two do not extend protection to claims for \"any negligent\n\nact,     error     or   omission   in     the    use      of   advertising     or\n\nmerchandising ideas\"; but the UEL policy, like the CGL and\n\nSmartfoods policies, has a prior condition, namely, that the\n\nact, error or omission grow out of \"advertising activities.\"\n\nThe former is a pre-condition of any coverage under this part of\n\nthe policy and, if Smartfoods is followed, then this condition\n\nhas not been met.\n\n            Absent a decision by the state's highest court, we are\n\nfree   to   make    our   own   best   guess    as   to   Massachusetts      law,\n\nMichelin Tires (Canada) Ltd. v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 666\n\nF.2d 673, 682 (1st Cir. 1981), but there is no reason not to\n\nconsider Smartfoods as the prevailing rule in Massachusetts: it\n\nis reasonably recent; it is not inconsistent with SJC precedent;\n\nand it accords with what appears to be the majority view, albeit\n\nby a small margin, among the courts that have spoken on the\n\nissue, Peerless Lighting Corp., 82 Cal. App. 4th at 1008-09; 2\n\nWindt, Insurance Claims & Disputes, § 11.29 at 339 n.404 (3d ed.\n\n1995).\n\n            Smartfoods was decided before the Washington and Ohio\n\ncases were tendered to Liberty.                 Nothing in the complaints\n\nidentified advertising at all; indeed, MetLife tendered the\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fcases only after it ascertained that the prospectuses would be\n\npart of the boards' evidence.              But by this time Smartfoods had\n\nmade       clear   that   under   Massachusetts    law,   such   a   tailored\n\ndocument setting out a proposal for an individual customer is\n\nnot \"advertising activity\" or even arguably so.            MetLife's claim\n\nfor coverage of the Washington and Ohio lawsuits thus fails\n\nbecause there was no \"advertising injury.\"\n\n              Even if there was advertising activity and injury, we\n\nthink that MetLife's claim would still fail because of the\n\nexclusions of the IROE.           The IROE was in all three of MetLife's\n\nUEL policies, which are the pertinent policies for the real\n\nestate cases.3        The critical language appears in subparagraphs\n\n(c)(1), (5), and (6) of the IROE, which exclude coverage for\n\nadvertising liability where such liability \"arise[s] out of the\n\nrendering or failure to render professional services in\" the\n\nfollowing activities:\n\n              (1) advising, inspecting, reporting or making\n              recommendations in the Insured's capacity as an\n              insurance company, consultant, broker, agent or\n              representative thereof, or\n                          . . .\n              (5) the conduct of an investment, loan or\n              operation, or\n\n       3\n     On the first day of trial, MetLife conceded that the CGL\npolicy's unfair competition provision applied only to the\nvanishing premium class actions and not to the real estate\ncases. Moreover, MetLife's briefs--both at trial and on appeal-\n-focus only on coverage under the UEL policy.\n\n                                    -25-\n\f            (6) any capacity as a fiduciary or trustee for\n            mutual funds, pension or welfare funds or other\n            similar activities. . . .4\n\n            The    Washington        and   Ohio   complaints       alleged     that\n\nMetLife, as the parties' investment adviser and manager, assumed\n\nfiduciary duties to the pension funds and that MetLife breached\n\nits fiduciary duties by misrepresenting and failing to disclose\n\naspects of the real estate transactions and by mismanaging the\n\nboard's investment portfolio.              It seems to us that on their\n\nface,    such     claims    fall     directly     within    the     language     of\n\n\"advising\"      and    \"conduct[ing]\"         investment    activities       under\n\nsubparagraphs (c)(1) and (5) and acting in \"any capacity\" as a\n\nfiduciary    for      pension   or    welfare     funds    under    subparagraph\n\n(c)(6).5\n\n            Neither of MetLife's two counter-arguments to this\n\ninitial conclusion is persuasive.              It first says that the common\n\ncondition    for      the   exclusion--that       liability        arise   out   of\n\n\n\n     4\n     Liberty also relies upon paragraph (a) of the IROE\nexcluding advertising liability that relates to an annuity; but\nwhile the principal transaction involved an annuity in certain\nrespects, the record does not adequately reveal just what role\nit played, and we do not rely upon paragraph (a).\n     5\n     In Massachusetts, the term \"arising out of\" has been\ninterpreted to require merely that a claim be connected to an\nexcluded event. See Med. Records Assocs., Inc. v. Am. Empire\nSurplus Lines Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 512, 516 n.4 (1st Cir. 1998)\n(citing New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,\n667 N.E.2d 295, 198 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996)).\n\n                                       -26-\n\f\"professional services\"--is not satisfied, because professional\n\nservices encompasses not mere business operations but activities\n\ninvolving \"the need for specialized learning or training.\"            The\n\nlatter is a supportable view, e.g., Roe v. Fed. Ins. Co., 587\n\nN.E.2d 214, 217 (Mass. 1992), but it hardly excludes assistance\n\nand   advice   provided   by   a    professional   financial   firm    in\n\nassessing and purchasing a huge real estate portfolio.\n\n          The other response offered by MetLife to subparagraphs\n\n(c)(1), (5), and (6) is that the exclusion, where it applies,\n\nonly defeats the duty to indemnify and not the duty to defend.\n\nMetLife notes that the introduction to the IROE states that\n\n\"[t]his policy does not apply to . . . Advertising Liability\";\n\nand it suggests that \"advertising liability\" refers not to all\n\ndamages incurred because of \"advertising injury\" but only to the\n\nliability to the plaintiffs who sue the insured and then collect\n\na judgment or settlement.          In other words, by using the term\n\n\"liability,\" MetLife says that Liberty made the entire exclusion\n\ninapplicable to defense costs.\n\n          The duty to defend, in both the CGL and UEL policies,\n\nis derivative; it requires that the claim of the plaintiff in\n\nthe underlying suit--whether valid or not--seek damages for some\n\ninjury that is arguably covered by the policy.        See Higgenbottom\n\nv. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 425 N.E.2d 370, 372 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\f1981); Windt, Insurance Claims & Disputes § 4.01 at 149-50 (3d\n\ned. 1995).      If such a suit seeks on its face to impose a\n\nliability excluded from coverage by the IROE, then the liability\n\nis   not   insured    against   and    there    is   not   even   an     arguable\n\nobligation to defend.        Terrio v. McDonough, 450 N.E.2d 190, 194\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1983).6\n\n            As matters stand, we think that Liberty had no duty to\n\ndefend or indemnify MetLife in the real estate suits because the\n\ncases are not within the advertising injury coverage and, even\n\nif they were, would be independently excluded by the IROE.\n\nEither     ground    is   sufficient    for    affirmance.        Hope    Furnace\n\nAssocs., Inc. v. FDIC, 71 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1995).                      Given\n\nthe stakes, we have considered MetLife's arguments with great\n\ncare, but in the end, find no basis for reversal or remand.\n\n            For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n                                  APPENDIX\n\nI.

This appeal grows out of a\n\nlengthy and complex dispute over commercial liability insurance\n\ncoverage.           At odds are the insured, Metropolitan Life Insurance\n\nCo.    (\"MetLife\")1        and    one   of     its   insurers,   Liberty   Mutual\n\nInsurance Co. (\"Liberty\").               MetLife claims that Liberty had a\n\nduty       to   defend    and    indemnify     MetLife    in   numerous   lawsuits\n\nrelating to the marketing of life insurance policies and real\n\nestate investments.             Liberty refused       coverage and prevailed in\n\nthe district court.             MetLife now appeals.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n                The    origins    of    this    dispute   lie    in   twenty-seven\n\nlawsuits brought against MetLife by dissatisfied customers.                    The\n\nlawsuits fall into three groups:\n\n                •        Sixteen individual \"vanishing premium\" lawsuits\n                         in Alabama state courts (the \"Alabama cases\");\n\n                •        Nine nationwide \"vanishing premium\" class\n                         actions in federal court (the \"class actions\");\n                         and\n\n                •        Two real estate investment cases arising out of\n                         dealings with Copley Real Estate Advisors, a\n                         MetLife subsidiary (the \"real estate cases\").\n\n\n       1\n     MetLife is the successor corporation to the original\ninsured, New England Mutual Insurance Co. MetLife merged with\nNew England Mutual in 1996 and, for simplicity's sake, this\ndecision refers throughout to MetLife.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fMetLife claims that the Commercial (previously \"Comprehensive\")\n\nGeneral    Liability    Insurance        (\"CGL\")       and   Umbrella     Excess\n\nLiability Insurance (\"UEL\") policies that it purchased from\n\nLiberty require that Liberty defend and indemnify MetLife.                      We\n\ndescribe each group of lawsuits in turn.\n\n            The   Alabama     Cases.      From   late    1994   through      1996,\n\nsixteen individuals filed suit against MetLife in Alabama state\n\ncourts     claiming    that     MetLife       sales     representatives        had\n\nnegligently or intentionally made misrepresentations concerning\n\nMetLife's life insurance policies.             In particular, the lawsuits\n\ncharged    that   representatives       had    told    buyers   that    if    they\n\nreinvested    their    yearly     life       insurance       dividends,      their\n\nobligation to pay premiums would \"vanish\" after eight to ten\n\nyears.    In fact, the buyers' payment obligations continued.                  The\n\nAlabama plaintiffs claimed that as a result of MetLife's actions\n\nthey suffered monetary damages and mental anguish.\n\n            Beginning in December 1994, MetLife began tendering\n\nthe Alabama cases to Liberty.          Based on the plaintiffs' \"mental\n\nanguish\" claims, MetLife argued that Liberty had a duty to\n\ndefend and indemnify MetLife because its CGL policy included\n\ncoverage    for   \"personal     injury\"      claims.     Initially,       Liberty\n\nagreed to defend the claims, but eventually it concluded that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fthe policies did not afford any coverage and notified MetLife\n\nthat it would neither defend nor indemnify.\n\n            In the litigation with the Alabama plaintiffs, MetLife\n\neventually paid legal fees of approximately $450,000 and settled\n\n15 of the 16 suits for roughly $2.7 million.              The last suit was\n\nstill   pending     when    the   present    federal    action     was   heard.\n\nMetLife seeks to hold Liberty liable for both the defense costs\n\nand the settlement payments.\n\n            The Class Actions.         The second group of suits also\n\narose     from   customer    complaints      about     vanishing    premiums.\n\nBeginning in October 1995, class actions were filed in various\n\nfederal and state courts against MetLife; all recited claims\n\nthat were similar to those in the Alabama cases.                 The federal\n\nclass actions were consolidated in the federal district court in\n\nMassachusetts.      The consolidated complaint alleged inter alia\n\nthat MetLife's misdescription of the vanishing premium concept\n\ncomprised    \"unfair   competition,\"        violating    the   Massachusetts\n\nConsumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §§ 2, 9\n\n(2000).\n\n            MetLife tendered the class action cases to Liberty on\n\nthe ground that the CGL policy provided coverage for claims of\n\nunfair competition arising out of advertising.              The advertising\n\nto   which       MetLife    pointed     were    the      computer-generated\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fillustrations      it    used    during    the   vanishing      premium       sales\n\nmeetings with customers.           Liberty declined to defend the class\n\nactions    or    indemnify      MetLife.      MetLife   spent   more   than      $4\n\nmillion in legal fees to defend the suits.                 Subsequent to its\n\ndecision    in    this   case,    the   district   court    approved      a    $155\n\nmillion settlement for the class actions.\n\n            The Real Estate Cases.            The final group of lawsuits\n\nstemmed from MetLife's sale of commercial real estate interests\n\nto two state pension fund boards.              In 1987, Copley Real Estate\n\nAdvisors, a MetLife subsidiary, sold $450 million worth of\n\ncommercial real estate to the Washington State Investment Board\n\n(the \"Washington board\") and $50 million worth of real estate to\n\nthe Ohio State Teachers Retirement Board (the \"Ohio board\").\n\nWashington also bought other real estate interests controlled by\n\nMetLife--one set of investments between 1984 and 1990 for about\n\n$185 million and another set between 1986 and 1988 for about $65\n\nmillion.\n\n            As national real estate markets declined in the late\n\n1980s, the investments quickly lost much of their value.                         In\n\n1993, Washington and Ohio sued MetLife in state court suits\n\nalleging numerous wrongs; one set of claims was that MetLife had\n\nmisrepresented the risks, fees, and other material aspects of\n\nthe investments.         In June 1995, MetLife notified Liberty of the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fWashington and Ohio lawsuits.         Because the false statements\n\ncomplained of by the Washington and Ohio boards appeared in\n\nMetLife's written promotional material, MetLife said that the\n\nsuits were covered by both the CGL and UEL policies' advertising\n\ninjury clauses.\n\n         Liberty concluded that it would not defend or indemnify\n\nMetLife as to any of these real estate suits; it said that the\n\npromotional materials were not advertising and, further, that\n\ncoverage was excluded under the policies' \"insurance and related\n\noperations exclusion\" (\"IROE\").       MetLife subsequently incurred\n\nnearly $7.75 million in legal expenses in the two suits and\n\nsettled both actions; the Washington claim settled for almost\n\n$120 million.     The record does not indicate the amount of the\n\nOhio settlement.\n\n         The Policies.     MetLife purchased eleven separate CGL\n\npolicies (1985-96) and three separate UEL policies (1986-89);\n\neach policy covered a single year.        The UEL policies provide\n\nhigher liability limits.   The coverage provisions are, so far as\n\npertinent here, the same except where otherwise indicated.      The\n\nkey policy provisions in dispute are included in an appendix to\n\nthis opinion.\n\n         The UEL and CGL policies provided coverage, subject to\n\nexclusions, for several broad categories of liability.           As\n\n\n                                -6-\n\falready noted, the liabilities for which MetLife sought coverage\n\nstemmed from MetLife's alleged misrepresentations in selling\n\nvanishing    premium   insurance    to   consumers   and   its   alleged\n\nmisrepresentations in the sale of real estate interests to the\n\nWashington and Ohio boards.         To establish coverage, MetLife\n\nmainly relied on provisions covering so-called \"advertising\n\ninjury,\" a phrase defined slightly differently in the CGL and\n\nUEL policies.     Further, in the Alabama cases, MetLife also\n\nrelied on a coverage provision for \"personal injury,\" which was\n\ncontained in the CGL policies, but not the UEL policies.\n\n            In addition to disputing initial coverage, the main\n\nexclusion invoked by Liberty was the multi-part IROE exclusion\n\nfrom both personal injury and advertising liability, captioned\n\n\"insurance and related operations.\"       The IROE, which was present\n\nin the CGL policies between 1985 and 1988 and all of the UEL\n\npolicies, contains two paragraphs pertinent here:          one excluding\n\nclaims concerning insurance or annuities, and another excluding\n\ninjury or liability resulting from professional services in\n\neffecting insurance, the conduct of an investment or acting as\n\na fiduciary for pension or welfare funds.\n\n            The District Court Proceedings.      In June 1997, after\n\nLiberty had refused to defend or indemnify in all three sets of\n\nsuits against MetLife, MetLife brought a state-court declaratory\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fjudgment action against Liberty in Alabama seeking defense and\n\nindemnification      for       the   twenty-seven    lawsuits.      Liberty\n\ncountered by filing its own declaratory judgment action in the\n\nfederal district court in Massachusetts, asserting that it had\n\nno duty to defend or indemnify MetLife.               After the district\n\ncourt denied MetLife's motion to dismiss or stay the federal\n\naction in deference to MetLife's Alabama action, MetLife filed\n\na counterclaim in federal court to establish coverage in all\n\nthree groups of suits.\n\n            Over the next two years, the district court supervised\n\nextensive discovery, heard numerous motions, and conducted a\n\nlengthy trial.      Although the trial began with MetLife ready to\n\ntry its claims as to all three sets of lawsuits, in the end the\n\nclaims submitted to the jury were greatly narrowed by two sets\n\nof rulings by the district court during trial--rulings that give\n\nrise to two of the three main issues pressed by MetLife on this\n\nappeal.\n\n            For the class action cases, MetLife asserted coverage\n\non the ground that the misrepresentations charged in those cases\n\nfell within the advertising injury coverage of the Liberty\n\npolicies.    Its theory of coverage under the CGL policies relied\n\non   the   fact   that   the    master   complaint   in   the   consolidated\n\nMassachusetts class action against MetLife included a cause of\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\faction for unfair competition under chapter 93A, and the CGL\n\npolicies included \"unfair competition\" within the definition of\n\n\"advertising injury.\"2\n\n          In a motion for summary judgment, Liberty asserted that\n\nthe CGL policy only covered claims of unfair competition when\n\nthey involved injury to an insured's competitors, and it invoked\n\nMassachusetts case law interpreting similar insurance clauses.\n\nThe district court denied Liberty's motion for a variety of\n\nreasons, but its decision did not squarely address the merits of\n\nLiberty's claim regarding unfair competition.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533-34 (D.\n\nMass. 1999).   Liberty also failed in other efforts to forestall\n\ntrial on coverage for the class action suits.\n\n          On January 24, 2000, the first day of trial, Liberty\n\nrenewed its argument in a motion in limine to preclude MetLife\n\nfrom claiming any coverage for, or presenting any evidence\n\nrelating to, the unfair competition claim arising from the class\n\naction   suits.   To   MetLife's    surprise,   the    district   court\n\nprovisionally agreed with Liberty and prohibited MetLife from\n\n\n    2 The UEL policies did not include \"unfair competition\" as a\nform of advertising injury, but included in the definition other\nlanguage not appearing in the CGL, namely, coverage for any\n\"negligent act, error or omission in the use of advertising or\nmerchandising ideas.\" As to the UEL policies, MetLife relied on\nthis latter language to establish coverage.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fmaking any mention of unfair competition coverage in its opening\n\nargument.    MetLife was never able to persuade the court to alter\n\nits position, so no evidence relating to unfair competition\n\ncoverage           was       presented           at       trial.\n\n            The district court's other contested ruling, which cut\n\neven deeper, concerned MetLife's failure to allocate its damages\n\nin a manner satisfactory to the district court.    The issue first\n\narose when MetLife made a proffer of testimony of its in-house\n\ncounsel, Robert Jordan.      In cross examining Jordan, Liberty\n\nelicited the fact that some of the damages presented by MetLife\n\nmight be attributed to defense and settlement costs paid by\n\nMetLife on behalf of its independent sales agents, who were not\n\ncovered by Liberty's insurance.       The court expressed concern\n\nthat MetLife did not intend to allocate its damages between\n\nthese uninsured agents and the insured principal or between\n\nc o v e r e d      a n d     u n c o v e r e d    c l a i m s .\n\n            On the fifth day of the trial, the district judge\n\nreturned to this issue when he discussed the parties' proposed\n\njury instructions.    The district judge advised the parties that:\n\n            [I]f MetLife is only able to establish that there\n            is a policy coverage for a small minority of the\n            total of the claims within a particular lawsuit,\n            the idea that that triggers a duty to defend the\n            whole   lawsuit  at   Liberty  Mutual's   expense\n            entirely and also a duty to bear the costs of\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f           settlement         is,    I    think,       going   to     be     out    of\n           bounds.\n\nBecause MetLife had not yet attempted to present its damages\n\nevidence, the district court did not rule on whether and how\n\nMetLife would have to allocate its damages.\n\n           On     two   occasions          thereafter,         the    district        court\n\nprohibited MetLife from presenting evidence of damages.                              On the\n\nfirst    occasion,      the   district          court    disallowed         evidence       of\n\ndefense costs in the real estate cases on the ground that it did\n\nnot properly allocate costs between the Washington and Ohio\n\nlawsuits and between covered and uncovered claims within the\n\nWashington case; it also disallowed evidence of the Washington\n\nsettlement on the ground that the settlement figure did not\n\nallocate between covered and uncovered claims.                             On the second\n\noccasion, the district court did not allow evidence of MetLife's\n\nlegal bills for the Alabama cases and the class actions on the\n\nground    that    the   bills       were    not    relevant          until     they      were\n\nestablished as necessary by an expert witness.\n\n           At    the    close       of    all    evidence      the     district       court\n\nsuggested that MetLife might reopen its case for the purpose of\n\npresenting       damages      evidence          that     allocated         defense        and\n\nsettlement      costs   between          covered    and    not       covered       matters.\n\nHowever, when MetLife continued to proffer damages evidence in\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\funallocated form, the district court ultimately refused to allow\n\nMetLife to reopen the damages issue.       As a result of the\n\ndistrict court's preclusion of damages evidence, none of the\n\ndamage claims as to any of the three sets of lawsuits were\n\nsubmitted to the jury.\n\n         In the end, because of the district court's rulings,\n\nthe jury was asked to determine only whether Liberty had a\n\nfuture duty to defend or indemnify a single Alabama lawsuit\n\n(Loudermilch) that had not yet been resolved and whether it had\n\na future duty to defend or indemnify the still pending class\n\naction lawsuits under the UEL policy (but not under the CGL\n\npolicy, since the court had already rejected coverage based on\n\nits reading of the unfair competition language).    None of the\n\nclaims based on the real estate cases were submitted to the jury\n\nbecause MetLife conceded that it had not made out its prima\n\nfacie case since its damages evidence had been excluded.\n\n         After deliberating for several days, the jury found\n\nthat Liberty did not have a duty to defend or indemnify MetLife\n\non any of the claims submitted to the jury regarding Loudermilch\n\nor the class action cases.   In doing so, the jury answered 133\n\nspecial questions that detailed its reasoning.   The jury found\n\ninter alia that the Loudermilch case was not covered by the CGL\n\npolicy's \"personal injury\" clause, that the class actions were\n\n\n                              -12-\n\fnot covered by the UEL policy's \"advertising injury\" clause, and\n\nthat numerous exclusions barred MetLife from recovering defense\n\nor settlement costs for both sets of lawsuits.\n\n              On April 12, 2000, the district court issued a judgment\n\nin favor of Liberty on all counts, including those that had not\n\nbeen submitted to the jury.              In an accompanying unreported\n\nopinion, the court explained why certain questions had not been\n\nsubmitted to the jury and why it had ruled against MetLife on\n\nthose issues.      In particular, the court further explicated its\n\nruling on the class action lawsuits' unfair competition claim,\n\nthe need to allocate damages, and the general scope of Liberty's\n\nduty to defend.\n\n                               II. DISCUSSION\n\n              MetLife now appeals and makes three claims of error:\n\nthat    the    district    court   incorrectly       placed     the   burden   of\n\nallocating defense and indemnity costs between covered and non-\n\ncovered matters on the insured, thus effectively preventing\n\nMetLife from presenting its damages evidence; that the district\n\ncourt erred by not permitting MetLife to seek coverage for the\n\nclass actions' unfair competition claims; and that the district\n\ncourt   erroneously       instructed    the   jury    as   to   how   it   should\n\ninterpret exclusionary clauses in the insurance policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f           We address MetLife's arguments in turn, applying de\n\nnovo review to questions of law.

The parties agree that this diversity action is governed\n\nby the substantive law of Massachusetts.\n\n           The Alabama Cases.         Two of MetLife's three claimed\n\nerrors are implicated in the Alabama cases:             the exclusion of\n\ndamages evidence because of the district court's ruling on\n\nallocation     and   the   district   court's    jury     instruction   on\n\ninterpreting    exclusionary    clauses.      Yet   the   jury's   special\n\nverdict specifically rejected coverage for the single Alabama\n\nlawsuit that it did consider (Loudermilch).          There is no reason\n\nto think that the result would have been any different if claims\n\nbased on the other fifteen Alabama lawsuits had been submitted\n\nto the jury.\n\n           The Loudermilch case was decided by the jury because,\n\nunlike the other fifteen Alabama lawsuits, the exclusion of\n\nMetLife's damages evidence did not undermine MetLife's claim\n\nthat Liberty had a continuing duty to defend and indemnify.\n\nThus, the jury was asked:\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f                 With respect to the duty to defend, was any\n          of the claims that a policyholder made against\n          MetLife in any of the lawsuits that various\n          policyholders brought against MetLife a claim\n          within the scope of a liability insurance\n          coverage as defined in the coverage provisions of\n          any of the various policies in evidence that\n          Liberty Mutual issued to MetLife (or New\n          England)?\n\n\nTo this, the jury answered \"no,\" thus rejecting any coverage for\n\nthe Loudermilch lawsuit independent of the exclusionary clauses.\n\nBecause   the   duty     to     defend   is    broader   than     the    duty   to\n\nindemnify, Ruggerio Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.

In the case of the class action\n\nlawsuits, two of MetLife's three claims of error are relevant:\n\nthe district court's decision not to allow MetLife to invoke\n\nunfair competition and the jury instruction on interpreting\n\nexclusionary clauses.      However, as with the Alabama lawsuits,\n\nthe   jury    verdict   saves   us    from   juxtaposing   state   unfair\n\ncompetition law with policy coverage because any supposed error\n\nmade by the district court was (once again) harmless.\n\n             Although the district court prohibited MetLife from\n\narguing that the class action lawsuits were covered by the CGL\n\npolicy's advertising injury clause, it permitted MetLife to\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fclaim coverage under the same clause in the UEL policy because,\n\nas already noted (see note 2, above), the two policies included\n\ndifferent     definitions          of   advertising      injury.       One       of   the\n\nquestions the jury was asked was whether:\n\n             the use of [MetLife] illustrations by sales\n             agents of [MetLife], as alleged in the underlying\n             class     action    complaints,     constitute[d]\n             advertising as used in the 1986-1989 [UEL]\n             policies.\n\nTo this, the jury answered \"no.\"\n\n             Where    there        is   no   advertising       there       can   be   no\n\nadvertising injury.          The policy language expressly requires that\n\nan injury arise from the \"insured's advertising activities.\"\n\nMetLife conceded as much when it said in its proposed jury\n\ninstructions that the first element of advertising injury under\n\nboth   the    CGL    and     UEL    policies       was   the    existence        of   \"an\n\nadvertising activity\" \"committed by\" MetLife.

Cal. 1994).\n\n             The problem for MetLife is that the jury's conclusion--\n\nthat   the    illustrations         used     by    MetLife's     agents      were     not\n\n\"advertising\" under the UEL policies--applies with equal force\n\nto   MetLife's       claim    for       coverage    under      the   CGL    policies.\n\nAlthough the CGL claim did not go to the jury, the illustrations\n\nin question are the same as those in the UEL claim.                          The only\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fdifference between the two claims was the type of wrong alleged\n\nto have been caused by the illustrations; under the CGL the\n\nwrong was unfair competition, whereas under the UEL it was a\n\n\"negligent             act,        error           or      omission.\"\n\n              Thus, even if we assume that the district court misread\n\nMassachusetts unfair competition law and mistakenly precluded\n\nMetLife's claim for coverage under the CGL policy, that error\n\nwas harmless because there is no practical likelihood that the\n\nCGL   claim    could   have    succeeded    when    the   UEL   claim   failed.\n\nBrandt, 242 F.3d at 16-17.             The jury's verdict shows that\n\nMetLife's CGL claim would not have satisfied the first element\n\nof advertising coverage, and this failure would have doomed\n\nMetLife's claim without regard to exclusions.\n\n              The Washington and Ohio Lawsuits.           As to the insurance\n\nclaims based on the Washington and Ohio lawsuits, the district\n\ncourt directed a verdict for Liberty after concluding that the\n\ndamages evidence offered by MetLife failed to allocate amounts\n\nbetween   covered      and    non-covered    claims.       MetLife   says   the\n\ndistrict court got the rules on allocation exactly backward and\n\nthat its evidence on damages should have been admitted and the\n\nclaims submitted to the jury.               Liberty defends the district\n\ncourt's allocation ruling and says that, in any case, none of\n\nthe claims are covered under the policy.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f            It is not uncommon for a lawsuit against an insured to\n\nassert some claims that are covered by the insurance policy and\n\nothers that are not.

Here, for\n\nexample, the district court thought some of the claimed expenses\n\nrelating    to   the     vanishing    premium   suits      were     to     defend\n\nindependent agents who were not insured and others were for\n\nsales outside the period covered by Liberty's policy.                    Possibly\n\nan insured who needlessly conflates expenses not covered by the\n\npolicy with expenses that arguably are covered would forfeit any\n\nclaim that the insurer should bear the burden of disaggregating\n\nthe asserted damage figures.\n\n           However, so far as we can tell, the gravamen of the\n\ndistrict court's misallocation objection in the real estate\n\nsuits was that some of the expenses incurred in defending claims\n\nby Washington were going to benefit MetLife's future defense of\n\nthe Ohio suit.      It is hard to view such a collateral benefit as\n\na misallocation:         so long as those costs were necessary for\n\ncovered    claims   in    the   Washington   suit,   the    fact     that     the\n\nresearch and discovery might be useful in some later case would\n\nhardly defeat full recovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f          The district court was apparently also concerned that\n\nmany of the complaint's theories of recovery in the Washington\n\nsuit could not conceivably come within the advertising coverage\n\nof the UEL policy.     However, where the theories relate to a\n\ncommon core of facts, defense costs are often hard to separate\n\nbetween theories--the witnesses and documents are often the\n\nsame--and this is ordinarily the classic case for imposing the\n\nallocation burden on the insurer who refused to defend a covered\n\ntheory.

The\n\nCGL and UEL definitions of advertising injury contain slightly\n\ndifferent language; but in both cases, Liberty says that the\n\npromotional materials given to the Washington and Ohio boards,\n\nessentially    prospectuses     describing    the    multi-million-dollar\n\nreal estate packages, are not \"advertising\" in any common sense\n\nof the term.\n\n             There is a basic split in authority on this issue.\n\nSome courts have taken the term \"advertising\" in its ordinary\n\nusage   to   suggest   public    dissemination,      usually      to   a   wide\n\naudience; on this view, a prospectus tailored to one customer\n\nand one transaction, setting forth the terms of the proposed\n\ndeal and its supposed advantages, is not advertising but part of\n\nthe negotiation.       Other courts have said that advertising can\n\noccur in individual transactions, at least where the customer\n\nbase is small or where this is the customary practice in the\n\nindustry.

The Appeals\n\nCourt said that \"advertising means a public announcement to\n\nproclaim the qualities of a product or point of view\" and that\n\nadvertising's        objective   is    the     \"[w]ide     dissemination\"         of\n\ninformation about a product.           Id. at 1368.       It deemed the letter\n\nso unrelated to \"advertising\" as to defeat even a duty to\n\ndefend.   Id. at 1369.\n\n          MetLife counters that this case is distinguishable on\n\nits facts, because in the present real estate cases there were\n\n\"brochures     and     a   marketing    program      directed        at    multiple\n\ninstitutional investors.\"         Yet aside from Smartfoods's broad\n\nlanguage, Smartfoods is fairly close on its facts:                        apparently\n\nthe producer sent similar letters to six other distributors.\n\nFurthermore,     MetLife      concedes        that   it    had   a        continuing\n\nrelationship with the two state boards, making a proposal for a\n\nparticular transaction even less like advertising and more like\n\ncontinuing business.\n\n          MetLife also asserts that its UEL policy is broader in\n\ndefining advertising injury that the CGL language used both in\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fthe Liberty policy and the Smartfoods case.                It is true that the\n\nlatter two do not extend protection to claims for \"any negligent\n\nact,     error     or   omission   in     the    use      of   advertising     or\n\nmerchandising ideas\"; but the UEL policy, like the CGL and\n\nSmartfoods policies, has a prior condition, namely, that the\n\nact, error or omission grow out of \"advertising activities.\"\n\nThe former is a pre-condition of any coverage under this part of\n\nthe policy and, if Smartfoods is followed, then this condition\n\nhas not been met.\n\n            Absent a decision by the state's highest court, we are\n\nfree   to   make    our   own   best   guess    as   to   Massachusetts      law,\n\nMichelin Tires (Canada) Ltd. v.

App. 4th at 1008-09; 2\n\nWindt, Insurance Claims & Disputes, § 11.29 at 339 n.404 (3d ed.\n\n1995).\n\n            Smartfoods was decided before the Washington and Ohio\n\ncases were tendered to Liberty.                 Nothing in the complaints\n\nidentified advertising at all; indeed, MetLife tendered the\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fcases only after it ascertained that the prospectuses would be\n\npart of the boards' evidence.              But by this time Smartfoods had\n\nmade       clear   that   under   Massachusetts    law,   such   a   tailored\n\ndocument setting out a proposal for an individual customer is\n\nnot \"advertising activity\" or even arguably so.            MetLife's claim\n\nfor coverage of the Washington and Ohio lawsuits thus fails\n\nbecause there was no \"advertising injury.\"\n\n              Even if there was advertising activity and injury, we\n\nthink that MetLife's claim would still fail because of the\n\nexclusions of the IROE.           The IROE was in all three of MetLife's\n\nUEL policies, which are the pertinent policies for the real\n\nestate cases.3        The critical language appears in subparagraphs\n\n(c)(1), (5), and (6) of the IROE, which exclude coverage for\n\nadvertising liability where such liability \"arise[s] out of the\n\nrendering or failure to render professional services in\" the\n\nfollowing activities:\n\n              (1) advising, inspecting, reporting or making\n              recommendations in the Insured's capacity as an\n              insurance company, consultant, broker, agent or\n              representative thereof, or\n                          . . .\n              (5) the conduct of an investment, loan or\n              operation, or\n\n       3\n     On the first day of trial, MetLife conceded that the CGL\npolicy's unfair competition provision applied only to the\nvanishing premium class actions and not to the real estate\ncases. Moreover, MetLife's briefs--both at trial and on appeal-\n-focus only on coverage under the UEL policy.\n\n                                    -25-\n\f            (6) any capacity as a fiduciary or trustee for\n            mutual funds, pension or welfare funds or other\n            similar activities. . . .4\n\n            The    Washington        and   Ohio   complaints       alleged     that\n\nMetLife, as the parties' investment adviser and manager, assumed\n\nfiduciary duties to the pension funds and that MetLife breached\n\nits fiduciary duties by misrepresenting and failing to disclose\n\naspects of the real estate transactions and by mismanaging the\n\nboard's investment portfolio.              It seems to us that on their\n\nface,    such     claims    fall     directly     within    the     language     of\n\n\"advising\"      and    \"conduct[ing]\"         investment    activities       under\n\nsubparagraphs (c)(1) and (5) and acting in \"any capacity\" as a\n\nfiduciary    for      pension   or    welfare     funds    under    subparagraph\n\n(c)(6).5\n\n            Neither of MetLife's two counter-arguments to this\n\ninitial conclusion is persuasive.              It first says that the common\n\ncondition    for      the   exclusion--that       liability        arise   out   of\n\n\n\n     4\n     Liberty also relies upon paragraph (a) of the IROE\nexcluding advertising liability that relates to an annuity; but\nwhile the principal transaction involved an annuity in certain\nrespects, the record does not adequately reveal just what role\nit played, and we do not rely upon paragraph (a).\n     5\n     In Massachusetts, the term \"arising out of\" has been\ninterpreted to require merely that a claim be connected to an\nexcluded event.

In other words, by using the term\n\n\"liability,\" MetLife says that Liberty made the entire exclusion\n\ninapplicable to defense costs.\n\n          The duty to defend, in both the CGL and UEL policies,\n\nis derivative; it requires that the claim of the plaintiff in\n\nthe underlying suit--whether valid or not--seek damages for some\n\ninjury that is arguably covered by the policy.

If such a suit seeks on its face to impose a\n\nliability excluded from coverage by the IROE, then the liability\n\nis   not   insured    against   and    there    is   not   even   an     arguable\n\nobligation to defend.
