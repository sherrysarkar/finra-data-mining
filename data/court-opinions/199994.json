Petitioner Lonnie Watkins\n\nappeals the district court's June 26, 2001 denial of his request\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus.    The district court had jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (1994 & Supp. II 1996).         On July 6,\n\n2001, Watkins filed a timely appeal and a motion for a certificate\n\nof appealability on the issues of (1) whether Watkins was denied\n\ndue process of law when the state trial court gave a supplemental\n\ncharge on felony murder, and (2) whether he was denied due process\n\nof law when the state trial court erroneously defined proof beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.     On July 12, 2001, the district court granted\nthe motion.   Our jurisdiction is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n1291 and 2253 (Supp. II 1996).     For the reasons stated below, we\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           The following facts, which are taken from the Supreme\nJudicial   Court   of   Massachusetts's    (the   \"SJC\")   decision     in\n\nCommonwealth v. Watkins, 683 N.E.2d 653 (Mass. 1997), are entitled\n\nto a presumption of correctness.       28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1) (1996);\nsee Sanna v. DiPaolo, 265 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001).       The facts are\nas follows:\n\n           On the evening of March 27, and into the early morning of\n\nMarch 28, 1993, Watkins attended a birthday party at a house in the\n\nDorchester section of Boston with several of his friends.             Also\n\nattending the party were the victims, Lloyd Industrious and Kevin\n\nChristopher, the latter of whom was wearing two large gold chains\n\naround his neck.   At some point during the evening, Watkins and at\n\n                                 -2-\n\fleast three of his friends, Mark Anderson, Marcus Edwards, and\n\nMichael Payne,1 decided to steal the chains from Christopher.          They\n\nlater agreed they would wait until the party was over before doing\nso.   One of the other guests at the party, Ana Bodden, testified at\n\nthe trial that about an hour before the end of the party, Watkins\n\nand two of his friends showed her the guns they were carrying.2\n            Shortly before 4 a.m., the party ended and the guests\n\nbegan to leave.    Bodden and six other party-goers got into a Ford\n\nTaurus, with Bodden in the passenger seat.          Bodden testified that\n\nright before the shooting, Edwards was standing on the sidewalk\n\ntalking to the driver of the Taurus, Charae Chretien.                 While\n\nEdwards was talking to Chretien, Bodden heard gunshots.                    She\n\ntestified that she saw Watkins, Payne, and Anderson shooting at\nChristopher and Industrious, who were on the ground.                 Bodden\n\nobserved someone shoot Industrious as he attempted to stand up; she\n\ntestified   that   she   thought   Payne   was   the   person   shooting    at\nIndustrious.    She identified Watkins and Anderson as the two who\n\nshot Christopher.    When the shooting stopped, the shooters turned\n\nand ran down the street past the Taurus.         Bodden testified that she\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Commonwealth also prosecuted Anderson, Edwards, and Payne\nfor both the robbery and murders of Christopher and Industrious.\nAnderson was tried as a juvenile. Edwards and Payne were convicted\non both counts, and their convictions were upheld by the SJC. See\nCommonwealth v. Payne, 690 N.E.2d 443 (Mass. 1998).\n      2\n      Bodden testified that Watkins showed her a gun that he\ncarried under his shirt. Watkins, 683 N.E.2d at 655. Ultimately,\nhowever, the jury acquitted Watkins of the charge of unlawful\npossession of a firearm. Id. at 654 n.1.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fsaw Anderson grab a chain from Christopher and saw Edwards take a\n\nchain from Industrious.\n\n            Adrian    Castillo,       another    passenger     in     the    Taurus,\ntestified at trial.      She testified that after the party, as she was\n\nsitting in    the     Taurus,   and    shortly    after     Edwards    spoke    with\n\nChretien, she heard gunshots.            When Castillo looked up, she saw\nPayne, Edwards, and another man whose back was toward her, shooting\n\nat Christopher.       She also saw a man over six feet tall standing\n\nalone near the sidewalk side of the automobile, and saw sparks from\n\nthat side of the automobile.          As reported to the police, Watkins is\n\nsix feet, five inches tall.\n\n            At trial, the prosecution played a tape recording of\n\nWatkins's statements to the police following his arrest.                    In these\ntapes,   Watkins     apparently    admitted      that   during      the     party   he\n\ndiscussed with his friends the possibility of robbing Christopher\n\nand Industrious.       However, he said that he later \"copped out\" of\nthe plan after one of his friends told him they would probably have\n\nto kill their victims in order to get the chain(s).                 Based on these\n\nstatements, Watkins argued at trial that even if a criminal joint\n\nventure existed between Watkins and his friends on the evening of\n\nthe incident, Watkins withdrew from the joint venture before any\n\ncrimes were committed, and therefore he should escape culpability\n\nfor   the   crimes.      The    prosecution      disputed    Watkins's       alleged\n\nwithdrawal.\n\n            On June 28, 1994, Watkins was convicted by a jury on two\n\nindictments charging armed robbery and two indictments charging\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fmurder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty\n\nand felony murder. The trial judge in the Superior Court sentenced\n\nWatkins to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment on the murder\nconvictions, and two terms of from fifteen to twenty years on the\n\narmed robbery conviction. Watkins was found not guilty of unlawful\n\npossession of a firearm. Watkins appealed these convictions to the\nSJC.    Ultimately, the SJC affirmed his convictions.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Watkins   argues   that     two   different    sets   of    jury\n\ninstructions violated his due process rights.             As will be shown\nbelow, these claims are without merit.\n\nA.   Supplemental Instructions on Joint Venture and Withdrawal\n\n            Watkins's first challenge is to the propriety of the\n\ntrial   judge's   jury   instructions    regarding   joint    venture    and\nwithdrawal.    Watkins argues that in responding to the jury's last\nquestion to the court, the judge failed to remind the jury of the\n\npossibility of withdrawal from a criminal joint venture, thus\ngiving the erroneous view that if Watkins was found guilty of\nrobbery, he should also necessarily be guilty of murder in the\nfirst degree. This, Watkins contends, effectively removed from the\n\njury both the issue of withdrawal and the issue of the degree of\n\nmurder in violation of his due process rights.\n\n            The jury's last question was:\n\n            Considering the joint venture clause and the\n            relationship of malice to murder, is it\n            contradictory to find someone guilty of armed\n            robbery, but not guilty of murder, if the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f           robbery results in the victim's death?        Why or\n           why not?\nUpon hearing this question, Watkins's trial counsel asked the judge\n\nto respond that such a finding was permissible, based on the\n\ndoctrine of withdrawal. Watkins's counsel argued that it would not\nbe contradictory to find a defendant guilty of armed robbery but\n\nnot guilty   of   murder   because    under    Massachusetts   law,   it   is\n\npossible for an individual to abandon a joint enterprise and avoid\n\nguilt for a crime committed subsequent to his abandonment.\n\n           The judge did not comply with Watkins's request.                In\n\nresponding to the question above, the trial judge pointed to an\n\nearlier   instruction,     which   correctly    stated   the   law.    That\ninstruction came from an undisclosed SJC opinion and reads:\n\n           [a] defendant who kills [his] victim in the\n           commission . . . of a robbery while the\n           defendant is armed with a gun is guilty of\n           [first degree] murder by application of the\n           felony/murder rule, and conscious disregard of\n           the risk to human life need not be further\n           shown.\n\nAfter reading this language, the trial judge noted:\n\n           If a defendant is engaged . . . at the time in\n           a joint criminal venture, . . . but is not\n           himself armed with a gun, he is still\n           responsible for the others engaged in that\n           armed robbery, provided that he himself has\n           actual knowledge and knows that the co-\n           venturer is armed with a gun and has the same\n           specific intent.\n\nIn conclusion, the trial judge made it a point to remind the jury\n\nto consider separately each indictment against Watkins.\n\n           Watkins argues that these instructions removed from the\n\njury both the question of withdrawal, upon which the jury had been\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fpreviously and correctly instructed, and the issue of the proper\n\ndegree of murder for which to convict him.    This, Watkins argues,\n\namounts to a directed verdict in violation of his due process\nrights, Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277 (1993), which in\n\nturn violates the mandate that all elements of a crime be proven\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.    See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364\n(1970).   While these arguments are novel, they are unsubstantiated\n\nby the record before us.\n\n           1.   Presence of a Federal Claim\n\n           Before we explore the merits of Watkins's claim, we must\nfirst address whether our jurisdiction is proper. The Commonwealth\n\nargues that the district court erroneously reviewed Watkins's\npetition on the issue of whether the trial court erred when it gave\nits supplemental instructions.     In particular, the Commonwealth\n\nargues that the state-law nature of jury instructions makes such\ndecisions unreviewable.    We review these claims de novo.   Phoenix\n\nv. Matesanz, 189 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n           Here, Watkins claims that his due process rights were\nviolated by the trial judge's supplemental instruction on joint\nventure, because it did not include a definition of withdrawal and\n\nbecause it instructed the jury to find him guilty of first degree\nmurder if it found him guilty of armed robbery.        While it is\naxiomatic that it is for state courts to say what state law is,\n\nGilday v. Callahan, 59 F.3d 257, 274 (1st Cir. 1995), it does not\n\nlogically follow, as the Commonwealth appears to suggest, that all\n\nclaims that touch upon state law are barred from federal habeas\n\n                                 -7-\n\freview.   As we understand it, the Commonwealth's argument on this\n\nscore appears to be geared more toward the merits of Watkins's\n\nclaims, and not so much the source of law that forms the basis for\nthose claims.\n\n           Although it is true that jury instructions are inherently\n\na   question   of   state   law,    that      does   not   mean     that   they   are\ncompletely unreviewable.      A perfect example is the case before us.\n\nIn one sense the Commonwealth sees no reason why we want for\n\njurisdiction on the \"moral certainty\" instruction, yet it argues\n\nthat we are without jurisdiction to hear the issue regarding the\n\nsupplemental instructions.          Here, Watkins correctly frames his\n\narguments regarding the supplemental instructions in terms of\n\nhaving the effect of removing from the jury consideration of both\nthe issue of withdrawal and the issue of the degree of the murder\n\ncommitted.     In doing so, Watkins calls into question whether this\n\ninstruction had the effect of removing an issue from the jury that\nneeded to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.               If this were true,\n\nthe requirement that all elements of a crime need to be proven\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt would be compromised in derogation of due\n\nprocess   rights    guaranteed     by   the     United     States    Constitution,\n\nWinship, 397 U.S. at 364.          Thus the trial judge, in essence, may\n\nhave directed a verdict when there were issues of fact to be\n\nresolved, in violation of the Court's decision in Sullivan.                       508\n\nU.S. at 277.\n\n           As noted above, the Commonwealth confuses the underlying\n\nstrength of Watkins's claim with the underlying foundation upon\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fwhich that claim is based.           It is this error that is the foundation\n\nupon which the Commonwealth's challenge to our jurisdiction rests.\n\nHowever, because Watkins's claim does not lie solely in state law,\nbut rather rests firmly within the ambit of the United States\n\nConstitution, we find no error in exercising jurisdiction over the\n\nmerits of Watkins's claim.\n\n              2.   Proper Standard of Review\n\n              We face one more hurdle, however, before we are able to\n\nreach the merits of Watkins's claim.               The parties dispute the\n\nproper standard of review. Watkins argues that the proper standard\nof review for his claim on this issue should be de novo because the\n\nSJC did not address the federal constitutional question, although\nWatkins raised it.        The Commonwealth, both in its brief and at oral\nargument, vigorously argue that the proper standard of review for\n\nthis       claim   is   the   more    stringent   standard     imposed    by     the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\").3                   In so\narguing, the Commonwealth appears to rely on the same arguments on\n\nwhich it       disputes    our   jurisdiction,    and   once   again     fails    to\nunderstand the difference between the merits of Watkins's claim and\nthe underlying basis for his claim.            In doing so, the Commonwealth\n\ncalls into question this court's decision in Fortini v. Murphy, 257\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      Under AEDPA, the federal courts must accept a state's legal\nruling unless it is \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)\n(Supp. II 1996).\n\n                                         -9-\n\fF.3d 39 (1st Cir. 2001), without providing any explanation as to\n\nwhy it should not apply.\n\n          As we held in Fortini:\n          AEDPA's strict standard of review only applies\n          to a \"claim that was adjudicated on the merits\n          in state court proceedings.\"      28 U.S.C. §\n          2254(d).   Here, the federal claim was never\n          addressed by the state courts.     All of the\n          cases that have touched on this problem (none\n          is directly in point) assume that the statute\n          applies only when the state court decided the\n          federal issue.     After all, AEDPA imposes a\n          requirement of deference to state court\n          decisions, but we can hardly defer to the\n          state court on an issue that the state court\n          did not address. Cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529\n          U.S. 362, 402-06 (2000).\n\n257 F.3d at 47 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).              The language\nof Fortini could not be more clear.          Properly understood, Fortini\n\ninstructs us that if state courts want us to defer to their\n\nrulings, they must, at a bare minimum, address the constitutional\nissue when properly raised.       That is, if they do not address the\n\nconstitutional   claim,    we   have   nothing     to    defer    to.    When\n\ndetermining the proper standard of review, we should avoid going\n\nagainst the    plain   language   of   the    AEDPA,    as   Fortini clearly\n\nrecognized. We now take this opportunity to reinforce what we said\n\nin Fortini. Accordingly, because the SJC did not discuss Watkins's\n\nfederal constitutional claim, although it was raised in that court,\n\nwe review Watkins's claim de novo.\n\n          3.   De Novo Analysis of Watkins's Claim\n\n          As we noted above, Watkins argues that the trial court's\n\nsupplementary instruction on joint venture gave the jury the\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\ferroneous view that if it found him guilty of armed robbery, it\n\nwould then be required to find him guilty of first degree murder,\n\nlest it be contradictory.       This, Watkins argues, amounts to a\ndirected verdict and therefore violates due process.             As Watkins\n\npoints out, it may very well be possible for someone to withdraw\n\nfrom a joint venture too late to avoid responsibility for his\ncoventurers' commission of an armed robbery, but in time to avoid\n\nresponsibility for their subsequent commission of murder.               While\n\nthis may be possible in the abstract, it cannot be so on the facts\n\nbefore us.\n\n          The facts of this case clearly show that both the murders\n\nand robbery were intertwined, with the robbery occurring either\n\nduring or directly after the murders.          Under Massachusetts law, an\nindividual may only escape liability for felony murder by virtue of\n\nwithdrawal if there was \"'at least an appreciable interval between\n\nthe alleged termination [of the joint venture] and the fatal\nshooting, a detachment from the enterprise before the shooting\n\n[became] so probable that it [could not] reasonably be stayed.'\"\n\nCommonwealth   v.   Fickett,   526    N.E.2d    1064,   1069   (Mass.   1988)\n\n(quoting Commonwealth v. Green, 20 N.E.2d 417, 422 (Mass. 1939)).\n\nBecause Watkins alleges his withdrawal occurred prior to the\n\nrobbery, not between the robbery and the murders (if any such time\n\nactually existed), if the jury actually believed that Watkins\n\n\"copped out,\" it would have had to acquit him of both the robbery\n\nand the murder.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f              Furthermore, the judge's response to the jury's question\n\nappropriately         reiterated      the     proper      legal     standard     under\n\nMassachusetts law.            The mere fact that the trial judge did not\nremind the jury of the possibility of withdrawal did not, in any\n\nway, interfere with the jury's determination of the facts.                            In\n\nfact, after instructing the jury, the trial judge made it perfectly\nclear that even if the jury was to find Watkins guilty of robbery,\n\nit    still   needed     to    consider      each   charge    in    the    indictment\n\nseparately.       Considering         that    the   trial    judge       had   properly\n\ninstructed the jury earlier not once, but twice, on the issue of\n\nwithdrawal, there is no reason to assume that the jury did not\n\nfollow these instructions.             Factually speaking, there is no way\n\nthat   the    trial    judge's     instructions        impermissibly       directed    a\nverdict of guilty on the murder charge or invaded the province of\n\nthe    jury's   duty    to     find   facts.        In   fact,     the   supplemental\n\ninstruction focused on a defendant \"engaged . . . at the time in a\n\njoint criminal venture\" (emphasis added) and so left open the\n\npossibility of the defendant having withdrawn from the joint\n\ncriminal venture before the murder.                      The instruction did not\n\nwithdraw the issue from the jury.\n\nB.    Reasonable Doubt Instruction\n\n              Watkins's next claim involves the propriety of the trial\njudge's instruction to the jury regarding the proper meaning of\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"           It is well established that in every\ncriminal trial, the state must prove every element of the offense\n\ncharged beyond a reasonable doubt.

Nebraska,    511    U.S.   1,    6     (1994).4\n\nAccordingly, Watkins argues, \"there has been no jury verdict within\n\nthe meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\"          Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 280.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n             In making our determination, we direct the parties to the\n\nwell-reasoned opinion of the district court that correctly held\n\nthat the jury instructions in question were constitutional.                 In\naddressing the merits of Watkins's claim, the district court\n\nreviewed in earnest the challenged instruction. Watkins v. Murphy,\n\nNo. 98-11114-NG, slip op. at 7-9 (D.Mass. June 26, 2001).               As the\ndistrict court correctly pointed out, while reference to the phrase\n\n\"moral   certainty\"    might    be    constitutional     error   in    certain\ncircumstances, the use of the phrase in the jury instruction before\n\nus, in the context of the instruction as a whole, appropriately\n\nconveyed the concepts of proof and reasonable doubt.

The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254 (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996). On July 6, 2001, Watkins filed a timely appeal and a motion for a certificate of appealability on the issues of (1) whether Watkins was denied due process of law when the state trial court gave a supplemental charge on felony murder, and (2) whether he was denied due process of law when the state trial court erroneously defined proof beyond a reasonable doubt. On July 12, 2001, the district court granted the motion. Our jurisdiction is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1291 and 2253 (Supp. II 1996). For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts, which are taken from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts's (the \"SJC\") decision in <i>Commonwealth v. Watkins,</i> 425 Mass. 830, 683 N.E.2d 653 (1997), are entitled to a presumption of correctness. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(e)(1) (1996); <i>see Sanna v. Dipaolo,</i> 265 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2001). The facts are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of March 27, and into the early morning of March 28, 1993, Watkins attended a birthday party at a house in the Dorchester section of Boston with several of his friends. Also attending the party were the victims, Lloyd Industrious and Kevin Christopher, the latter of whom was wearing two large gold chains around his neck. At some point during the evening, Watkins and at least three of his friends, Mark Anderson, Marcus Edwards, and Michael Payne,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> decided to steal the chains from Christopher. They later agreed they would wait until the party was over before doing so. One of the other guests at the party, Ana Bodden, testified at the trial that about an hour before the end of the party, Watkins and two of his friends showed her the guns they were carrying.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before 4 a.m., the party ended and the guests began to leave. Bodden and six other party-goers got into a Ford Taurus, with Bodden in the passenger seat. Bodden testified that right before the shooting, Edwards was standing on the sidewalk talking to the driver of the Taurus, Charae Chretien. While Edwards was talking to Chretien, Bodden heard gunshots. She testified that she saw Watkins, Payne, and Anderson shooting at Christopher and Industrious, who were on the ground. Bodden observed someone shoot Industrious as he attempted to stand up; she testified that she thought Payne was the person shooting at Industrious. She identified Watkins and Anderson as the two who shot Christopher. When the shooting stopped, the shooters turned and ran down the street past the Taurus. Bodden testified that she saw Anderson grab a chain from Christopher and saw Edwards take a chain from Industrious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adrian Castillo, another passenger in the Taurus, testified at trial. She testified that after the party, as she was sitting in the Taurus, and shortly after Edwards spoke with Chretien, she heard gunshots. When Castillo looked up, she saw Payne, Edwards, and another man whose back was toward her, shooting at Christopher. She also saw a man over six feet tall standing alone near the sidewalk side of the automobile, and saw sparks from that side of the automobile. As reported to the police, Watkins is six feet, five inches tall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the prosecution played a tape recording of Watkins's statements to the police following his arrest. In these tapes, Watkins apparently admitted that during the party he discussed with his friends the possibility of robbing Christopher and Industrious. However, he said that he later \"copped out\" of the plan after one of his friends told him they would probably have to kill their victims in order to get the chain(s). Based on these statements, Watkins argued at trial that even if a criminal joint venture existed between Watkins and his friends on the evening of the incident, Watkins withdrew from the joint venture before any crimes were committed, and therefore he should escape culpability for the crimes. The prosecution disputed Watkins's alleged withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1994, Watkins was convicted by a jury on two indictments charging armed robbery and two indictments charging murder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty and felony murder. The trial judge in the Superior Court sentenced Watkins to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment on the murder convictions, and two terms of from fifteen to twenty years on the armed robbery conviction. Watkins was found not guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm. Watkins appealed these convictions to the SJC. Ultimately, the SJC affirmed his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins argues that two different sets of jury instructions violated his due process rights. As will be shown below, these claims are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Supplemental Instructions on Joint Venture and Withdrawal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins's first challenge is to the propriety of the trial judge's jury instructions regarding joint venture and withdrawal. Watkins argues that in responding to the jury's last question to the court, the judge failed to remind the jury of the possibility of withdrawal from a criminal joint venture, thus giving the erroneous view that if Watkins was found guilty of robbery, he should also necessarily be guilty of murder in the first degree. This, Watkins contends, effectively removed from the jury both the issue of withdrawal and the issue of the degree of murder in violation of his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The jury's last question was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the joint venture clause and the relationship of malice to murder, is it contradictory to find someone guilty of armed robbery, but not guilty of murder, if the robbery results in the victim's death? Why or why not?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon hearing this question, Watkins's trial counsel asked the judge to respond that such a finding was permissible, based on the doctrine of withdrawal. Watkins's counsel argued that it would not be contradictory to find a defendant guilty of armed robbery but not guilty of murder because under Massachusetts law, it is possible for an individual to abandon a joint enterprise and avoid guilt for a crime committed subsequent to his abandonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge did not comply with Watkins's request. In responding to the question above, the trial judge pointed to an earlier instruction, which correctly stated the law. That instruction came from an undisclosed SJC opinion and reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a] defendant who kills [his] victim in the commission ... of a robbery while the defendant is armed with a gun is guilty of [first degree] murder by application of the felony/murder rule, and conscious disregard of the risk to human life need not be further shown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reading this language, the trial judge noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a defendant is engaged ... at the time in a joint criminal venture, ... but is not himself armed with a gun, he is still responsible for the others engaged in that armed robbery, provided that he himself has actual knowledge and knows that the co-venturer is armed with a gun and has the same specific intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the trial judge made it a point to remind the jury to consider separately each indictment against Watkins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins argues that these instructions removed from the jury both the question of withdrawal, upon which the jury had been previously and correctly instructed, and the issue of the proper degree of murder for which to convict him. This, Watkins argues, amounts to a directed verdict in violation of his due process rights, <i>Sullivan v. Louisiana,</i> 508 U.S. 275, 277, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993), which in turn violates the mandate that all elements of a crime be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). While these arguments are novel, they are unsubstantiated by the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Presence of a Federal Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we explore the merits of Watkins's claim, we must first address whether our jurisdiction is proper. The Commonwealth argues that the district court erroneously reviewed Watkins's petition on the issue of whether the trial court erred when it gave its supplemental instructions. In particular, the Commonwealth argues that the state-law nature of jury instructions makes such decisions unreviewable. We review these claims de novo. <i>Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> 189 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Watkins claims that his due process rights were violated by the trial judge's supplemental instruction on joint venture, because it did not include a definition of withdrawal and because it instructed the jury to find him guilty of first degree murder if it found him guilty of armed robbery. While it is axiomatic that it is for state courts to say what state law is, <i>Gilday v. Callahan,</i> 59 F.3d 257, 274 (1st Cir.1995), it does not logically follow, as the Commonwealth appears to suggest, that all claims that touch upon state law are barred from federal habeas review. As we understand it, the Commonwealth's argument on this score appears to be geared more toward the merits of Watkins's claims, and not so much the source of law that forms the basis for those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is true that jury instructions are inherently a question of state law, that does not mean that they are completely unreviewable. A perfect example is the case before us. In one sense the Commonwealth sees no reason why we want for jurisdiction on the \"moral certainty\" instruction, yet it argues that we are without jurisdiction to hear the issue regarding the supplemental instructions. Here, Watkins correctly frames his arguments regarding the supplemental instructions in terms of having the effect of removing from the jury consideration of both the issue of withdrawal and the issue of the degree of the murder committed. In doing so, Watkins calls into question whether this instruction had the effect of removing an issue from the jury that needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If this were true, the requirement that all elements of a crime need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt would be compromised in derogation of due process rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. <i>Winship,</i> 397 U.S. at 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068. Thus the trial judge, in essence, may have directed a verdict when there were issues of fact to be resolved, in violation of the Court's decision in <i>Sullivan.</i> 508 U.S. at 277, 113 S.Ct. 2078.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the Commonwealth confuses the underlying strength of Watkins's claim with the underlying foundation upon which that claim is based. It is this error that is the foundation upon which the Commonwealth's challenge to our jurisdiction rests. However, because Watkins's claim does not lie solely in state law, but rather rests firmly within the ambit of the United States Constitution, we find no error in exercising jurisdiction over the merits of Watkins's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Proper Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We face one more hurdle, however, before we are able to reach the merits of Watkins's claim. The parties dispute the proper standard of review. Watkins argues that the proper standard of review for his claim on this issue should be de novo because the SJC did not address the federal constitutional question, although Watkins raised it. The Commonwealth, both in its brief and at oral argument, vigorously argue that the proper standard of review for this claim is the more stringent standard imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In so arguing, the Commonwealth appears to rely on the same arguments on which it disputes our jurisdiction, and once again fails to understand the difference between the merits of Watkins's claim and the underlying basis for his claim. In doing so, the Commonwealth calls into question this court's decision in <i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39 (1st Cir.2001), without providing any explanation as to why it should not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As we held in <i>Fortini:</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AEDPA's strict standard of review <i>only applies</i> to a \"claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). Here, the federal claim was never addressed by the state courts. All of the cases that have touched on this problem (none is directly in point) assume <i>that the statute applies only when the state court decided the federal issue.</i> After all, AEDPA imposes a requirement of deference to state court decisions, but we can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address. <i>Cf. Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 402-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">257 F.3d at 47 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). The language of <i>Fortini</i> could not be more clear. Properly understood, <i>Fortini</i> instructs us that if state courts want us to defer to their rulings, they must, at a bare minimum, address the constitutional issue when properly raised. That is, if they do not address the constitutional claim, we have nothing to defer to. When determining the proper standard of review, we should avoid going against the plain language of the AEDPA, as <i>Fortini</i> clearly recognized. We now take this opportunity to reinforce what we said in <i>Fortini.</i> Accordingly, because the SJC did not discuss Watkins's federal constitutional claim, although it was raised in that court, we review Watkins's claim de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. De Novo Analysis of Watkins's Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted above, Watkins argues that the trial court's supplementary instruction on joint venture gave the jury the erroneous view that if it found him guilty of armed robbery, it would then be required to find him guilty of first degree murder, lest it be contradictory. This, Watkins argues, amounts to a directed verdict and therefore violates due process. As Watkins points out, it may very well be possible for someone to withdraw from a joint venture too late to avoid responsibility for his coventurers' commission of an armed robbery, but in time to avoid responsibility for their subsequent commission of murder. While this may be possible in the abstract, it cannot be so on the facts before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case clearly show that both the murders and robbery were intertwined, with the robbery occurring either during or directly after the murders. Under Massachusetts law, an individual may only escape liability for felony murder by virtue of withdrawal if there was \"`at least an appreciable interval between the alleged termination [of the joint venture] and the fatal shooting, a detachment from the enterprise before the shooting [became] so probable that it [could not] reasonably be stayed.'\" <i>Commonwealth v. Fickett,</i> 403 Mass. 194, 526 N.E.2d 1064, 1069 (1988) (quoting <i>Commonwealth v. Green,</i> 302 Mass. 547, 20 N.E.2d 417, 422 (1939)). Because Watkins alleges his withdrawal occurred prior to the robbery, not between the robbery and the murders (if any such time actually existed), if the jury actually believed that Watkins \"copped out,\" it would have had to acquit him of both the robbery and the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the judge's response to the jury's question appropriately reiterated the proper legal standard under Massachusetts law. The mere fact that the trial judge did not remind the jury of the possibility of withdrawal did not, in any way, interfere with the jury's determination of the facts. In fact, after instructing the jury, the trial judge made it perfectly clear that even if the jury was to find Watkins guilty of robbery, it still needed to consider each charge in the indictment separately. Considering that the trial judge had properly instructed the jury earlier not once, but twice, on the issue of withdrawal, there is no reason to assume that the jury did not follow these instructions. Factually speaking, there is no way that the trial judge's instructions impermissibly directed a verdict of guilty on the murder charge or invaded the province of the jury's duty to find facts. In fact, the supplemental instruction focused on a defendant \"engaged ... <i>at the time in a joint criminal venture</i>\" (emphasis added) and so left open the possibility of the defendant having withdrawn from the joint criminal venture before the murder. The instruction did not withdraw the issue from the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins's next claim involves the propriety of the trial judge's instruction to the jury regarding the proper meaning of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" It is well established that in every criminal trial, the state must prove every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Winship,</i> 397 U.S. at 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068. Watkins contends that in his trial, the trial judge's instruction on the meaning of the words \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" was severed from any language stressing the high degree of certainty required to convict a defendant, and therefore \"there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction[] to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the <i>Winship</i> standard.\" <i>Victor v. Nebraska,</i> 511 U.S. 1, 6, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Accordingly, Watkins argues, \"there has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>Sullivan,</i> 508 U.S. at 280, 113 S.Ct. 2078. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In making our determination, we direct the parties to the well-reasoned opinion of the district court that correctly held that the jury instructions in question were constitutional. In addressing the merits of Watkins's claim, the district court reviewed in earnest the challenged instruction. <i>Watkins v. Murphy,</i> No. 98-11114-NG, slip op. at 7-9 (D.Mass. June 26, 2001). As the district court correctly pointed out, while reference to the phrase \"moral certainty\" might be constitutional error in certain circumstances, the use of the phrase in the jury instruction before us, in the context of the instruction as a whole, appropriately conveyed the concepts of proof and reasonable doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 13-15. For the reasons contained within the opinion of the court below, we affirm that court's decision to deny the writ on the basis that the jury instruction in question did not violate Watkins's due process rights because it adequately conveyed the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Watkins's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Commonwealth also prosecuted Anderson, Edwards, and Payne for both the robbery and murders of Christopher and Industrious.

The facts are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of March 27, and into the early morning of March 28, 1993, Watkins attended a birthday party at a house in the Dorchester section of Boston with several of his friends. Also attending the party were the victims, Lloyd Industrious and Kevin Christopher, the latter of whom was wearing two large gold chains around his neck. At some point during the evening, Watkins and at least three of his friends, Mark Anderson, Marcus Edwards, and Michael Payne,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> decided to steal the chains from Christopher. They later agreed they would wait until the party was over before doing so. One of the other guests at the party, Ana Bodden, testified at the trial that about an hour before the end of the party, Watkins and two of his friends showed her the guns they were carrying.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before 4 a.m., the party ended and the guests began to leave. Bodden and six other party-goers got into a Ford Taurus, with Bodden in the passenger seat. Bodden testified that right before the shooting, Edwards was standing on the sidewalk talking to the driver of the Taurus, Charae Chretien. While Edwards was talking to Chretien, Bodden heard gunshots. She testified that she saw Watkins, Payne, and Anderson shooting at Christopher and Industrious, who were on the ground. Bodden observed someone shoot Industrious as he attempted to stand up; she testified that she thought Payne was the person shooting at Industrious. She identified Watkins and Anderson as the two who shot Christopher. When the shooting stopped, the shooters turned and ran down the street past the Taurus. Bodden testified that she saw Anderson grab a chain from Christopher and saw Edwards take a chain from Industrious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adrian Castillo, another passenger in the Taurus, testified at trial. She testified that after the party, as she was sitting in the Taurus, and shortly after Edwards spoke with Chretien, she heard gunshots. When Castillo looked up, she saw Payne, Edwards, and another man whose back was toward her, shooting at Christopher. She also saw a man over six feet tall standing alone near the sidewalk side of the automobile, and saw sparks from that side of the automobile. As reported to the police, Watkins is six feet, five inches tall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the prosecution played a tape recording of Watkins's statements to the police following his arrest. In these tapes, Watkins apparently admitted that during the party he discussed with his friends the possibility of robbing Christopher and Industrious. However, he said that he later \"copped out\" of the plan after one of his friends told him they would probably have to kill their victims in order to get the chain(s). Based on these statements, Watkins argued at trial that even if a criminal joint venture existed between Watkins and his friends on the evening of the incident, Watkins withdrew from the joint venture before any crimes were committed, and therefore he should escape culpability for the crimes. The prosecution disputed Watkins's alleged withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1994, Watkins was convicted by a jury on two indictments charging armed robbery and two indictments charging murder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty and felony murder. The trial judge in the Superior Court sentenced Watkins to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment on the murder convictions, and two terms of from fifteen to twenty years on the armed robbery conviction. Watkins was found not guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm. Watkins appealed these convictions to the SJC. Ultimately, the SJC affirmed his convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins argues that two different sets of jury instructions violated his due process rights. As will be shown below, these claims are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Supplemental Instructions on Joint Venture and Withdrawal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins's first challenge is to the propriety of the trial judge's jury instructions regarding joint venture and withdrawal. Watkins argues that in responding to the jury's last question to the court, the judge failed to remind the jury of the possibility of withdrawal from a criminal joint venture, thus giving the erroneous view that if Watkins was found guilty of robbery, he should also necessarily be guilty of murder in the first degree. This, Watkins contends, effectively removed from the jury both the issue of withdrawal and the issue of the degree of murder in violation of his due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The jury's last question was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the joint venture clause and the relationship of malice to murder, is it contradictory to find someone guilty of armed robbery, but not guilty of murder, if the robbery results in the victim's death? Why or why not?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon hearing this question, Watkins's trial counsel asked the judge to respond that such a finding was permissible, based on the doctrine of withdrawal. Watkins's counsel argued that it would not be contradictory to find a defendant guilty of armed robbery but not guilty of murder because under Massachusetts law, it is possible for an individual to abandon a joint enterprise and avoid guilt for a crime committed subsequent to his abandonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge did not comply with Watkins's request. In responding to the question above, the trial judge pointed to an earlier instruction, which correctly stated the law. That instruction came from an undisclosed SJC opinion and reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a] defendant who kills [his] victim in the commission ... of a robbery while the defendant is armed with a gun is guilty of [first degree] murder by application of the felony/murder rule, and conscious disregard of the risk to human life need not be further shown.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reading this language, the trial judge noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a defendant is engaged ... at the time in a joint criminal venture, ... but is not himself armed with a gun, he is still responsible for the others engaged in that armed robbery, provided that he himself has actual knowledge and knows that the co-venturer is armed with a gun and has the same specific intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, the trial judge made it a point to remind the jury to consider separately each indictment against Watkins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins argues that these instructions removed from the jury both the question of withdrawal, upon which the jury had been previously and correctly instructed, and the issue of the proper degree of murder for which to convict him. This, Watkins argues, amounts to a directed verdict in violation of his due process rights, <i>Sullivan v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 277, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span> (1970). While these arguments are novel, they are unsubstantiated by the record before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Presence of a Federal Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we explore the merits of Watkins's claim, we must first address whether our jurisdiction is proper. The Commonwealth argues that the district court erroneously reviewed Watkins's petition on the issue of whether the trial court erred when it gave its supplemental instructions. In particular, the Commonwealth argues that the state-law nature of jury instructions makes such decisions unreviewable. We review these claims de novo. <i>Phoenix v. Matesanz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198596\"><a href=\"/opinion/198596/phoenix-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Watkins claims that his due process rights were violated by the trial judge's supplemental instruction on joint venture, because it did not include a definition of withdrawal and because it instructed the jury to find him guilty of first degree murder if it found him guilty of armed robbery. While it is axiomatic that it is for state courts to say what state law is, <i>Gilday v. Callahan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196171\"><a href=\"/opinion/196171/gilday-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 274 (1st Cir.1995), it does not logically follow, as the Commonwealth appears to suggest, that all claims that touch upon state law are barred from federal habeas review. As we understand it, the Commonwealth's argument on this score appears to be geared more toward the merits of Watkins's claims, and not so much the source of law that forms the basis for those claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it is true that jury instructions are inherently a question of state law, that does not mean that they are completely unreviewable. A perfect example is the case before us. In one sense the Commonwealth sees no reason why we want for jurisdiction on the \"moral certainty\" instruction, yet it argues that we are without jurisdiction to hear the issue regarding the supplemental instructions. Here, Watkins correctly frames his arguments regarding the supplemental instructions in terms of having the effect of removing from the jury consideration of both the issue of withdrawal and the issue of the degree of the murder committed. In doing so, Watkins calls into question whether this instruction had the effect of removing an issue from the jury that needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If this were true, the requirement that all elements of a crime need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt would be compromised in derogation of due process rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. <i>Winship,</i> 397 U.S. at 364, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>. Thus the trial judge, in essence, may have directed a verdict when there were issues of fact to be resolved, in violation of the Court's decision in <i>Sullivan.</i> 508 U.S. at 277, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the Commonwealth confuses the underlying strength of Watkins's claim with the underlying foundation upon which that claim is based. It is this error that is the foundation upon which the Commonwealth's challenge to our jurisdiction rests. However, because Watkins's claim does not lie solely in state law, but rather rests firmly within the ambit of the United States Constitution, we find no error in exercising jurisdiction over the merits of Watkins's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Proper Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We face one more hurdle, however, before we are able to reach the merits of Watkins's claim. The parties dispute the proper standard of review. Watkins argues that the proper standard of review for his claim on this issue should be de novo because the SJC did not address the federal constitutional question, although Watkins raised it. The Commonwealth, both in its brief and at oral argument, vigorously argue that the proper standard of review for this claim is the more stringent standard imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In so arguing, the Commonwealth appears to rely on the same arguments on which it disputes our jurisdiction, and once again fails to understand the difference between the merits of Watkins's claim and the underlying basis for his claim. In doing so, the Commonwealth calls into question this court's decision in <i>Fortini v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199512\"><a href=\"/opinion/199512/fortini-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001), without providing any explanation as to why it should not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As we held in <i>Fortini:</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AEDPA's strict standard of review <i>only applies</i> to a \"claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d). Here, the federal claim was never addressed by the state courts. All of the cases that have touched on this problem (none is directly in point) assume <i>that the statute applies only when the state court decided the federal issue.</i> After all, AEDPA imposes a requirement of deference to state court decisions, but we can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address. <i>Cf. Williams v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 402-06, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The language of <i>Fortini</i> could not be more clear. Properly understood, <i>Fortini</i> instructs us that if state courts want us to defer to their rulings, they must, at a bare minimum, address the constitutional issue when properly raised. That is, if they do not address the constitutional claim, we have nothing to defer to. When determining the proper standard of review, we should avoid going against the plain language of the AEDPA, as <i>Fortini</i> clearly recognized. We now take this opportunity to reinforce what we said in <i>Fortini.</i> Accordingly, because the SJC did not discuss Watkins's federal constitutional claim, although it was raised in that court, we review Watkins's claim de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. De Novo Analysis of Watkins's Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted above, Watkins argues that the trial court's supplementary instruction on joint venture gave the jury the erroneous view that if it found him guilty of armed robbery, it would then be required to find him guilty of first degree murder, lest it be contradictory. This, Watkins argues, amounts to a directed verdict and therefore violates due process. As Watkins points out, it may very well be possible for someone to withdraw from a joint venture too late to avoid responsibility for his coventurers' commission of an armed robbery, but in time to avoid responsibility for their subsequent commission of murder. While this may be possible in the abstract, it cannot be so on the facts before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case clearly show that both the murders and robbery were intertwined, with the robbery occurring either during or directly after the murders. Under Massachusetts law, an individual may only escape liability for felony murder by virtue of withdrawal if there was \"`at least an appreciable interval between the alleged termination [of the joint venture] and the fatal shooting, a detachment from the enterprise before the shooting [became] so probable that it [could not] reasonably be stayed.'\" <i>Commonwealth v. Fickett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2026493\"><a href=\"/opinion/2026493/commonwealth-v-fickett/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2026493\"><a href=\"/opinion/2026493/commonwealth-v-fickett/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span>, 1069 (1988) (quoting <i>Commonwealth v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span>, 422 (1939)). Because Watkins alleges his withdrawal occurred prior to the robbery, not between the robbery and the murders (if any such time actually existed), if the jury actually believed that Watkins \"copped out,\" it would have had to acquit him of both the robbery and the murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the judge's response to the jury's question appropriately reiterated the proper legal standard under Massachusetts law. The mere fact that the trial judge did not remind the jury of the possibility of withdrawal did not, in any way, interfere with the jury's determination of the facts. In fact, after instructing the jury, the trial judge made it perfectly clear that even if the jury was to find Watkins guilty of robbery, it still needed to consider each charge in the indictment separately. Considering that the trial judge had properly instructed the jury earlier not once, but twice, on the issue of withdrawal, there is no reason to assume that the jury did not follow these instructions. Factually speaking, there is no way that the trial judge's instructions impermissibly directed a verdict of guilty on the murder charge or invaded the province of the jury's duty to find facts. In fact, the supplemental instruction focused on a defendant \"engaged ... <i>at the time in a joint criminal venture</i>\" (emphasis added) and so left open the possibility of the defendant having withdrawn from the joint criminal venture before the murder. The instruction did not withdraw the issue from the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watkins's next claim involves the propriety of the trial judge's instruction to the jury regarding the proper meaning of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" It is well established that in every criminal trial, the state must prove every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Winship,</i> 397 U.S. at 364, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>. Watkins contends that in his trial, the trial judge's instruction on the meaning of the words \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" was severed from any language stressing the high degree of certainty required to convict a defendant, and therefore \"there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction[] to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the <i>Winship</i> standard.\" <i>Victor v.

As the district court correctly pointed out, while reference to the phrase \"moral certainty\" might be constitutional error in certain circumstances, the use of the phrase in the jury instruction before us, in the context of the instruction as a whole, appropriately conveyed the concepts of proof and reasonable doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 13-15.
