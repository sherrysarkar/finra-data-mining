In  his  appeal  from his  sentence,\r                                 \r\n\nappellant contends  that the  court committed plain  error in\r\n\nimposing a  $15,000 fine.   There  was no  plain error.   The\r\n\npresentence  investigation report, while it did not recommend\r\n\na fine because  of defendant's presumed inability  to pay it,\r\n\nalso  indicated that  defendant had  assets of  approximately\r\n\n$21,500 and, in addition,  any moneys that he may  receive if\r\n\nhis  ex-wife's bankruptcy case  were resolved.   We have held\r\n\nthat, under the relevant  Guidelines, \"a fine is the  rule   \r\n\nand it is the defendant's burden to demonstrate that his case\r\n\nis an exception.\"  United States v.

The\r                                          \r\n\namount  the court  imposed was  the minimum  fine within  the\r\n\napplicable guideline range.  In the present circumstances, we\r\n\ncannot  say  the  district   court's  imposition  of  a  fine\r\n\nconstituted plain  error,  as we  would need  to conclude  in\r\n\norder  to  overturn   the  district  court's   action,  given\r\n\nappellant's failure to object.
