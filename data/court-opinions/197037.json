After  careful review  of the  briefs and\r                            \r\n\nrecord,   we  conclude  that   the  district  court  properly\r\n\ndismissed appellant's   2255  petition for the reasons stated\r\n\nin the order dated July 25, 1995, as amended March  29, 1996.\r\n\nWe add only these comments.\r\n\n     1.   Appellant's complaint regarding  the lack of stated\r\n\nreasons  for the 20-year sentence  was not properly raised in\r\n\nhis    2255 petition, as it was  not raised on direct appeal.\r\n\nSee  Knight v. United States,  37 F.3d 769,  772-73 (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1994). \r\n\n     2.   Appellant's complaints regarding the proceedings on\r\n\nremand from  the direct appeal  also did not  present grounds\r\n\nfor   2255 relief.  The proceedings on remand were limited by\r\n\nthe  scope  of  the  direct appeal,  and  appellant  was  not\r\n\nentitled to raise new  objections at that stage.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Appellant's complaint\r\n\nabout the delay on remand is also without merit.  See Fed. R.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCrim. P. 35(a)(1) (current version).\r\n\n     3.   We   do  not   address  the   argument  raised   in\r\n\nappellant's  reply brief  that the  district court  on remand\r\n\nfailed to  advise him of  his right  to appeal under  Fed. R.\r\n\nCrim. P. 32(c)(5).  That argument was neither presented below\r\n\nnor raised here in a timely fashion.  See, e.g., Sandstrom v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nChemlawn Corp., 904  F.2d 83, 86  (1st Cir. 1990)  (arguments\r                          \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nnot made  to the district  court or in the  opening brief are\r\n\nwaived). \r\n\n     Affirmed.
