In 1952, Congress enacted the\n\nMcCarran Amendment, 43 U.S.C. § 666, a law that waived the\n\nsovereign immunity of the United States in suits for the general\n\nadjudication or administration of water rights.                This appeal\n\nturns on the scope of that waiver.\n\n             The underlying litigation flows from Puerto Rico's\n\nefforts to impose restrictions on the extraction of water from\n\na river known as the Rio Blanco.          The Commonwealth asserts that\n\nthe    McCarran     Amendment   divests    the   United   States   of    its\n\nsovereign immunity in respect to the compelled participation of\n\nthe United States Navy in administrative proceedings concerning\n\nthat subject, commenced pursuant to Puerto Rico's Law of Waters,\n\n12    P.R.   Laws   Ann.   §§   1501-3015.       Disagreeing    with    this\n\nassertion, the Navy asked the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico for surcease.            The district court\n\nstayed the administrative proceedings pending final resolution\n\nof the suit.        In due course, the court found the McCarran\n\nAmendment inapplicable and         granted the Navy sanctuary.           See\n\nUnited States v. Puerto Rico, 144 F. Supp. 2d 46, 53 (D.P.R.\n\n2001).\n\n             Although our reasoning differs significantly from the\n\ndistrict court's, we too hold that the McCarran Amendment does\n\nnot waive the sovereign immunity of the United States with\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\frespect to the administrative proceedings here at issue.                   The\n\nMcCarran Amendment speaks of \"suits,\" and the local proceedings,\n\ninstituted   by   the   Commonwealth's     Department     of    Natural    and\n\nEnvironmental Resources (DNER) under the Law of Waters, cannot\n\nbe so characterized.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n          Insofar       as     pertinent       here,    the     facts      are\n\nuncontroversial.        During    World    War    II,    the    Navy    began\n\nconstruction of the United States Naval Station at Roosevelt\n\nRoads (NSRR).     To ensure an adequate fresh-water supply, the\n\nNavy obtained a permit (the 1942 permit) from the Puerto Rico\n\nPublic Service Commission to withdraw up to ten cubic feet per\n\nsecond   from   the   Rio    Blanco.     The    Navy   then    proceeded    to\n\nconstruct a primary water intake in the tailrace of a privately-\n\nowned hydroelectric power plant and an emergency intake just\n\nupstream of the plant.         Shortly thereafter, a federal agency\n\nacquired title to the hydroelectric plant and conveyed it to the\n\nPuerto Rico Water Resources Authority (PRWRA).           In consideration\n\nof the conveyance, the PRWRA issued a permit (the 1944 permit)\n\ngranting the federal government the right \"to continue the use,\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\foperation, and maintenance\" of the water supply system free of\n\ncharge for as long as the NSRR remained operational.1\n\n           Puerto Rico enacted the Law of Waters in 1976.                        The\n\nstatute   directs     the    Secretary    of    the    DNER   to   formulate      an\n\nintegrated plan for conservation, development, and use of the\n\nCommonwealth's water resources, 12 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1505(a), set\n\nwater consumption priorities, id. § 1505(e), and establish and\n\nadminister    a   system      that     allocates      water   based      on   those\n\npriorities,    id.    §     1505(j).      The    statute      contemplates       the\n\nissuance of permits for the drilling of water wells and the\n\ngranting of franchises for the utilization of surface waters.\n\nId. § 1509.\n\n           The statutory regime further provides that when a body\n\nof water lacks sufficient volume to meet the demands that are\n\nmade upon it, the Secretary may institute a process to allocate\n\nthe available water among competing claimants.                 Id. § 1515.       The\n\nstatute grants affected parties the right to a hearing before\n\nthe   Secretary   —   a     hearing    that     incorporates       the   right    to\n\ncounsel, the right to present evidence, and similar procedural\n\nprotections.      Id. § 1519.          Although the statute terms such\n\n\n\n      1\n     The parties hotly debate whether the 1944 permit granted a\nright to withdraw water or merely an easement-like right to\nmaintain the water supply system. We have no occasion to reach\nthis issue.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fhearings \"quasi-judicial,\" no court officer is involved; the\n\ndetails      of    the     process     are       spelled      out     in   the       DNER's\n\nregulations, and the Secretary's decision is final unless an\n\naggrieved party seeks review within thirty days in a court of\n\nfirst instance.           Id. § 1520.\n\n             In 1986, the DNER, acting under the Law of Waters,\n\nadmonished the Navy that it needed to update its franchise for\n\ndiverting water from the Rio Blanco.                         Thinking this a mere\n\nformality,        the    Navy   submitted        a    renewal   application.            The\n\nSecretary never acted upon the application, claiming that it was\n\nincomplete.\n\n             The matter remained on the back burner until July 7,\n\n1999, when the DNER served the Navy with a \"cease-and-show-\n\ncause\" order.           This order rested on the premise that the Navy\n\nwas    withdrawing        water    from    the       Rio   Blanco     without    a    valid\n\nfranchise (and thereby transgressing the Law of Waters).                              After\n\nsome    intermittent        contacts,      marked          chiefly    by   bureaucratic\n\nwrangling, the Secretary issued a second order, dated October\n\n29, 1999, directing the Navy to (1) initiate a franchise request\n\nfor    the   primary      and     emergency      water      intake     locations,       (2)\n\ninstall metering devices to measure water extraction from both\n\nintakes,     (3)        reimburse    the     Commonwealth            for   prior      water\n\nconsumption, and (4) pay provisional user fees until its water\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\frights claims were administratively determined.             This order\n\ninformed the Navy, in no uncertain terms, that it was obliged to\n\nparticipate in franchise application proceedings, and that the\n\nDNER might ultimately grant or deny a franchise, taking into\n\naccount \"the needs of the entire community of the area.\"\n\n          Dismayed by the DNER's dismissive attitude toward its\n\nrights under the 1942 and 1944 permits, the Navy sued the\n\nCommonwealth and the Secretary.      Its complaint asked the federal\n\ndistrict court both to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the\n\nDNER's orders, and to confirm the Navy's right to withdraw water\n\nfrom the Rio Blanco as provided in the 1942 and 1944 permits.\n\nThe Navy advanced a golconda of arguments in support of these\n\nprayers for relief, alleging, inter alia, that the 1944 permit\n\nbestowed an affirmative right to withdraw water from the Rio\n\nBlanco free of charge, and that the Secretary's efforts to\n\nplunge   the   Navy   into   administrative   water   use   proceedings\n\ninfringed the sovereign immunity of the United States.              The\n\ndefendants took a much dimmer view of the combined force and\n\neffect of the Navy's permits.      In addition, they maintained that\n\nthe ongoing DNER proceedings fell within the waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity effected by the McCarran Amendment.\n\n          On November 22, 1999, the district court enjoined all\n\nDNER proceedings against the Navy pendente lite.       The defendants\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthen moved to dismiss the action.        Pertinently, they posited\n\nthat the waiver contained in the McCarran Amendment extended to\n\nadministrative proceedings of the type and kind initiated by the\n\nSecretary under the Law of Waters.      The Navy opposed the motion.\n\nIn regard to the sovereign immunity issue, it advanced several\n\nreasons why the McCarran Amendment did not pave the way for the\n\nDNER proceeding.    Among other things, the Navy asseverated that\n\nthe proceeding was not a general stream-wide adjudication of the\n\nsort envisioned by the McCarran Amendment, but, rather, a purely\n\nadministrative proceeding limited to a single user.\n\n          In response, the defendants reiterated their argument\n\nthat the administrative proceedings were covered by the McCarran\n\nAmendment.   They suggested that the particular administrative\n\nproceeding they had initiated was merely the first in a series\n\nof proceedings which, in due course, would involve other water\n\nrights claimants.    To emphasize this last point, the defendants\n\nmoved on January 31, 2001, for a limited modification of the\n\nstay in order to permit them to join other parties in the\n\nongoing   administrative   proceeding    and   carry   out   a   general\n\nstream-wide allocation referable to the Rio Blanco.\n\n          The district court denied both motions on March 30,\n\n2001, and set the case for trial.     On May 9, the court reversed\n\nits field and advised the parties that it would address the\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fissues raised by the defendants' motion to dismiss in advance of\n\ntrial.       Roughly four weeks later, the court issued an opinion\n\nthat not only denied the motion to dismiss but also declared\n\nthat       federal   sovereign   immunity   barred   the   Secretary   from\n\ncompelling the Navy to participate in the ongoing administrative\n\nproceeding.2         The court based this conclusion on the fact that\n\nthe Navy's water rights antedated the McCarran Amendment.               See\n\nUnited States v. Puerto Rico, 144 F. Supp. 2d at 52-53.                This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n              Although a plethora of other interesting questions lurk\n\nin the penumbra of this case, we deem the sovereign immunity\n\nissue dispositive.          Consequently, we start by describing the\n\nlegal framework applicable to that issue, explain briefly why we\n\nreject the district court's rationale, and then proceed to the\n\nmerits.       Since the existence vel non of sovereign immunity here\n\n\n\n       2\n     Because the United States, to this point, had not moved\naffirmatively for remedial action, the court's ruling was, in\neffect, a sua sponte grant of declaratory and injunctive relief.\nWe need not probe this seeming anomaly, however, as the\ndefendants have not made a developed argument that we should\nvacate the order on the ground of procedural irregularity, see\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting\nthat \"issues . . . unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation are deemed waived\"), but, rather, have elected to\nattack the district court's ruling head-on.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fdepends upon a question of waiver, and that question in turn\n\ndepends on statutory construction, we afford plenary review.\n\nStrickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs., 96 F.3d 542,\n\n545 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                      A.    The Legal Framework.\n\n            It is common ground that absent waiver or consent,\n\nfederal sovereign immunity precludes a state from hauling the\n\nUnited States into either a state court or an adversarial state\n\nadministrative    proceeding.          But    Congress   can   waive   federal\n\nsovereign    immunity,     and   the    McCarran   Amendment     —   the   sole\n\n\"waiver\" statute that is at issue here — constitutes an express\n\nwaiver of that immunity in suits for the adjudication of water\n\nrights.     It provides in pertinent part:\n\n                   Consent is hereby given to join the\n            United States as a defendant in any suit (1)\n            for the adjudication of rights to the use of\n            water of a river system or other source, or\n            (2) for the administration of such rights,\n            where it appears that the United States is\n            the owner of or is in the process of\n            acquiring water rights by appropriation\n            under State law, by purchase, by exchange,\n            or otherwise, and the United States is a\n            necessary party to such suit.     The United\n            States, when a party to any such suit, shall\n            (1) be deemed to have waived any right to\n            plead that the State laws are inapplicable\n            or that the United States is not amenable\n            thereto by reason of its sovereignty, and\n            (2) shall be subject to the judgments,\n            orders, and decrees of the court having\n            jurisdiction, and may obtain review thereof,\n            in the same manner and to the same extent as\n\n                                       -10-\n\f             a    private    individual    under   like\n             circumstances:  Provided, That no judgment\n             for costs shall be entered against the\n             United States in any such suit.\n\n43 U.S.C. § 666(a).\n\n             Typically, waivers of federal sovereign immunity are\n\nstrictly construed.         E.g., United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754,\n\n762 (1st Cir. 1994).         In United States v. Idaho, 50 8 U . S . 1\n\n(1993),     the   Supreme   Court   confirmed         that    this     interpretive\n\napproach applies in the context of the McCarran Amendment.                          The\n\nCourt stated:\n\n             Any such waiver must be strictly construed\n             in favor of the United States, and not\n             enlarged beyond what the language of the\n             statute requires. But just as we should not\n             take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver\n             beyond that which Congress intended[,] . . .\n             [n]either, however, should we assume the\n             authority to narrow the waiver that Congress\n             intended.\n\nId. at 6 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             The short of it is that congressional intent remains\n\nthe   key   determinant     of   the    scope        of   a   waiver    of   federal\n\nsovereign immunity — and the McCarran Amendment is no exception\n\nto this rule.        To discern what Congress intended, we look\n\nprimarily to the language and structure of the statute.                             See\n\nUnited States v. Hilario, 218 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nPlain   meaning     controls     except       when    the     statutory      text    is\n\nambiguous, or when literal application of the words would either\n\n                                       -11-\n\fcontravene clear legislative intent or lead to an absurd result.\n\nId.\n\n                   B.    The District Court's Rationale.\n\n               The district court held the McCarran Amendment waiver\n\ninapplicable on non-retroactivity grounds.             United States v.\n\nPuerto Rico, 144 F. Supp. 2d at 52-53.               We agree with the\n\ndefendants that this reasoning misses the mark.3\n\n               There is, of course, a general presumption against\n\napplying statutes retroactively.             See Landgraf v. U.S.I. Film\n\nProds., 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994).            This presumption, combined\n\nwith the rule of strict construction for waivers of federal\n\nsovereign immunity, can suffice to ground a plausible argument\n\nthat the McCarran Amendment was not intended to have retroactive\n\napplication.          The rub, however, is that the case before us does\n\nnot involve a backward-looking application of the statute.\n\n               The McCarran Amendment was adopted in 1952, and the\n\nDNER proceeding against the Navy did not commence until 1999.\n\nA   law   is    not    considered   retroactive   merely   because   events\n\noccurring prior to its passage are implicated in subsequent\n\nproceedings under it.          See Campbell v. United States, 809 F.2d\n\n563, 571 (9th Cir. 1987); Alexander v. Robinson, 756 F.2d 1153,\n\n\n      3\n     The United States, to its credit, concedes this point\n(although it vigorously defends the district court's decision on\nalternate grounds).\n\n                                      -12-\n\f1155 n.5 (5th Cir. 1985).            Thus, the fact that the United States\n\ntraces its water rights to permits issued in the early 1940s\n\ndoes   not   alter     the    conclusion       that       the   use   to     which    the\n\ndefendants      seek   to     put    the    statutory       waiver      would       be   a\n\nprospective application, not a retrospective one.                          Because the\n\ndefense of sovereign immunity exists wholly apart from any legal\n\nrights   that    the   Navy    might       claim    under       the   1942    and    1944\n\npermits, see United States v. Dist. Ct. ex rel. Eagle County,\n\n401 U.S. 520, 525-26 (1971), the incidence of federal sovereign\n\nimmunity     cannot    turn    on     the    date     a    particular        right    was\n\nacquired.     See Campbell, 809 F.2d at 571 (explaining that \"the\n\npresumption against 'retroactivity' has generally been applied\n\nonly when application of the new law would affect rights or\n\nobligations existing prior to the change in law\").                           Hence, the\n\nMcCarran Amendment applies to water rights acquired prior to\n\n1952, as long as the suit against the government is commenced\n\nsubsequent to that date.             See, e.g., Eagle County, 401 U.S. at\n\n523 (finding the McCarran Amendment applicable even though the\n\nunderlying federal rights were acquired in 1905).\n\n                                C.    The Merits.\n\n             Despite the fact that we do not accept the district\n\ncourt's ratio decidendi, we nonetheless may affirm the judgment\n\non any independent ground that is apparent in the record.

The Navy argues that the waiver embodied in\n\nthe McCarran Amendment does not extend to purely administrative\n\nproceedings    (such    as   the     proceeding      that   the   Secretary\n\ncommenced).    We turn next to that argument.4\n\n         In     crafting      the     McCarran      Amendment,       Congress\n\nconsistently   used    the   word    \"suit\"    to   describe   the    matters\n\naffected by the statutory waiver of federal sovereign immunity.\n\nThat word appears no fewer than seven times in a relatively\n\ncompact statute (most of which is reproduced above).                 The word\n\n\"suit\" has a particularized meaning in legal parlance; it refers\n\nspecifically to an action in a judicial forum.              See Black's Law\n\nDictionary 1448 (7th ed. 1999) (defining a \"suit\" as \"[a]ny\n\nproceeding by a party or parties against another in a court of\n\nlaw\") (emphasis supplied).          The term's meaning was essentially\n\nthe same a half-century ago (when Congress enacted the McCarran\n\nAmendment).    E.g., Stoll v. Hawkeye Cas. Co., 185 F.2d 96, 98\n\n(8th Cir. 1950) (stating that the generally accepted definition\n\nof the word \"suit\"       refers     to   a   \"proceeding in a court of\n\njustice\") (quoting Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 27 U.S.\n\n\n    4Because we find this argument compelling, we need not\nevaluate the Navy's asseveration that the McCarran Amendment\ndoes not apply because the DNER proceeding is neither a general\nstream-wide adjudication nor an \"adjudication of rights\" within\nthe contemplation of the statute.\n\n                                    -14-\n\f(2 Pet.) 449, 464 (1829) (emphasis supplied)).                   The presumption\n\nis     that      Congress    knew,    and    purposefully        embraced,        that\n\nparticularized meaning when it chose to employ the word in the\n\ntext       of   the   McCarran    Amendment.        See    Morissette      v.   United\n\nStates, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952); United States v. Nason, 269\n\nF.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                Nothing in the language or structure of the McCarran\n\nAmendment rebuts this presumption.5                 To the contrary, Congress's\n\npersistent use of terms such as \"defendant,\" \"necessary party,\"\n\nand    \"the      court   having    jurisdiction,\"         virtually   compels      the\n\nconclusion that the repeated references to suits were fully\n\ncalculated.           It follows that the waiver was meant to apply only\n\nto judicial proceedings.\n\n                The defendants attempt to blunt the force of Congress's\n\nseven-fold resort to the word \"suit\" in the text of the McCarran\n\nAmendment by reliance on the Ninth Circuit's opinion in United\n\nStates v. Oregon, 44 F.3d 758 (9th Cir. 1994).                      They cite this\n\ncase for the proposition that \"suit,\" as that word is used in\n\nthe McCarran Amendment, encompasses administrative as well as\n\njudicial        proceedings.       Whether     or    not   Oregon     is   correctly\n\n\n       5\n     To be sure, the McCarran Amendment does contain a reference\nto the \"administration of [water use] rights,\" but read in\ncontext, these words grammatically refer to suits for the\nadministration of such rights, and so fail to broaden the scope\nof the waiver.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fdecided — a matter on which we take no view — we do not believe\n\nthat the opinion supports so sweeping a proposition.\n\n            In Oregon, the Ninth Circuit held that a unitary water\n\nrights     adjudication        framework,        which      contained         both\n\nadministrative and judicial components, satisfied the McCarran\n\nAmendment's definition of a suit.             Id. at 767.      The court noted\n\nthat the primary purpose of the McCarran Amendment was to permit\n\ncomprehensive       water   rights      adjudications          in     the     arid\n\nsouthwestern states (where, historically, the United States held\n\na major portion of such rights).             See id. at 765.     Most of those\n\nstates    adopted   specific    statutory       schemes   for    water      rights\n\nadjudications, and those schemes tended to delegate significant\n\nauthority to administrative agencies.              See id. at 763-65.          The\n\ncourt reasoned that to exclude such proceedings from the scope\n\nof the waiver granted by the McCarran Amendment would defeat the\n\ndrafters' intent to facilitate water use adjudications in those\n\nregions.    See id. at 765-67; see also Colo. River Water Conserv.\n\nDist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 819 (1976) (\"The consent\n\nto jurisdiction given by the McCarran Amendment bespeaks a\n\npolicy that recognizes the availability of comprehensive state\n\nsystems    for   adjudication    of    water    rights    as    the   means    for\n\nachieving these goals.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f              The statutory scheme considered in Oregon was a unitary\n\nscheme that contained two interconnecting tracks.                      Although it\n\nenvisioned that an action would be commenced administratively by\n\nthe agency (the Oregon Water Resources Department), that action\n\nautomatically would proceed to a judicial forum upon completion\n\nof the administrative process.               See Oregon, 44 F.3d at 764.           In\n\nother     words,       the     Oregon     statute     constructs       a    seamless\n\nproceeding,          possessing       both   administrative         and     judicial\n\ncomponents.          These     two    components    \"are     not   independent    or\n\nunrelated, but parts of a single statutory proceeding, the\n\nearlier stages of which are before the [agency] and the later\n\nstages before the court.\"               Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Or. Water\n\nBd.,    241    U.S.     440,    451     (1915)     (commenting      upon    Oregon's\n\nstatutory scheme for the administration of water rights).                         In\n\nother     words,      the    agency      \"merely     paves    the     way   for   an\n\nadjudication by the court of all the rights involved.\"                            Id.\n\nThus, even though the word \"suit\" contemplates an action in a\n\njudicial forum, it is at least arguable that this seamless\n\nproceeding constitutes a suit.\n\n              Puerto Rico's approach differs in material respects\n\nfrom Oregon's.         The Law of Waters does not establish a seamless\n\nprocess       with    both     administrative       and    judicial    components.\n\nRather, it contemplates a purely administrative proceeding — a\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fproceeding that ordinarily will terminate with a final order of\n\nthe Secretary.   It defies common sense to say that this type of\n\nadministrative    proceeding,        wholly   lacking    any   integrated\n\njudicial involvement, is a fair congener to a proceeding under\n\nthe Oregon scheme (and, thus, constitutes a suit).\n\n          To   plug   this   hole,    the   defendants   respond   that   a\n\nproceeding under the Law of Waters leaves open the possibility\n\nof judicial review.     See 12 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1520 (conferring\n\nupon any aggrieved party a right to seek judicial review of the\n\nDNER's final order within thirty days).         Their premise is true,\n\nbut their suggested conclusion — that this right of judicial\n\nreview transmogrifies the underlying proceeding into a suit —\n\ndoes not hold water.     We explain briefly.\n\n          Section 1520 is a bareboned provision, which lacks any\n\nsemblance of detail.     Therefore, we must assume that it merely\n\nacknowledges the right of judicial review embodied in Puerto\n\nRico's Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), 3 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. §§ 2101-2201.6     Cf. Becker v. FEC, 230 F.3d 381, 384 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (reasoning that because a federal statute contained\n\nno provisions governing the mode and manner of judicial review,\n\n\n\n     6Under the UAPA, \"[a]ny party which is adversely affected by\na final order or resolution of an agency\" has thirty days within\nwhich to file a petition for review in a local court. 3 P.R.\nLaws Ann. § 2172.\n\n                                 -18-\n\fthe provisions set forth in the APA applied).                That review is\n\nhighly circumscribed and cannot serve to compensate for the\n\nabsence of meaningful judicial involvement in the underlying\n\nproceeding.    After all, virtually every final agency action is\n\nreviewable    by   a   court   of   law.     See,    e.g.,   Administrative\n\nProcedure Act (APA) § 704, 5 U.S.C. § 704 (\"Agency action made\n\nreviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is\n\nno other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial\n\nreview.\").    To accept that the right to a limited APA-type of\n\njudicial review suffices to convert a purely administrative\n\nproceeding into a suit would compel the absurd conclusion that\n\nall administrative proceedings are suits and that no purely\n\nadministrative proceedings exist.          We cannot endorse so radical\n\na proposition.\n\n           A further comparison between Oregon's seamless scheme\n\nfor the adjudication of water rights and Puerto Rico's Law of\n\nWaters   illustrates     the   point.      Under    the   former   scheme,   a\n\nreviewing court is not constrained by the administrative record\n\nbut may receive additional evidence, Warner Valley Stock Co. v.\n\nLynch, 336 P.2d 884, 901 (Or. 1959), or, alternatively, may\n\nappoint a special master to take further testimony,                 Or. Rev.\n\nStat. § 539.150.        Relatedly, such a scheme allows de novo\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fjudicial review of factual matters.                  See Warner Valley, 336 P.2d\n\nat 900.\n\n              The UAPA (and, thus, Puerto Rico's Law of Waters)\n\noperates quite differently.              Under it, an inquiring court is\n\nlimited       to   the   administrative          record,      and    the    agency's\n\nfactfinding \"shall be upheld by the court [so long as] grounded\n\non substantial evidence filed in the administrative record.\"                       3\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 2175.           Thus, a court examining a decision of\n\nthe Secretary in a case under the Law of Waters would be forced\n\nto rely solely on evidence presented in the administrative\n\nproceeding, and would have to defer broadly to the Secretary's\n\nfindings of fact.         Limitations such as these underscore that\n\nPuerto Rico's water rights proceedings are both procedurally and\n\nsubstantively different from a traditional suit.                     In effect, an\n\nagency       functions   under     the    UAPA       scheme   as    an   independent\n\nadjudicator within the executive branch of government, whereas,\n\nunder    a    seamless   scheme     possessing         both   administrative     and\n\njudicial components, an agency functions as an aid to the court.\n\n              In sum, a seamless administrative-judicial scheme (such\n\nas   Oregon's)      places   the    court       in    the   role    of   independent\n\nadjudicator, not merely in the role of reviewer of a pre-\n\ncompiled record.         Based on this salient distinction, we hold\n\nthat even if Oregon's scheme might be termed a suit, Puerto\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fRico's counterpart scheme cannot be so characterized.                           Put\n\nanother way, because a DNER proceeding under the Law of Waters\n\ncontains no significant judicial component, it is not equivalent\n\nto a suit — and the balm of the McCarran Amendment does not\n\nextend to it.\n\n                 We need go no further.         There is simply no persuasive\n\nevidence         that   the   repeated   use    of   the   word   \"suit\"   by   the\n\ndrafters of the McCarran Amendment was either a linguistic\n\naccident or an awkward attempt to convey a meaning different\n\nthan the norm.7          Thus, we are bound to accord the word \"suit\" its\n\nordinary meaning.             See Morissette, 342 U.S. at 263; Nason, 268\n\nF.3d at 16.             So defined, the word presupposes a meaningful\n\nadjudication in a judicial forum.               Since the Law of Waters does\n\nnot provide for such an adjudication, the McCarran Amendment\n\ndoes       not   apply    here.     It   follows     inexorably    that    federal\n\nsovereign immunity bars the proceeding that the Secretary seeks\n\nto launch against the Navy.\n\n\n       7\n     For what it may be worth, we note that nothing in the\nlegislative history of the McCarran Amendment establishes that\nCongress intended the waiver of federal sovereign immunity to\ncover a purely administrative scheme for the adjudication of\nwater rights. In the Senate hearings, the distinction between\nadministrative and judicial actions was drawn at several points,\nsee, e.g., Hearings on S.18, Subcomm. Sen. Jud'y Comm., 82d\nCong., 1st Sess., 10-11, 23, 53 (1952), but the hearings are\nunilluminating as to the key issue of whether the Amendment was\nultimately   intended   to  encompass   purely    administrative\nproceedings.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n              To recapitulate, we hold that the McCarran Amendment\n\ndoes not waive federal sovereign immunity with respect to the\n\npurely administrative proceeding commenced against the Navy\n\nunder the Law of Waters.             The upshot is that the federal\n\ngovernment's immunity remains intact and the Secretary lacks the\n\nauthority      to   compel   the   Navy   either   to   participate   in   the\n\nongoing administrative proceeding or to enforce the October 29,\n\n1999 order.8\n\n\n\nAffirmed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      Because our reasoning differs from that of the lower court,\nwe remand the case for the entry of an amended decree consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n                                     -22-\n\f",

This appeal turns on the scope of that waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying litigation flows from Puerto Rico's efforts to impose restrictions on the extraction of water from a river known as the Rio Blanco. The Commonwealth asserts that the McCarran Amendment divests the United States of its sovereign immunity in respect to the compelled participation of the United States Navy in administrative proceedings concerning that subject, commenced pursuant to Puerto Rico's Law of Waters, 12 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 1501-3015. Disagreeing with this assertion, the Navy asked the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico for surcease. The district court stayed the administrative proceedings pending final resolution of the suit. In due course, the court found the McCarran Amendment inapplicable and granted the Navy sanctuary. <i>See United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 144 F.Supp.2d 46, 53 (D.P.R.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although our reasoning differs significantly from the district court's, we too hold that the McCarran Amendment does not waive the sovereign immunity of the United States with respect to the administrative proceedings here at issue. The McCarran Amendment speaks of \"suits,\" and the local proceedings, instituted by the Commonwealth's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) under the Law of Waters, cannot be so characterized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as pertinent here, the facts are uncontroversial. During World War II, the Navy began construction of the United States Naval Station at Roosevelt Roads (NSRR). To ensure an adequate freshwater supply, the Navy obtained a permit (the 1942 permit) from the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission to withdraw up to ten cubic feet per second from the Rio Blanco. The Navy then proceeded to construct a primary water intake in the tailrace of a privately-owned hydroelectric power plant and an emergency intake just upstream of the plant. Shortly thereafter, a federal agency acquired title to the hydroelectric plant and conveyed it to the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority (PRWRA). In consideration of the conveyance, the PRWRA issued a permit (the 1944 permit) granting the federal government the right \"to continue the use, operation, and maintenance\" of the water supply system free of charge for as long as the NSRR remained operational.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico enacted the Law of Waters in 1976. The statute directs the Secretary of the DNER to formulate an integrated plan for conservation, development, and use of the Commonwealth's water resources, 12 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1505(a), set water consumption priorities, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1505(e), and establish and administer a system that allocates water based on those priorities, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1505(j). The statute contemplates the issuance of permits for the drilling of water wells and the granting of franchises for the utilization of surface waters. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1509.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory regime further provides that when a body of water lacks sufficient volume to meet the demands that are made upon it, the Secretary may institute a process to allocate the available water among competing claimants. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1515. The statute grants affected parties the right to a hearing before the Secretary &#8212; a hearing that incorporates the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, and similar procedural protections. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1519. Although the statute terms such hearings \"quasi-judicial,\" no court officer is involved; the details of the process are spelled out in the DNER's regulations, and the Secretary's decision is final unless an aggrieved party seeks review within thirty days in a court of first instance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1520.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, the DNER, acting under the Law of Waters, admonished the Navy that it needed to update its franchise for diverting water from the Rio Blanco. Thinking this a mere formality, the Navy submitted a renewal application. The Secretary never acted upon the application, claiming that it was incomplete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter remained on the back burner until July 7, 1999, when the DNER served the Navy with a \"cease-and-show-cause\" order. This order rested on the premise that the Navy was withdrawing water from the Rio Blanco without a valid franchise (and thereby transgressing the Law of Waters). After some intermittent contacts, marked chiefly by bureaucratic wrangling, the Secretary issued a second order, dated October 29, 1999, directing the Navy to (1) initiate a franchise request for the primary and emergency water intake locations, (2) install metering devices to measure water extraction from both intakes, (3) reimburse the Commonwealth for prior water consumption, and (4) pay provisional user fees until its water rights claims were administratively determined. This order informed the Navy, in no uncertain terms, that it was obliged to participate in franchise application proceedings, and that the DNER might ultimately grant or deny a franchise, taking into account \"the needs of the entire community of the area.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by the DNER's dismissive attitude toward its rights under the 1942 and 1944 permits, the Navy sued the Commonwealth and the Secretary. Its complaint asked the federal district court both to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the DNER's orders, and to confirm the Navy's right to withdraw water from the Rio Blanco as provided in the 1942 and 1944 permits. The Navy advanced a golconda of arguments in support of these prayers for relief, alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> that the 1944 permit bestowed an affirmative right to withdraw water from the Rio Blanco free of charge, and that the Secretary's efforts to plunge the Navy into administrative water use proceedings infringed the sovereign immunity of the United States. The defendants took a much dimmer view of the combined force and effect of the Navy's permits. In addition, they maintained that the ongoing DNER proceedings fell within the waiver of sovereign immunity effected by the McCarran Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1999, the district court enjoined all DNER proceedings against the Navy <i>pendente lite.</i> The defendants then moved to dismiss the action. Pertinently, they posited that the waiver contained in the McCarran Amendment extended to administrative proceedings of the type and kind initiated by the Secretary under the Law of Waters. The Navy opposed the motion. In regard to the sovereign immunity issue, it advanced several reasons why the McCarran Amendment did not pave the way for the DNER proceeding. Among other things, the Navy asseverated that the proceeding was not a general stream-wide adjudication of the sort envisioned by the McCarran Amendment, but, rather, a purely administrative proceeding limited to a single user.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the defendants reiterated their argument that the administrative proceedings were covered by the McCarran Amendment. They suggested that the particular administrative proceeding they had initiated was merely the first in a series of proceedings which, in due course, would involve other water rights claimants. To emphasize this last point, the defendants moved on January 31, 2001, for a limited modification of the stay in order to permit them to join other parties in the ongoing administrative proceeding and carry out a general stream-wide allocation referable to the Rio Blanco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied both motions on March 30, 2001, and set the case for trial. On May 9, the court reversed its field and advised the parties that it would address the issues raised by the defendants' motion to dismiss in advance of trial. Roughly four weeks later, the court issued an opinion that not only denied the motion to dismiss but also declared that federal sovereign immunity barred the Secretary from compelling the Navy to participate in the ongoing administrative proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The court based this conclusion on the fact that the Navy's water rights antedated the McCarran Amendment. <i>See United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 144 F.Supp.2d at 52-53. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a plethora of other interesting questions lurk in the penumbra of this case, we deem the sovereign immunity issue dispositive. Consequently, we start by describing the legal framework applicable to that issue, explain briefly why we reject the district court's rationale, and then proceed to the merits. Since the existence <i>vel non</i> of sovereign immunity here depends upon a question of waiver, and that question in turn depends on statutory construction, we afford plenary review. <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> 96 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Legal Framework.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that absent waiver or consent, federal sovereign immunity precludes a state from hauling the United States into either a state court or an adversarial state administrative proceeding. But Congress can waive federal sovereign immunity, and the McCarran Amendment &#8212; the sole \"waiver\" statute that is at issue here &#8212; constitutes an express waiver of that immunity in suits for the adjudication of water rights. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consent is hereby given to join the United States as a defendant in any suit (1) for the adjudication of rights to the use of water of a river system or other source, or (2) for the administration of such rights, where it appears that the United States is the owner of or is in the process of acquiring water rights by appropriation under State law, by purchase, by exchange, or otherwise, and the United States is a necessary party to such suit. The United States, when a party to any such suit, shall (1) be deemed to have waived any right to plead that the State laws are inapplicable or that the United States is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty, and (2) shall be subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction, and may obtain review thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances: <i>Provided,</i> That no judgment for costs shall be entered against the United States in any such suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">43 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, waivers of federal sovereign immunity are strictly construed. <i>E.g., United States v. Horn,</i> 29 F.3d 754, 762 (1st Cir.1994). In <i>United States v. Idaho,</i> 508 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 1893, 123 L.Ed.2d 563 (1993), the Supreme Court confirmed that this interpretive approach applies in the context of the McCarran Amendment. The Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any such waiver must be strictly construed in favor of the United States, and not enlarged beyond what the language of the statute requires. But just as we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver beyond that which Congress intended[,] ... [n]either, however, should we assume the authority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 6, 113 S.Ct. 1893 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that congressional intent remains the key determinant of the scope of a waiver of federal sovereign immunity &#8212; and the McCarran Amendment is no exception to this rule. To discern what Congress intended, we look primarily to the language and structure of the statute. <i>See United States v. Hilario,</i> 218 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.2000). Plain meaning controls except when the statutory text is ambiguous, or when literal application of the words would either contravene clear legislative intent or lead to an absurd result. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The District Court's Rationale.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held the McCarran Amendment waiver inapplicable on non-retroactivity grounds. <i>United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 144 F.Supp.2d at 52-53. We agree with the defendants that this reasoning misses the mark.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, of course, a general presumption against applying statutes retroactively. <i>See Landgraf v. U.S.I. Film Prods.,</i> 511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). This presumption, combined with the rule of strict construction for waivers of federal sovereign immunity, can suffice to ground a plausible argument that the McCarran Amendment was not intended to have retroactive application. The rub, however, is that the case before us does not involve a backward-looking application of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The McCarran Amendment was adopted in 1952, and the DNER proceeding against the Navy did not commence until 1999. A law is not considered retroactive merely because events occurring prior to its passage are implicated in subsequent proceedings under it. <i>See Campbell v. United States,</i> 809 F.2d 563, 571 (9th Cir.1987); <i>Alexander v. Robinson,</i> 756 F.2d 1153, 1155 n. 5 (5th Cir.1985). Thus, the fact that the United States traces its water rights to permits issued in the early 1940s does not alter the conclusion that the use to which the defendants seek to put the statutory waiver would be a prospective application, not a retrospective one. Because the defense of sovereign immunity exists wholly apart from any legal rights that the Navy might claim under the 1942 and 1944 permits, <i>see United States v. Dist. Ct. ex rel. Eagle County,</i> 401 U.S. 520, 525-26, 91 S.Ct. 998, 28 L.Ed.2d 278 (1971), the incidence of federal sovereign immunity cannot turn on the date a particular right was acquired. <i>See Campbell,</i> 809 F.2d at 571 (explaining that \"the presumption against `retroactivity' has generally been applied only when application of the new law would affect rights or obligations existing prior to the change in law\"). Hence, the McCarran Amendment applies to water rights acquired prior to 1952, as long as the suit against the government is commenced subsequent to that date. <i>See, e.g., Eagle County,</i> 401 U.S. at 523, 91 S.Ct. 998 (finding the McCarran Amendment applicable even though the underlying federal rights were acquired in 1905).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that we do not accept the district court's <i>ratio decidendi,</i> we nonetheless may affirm the judgment on any independent ground that is apparent in the record. <i>See, e.g., Lohnes v. Level 3 Communications, Inc.,</i> 272 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.2001). The Navy argues that the waiver embodied in the McCarran Amendment does not extend to purely administrative proceedings (such as the proceeding that the Secretary commenced). We turn next to that argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In crafting the McCarran Amendment, Congress consistently used the word \"suit\" to describe the matters affected by the statutory waiver of federal sovereign immunity. That word appears no fewer than seven times in a relatively compact statute (most of which is reproduced above). The word \"suit\" has a particularized meaning in legal parlance; it refers specifically to an action in a judicial forum. <i>See</i> Black's Law Dictionary 1448 (7th ed.1999) (defining a \"suit\" as \"[a]ny proceeding by a party or parties against another <i>in a court of law</i>\") (emphasis supplied). The term's meaning was essentially the same a half-century ago (when Congress enacted the McCarran Amendment). <i>E.g., Stoll v. Hawkeye Cas. Co.,</i> 185 F.2d 96, 98 (8th Cir.1950) (stating that the generally accepted definition of the word \"suit\" refers to a \"proceeding <i>in a court of justice</i>\") (quoting <i>Weston v. City Council of Charleston,</i> 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 449, 464, 7 L.Ed. 481 (1829) (emphasis supplied)). The presumption is that Congress knew, and purposefully embraced, that particularized meaning when it chose to employ the word in the text of the McCarran Amendment. <i>See Morissette v. United States,</i> 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952); <i>United States v. Nason,</i> 269 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the language or structure of the McCarran Amendment rebuts this presumption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> To the contrary, Congress's persistent use of terms such as \"defendant,\" \"necessary party,\" and \"the court having jurisdiction,\" virtually compels the conclusion that the repeated references to suits were fully calculated. It follows that the waiver was meant to apply only to judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants attempt to blunt the force of Congress's seven-fold resort to the word \"suit\" in the text of the McCarran Amendment by reliance on the Ninth Circuit's opinion in <i>United States v. Oregon,</i> 44 F.3d 758 (9th Cir.1994). They cite this case for the proposition that \"suit,\" as that word is used in the McCarran Amendment, encompasses administrative as well as judicial proceedings. Whether or not <i>Oregon</i> is correctly decided &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; we do not believe that the opinion supports so sweeping a proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Oregon,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that a unitary water rights adjudication framework, which contained both administrative and judicial components, satisfied the McCarran Amendment's definition of a suit. <i>Id.</i> at 767. The court noted that the primary purpose of the McCarran Amendment was to permit comprehensive water rights adjudications in the arid southwestern states (where, historically, the United States held a major portion of such rights). <i>See id.</i> at 765. Most of those states adopted specific statutory schemes for water rights adjudications, and those schemes tended to delegate significant authority to administrative agencies. <i>See id.</i> at 763-65. The court reasoned that to exclude such proceedings from the scope of the waiver granted by the McCarran Amendment would defeat the drafters' intent to facilitate water use adjudications in those regions. <i>See id.</i> at 765-67; <i>see also Colo. River Water Conserv. Dist. v. United States,</i> 424 U.S. 800, 819, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976) (\"The consent to jurisdiction given by the McCarran Amendment bespeaks a policy that recognizes the availability of comprehensive state systems for adjudication of water rights as the means for achieving these goals.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory scheme considered in <i>Oregon</i> was a unitary scheme that contained two interconnecting tracks. Although it envisioned that an action would be commenced administratively by the agency (the Oregon Water Resources Department), that action automatically would proceed to a judicial forum upon completion of the administrative process. <i>See Oregon,</i> 44 F.3d at 764. In other words, the Oregon statute constructs a seamless proceeding, possessing both administrative and judicial components. These two components \"are not independent or unrelated, but parts of a single statutory proceeding, the earlier stages of which are before the [agency] and the later stages before the court.\" <i>Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Lewis,</i> 241 U.S. 440, 451, 36 S.Ct. 637, 60 L.Ed. 1084 (1915) (commenting upon Oregon's statutory scheme for the administration of water rights). In other words, the agency \"merely paves the way for an adjudication by the court of all the rights involved.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, even though the word \"suit\" contemplates an action in a judicial forum, it is at least arguable that this seamless proceeding constitutes a suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's approach differs in material respects from Oregon's. The Law of Waters does not establish a seamless process with both administrative and judicial components. Rather, it contemplates a purely administrative proceeding &#8212; a proceeding that ordinarily will terminate with a final order of the Secretary. It defies common sense to say that this type of administrative proceeding, wholly lacking any integrated judicial involvement, is a fair congener to a proceeding under the Oregon scheme (and, thus, constitutes a suit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To plug this hole, the defendants respond that a proceeding under the Law of Waters leaves open the possibility of judicial review. <i>See</i> 12 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1520 (conferring upon any aggrieved party a right to seek judicial review of the DNER's final order within thirty days). Their premise is true, but their suggested conclusion &#8212; that this right of judicial review transmogrifies the underlying proceeding into a suit &#8212; does not hold water. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1520 is a bareboned provision, which lacks any semblance of detail. Therefore, we must assume that it merely acknowledges the right of judicial review embodied in Puerto Rico's Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 2101-2201.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Cf. Becker v.</i> <i>FEC,</i> 230 F.3d 381, 384 (1st Cir.2000) (reasoning that because a federal statute contained no provisions governing the mode and manner of judicial review, the provisions set forth in the APA applied). That review is highly circumscribed and cannot serve to compensate for the absence of meaningful judicial involvement in the underlying proceeding. After all, virtually every final agency action is reviewable by a court of law. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Administrative Procedure Act (APA) &#167; 704, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704 (\"Agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.\"). To accept that the right to a limited APA-type of judicial review suffices to convert a purely administrative proceeding into a suit would compel the absurd conclusion that <i>all</i> administrative proceedings are suits and that no purely administrative proceedings exist. We cannot endorse so radical a proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further comparison between Oregon's seamless scheme for the adjudication of water rights and Puerto Rico's Law of Waters illustrates the point. Under the former scheme, a reviewing court is not constrained by the administrative record but may receive additional evidence, <i>Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Lynch,</i> 215 Or. 523, 336 P.2d 884, 901 (1959), or, alternatively, may appoint a special master to take further testimony, Or.Rev.Stat. &#167; 539.150. Relatedly, such a scheme allows de novo judicial review of factual matters. <i>See Warner Valley,</i> 336 P.2d at 900.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UAPA (and, thus, Puerto Rico's Law of Waters) operates quite differently. Under it, an inquiring court is limited to the administrative record, and the agency's factfinding \"shall be upheld by the court [so long as] grounded on substantial evidence filed in the administrative record.\" 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 2175. Thus, a court examining a decision of the Secretary in a case under the Law of Waters would be forced to rely solely on evidence presented in the administrative proceeding, and would have to defer broadly to the Secretary's findings of fact. Limitations such as these underscore that Puerto Rico's water rights proceedings are both procedurally and substantively different from a traditional suit. In effect, an agency functions under the UAPA scheme as an independent adjudicator within the executive branch of government, whereas, under a seamless scheme possessing both administrative and judicial components, an agency functions as an aid to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, a seamless administrative-judicial scheme (such as Oregon's) places the court in the role of independent adjudicator, not merely in the role of reviewer of a pre-compiled record. Based on this salient distinction, we hold that even if Oregon's scheme might be termed a suit, Puerto Rico's counterpart scheme cannot be so characterized. Put another way, because a DNER proceeding under the Law of Waters contains no significant judicial component, it is not equivalent to a suit &#8212; and the balm of the McCarran Amendment does not extend to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. There is simply no persuasive evidence that the repeated use of the word \"suit\" by the drafters of the McCarran Amendment was either a linguistic accident or an awkward attempt to convey a meaning different than the norm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, we are bound to accord the word \"suit\" its ordinary meaning. <i>See Morissette,</i> 342 U.S. at 263, 72 S.Ct. 240; <i>Nason,</i> 269 F.3d at 16. So defined, the word presupposes a meaningful adjudication in a <i>judicial</i> forum. Since the Law of Waters does not provide for such an adjudication, the McCarran Amendment does not apply here. It follows inexorably that federal sovereign immunity bars the proceeding that the Secretary seeks to launch against the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we hold that the McCarran Amendment does not waive federal sovereign immunity with respect to the purely administrative proceeding commenced against the Navy under the Law of Waters. The upshot is that the federal government's immunity remains intact and the Secretary lacks the authority to compel the Navy either to participate in the ongoing administrative proceeding or to enforce the October 29, 1999 order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties hotly debate whether the 1944 permit granted a right to withdraw water or merely an easement-like right to maintain the water supply system.

This appeal turns on the scope of that waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying litigation flows from Puerto Rico's efforts to impose restrictions on the extraction of water from a river known as the Rio Blanco. The Commonwealth asserts that the McCarran Amendment divests the United States of its sovereign immunity in respect to the compelled participation of the United States Navy in administrative proceedings concerning that subject, commenced pursuant to Puerto Rico's Law of Waters, 12 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 1501-3015. Disagreeing with this assertion, the Navy asked the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico for surcease. The district court stayed the administrative proceedings pending final resolution of the suit. In due course, the court found the McCarran Amendment inapplicable and granted the Navy sanctuary. <i>See United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2316096\"><a href=\"/opinion/2316096/united-states-v-commonwealth-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The McCarran Amendment speaks of \"suits,\" and the local proceedings, instituted by the Commonwealth's Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) under the Law of Waters, cannot be so characterized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as pertinent here, the facts are uncontroversial. During World War II, the Navy began construction of the United States Naval Station at Roosevelt Roads (NSRR). To ensure an adequate freshwater supply, the Navy obtained a permit (the 1942 permit) from the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission to withdraw up to ten cubic feet per second from the Rio Blanco. The Navy then proceeded to construct a primary water intake in the tailrace of a privately-owned hydroelectric power plant and an emergency intake just upstream of the plant. Shortly thereafter, a federal agency acquired title to the hydroelectric plant and conveyed it to the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority (PRWRA). In consideration of the conveyance, the PRWRA issued a permit (the 1944 permit) granting the federal government the right \"to continue the use, operation, and maintenance\" of the water supply system free of charge for as long as the NSRR remained operational.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico enacted the Law of Waters in 1976. The statute directs the Secretary of the DNER to formulate an integrated plan for conservation, development, and use of the Commonwealth's water resources, 12 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1505(a), set water consumption priorities, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1505(e), and establish and administer a system that allocates water based on those priorities, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1505(j). The statute contemplates the issuance of permits for the drilling of water wells and the granting of franchises for the utilization of surface waters. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1509.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory regime further provides that when a body of water lacks sufficient volume to meet the demands that are made upon it, the Secretary may institute a process to allocate the available water among competing claimants. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1515. The statute grants affected parties the right to a hearing before the Secretary &#8212; a hearing that incorporates the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, and similar procedural protections. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1519. Although the statute terms such hearings \"quasi-judicial,\" no court officer is involved; the details of the process are spelled out in the DNER's regulations, and the Secretary's decision is final unless an aggrieved party seeks review within thirty days in a court of first instance. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1520.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1986, the DNER, acting under the Law of Waters, admonished the Navy that it needed to update its franchise for diverting water from the Rio Blanco. Thinking this a mere formality, the Navy submitted a renewal application. The Secretary never acted upon the application, claiming that it was incomplete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter remained on the back burner until July 7, 1999, when the DNER served the Navy with a \"cease-and-show-cause\" order. This order rested on the premise that the Navy was withdrawing water from the Rio Blanco without a valid franchise (and thereby transgressing the Law of Waters). After some intermittent contacts, marked chiefly by bureaucratic wrangling, the Secretary issued a second order, dated October 29, 1999, directing the Navy to (1) initiate a franchise request for the primary and emergency water intake locations, (2) install metering devices to measure water extraction from both intakes, (3) reimburse the Commonwealth for prior water consumption, and (4) pay provisional user fees until its water rights claims were administratively determined. This order informed the Navy, in no uncertain terms, that it was obliged to participate in franchise application proceedings, and that the DNER might ultimately grant or deny a franchise, taking into account \"the needs of the entire community of the area.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by the DNER's dismissive attitude toward its rights under the 1942 and 1944 permits, the Navy sued the Commonwealth and the Secretary. Its complaint asked the federal district court both to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the DNER's orders, and to confirm the Navy's right to withdraw water from the Rio Blanco as provided in the 1942 and 1944 permits. The Navy advanced a golconda of arguments in support of these prayers for relief, alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> that the 1944 permit bestowed an affirmative right to withdraw water from the Rio Blanco free of charge, and that the Secretary's efforts to plunge the Navy into administrative water use proceedings infringed the sovereign immunity of the United States. The defendants took a much dimmer view of the combined force and effect of the Navy's permits. In addition, they maintained that the ongoing DNER proceedings fell within the waiver of sovereign immunity effected by the McCarran Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1999, the district court enjoined all DNER proceedings against the Navy <i>pendente lite.</i> The defendants then moved to dismiss the action. Pertinently, they posited that the waiver contained in the McCarran Amendment extended to administrative proceedings of the type and kind initiated by the Secretary under the Law of Waters. The Navy opposed the motion. In regard to the sovereign immunity issue, it advanced several reasons why the McCarran Amendment did not pave the way for the DNER proceeding. Among other things, the Navy asseverated that the proceeding was not a general stream-wide adjudication of the sort envisioned by the McCarran Amendment, but, rather, a purely administrative proceeding limited to a single user.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the defendants reiterated their argument that the administrative proceedings were covered by the McCarran Amendment. They suggested that the particular administrative proceeding they had initiated was merely the first in a series of proceedings which, in due course, would involve other water rights claimants. To emphasize this last point, the defendants moved on January 31, 2001, for a limited modification of the stay in order to permit them to join other parties in the ongoing administrative proceeding and carry out a general stream-wide allocation referable to the Rio Blanco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied both motions on March 30, 2001, and set the case for trial. On May 9, the court reversed its field and advised the parties that it would address the issues raised by the defendants' motion to dismiss in advance of trial. Roughly four weeks later, the court issued an opinion that not only denied the motion to dismiss but also declared that federal sovereign immunity barred the Secretary from compelling the Navy to participate in the ongoing administrative proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The court based this conclusion on the fact that the Navy's water rights antedated the McCarran Amendment. <i>See United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 144 F.Supp.2d at 52-53. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a plethora of other interesting questions lurk in the penumbra of this case, we deem the sovereign immunity issue dispositive. Consequently, we start by describing the legal framework applicable to that issue, explain briefly why we reject the district court's rationale, and then proceed to the merits. Since the existence <i>vel non</i> of sovereign immunity here depends upon a question of waiver, and that question in turn depends on statutory construction, we afford plenary review. <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196992\"><a href=\"/opinion/196992/strickland-v-comm-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Legal Framework.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that absent waiver or consent, federal sovereign immunity precludes a state from hauling the United States into either a state court or an adversarial state administrative proceeding. But Congress can waive federal sovereign immunity, and the McCarran Amendment &#8212; the sole \"waiver\" statute that is at issue here &#8212; constitutes an express waiver of that immunity in suits for the adjudication of water rights. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consent is hereby given to join the United States as a defendant in any suit (1) for the adjudication of rights to the use of water of a river system or other source, or (2) for the administration of such rights, where it appears that the United States is the owner of or is in the process of acquiring water rights by appropriation under State law, by purchase, by exchange, or otherwise, and the United States is a necessary party to such suit. The United States, when a party to any such suit, shall (1) be deemed to have waived any right to plead that the State laws are inapplicable or that the United States is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty, and (2) shall be subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction, and may obtain review thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances: <i>Provided,</i> That no judgment for costs shall be entered against the United States in any such suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">43 U.S.C. &#167; 666(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, waivers of federal sovereign immunity are strictly construed. <i>E.g., United States v. Horn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674595\"><a href=\"/opinion/674595/united-states-v-richard-a-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 762 (1st Cir.1994).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span> (1993), the Supreme Court confirmed that this interpretive approach applies in the context of the McCarran Amendment. The Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any such waiver must be strictly construed in favor of the United States, and not enlarged beyond what the language of the statute requires. But just as we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiver beyond that which Congress intended[,] ... [n]either, however, should we assume the authority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112851\"><a href=\"/opinion/112851/united-states-v-idaho-ex-rel-director-idaho-department-of-water/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1893</span></a></span> (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that congressional intent remains the key determinant of the scope of a waiver of federal sovereign immunity &#8212; and the McCarran Amendment is no exception to this rule. To discern what Congress intended, we look primarily to the language and structure of the statute. <i>See United States v. Hilario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198998\"><a href=\"/opinion/198998/united-states-v-hilario/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2000). Plain meaning controls except when the statutory text is ambiguous, or when literal application of the words would either contravene clear legislative intent or lead to an absurd result. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The District Court's Rationale.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held the McCarran Amendment waiver inapplicable on non-retroactivity grounds. <i>United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 144 F.Supp.2d at 52-53. We agree with the defendants that this reasoning misses the mark.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, of course, a general presumption against applying statutes retroactively. <i>See Landgraf v. U.S.I. Film Prods.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span> (1994). This presumption, combined with the rule of strict construction for waivers of federal sovereign immunity, can suffice to ground a plausible argument that the McCarran Amendment was not intended to have retroactive application. The rub, however, is that the case before us does not involve a backward-looking application of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The McCarran Amendment was adopted in 1952, and the DNER proceeding against the Navy did not commence until 1999. A law is not considered retroactive merely because events occurring prior to its passage are implicated in subsequent proceedings under it. <i>See Campbell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481710\"><a href=\"/opinion/481710/duncan-campbell-individually-and-as-personal-representative-of-the-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 571 (9th Cir.1987); <i>Alexander v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449241\"><a href=\"/opinion/449241/debra-alexander-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-other-persons-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span>, 1155 n. 5 (5th Cir.1985). Thus, the fact that the United States traces its water rights to permits issued in the early 1940s does not alter the conclusion that the use to which the defendants seek to put the statutory waiver would be a prospective application, not a retrospective one. Because the defense of sovereign immunity exists wholly apart from any legal rights that the Navy might claim under the 1942 and 1944 permits, <i>see United States v. Dist. Ct. ex rel. Eagle County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108293\"><a href=\"/opinion/108293/united-states-v-district-court-for-eagle-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 525-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108293\"><a href=\"/opinion/108293/united-states-v-district-court-for-eagle-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span> (1971), the incidence of federal sovereign immunity cannot turn on the date a particular right was acquired. <i>See Campbell,</i> 809 F.2d at 571 (explaining that \"the presumption against `retroactivity' has generally been applied only when application of the new law would affect rights or obligations existing prior to the change in law\"). Hence, the McCarran Amendment applies to water rights acquired prior to 1952, as long as the suit against the government is commenced subsequent to that date. <i>See, e.g., Eagle County,</i> 401 U.S. at 523, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108293\"><a href=\"/opinion/108293/united-states-v-district-court-for-eagle-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span> (finding the McCarran Amendment applicable even though the underlying federal rights were acquired in 1905).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the fact that we do not accept the district court's <i>ratio decidendi,</i> we nonetheless may affirm the judgment on any independent ground that is apparent in the record. <i>See, e.g., Lohnes v. Level 3 Communications, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199704\"><a href=\"/opinion/199704/lohnes-v-level-3-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2001). The Navy argues that the waiver embodied in the McCarran Amendment does not extend to purely administrative proceedings (such as the proceeding that the Secretary commenced). We turn next to that argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In crafting the McCarran Amendment, Congress consistently used the word \"suit\" to describe the matters affected by the statutory waiver of federal sovereign immunity. That word appears no fewer than seven times in a relatively compact statute (most of which is reproduced above). The word \"suit\" has a particularized meaning in legal parlance; it refers specifically to an action in a judicial forum. <i>See</i> Black's Law Dictionary 1448 (7th ed.1999) (defining a \"suit\" as \"[a]ny proceeding by a party or parties against another <i>in a court of law</i>\") (emphasis supplied). The term's meaning was essentially the same a half-century ago (when Congress enacted the McCarran Amendment). <i>E.g., Stoll v. Hawkeye Cas. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"225945\"><a href=\"/opinion/225945/stoll-v-hawkeye-casualty-co-of-des-moines-iowa/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 98 (8th Cir.1950) (stating that the generally accepted definition of the word \"suit\" refers to a \"proceeding <i>in a court of justice</i>\") (quoting <i>Weston v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (1829) (emphasis supplied)). The presumption is that Congress knew, and purposefully embraced, that particularized meaning when it chose to employ the word in the text of the McCarran Amendment. <i>See Morissette v.

They cite this case for the proposition that \"suit,\" as that word is used in the McCarran Amendment, encompasses administrative as well as judicial proceedings.

The court noted that the primary purpose of the McCarran Amendment was to permit comprehensive water rights adjudications in the arid southwestern states (where, historically, the United States held a major portion of such rights). <i>See id.</i> at 765. Most of those states adopted specific statutory schemes for water rights adjudications, and those schemes tended to delegate significant authority to administrative agencies. <i>See id.</i> at 763-65. The court reasoned that to exclude such proceedings from the scope of the waiver granted by the McCarran Amendment would defeat the drafters' intent to facilitate water use adjudications in those regions. <i>See id.</i> at 765-67; <i>see also Colo.

Although it envisioned that an action would be commenced administratively by the agency (the Oregon Water Resources Department), that action automatically would proceed to a judicial forum upon completion of the administrative process. <i>See Oregon,</i> 44 F.3d at 764. In other words, the Oregon statute constructs a seamless proceeding, possessing both administrative and judicial components. These two components \"are not independent or unrelated, but parts of a single statutory proceeding, the earlier stages of which are before the [agency] and the later stages before the court.\" <i>Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></span>, 451, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></span> (1915) (commenting upon Oregon's statutory scheme for the administration of water rights). In other words, the agency \"merely paves the way for an adjudication by the court of all the rights involved.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, even though the word \"suit\" contemplates an action in a judicial forum, it is at least arguable that this seamless proceeding constitutes a suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's approach differs in material respects from Oregon's. The Law of Waters does not establish a seamless process with both administrative and judicial components. Rather, it contemplates a purely administrative proceeding &#8212; a proceeding that ordinarily will terminate with a final order of the Secretary. It defies common sense to say that this type of administrative proceeding, wholly lacking any integrated judicial involvement, is a fair congener to a proceeding under the Oregon scheme (and, thus, constitutes a suit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To plug this hole, the defendants respond that a proceeding under the Law of Waters leaves open the possibility of judicial review. <i>See</i> 12 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1520 (conferring upon any aggrieved party a right to seek judicial review of the DNER's final order within thirty days). Their premise is true, but their suggested conclusion &#8212; that this right of judicial review transmogrifies the underlying proceeding into a suit &#8212; does not hold water. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1520 is a bareboned provision, which lacks any semblance of detail. Therefore, we must assume that it merely acknowledges the right of judicial review embodied in Puerto Rico's Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 2101-2201.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Cf. Becker v.</i> <i>FEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199145\"><a href=\"/opinion/199145/becker-v-federal-election/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 384 (1st Cir.2000) (reasoning that because a federal statute contained no provisions governing the mode and manner of judicial review, the provisions set forth in the APA applied). That review is highly circumscribed and cannot serve to compensate for the absence of meaningful judicial involvement in the underlying proceeding. After all, virtually every final agency action is reviewable by a court of law. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Administrative Procedure Act (APA) &#167; 704, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704 (\"Agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.\"). To accept that the right to a limited APA-type of judicial review suffices to convert a purely administrative proceeding into a suit would compel the absurd conclusion that <i>all</i> administrative proceedings are suits and that no purely administrative proceedings exist. We cannot endorse so radical a proposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A further comparison between Oregon's seamless scheme for the adjudication of water rights and Puerto Rico's Law of Waters illustrates the point. Under the former scheme, a reviewing court is not constrained by the administrative record but may receive additional evidence, <i>Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Lynch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1393084\"><a href=\"/opinion/1393084/warner-valley-stock-co-v-lynch/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1393084\"><a href=\"/opinion/1393084/warner-valley-stock-co-v-lynch/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 901 (1959), or, alternatively, may appoint a special master to take further testimony, Or.Rev.Stat. &#167; 539.150. Relatedly, such a scheme allows de novo judicial review of factual matters. <i>See Warner Valley,</i> 336 P.2d at 900.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UAPA (and, thus, Puerto Rico's Law of Waters) operates quite differently. Under it, an inquiring court is limited to the administrative record, and the agency's factfinding \"shall be upheld by the court [so long as] grounded on substantial evidence filed in the administrative record.\" 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 2175. Thus, a court examining a decision of the Secretary in a case under the Law of Waters would be forced to rely solely on evidence presented in the administrative proceeding, and would have to defer broadly to the Secretary's findings of fact. Limitations such as these underscore that Puerto Rico's water rights proceedings are both procedurally and substantively different from a traditional suit. In effect, an agency functions under the UAPA scheme as an independent adjudicator within the executive branch of government, whereas, under a seamless scheme possessing both administrative and judicial components, an agency functions as an aid to the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, a seamless administrative-judicial scheme (such as Oregon's) places the court in the role of independent adjudicator, not merely in the role of reviewer of a pre-compiled record. Based on this salient distinction, we hold that even if Oregon's scheme might be termed a suit, Puerto Rico's counterpart scheme cannot be so characterized. Put another way, because a DNER proceeding under the Law of Waters contains no significant judicial component, it is not equivalent to a suit &#8212; and the balm of the McCarran Amendment does not extend to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. There is simply no persuasive evidence that the repeated use of the word \"suit\" by the drafters of the McCarran Amendment was either a linguistic accident or an awkward attempt to convey a meaning different than the norm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, we are bound to accord the word \"suit\" its ordinary meaning. <i>See Morissette,</i> 342 U.S. at 263, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104952\"><a href=\"/opinion/104952/morissette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>; <i>Nason,</i> 269 F.3d at 16. So defined, the word presupposes a meaningful adjudication in a <i>judicial</i> forum. Since the Law of Waters does not provide for such an adjudication, the McCarran Amendment does not apply here. It follows inexorably that federal sovereign immunity bars the proceeding that the Secretary seeks to launch against the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, we hold that the McCarran Amendment does not waive federal sovereign immunity with respect to the purely administrative proceeding commenced against the Navy under the Law of Waters. The upshot is that the federal government's immunity remains intact and the Secretary lacks the authority to compel the Navy either to participate in the ongoing administrative proceeding or to enforce the October 29, 1999 order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties hotly debate whether the 1944 permit granted a right to withdraw water or merely an easement-like right to maintain the water supply system.

Jud'y Comm., 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 10-11, 23, 53 (1952), but the hearings are unilluminating as to the key issue of whether the Amendment was ultimately intended to encompass purely administrative proceedings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Because our reasoning differs from that of the lower court, we remand the case for the entry of an amended decree consistent with this opinion</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
