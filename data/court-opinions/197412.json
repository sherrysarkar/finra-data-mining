Billy Ray McDowell  was convicted of  drug\r                           \r\n\ntrafficking offenses in June  1988.  In March 1996,  he moved\r\n\nin the  district court  for the  return of  $4000 in  cash, a\r\n\ncellular  telephone,  and a  briefcase  containing documents,\r\n\neach of which he claims  were seized from him at the  time of\r\n\nhis  arrest in  February 1988;  according to  the government,\r\n\nthese items  were later  administratively forfeited.   See 21\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   881 (providing for  forfeiture of property or  money\r\n\nused to facilitate or traceable to a drug offense); 19 U.S.C.\r\n\n   1607-09 (outlining administrative forfeiture procedure for\r\n\nitems worth  $500,000 or  less).  In  his collateral  attack,\r\n\nMcDowell claims that he received no notice of the forfeitures\r\n\nand alleges that they  violated his right to due  process and\r\n\nshould be invalidated.     See United States  v. Giraldo,  45\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 509, 511-12 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam).  \r\n\n     The short  response submitted  by the government  in the\r\n\ndistrict court  was apparently  intended to suggest  that the\r\n\nforfeitures  were  in  fact  valid.    But  to  support  this\r\n\nsuggestion, the  government simply  asked  the district court\r\n\nto \"take notice\" of the fact that the  cash and telephone had\r\n\nbeen   \"administratively   forfeited,\"   as    evidenced   by\r\n\ndeclarations of forfeiture for  these two items, which merely\r\n\nrecited that notice had been  sent to all interested persons.\r\n\nThe  government also reported that it  had neither record nor\r\n\nrecollection of a seized briefcase.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     The district court denied the defendant's motion, citing\r\n\nthe  \"facts\" provided by  the Government--facts pertaining to\r\n\nthe administrative forfeiture proceedings and not the  merits\r\n\nof the forfeiture.   The defendant now appeals.   The parties\r\n\nrepeat  the  arguments  advanced below,  with  the government\r\n\nadding the contention that the district court in  Puerto Rico\r\n\nlacked jurisdiction to decide the motion because the property\r\n\nwas seized in Texas.\r\n\n     1.   With  respect  to  the  cell phone  and  cash,  the\r\n\ndefendant  appears  to  have an  almost  hopeless  case.   He\r\n\nconcedes  that the seizure occurred at the time of the arrest\r\n\nthat  led to  his  conviction, as  he  attempted to  open  an\r\n\nairport  locker  which he  thought  contained  cocaine.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.  McDowell, 918  F.2d 1004,  1006 (1st  Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1990).  The facts  recited in the first appellate  opinion in\r\n\nthis  case also reveal that  McDowell carried $4000 cash, the\r\n\nexact  amount of the  delivery fee for  the drugs, separately\r\n\nfrom other  funds, and  that he repeatedly  communicated with\r\n\ncoconspirators by phone.  McDowell, 918 F.2d at 1006.  \r                                              \r\n\n     On the  surface, the  government's case  looks extremely\r\n\nstrong.   See United States v. One  Lot of U.S. Currency, 103\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d  1048, 1053-54  (1st  Cir. 1997)  (forfeiture proper  if\r\n\ngovernment  shows  probable  cause  to  believe  that  seized\r\n\nproperty  has a  sufficient  nexus to  illegal activity,  and\r\n\ndefendant fails to rebut);  United States v. One Lot  of U.S.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nCurrency,  927 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1991) (probable cause to\r                    \r\n\nbelieve  that cash and car were forfeitable where cash amount\r\n\nequaled the  promised purchase  price in a  sting transaction\r\n\nand the defendant drove the car to the airport meeting place,\r\n\napparently  planning to  use  it to  transport the  purchased\r\n\ndrugs).   Nothing in the  defendant's papers explains  how he\r\n\nexpects to avoid forfeiture, even if the prior administrative\r\n\nproceedings were procedurally defective.  \r\n\n     Nevertheless,  this is only  our own reconstruction; the\r\n\ngovernment has not made, and the  defendant has not answered,\r\n\nsuch  a  claim; and  there is  no  reason why  the government\r\n\nshould  not  turn square  corners  even  if it  is  defending\r\n\nagainst a  dubious collateral attack on a  forfeiture.  Here,\r\n\nthe record contains no response to the defendant's allegation\r\n\nthat he had not received adequate notice, which in some cases\r\n\nmight  negate a  forfeiture's validity,  Giraldo, 45  F.3d at\r                                                            \r\n\n512,  and the  government did  not attempt  to show  that the\r\n\nproperty was  plainly forfeitable,  giving  the defendant  an\r\n\nopportunity to answer.\r\n\n     There  is some conflict  in the law  as to  who needs to\r\n\nshow  what  when the  defendant makes  a  claim like  the one\r\n\nbefore us.\r\n\nCompare United  States v. Deninno,  103 F.3d 82,  85-86 (10th\r                                             \r\n\nCir. 1996)  with Boero  v. DEA,  111 F.3d 301,  306 (2d  Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1997).  We see no reason to lay down any general rule.  But\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nin the present case we think that an adequate answer needs to\r\n\nbe   provided  by   the  government--whether   procedural  or\r\n\nsubstantive--before  defendant's  motion  may   be  summarily\r\n\ndenied.\r\n\n     2.   As   to  McDowell's   further  allegation   that  a\r\n\nbriefcase containing documents  was improperly forfeited, the\r\n\ngovernment  says that it has no record  of such an item.  But\r\n\nit  points to no inventory list or similar evidence; nor does\r\n\nit provide  any other explanation for  the divergence between\r\n\nthe defendant's  version of  the events and  the government's\r\n\nrecords.  \r\n\n     The  government  may  have an  excellent  laches defense\r\n\nsince  the defendant waited eight years to file a motion that\r\n\ncould have been made promptly;  this delay might help explain\r\n\nthe  gaps in the government's evidence.   Cf. Angel-Torres v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  States, 712 F.2d 717,  719-20 (1st Cir. 1983) (motion\r                          \r\n\nfor  return of  property  subject to  equitable  principles).\r\n\nHowever, as  the government did  not assert laches  below and\r\n\nthe district court made  no relevant findings, we  decline to\r\n\naffirm the denial of the motion with respect to the briefcase\r\n\non that ground.\r\n\n     3.   The government belatedly  says on  appeal that  the\r\n\ndefendant brought  his claim in  the wrong court.   We do not\r\n\nthink that this minimally briefed case is a vehicle for us to\r\n\ndetermine  where  a  post-conviction  motion  for  return  of\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nproperty  should  be made  if  the property  seizure  and the\r\n\nrelated criminal  trial  occurred in  different  districts--a\r\n\nquestion on  which other  circuits disagree.   Compare United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

While  the district  court\r\n\nis free to hear  the government's argument on this  point, it\r\n\nmay be simpler to assume jurisdiction arguendo, assuming that\r                                                          \r\n\nthe  government  has  an adequate  substantive  or procedural\r\n\nanswer  to defendant's  claim.    In  any event,  we  decline\r\n\nourselves to affirm  the dismissal based on  a venue argument\r\n\nnever presented to the district court.\r\n\n     The district court's judgment  is vacated and the matter\r                                                          \r\n\nremanded   for  further  proceedings   consistent  with  this\r                    \r\n\nopinion.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                 \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n",

The parties\r\n\nrepeat  the  arguments  advanced below,  with  the government\r\n\nadding the contention that the district court in  Puerto Rico\r\n\nlacked jurisdiction to decide the motion because the property\r\n\nwas seized in Texas.\r\n\n     1.   With  respect  to  the  cell phone  and  cash,  the\r\n\ndefendant  appears  to  have an  almost  hopeless  case.   He\r\n\nconcedes  that the seizure occurred at the time of the arrest\r\n\nthat  led to  his  conviction, as  he  attempted to  open  an\r\n\nairport  locker  which he  thought  contained  cocaine.

Nothing in the  defendant's papers explains  how he\r\n\nexpects to avoid forfeiture, even if the prior administrative\r\n\nproceedings were procedurally defective.  \r\n\n     Nevertheless,  this is only  our own reconstruction; the\r\n\ngovernment has not made, and the  defendant has not answered,\r\n\nsuch  a  claim; and  there is  no  reason why  the government\r\n\nshould  not  turn square  corners  even  if it  is  defending\r\n\nagainst a  dubious collateral attack on a  forfeiture.

As   to  McDowell's   further  allegation   that  a\r\n\nbriefcase containing documents  was improperly forfeited, the\r\n\ngovernment  says that it has no record  of such an item.  But\r\n\nit  points to no inventory list or similar evidence; nor does\r\n\nit provide  any other explanation for  the divergence between\r\n\nthe defendant's  version of  the events and  the government's\r\n\nrecords.  \r\n\n     The  government  may  have an  excellent  laches defense\r\n\nsince  the defendant waited eight years to file a motion that\r\n\ncould have been made promptly;  this delay might help explain\r\n\nthe  gaps in the government's evidence.
