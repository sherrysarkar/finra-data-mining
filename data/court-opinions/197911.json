Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Sangita Rao, Attorney, Department of Justice, with whom\r\nGuillermo Gil, U.S. Attorney, and Louis M. Fischer, Attorney,\r\nDepartment of Justice, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n   Francisco J. Rivera-Alvarez for appellant.\r\n\nApril 22, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Tennessee Morales-Morales was convicted\r\nafter a jury trial on four counts: conspiring to possess cocaine\r\nwith intent to distribute, attempted possession of cocaine with\r\nintent to distribute, using a communication facility in committing\r\na drug offense, and criminal forfeiture.  For his crimes, Morales\r\nwas sentenced to 215 months of imprisonment and other penalties. \r\nMorales was caught by a \"reverse sting\" operation in which federal\r\nagents posed as drug sellers.  Morales had attempted to purchase\r\nthirty kilograms of cocaine from the agents.\r\nMorales alleges that four errors contaminated his trial;\r\nnone of these claims warrants extended discussion.  He also\r\nchallenges his sentence.  We affirm Morales' conviction and\r\nsentence.\r\nThe evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\njury's verdict, see United States v. Alicea-Cardoza, 132 F.3d 1, 3\r\n(1st Cir. 1997), is more than sufficient to sustain Morales'\r\nconviction.  The drug sale involved protracted negotiations over\r\nseveral days.  These negotiations were tape recorded.  Morales used\r\nan intermediary to conduct the initial negotiations with the agents,\r\nand a fourth man retrieved the cash necessary to purchase the drugs. \r\nMorales was guarded by two men carrying firearms during the drug\r\nsale, one of whom pled guilty and testified against Morales.  In\r\naddition to the federal agents participating in the sale, other\r\nagents monitored the transaction from a distance.  During the\r\nreverse sting drug sale, Morales told a federal agent that he was\r\ninvolved in smuggling drugs from Puerto Rico to New York and\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n1.  We treat Morales' first two arguments together.  Morales\r\nargues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the\r\nstatements of a co-conspirator and the two firearms carried by the\r\nmen guarding Morales.  We review the trial court's evidentiary\r\nrulings for abuse of discretion, and will treat a non-constitutional\r\nerror as harmless \"if it is highly probable that the error did not\r\ncontribute to the verdict.\"  United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408,\r\n1414 (1st Cir. 1997).  Neither evidentiary ruling was erroneous. \r\nThe evidence shows that a conspiracy existed embracing both the\r\ndeclarant and the defendant and that the co-conspirator's statements\r\nwere made during the course of the conspiracy and in furtherance of\r\nthe conspiracy.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180\r\n(1st Cir. 1993).  As to the firearms, the district court was careful\r\nto caution the jury that Morales was not charged with weapons\r\npossession, and that the firearms were to be considered for the\r\nlimited purpose of determining whether Morales was receiving armed\r\nprotection, and to aid the jury's determination of the armed guard's\r\ncredibility.\r\n2.  Morales' claim that the district court's mid-trial\r\nrevocation of his bail prejudiced him amounts to pure speculation. \r\nAfter his bond was revoked, Morales was accompanied by two marshals\r\nin the courtroom, but he remained dressed in ordinary clothing. \r\nMorales does not offer any evidence that the jury was aware that his\r\nbond had been revoked.\r\n3.  Morales' claim that he was denied his right to compulsory\r\nprocess is also without merit.  A violation of the compulsory\r\nprocess clause can be established only on a showing that the missing\r\nwitness's testimony would have been relevant, material, and\r\nfavorable.  See United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858,\r\n867, 872 (1982); United States v. Mount, 896 F.2d 612, 621 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).  \"Indeed, the Sixth Amendment does not by its terms grant to\r\na criminal defendant the right to secure the attendance and\r\ntestimony of any and all witnesses: it guarantees him 'compulsory\r\nprocess for obtaining witnesses in his favor.'\" Valenzuela-Bernal,\r\n458 U.S. at 867 (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI).  \r\nFirst, there is likely a procedural default.  Morales,\r\nwho was on notice the afternoon before he sought the witness (a DEA\r\nagent), never subpoenaed the witness and expressly waived a\r\ncontinuance of the trial to give him time to obtain the witness.\r\nSecond, on the merits, Morales has not shown that the\r\nwitness's testimony would be relevant, material, and favorable.  The\r\nwitness could have at most clarified a minor point concerning the\r\narmed guard's interrogation after the guard's arrest, and would have\r\nadded little to the jury's assessment of the armed guard's\r\ncredibility.\r\n4.  Finally, we determine that the court did not err in\r\nadjusting Morales' offense level upward by three levels under\r\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.1 because Morales was a \"manager or supervisor\" in\r\na criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was\r\notherwise extensive.  Section 3B1.1 requires \"evidence that a\r\ndefendant, in committing the crime, exercised control over, or was\r\notherwise responsible for overseeing the activities of, at least one\r\nother person.\"  United States v. Voccola, 99 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir.\r\n1996) (quotation marks omitted).  But the defendant need not be the\r\nleader of the scheme to receive this enhancement.  See United Statesv. Goldberg, 105 F.3d 770, 777 (1st Cir. 1997).  The criminal\r\nactivity for which Morales was convicted clearly involved five\r\npeople: Morales; the intermediary; the two armed guards; and the man\r\nwho retrieved the money to buy the drugs.  The evidence, summarized\r\nin the sentencing transcript, amply supports the conclusion of the\r\nexperienced trial judge that Morales supervised the activities of\r\nthese other participants.\r\nNor do we find any error in the district court's drug\r\nquantity calculation.  Morales negotiated a purchase of two fifteen\r\nkilogram units of cocaine.  The agreed price for the sale of thirty\r\nkilos was $10,000 per kilo.  Morales and his confederates had\r\nbrought approximately $190,000 in cash to the drug buy, more than\r\nenough to purchase the fifteen kilos attributed to Morales.\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
