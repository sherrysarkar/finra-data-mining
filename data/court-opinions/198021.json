Upon review of all documents in the record\r\n(not just those before the administrative tribunal), assuming\r\narguendo that our review of this matter is de novo, and assuming\r\narguendo that plaintiff-appellant Walter K. Grant's construction of\r\nthe phrase \"other regular gainful occupation\" (as used in the\r\nbenefits plan at issue) is the correct one, we affirm the judgment\r\nof the district court on the ground that there is insufficient\r\nevidence, indeed no evidence, upon which a rational factfinder\r\ncould conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that Grant was\r\n\"totally disabled . . . from engaging in . . . any . . . regular\r\ngainful occupation\" as of the date of his termination.  The July\r\n24, 1991 letter from Dr. Oliver upon which Grant so heavily relies\r\ntends to establish only that Grant could not, as of that point in\r\ntime, return to his then \"current work environment.\"  \r\nIn affirming the lower court's judgment, we regard as\r\nwaived Grant's breach of fiduciary duty claim.  But even if Grant\r\nhad not waived this claim, the relief sought thereunder is\r\nprecluded by Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134\r\n(1985).\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.\n",
