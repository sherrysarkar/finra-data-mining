Morris E. Lasker, Senior District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Mitchell Swartz on brief pro se.\r\n Loretta C. Argrett, Assistant Attorney General, Ann M. Durneyand John A. Nolet, Attorneys, Tax Division, Department of Justice,\r\non brief for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 22, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Having carefully reviewed the record in\r\nthis case, including the briefs of the parties and the decision\r\nof the district court, we affirm the dismissal of all\r\nappellant's claims.  We add only the following.\r\n          26 U.S.C.  6402(f) specifically bars any federal\r\ncourt from hearing appellant's claim that the IRS erred in\r\ntransferring his tax refund to California authorities for\r\nallegedly past due child support payments.  This jurisdictional\r\nbar rests on the recognition that \"the IRS does not have the\r\ninformation and resources needed to adjudicate the validity of\r\nthe alleged child support arrearage.\"  Satorius v. IRS, 671 F.\r\nSupp. 592, 594 (E.D. Wis. 1987).  The duty of the IRS in this\r\nmatter is simply ministerial.  It \"do[es] no more than retain\r\nand transfer an amount certified by the State agency. [It]\r\nmake[s] no determinations of liability and ability to pay.\"  \r\nLarsen v. Larsen, 671 F. Supp. 718, 720 (D. Utah 1987), aff'd871 F.2d 1095 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 844 (1989). \r\n          Appellant's allegation that he has been the victim of\r\nIRS harassment in its attempt to collect taxes is without\r\nmerit. In order to collect damages \"in connection with the\r\ncollection of Federal tax,\" appellant must show that the IRS\r\nacted with recklessness or intentional disregard of a provision\r\nof the tax law. 26 U.S.C.  7433. The only examples of\r\nharassment alleged are a summons seeking information relating\r\nto appellant's 1990 and 1992 tax returns and a notice of intent\r\nto levy for unpaid liabilities for these years.  Appellant\r\nalleges that these actions are not good faith attempts to\r\nexamine his return or to collect taxes owed but retaliation for\r\nthe institution of his suit against the IRS.  Since the only\r\nsupport for the claim that these actions were not taken in good\r\nfaith is appellant's conclusory allegation of a retaliatory\r\nmotive, this claim was properly dismissed.  See Boddie v.\r\nSchneider, 105 F.3d 857, 862 (2d Cir. 1997) (complaint of\r\nretaliation which contains only speculative and conclusory\r\nallegations properly dismissed); Atkinson v. Bohn, 91 F.3d\r\n1127, 1129 (8th Cir. 1996) (same).\r\n          Since appellant fails to show that the government\r\ncould not possibly prevail on its claim that plaintiff has\r\nunpaid tax liabilities for the years 1990 and 1992, see Enochsv. Williams Packing &amp; Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7 (1962), his\r\nrequest for an injunction is barred by 26 U.S.C.  7421.  \r\n          His claim that he is owed a tax refund for these\r\nyears must also be dismissed, \"regardless of the suit's\r\npotential merit,\" because appellant has not met the\r\njurisdictional prerequisites of having fully paid his assessed\r\nliability and having filed a timely administrative claim with\r\nthe IRS.  United States v. Forma, 42 F.3d 759, 763-64 (2d Cir.\r\n1994).  None of the other claims raised by appellant has any\r\nmerit.\r\n          Finally, since appellant has not \"established a claim\r\nor right to relief,\" the district court did not err in setting\r\naside the default judgment which it had entered against the\r\ngovernment.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(e).\r\n          Appellant's motion for sanctions is denied.  His\r\nmotion for an injunction is denied as moot.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
