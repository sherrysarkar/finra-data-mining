Carlos Hernandez is a native\n\nand citizen of the Dominican Republic who entered the United\n\nStates    as   an   immigrant    in    1982.      In    1989,   Hernandez     was\n\nconvicted in state court of distributing cocaine.                    As a result,\n\nthe INS commenced deportation proceedings against Hernandez,\n\ncharging him with being removable under section 241 of the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1251\n\n(1988),    because    his   conviction       qualified     as   an    aggravated\n\nfelony, id. § 1251(a)(4)(B), and a narcotics violation, id. §\n\n1251(a)(11).        (U.S. Code references are to the 1994 edition\n\nunless otherwise indicated.)\n\n            In November 1989, Hernandez conceded deportability and\n\napplied for a waiver of deportation under INA section 212(c), 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1182(c).        At his hearing which commenced in August\n\n1990,    Hernandez    argued    that   his     family    ties   to    the   United\n\nStates, job history, and rehabilitation made him eligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief from deportation.                  The immigration judge\n\ndisagreed, denying Hernandez' request for waiver because the\n\n\"adverse factors in [his] case so greatly outweigh[ed] the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fsocial   and    human   considerations    presented.\"    Hernandez   was\n\nordered deported on September 4, 1992.1\n\n            Five days later, Hernandez' counsel filed a timely\n\nnotice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (the\n\n\"Board\").      The notice stated that a brief on the issues would be\n\nfiled separately, but Hernandez' counsel failed to submit one.\n\nAs a result, on October 28, 1993, the Board summarily dismissed\n\nthe appeal, stating that Hernandez had failed to \"meaningfully\n\nidentify the particular basis\" for his claim.              8 C.F.R. §\n\n3.1(d)(1-a)(i)(A) (1993).        Although under then-existing law\n\nHernandez had the option of appealing the Board's decision to\n\nthis court, no appeal was taken.         See   INA § 106(a), 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1105a(a), repealed by Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\n\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, §\n\n242, 110 Stat. 3009-546, -612 (1996) (codified at 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252 (Supp. II 1996)).\n\n            Why Hernandez did not pursue his remedies is unclear.\n\nHernandez had arguments to make to the Board but none, on our\n\npreliminary review, had great promise of success.           Hernandez'\n\nthen counsel has since said that he and Hernandez agreed that no\n\n\n    1There were three days of hearings conducted over the course\nof two years.    Much of the delay resulted from requests by\nHernandez' counsel for continuances and, in at least one\ninstance, because Hernandez failed to appear at a scheduled\nhearing.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcourt appeal from the Board's decision should be taken because\n\nit would be hopeless and that it was more useful for Hernandez\n\nto defer any clear-cut affirmance and in the meantime accumulate\n\n\"equities.\"    But it is doubtful that Hernandez would endorse\n\nthis   description   of   what    happened,   nor   is   it   certain    what\n\nHernandez was told at the time.\n\n           Nevertheless,    the     strategy--if    there     was   one--was\n\ninitially successful.       For reasons not explained to us, no\n\naction was taken against Hernandez for almost four years.               Then,\n\nin May 1997, the INS issued a so-called \"bag and baggage\" letter\n\nto Hernandez, which directed him to appear for deportation the\n\nfollowing month.      On the day of his scheduled deportation,\n\nHernandez hired a new attorney who immediately filed a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus in the district court, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and a\n\nmotion to reopen his case with the Board, 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(a) &\n\n(c) (2000); both pleadings claimed that Hernandez had been\n\ndenied due process in the deportation proceedings because of\n\nprior counsel's ineffectiveness.\n\n           Although unsure of its jurisdiction, the district court\n\nstayed Hernandez' deportation based on the \"facial seriousness\"\n\nof his due process claim.        Hernandez v. Reno, 63 F. Supp. 2d 99,\n\n100 (D. Mass. 1999).      At Hernandez' request, the district court\n\nalso stayed his habeas proceeding in light of then-pending\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\flitigation in which we proposed to consider, inter alia, whether\n\nnewly-passed legislation barred section 212(c) discretionary\n\nrelief for deportable criminals who had sought a waiver prior to\n\nthe new restrictions.           Thereafter, in Goncalves v. Reno, 144\n\nF.3d 110, 133 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1004\n\n(1999), we held that the new restrictions did not apply to such\n\npersons.\n\n             The   district   court    then   proceeded     with    Hernandez'\n\npetition but now found relief barred by an intervening decision\n\nby the Supreme Court, Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination\n\nComm., 525 U.S. 471, 482-87 (1999), construing section 242(g) of\n\nIIRIRA, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) (Supp. II 1996).                Hernandez, 63 F.\n\nSupp.   2d    at    103.   By    its    terms,    that    section    precludes\n\njurisdiction by any court, apart from direct court of appeals\n\nreview as authorized in that section, over claims:\n\n             by or on behalf of any alien arising from\n             the decision or action by the Attorney\n             General to commence proceedings, adjudicate\n             cases, or execute removal orders against any\n             alien under this chapter.\n\n             Read literally, this language could easily be taken to\n\nbar district court habeas jurisdiction insofar as the \"claim\"\n\nrelated to any one of the three described types of \"decision or\n\naction.\"      The    district    court   viewed     the   relief     sought    by\n\nHernandez     --effectively     requiring     the   Board    to     reopen    his\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fsection 212(c) waiver case--as interfering with the Attorney\n\nGeneral's decision to \"adjudicate\" cases.                         Hernandez, 63 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 103.               The court therefore dismissed Hernandez'\n\npetition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction but stayed its\n\norder   to    permit      an    appeal,       finding    the    issue    \"not      without\n\ndoubt.\"      Id.\n\n              Hernandez        now    appeals,      claiming that the district\n\ncourt's      reading      of     section       242(g)     and     American-Arab         is\n\ninconsistent with our later decision in Wallace v. Reno, 194\n\nF.3d 279, 285 (1st Cir. 1999).                The government responds that the\n\nhabeas petition was correctly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction\n\nfor two other reasons:                because former section 106(a) of the\n\nINA, 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a), made direct review the exclusive\n\navenue to review deportation orders, and in the alternative,\n\nbecause      Hernandez     has       failed    to   exhaust     his     administrative\n\nremedies,      id.   §    1105a(c).           The   government        also     says   that\n\nHernandez has failed to show either ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel      or    that    the       immigration        judge    erred       in   denying\n\ndiscretionary relief to Hernandez.\n\n              We are not persuaded by either the district court's or\n\nthe   government's         jurisdictional           objections.          The      district\n\ncourt's      reading of section 242(g) is not without force, but it\n\nwas rejected in Goncalves--based on an unwillingness to find an\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fimplied repeal of habeas corpus.                  Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 119-23.\n\nGoncalves was reaffirmed in Wallace--notwithstanding American-\n\nArab.   Wallace, 194 F.3d at 284-85.                Indeed, while American-Arab\n\nwas not concerned with habeas, its surprisingly narrow reading\n\nof section 242(g) indirectly reinforces Wallace and Goncalves.\n\nThe government itself agrees that                   American-Arab's reading of\n\nsection      242(g)       \"does    not     divest        the     district      court     of\n\njurisdiction.\"\n\n             The government relies instead on former section 106(a)\n\nof the INA.         That section, now repealed but still pertinent to\n\nHernandez' claim, see IIRIRA §§ 309(a) & (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1101\n\nnote (Supp. II 1996),              made court of appeals review the \"sole\n\nand exclusive procedure\" to review final orders of deportation.\n\nINA § 106(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a).                      But in the pertinent time\n\nframe, section 106 itself explicitly endorsed habeas corpus as\n\na remedy, id. § 1105a(a)(10), and even if this were not so, the\n\nlogic   of    Goncalves'      objection       to       implied    repeal    of    habeas\n\napplies      with    equal    force       where    an    asserted      constitutional\n\ndefault by counsel forfeits direct review.\n\n             In     the    alternative,          the     government      argues        that\n\nHernandez has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\n\nUnder     former      section      106(a)(c),           review    of   an      order     of\n\ndeportation       was     barred    if,    inter       alia,   \"the    alien     has    not\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fexhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of\n\nright . . . .\"       8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c).      The government appears to\n\nrely   both    on   Hernandez'    past   failure   to   utilize   available\n\nremedies and on his present pending motion to reopen.                 It is\n\nuseful to treat past and present remedies separately.\n\n              Starting with the past, at one time Hernandez did have\n\nat least two remedies as of right, namely, briefing a timely\n\nappeal to the Board and moving to reopen by September 30, 1996,\n\n8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(2) (2000).               Sometimes courts do talk of\n\n\"failure to exhaust\" past remedies that are no longer available,\n\nmeaning either that the party did not seek the agency remedy at\n\nall or did not make a particular argument.          E.g., Roman-Martinez\n\nv. Runyon, 100 F.3d 213, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).                     These are\n\nessentially arguments that a claim or contention has been waived\n\nor forfeited--which is quite different than saying that there is\n\nan existing agency remedy that should be invoked before turning\n\nto the courts.\n\n              However labeled, the government's objection based on\n\nnow-forgone remedies essentially overlaps, in this case, with\n\nthe \"merits.\"       Hernandez' central claim in the district court\n\nwas that counsel's failure seriously to pursue an appeal to the\n\nBoard, and his failure entirely to appeal to this court, created\n\na constitutional defect.         If this were so--and we will return to\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fthe merits shortly--it would be very odd to say that counsel's\n\nunconstitutional conduct created a waiver, forfeit, or failure\n\nto exhaust that prevented his client from ever litigating that\n\nissue.    The same is true of the failure to move to reopen within\n\nthe time limits.\n\n            This brings us back to the pending motion before the\n\nBoard.    This is not a remedy \"as of right\" under former section\n\n106(a)(6), because Hernandez' motion to reopen was filed long\n\nafter the time period for such motions.               8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(2)\n\n(2000).   But to the extent that the Board does provide currently\n\navailable remedies as a matter of grace, a court is free to\n\nrequire     exhaustion    of   such      remedies--not        because    of    any\n\njurisdictional objection or statutory command but simply because\n\nit makes sense.         See McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144\n\n(1992); Davis, Administrative Law § 15.2 (3d ed. 1994).\n\n            The Board, admirably in our view, has sought to cope\n\nwith the type of problem raised in this case by setting up a\n\nprocedure      for   respondents   to    seek   reopening      of   deportation\n\norders based on incompetence of counsel.              In re Lozada, 19 I. &\n\nN. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).            Recognizing that such claims are\n\neasily    made    and   compromise      finality,    the   Board's      criteria\n\nrequire   an     affidavit   describing     the     alleged    agreement      with\n\ncounsel, notice to counsel (who can respond), and a statement\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwhether the alleged default by counsel has been reported to\n\nstate authorities and, if so, with what result (and if not, why\n\nnot).    Id.\n\n           In the ordinary case, we agree that the respondent must\n\nuse the Board's own procedures to resolve his competency of\n\ncounsel claims.    Absent a threat of immediate deportation, a\n\ndistrict court should in general decline to entertain a habeas\n\npetition challenging competency of counsel.        See Bernal-Vallejo\n\nv. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1999).     Even if such a threat\n\nimpends, the respondent still ought to show good cause why he\n\nhas not previously sought a discretionary stay of deportation,\n\nas well as reopening, from the Board.      However, unless rigidly\n\nprescribed by statute, exhaustion may be excused where there is\n\nreason to do so.   See Sousa v. INS, 226 F.3d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           Here,   Hernandez   is     threatened     with   immediate\n\ndeportation and his petition to reopen has been pending with the\n\nBoard for well over three years.      Cf. Dabone v. Karn, 763 F.2d\n\n593, 597 n.2 (3d Cir. 1985) (holding that the Board's \"failure\n\nto act within a reasonable period\" on a motion to reopen may be\n\ntreated as an \"effective denial\").      Under these circumstances,\n\nto await further action by the Board would, on the one hand,\n\nfrustrate Congress' plain intent to expedite deportation of\n\n\n                               -10-\n\faggravated felons, see IIRIRA § 304(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1229(d)(1)\n\n(Supp. II 1996), and, on the other, risk deporting Hernandez\n\nwithout giving him an opportunity to make his constitutional\n\nobjection in court.        We therefore turn to the merits of the due\n\nprocess claim.\n\n          There     is   no   Sixth     Amendment      right    to   counsel   in\n\ndeportation, which is a civil proceeding, but several courts of\n\nappeals (including this one) have said that where counsel does\n\nappear for the respondent, incompetence in some situations may\n\nmake the proceeding        fundamentally unfair and give rise to a\n\nFifth Amendment due process objection.                Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d\n\n10, 13 (1st Cir. 1988).          We have said that a process becomes\n\nfundamentally     unfair      when    \"the    alien    [is]     prevented   from\n\nreasonably presenting his case.\"              Id.\n\n          There is one threshold issue.               Hernandez has never had\n\na legal defense to deportation.              He does not say that he is not\n\nan alien or that he was wrongly convicted of a deportable crime.\n\nRather, all that stands between him and deportation is his\n\nrequest for a section 212(c) discretionary waiver, based on the\n\nAttorney General's weighing of equities.               It is this request for\n\na   discretionary    waiver      that    Hernandez       says    his   attorney\n\nmishandled.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f           The Eleventh Circuit has taken the view that waiver\n\nrelief is so speculative and so much a matter of grace that \"an\n\nattorney's deficient representation does not deprive an alien of\n\ndue process if the deficient representation merely prevents the\n\nalien from being eligible for suspension of deportation.\"   Mejia\n\nRodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1148 (11th Cir. 1999), cert.\n\ndenied, 121 S. Ct. 563 (2000).        Yet waivers are granted or\n\nwithheld according to largely fixed criteria, Yepes-Prado v.\n\nINS, 10 F.3d 1363, 1365-66 (9th Cir. 1993), and have an enormous\n\npractical impact.    We think it best to treat the speculative and\n\ndiscretionary character of waivers not as an absolute bar but as\n\nbearing on the likelihood that counsel's conduct affected the\n\noutcome.\n\n           Turning then to the due process claim itself, Hernandez\n\ndid have a fair opportunity to present his waiver case to the\n\nimmigration judge.    There was a hearing, substantial testimony,\n\nand a reasoned decision.   Hernandez says that his attorney erred\n\nduring the proceedings, but these are garden-variety claims that\n\ncounsel should have handled matters somewhat differently and in\n\nthis context do not even approach a showing that Hernandez has\n\nbeen deprived of a constitutionally adequate opportunity to make\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fhis case.2   Thus, everything turns on the claim that counsel's\n\nfailure to brief the appeal to the Board and seek review in this\n\ncourt comprised such a deprivation.\n\n           Both steps may have been strategic--Hernandez' counsel\n\nso claims explicitly as to judicial review--but we will assume\n\narguendo   that   attorney   negligence           is   involved.    Even   in   a\n\ncriminal     proceeding,        attorney           negligence      creates      a\n\nconstitutional    flaw   only    if    it    is    extreme   and   there   is   a\n\n\"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n\nStrickland v.

We have reviewed the immigration judge's\n\ndecision and cannot find any such \"reasonable probability\" that\n\nthe result would have been different if counsel had carried\n\nthrough with an appeal to the Board or to this court.\n\n           To support his contrary claim, Hernandez points to two\n\nequitable considerations that he argues would have led to the\n\ngrant of a waiver by the Board.             Hernandez says that the extent\n\n\n    2 Hernandez also points to errors made by the immigration\njudge concerning the length of time Hernandez' children were\nreceiving welfare support, Hernandez' rehabilitation, and\npermitting Hernandez' wife to testify.     Even accepting these\nclaims as true (and there is a serious question whether they\nare), such \"mistakes\" fall far short of a denial of due process.\nSee Toscano-Gil v. Trominski, 210 F.3d 470, 474 (5th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                      -13-\n\fof his family ties in the United States are an \"unusual and\n\noutstanding equity\" and that his \"genuine rehabilitation\" also\n\nweighed in favor of a waiver.            As to the first, Hernandez argues\n\nthat he has sixty-five \"close\" family members who are either\n\nU.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.                  As evidence of the\n\nsecond, Hernandez points to his limited criminal history (one\n\nconviction),     steady       employment,    community        involvement,     and\n\nremoval of his family from welfare support.\n\n             Having    been    convicted    of   a    serious    drug   offense,\n\nHernandez     needed     to    demonstrate       \"unusual       or   outstanding\n\ncountervailing equities.\"           Hazzard v. INS, 951 F.2d 435, 438\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).         The numerous relatives that Hernandez now\n\ncites   as    equities    are     more    distant      than    those    that   the\n\nimmigration judge did consider (his children, wife, mother, and\n\nsisters).      It is difficult to see why consideration of such\n\nattenuated relationships should alter the equitable balance.                    As\n\nfor rehabilitation, Hernandez' seems only to have seriously\n\nbegun after deportation proceedings originally commenced in\n\n1990.\n\n             Conversely, there is at least some evidence of other,\n\nless admirable behavior by Hernandez.                This led the immigration\n\njudge to say that even accepting that Hernandez had established\n\nunusual or outstanding equities, he still believed that a waiver\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fwould not be justified.         In all events, we can identify nothing\n\nin Hernandez' case that leads us to believe that there is a\n\n\"reasonable probability\" that the result of the proceedings\n\nwould have been different had an appeal been perfected.\n\n              Were this a criminal case, counsel's failure to comply\n\nwith    a    defendant's     request   to     appeal       would   be   treated   as\n\nprejudice per se.       Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 120 S. Ct. 1029, 1038-\n\n39 (2000).      But we are unwilling, unless directed to do so, to\n\nincorporate      into   civil     deportation            proceedings    the   whole\n\napparatus of Sixth Amendment precedent.                    But see Dearinger ex\n\nrel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\nOur concern in the immigration context is not with the Sixth\n\nAmendment but with preserving a fair opportunity to have a\n\nwaiver claim considered; it does not include an opportunity to\n\ntie    up    deportation     proceedings      in    knots    through    collateral\n\nattacks on defects that would not plausibly have altered the\n\nresult.\n\n              Whether or not Hernandez' counsel engaged in strategic\n\nbehavior in this case, the threat is a very real one.                              A\n\nconvicted criminal sits in jail while his habeas petition is\n\npending; someone threatened with deportation but at large has\n\nevery       incentive   to    string    out        the    deportation     process,\n\nespecially after an initial adverse decision by the immigration\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fjudge makes prospects of getting a waiver dim.              Sixth Amendment\n\nprecedent is worth consulting where counsel's performance is\n\nattacked in a deportation proceeding, but it is not binding and\n\nshould not be blindly imported wholesale.\n\n            There is an alternative reason in this case why the due\n\nprocess claim should fail even if we extended the prejudice per\n\nse notion from criminal convictions to review of waiver denials\n\nin deportations.      On September 4, 1992, the immigration judge\n\ndenied Hernandez' request for waiver (Hernandez having conceded\n\ndeportability in 1989).        Hernandez does not deny that he knew of\n\nthat decision; on the contrary, he says--in a very cursory\n\naffidavit--that      his   then      counsel   assured    him   that   he    had\n\nappealed and would continue to pursue all avenues; after that,\n\nthe affidavit indicates, Hernandez knew little more about what\n\nhappened.      At most, it appears that Hernandez had a cursory\n\nconversation with his lawyer in 1995.\n\n            It is hard to stomach the idea that Hernandez could sit\n\non his hands for almost five years and then say that he was\n\nunconstitutionally denied an opportunity to pursue an appeal\n\nfrom the denial of waiver.            Knowing that he had been denied a\n\nwaiver   and   was   subject    to    deportation,   it    would   seem     that\n\nHernandez had some duty--as a condition of a successful due\n\nprocess claim--to monitor his lawyer's actions and assure that\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fhis appeal was being pursued.         Cf. Leblanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685,\n\n694 (1st Cir. 1983).          So far as his affidavit reveals, he did\n\nnothing whatever after 1995 when he says that his then lawyer\n\ntold him that there was \"no word on the appeal.\"\n\n              Only in 1997, five years after the original denial of\n\nwaiver (and on the day he was faced with a bag and baggage\n\nletter order) did Hernandez claim on collateral attack that all\n\nthis time he has been denied an opportunity to appeal.                 What he\n\nnow wants is a judicial stay pending his petition to the Board\n\nto reopen or a judicial determination providing him with a new\n\nopportunity to appeal to the Board.          This is not due process but\n\noverkill of the kind that has led Congress increasingly to limit\n\njudicial review and to abolish waivers even for those who may\n\nfully deserve them.\n\n              Nothing in this opinion should be read as altering the\n\nstatus of Hernandez' pending motion to reopen.               Although we can\n\nidentify      no    due   process   violation   in   Hernandez'        original\n\nproceedings, it is within the Board's power to reopen Hernandez'\n\ncase,   and    to    stay   deportation   pending    its    decision    on   the\n\nmotion, if it thinks that the circumstances so warrant.                      We\n\nexpress no opinion as to these matters.\n\n              The district court's decision is             affirmed and this\n\ncourt's September 9, 1999, stay of deportation is vacated.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

In 1989, Hernandez was convicted in state court of distributing cocaine. As a result, the INS commenced deportation proceedings against Hernandez, charging him with being removable under section 241 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251 (1988), because his conviction qualified as an aggravated felony, id. &#167; 1251(a)(4)(B), and a narcotics violation, id. &#167; 1251(a)(11). (U.S. Code references are to the 1994 edition unless otherwise indicated.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, Hernandez conceded deportability and applied for a waiver of deportation under INA section 212(c), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c). At his hearing which commenced in August 1990, Hernandez argued that his family ties to the United States, job history, and rehabilitation made him eligible for discretionary relief from deportation. The immigration judge disagreed, denying Hernandez' request for waiver because the \"adverse factors in [his] case so greatly outweigh[ed] the social and human considerations presented.\" Hernandez was ordered deported on September 4, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days later, Hernandez' counsel filed a timely notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"Board\"). The notice stated that a brief on the issues would be filed separately, but Hernandez' counsel failed to submit one. As a result, on October 28, 1993, the Board summarily dismissed the appeal, stating that Hernandez had failed to \"meaningfully identify the particular basis\" for his claim. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.1(d)(1-a)(i)(A) (1993). Although under then-existing law Hernandez had the option of appealing the Board's decision to this court, no appeal was taken. See INA &#167; 106(a), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a), repealed by Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, &#167; 242, 110 Stat. 3009-546, -612 (1996) (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252 (Supp. II 1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why Hernandez did not pursue his remedies is unclear. Hernandez had arguments to make to the Board but none, on our preliminary review, had great promise of success. Hernandez' then counsel has since said that he and Hernandez agreed that no court appeal from the Board's decision should be taken because it would be hopeless and that it was more useful for Hernandez to defer any clear-cut affirmance and in the meantime accumulate \"equities.\" But it is doubtful that Hernandez would endorse this description of what happened, nor is it certain what Hernandez was told at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the strategy--if there was one--was initially successful. For reasons not explained to us, no action was taken against Hernandez for almost four years. Then, in May 1997, the INS issued a so-called \"bag and baggage\" letter to Hernandez, which directed him to appear for deportation the following month. On the day of his scheduled deportation, Hernandez hired a new attorney who immediately filed a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241, and a motion to reopen his case with the Board, 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 3.2(a) &amp; (c) (2000); both pleadings claimed that Hernandez had been denied due process in the deportation proceedings because of prior counsel's ineffectiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unsure of its jurisdiction, the district court stayed Hernandez' deportation based on the \"facial seriousness\" of his due process claim. Hernandez v. Reno, 63 F. Supp. 2d 99, 100 (D. Mass. 1999). At Hernandez' request, the district court also stayed his habeas proceeding in light of then-pending litigation in which we proposed to consider, inter alia, whether newly-passed legislation barred section 212(c) discretionary relief for deportable criminals who had sought a waiver prior to the new restrictions. Thereafter, in Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 133 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1004 (1999), we held that the new restrictions did not apply to such persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then proceeded with Hernandez' petition but now found relief barred by an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482-87 (1999), construing section 242(g) of IIRIRA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g) (Supp. II 1996). Hernandez, 63 F. Supp. 2d at 103. By its terms, that section precludes jurisdiction by any court, apart from direct court of appeals review as authorized in that section, over claims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read literally, this language could easily be taken to bar district court habeas jurisdiction insofar as the \"claim\" related to any one of the three described types of \"decision or action.\" The district court viewed the relief sought by Hernandez --effectively requiring the Board to reopen his section 212(c) waiver case--as interfering with the Attorney General's decision to \"adjudicate\" cases. Hernandez, 63 F. Supp. 2d at 103. The court therefore dismissed Hernandez' petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction but stayed its order to permit an appeal, finding the issue \"not without doubt.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez now appeals, claiming that the district court's reading of section 242(g) and American-Arab is inconsistent with our later decision in Wallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 285 (1st Cir. 1999). The government responds that the habeas petition was correctly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction for two other reasons: because former section 106(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a), made direct review the exclusive avenue to review deportation orders, and in the alternative, because Hernandez has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, id. &#167; 1105a(c). The government also says that Hernandez has failed to show either ineffective assistance of counsel or that the immigration judge erred in denying discretionary relief to Hernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded by either the district court's or the government's jurisdictional objections. The district court's reading of section 242(g) is not without force, but it was rejected in Goncalves--based on an unwillingness to find an implied repeal of habeas corpus. Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 119-23. Goncalves was reaffirmed in Wallace--notwithstanding American-Arab. Wallace, 194 F.3d at 284-85. Indeed, while American-Arab was not concerned with habeas, its surprisingly narrow reading of section 242(g) indirectly reinforces Wallace and Goncalves. The government itself agrees that American-Arab's reading of section 242(g) \"does not divest the district court of jurisdiction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relies instead on former section 106(a) of the INA. That section, now repealed but still pertinent to Hernandez' claim, see IIRIRA &#167;&#167; 309(a) &amp; (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 note (Supp. II 1996), made court of appeals review the \"sole and exclusive procedure\" to review final orders of deportation. INA &#167; 106(a), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a). But in the pertinent time frame, section 106 itself explicitly endorsed habeas corpus as a remedy, id. &#167; 1105a(a)(10), and even if this were not so, the logic of Goncalves' objection to implied repeal of habeas applies with equal force where an asserted constitutional default by counsel forfeits direct review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the government argues that Hernandez has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Under former section 106(a)(c), review of an order of deportation was barred if, inter alia, \"the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right . . . .\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(c). The government appears to rely both on Hernandez' past failure to utilize available remedies and on his present pending motion to reopen. It is useful to treat past and present remedies separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the past, at one time Hernandez did have at least two remedies as of right, namely, briefing a timely appeal to the Board and moving to reopen by September 30, 1996, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(c)(2) (2000). Sometimes courts do talk of \"failure to exhaust\" past remedies that are no longer available, meaning either that the party did not seek the agency remedy at all or did not make a particular argument. E.g., Roman-Martinez v. Runyon, 100 F.3d 213, 220 (1st Cir. 1996). These are essentially arguments that a claim or contention has been waived or forfeited--which is quite different than saying that there is an existing agency remedy that should be invoked before turning to the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However labeled, the government's objection based on now-forgone remedies essentially overlaps, in this case, with the \"merits.\" Hernandez' central claim in the district court was that counsel's failure seriously to pursue an appeal to the Board, and his failure entirely to appeal to this court, created a constitutional defect. If this were so--and we will return to the merits shortly--it would be very odd to say that counsel's unconstitutional conduct created a waiver, forfeit, or failure to exhaust that prevented his client from ever litigating that issue. The same is true of the failure to move to reopen within the time limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us back to the pending motion before the Board. This is not a remedy \"as of right\" under former section 106(a)(6), because Hernandez' motion to reopen was filed long after the time period for such motions. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(c)(2) (2000). But to the extent that the Board does provide currently available remedies as a matter of grace, a court is free to require exhaustion of such remedies--not because of any jurisdictional objection or statutory command but simply because it makes sense. See McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144 (1992); Davis, Administrative Law &#167; 15.2 (3d ed. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board, admirably in our view, has sought to cope with the type of problem raised in this case by setting up a procedure for respondents to seek reopening of deportation orders based on incompetence of counsel. In re Lozada, 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Recognizing that such claims are easily made and compromise finality, the Board's criteria require an affidavit describing the alleged agreement with counsel, notice to counsel (who can respond), and a statement whether the alleged default by counsel has been reported to state authorities and, if so, with what result (and if not, why not). Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinary case, we agree that the respondent must use the Board's own procedures to resolve his competency of counsel claims. Absent a threat of immediate deportation, a district court should in general decline to entertain a habeas petition challenging competency of counsel. See Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1999). Even if such a threat impends, the respondent still ought to show good cause why he has not previously sought a discretionary stay of deportation, as well as reopening, from the Board. However, unless rigidly prescribed by statute, exhaustion may be excused where there is reason to do so. See Sousa v. INS, 226 F.3d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Hernandez is threatened with immediate deportation and his petition to reopen has been pending with the Board for well over three years. Cf. Dabone v. Karn, 763 F.2d 593, 597 n.2 (3d Cir. 1985) (holding that the Board's \"failure to act within a reasonable period\" on a motion to reopen may be treated as an \"effective denial\"). Under these circumstances, to await further action by the Board would, on the one hand, frustrate Congress' plain intent to expedite deportation of aggravated felons, see IIRIRA &#167; 304(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229(d)(1) (Supp. II 1996), and, on the other, risk deporting Hernandez without giving him an opportunity to make his constitutional objection in court. We therefore turn to the merits of the due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in deportation, which is a civil proceeding, but several courts of appeals (including this one) have said that where counsel does appear for the respondent, incompetence in some situations may make the proceeding fundamentally unfair and give rise to a Fifth Amendment due process objection. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1988). We have said that a process becomes fundamentally unfair when \"the alien [is] prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one threshold issue. Hernandez has never had a legal defense to deportation. He does not say that he is not an alien or that he was wrongly convicted of a deportable crime. Rather, all that stands between him and deportation is his request for a section 212(c) discretionary waiver, based on the Attorney General's weighing of equities. It is this request for a discretionary waiver that Hernandez says his attorney mishandled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit has taken the view that waiver relief is so speculative and so much a matter of grace that \"an attorney's deficient representation does not deprive an alien of due process if the deficient representation merely prevents the alien from being eligible for suspension of deportation.\" Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1148 (11th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 121 S.Ct. 563(2000). Yet waivers are granted or withheld according to largely fixed criteria, Yepes-Prado v. INS, 10 F.3d 1363, 1365-66 (9th Cir. 1993), and have an enormous practical impact. We think it best to treat the speculative and discretionary character of waivers not as an absolute bar but as bearing on the likelihood that counsel's conduct affected the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the due process claim itself, Hernandez did have a fair opportunity to present his waiver case to the immigration judge. There was a hearing, substantial testimony, and a reasoned decision. Hernandez says that his attorney erred during the proceedings, but these are garden-variety claims that counsel should have handled matters somewhat differently and in this context do not even approach a showing that Hernandez has been deprived of a constitutionally adequate opportunity to make his case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, everything turns on the claim that counsel's failure to brief the appeal to the Board and seek review in this court comprised such a deprivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both steps may have been strategic--Hernandez' counsel so claims explicitly as to judicial review--but we will assume arguendo that attorney negligence is involved. Even in a criminal proceeding, attorney negligence creates a constitutional flaw only if it is extreme and there is a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1983); Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 49 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1129 (2000). We have reviewed the immigration judge's decision and cannot find any such \"reasonable probability\" that the result would have been different if counsel had carried through with an appeal to the Board or to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his contrary claim, Hernandez points to two equitable considerations that he argues would have led to the grant of a waiver by the Board. Hernandez says that the extent of his family ties in the United States are an \"unusual and outstanding equity\" and that his \"genuine rehabilitation\" also weighed in favor of a waiver. As to the first, Hernandez argues that he has sixty-five \"close\" family members who are either U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. As evidence of the second, Hernandez points to his limited criminal history (one conviction), steady employment, community involvement, and removal of his family from welfare support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having been convicted of a serious drug offense, Hernandez needed to demonstrate \"unusual or outstanding countervailing equities.\" Hazzard v. INS, 951 F.2d 435, 438 (1st Cir. 1991). The numerous relatives that Hernandez now cites as equities are more distant than those that the immigration judge did consider (his children, wife, mother, and sisters). It is difficult to see why consideration of such attenuated relationships should alter the equitable balance. As for rehabilitation, Hernandez' seems only to have seriously begun after deportation proceedings originally commenced in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, there is at least some evidence of other, less admirable behavior by Hernandez. This led the immigration judge to say that even accepting that Hernandez had established unusual or outstanding equities, he still believed that a waiver would not be justified. In all events, we can identify nothing in Hernandez' case that leads us to believe that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the result of the proceedings would have been different had an appeal been perfected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were this a criminal case, counsel's failure to comply with a defendant's request to appeal would be treated as prejudice per se. Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 120 S. Ct. 1029, 1038-39 (2000). But we are unwilling, unless directed to do so, to incorporate into civil deportation proceedings the whole apparatus of Sixth Amendment precedent. But see Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (9th Cir. 2000). Our concern in the immigration context is not with the Sixth Amendment but with preserving a fair opportunity to have a waiver claim considered; it does not include an opportunity to tie up deportation proceedings in knots through collateral attacks on defects that would not plausibly have altered the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not Hernandez' counsel engaged in strategic behavior in this case, the threat is a very real one. A convicted criminal sits in jail while his habeas petition is pending; someone threatened with deportation but at large has every incentive to string out the deportation process, especially after an initial adverse decision by the immigration judge makes prospects of getting a waiver dim. Sixth Amendment precedent is worth consulting where counsel's performance is attacked in a deportation proceeding, but it is not binding and should not be blindly imported wholesale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an alternative reason in this case why the due process claim should fail even if we extended the prejudice per se notion from criminal convictions to review of waiver denials in deportations. On September 4, 1992, the immigration judge denied Hernandez' request for waiver (Hernandez having conceded deportability in 1989). Hernandez does not deny that he knew of that decision; on the contrary, he says--in a very cursory affidavit--that his then counsel assured him that he had appealed and would continue to pursue all avenues; after that, the affidavit indicates, Hernandez knew little more about what happened. At most, it appears that Hernandez had a cursory conversation with his lawyer in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard to stomach the idea that Hernandez could sit on his hands for almost five years and then say that he was unconstitutionally denied an opportunity to pursue an appeal from the denial of waiver. Knowing that he had been denied a waiver and was subject to deportation, it would seem that Hernandez had some duty--as a condition of a successful due process claim--to monitor his lawyer's actions and assure that his appeal was being pursued. Cf. Leblanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685, 694 (1st Cir. 1983). So far as his affidavit reveals, he did nothing whatever after 1995 when he says that his then lawyer told him that there was \"no word on the appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only in 1997, five years after the original denial of waiver (and on the day he was faced with a bag and baggage letter order) did Hernandez claim on collateral attack that all this time he has been denied an opportunity to appeal. What he now wants is a judicial stay pending his petition to the Board to reopen or a judicial determination providing him with a new opportunity to appeal to the Board. This is not due process but overkill of the kind that has led Congress increasingly to limit judicial review and to abolish waivers even for those who may fully deserve them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in this opinion should be read as altering the status of Hernandez' pending motion to reopen. Although we can identify no due process violation in Hernandez' original proceedings, it is within the Board's power to reopen Hernandez' case, and to stay deportation pending its decision on the motion, if it thinks that the circumstances so warrant. We express no opinion as to these matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision is affirmed and this court's September 9, 1999, stay of deportation is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There were three days of hearings conducted over the course of two years. Much of the delay resulted from requests by Hernandez' counsel for continuances and, in at least one instance, because Hernandez failed to appear at a scheduled hearing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Hernandez also points to errors made by the immigration judge concerning the length of time Hernandez' children were receiving welfare support, Hernandez' rehabilitation, and permitting Hernandez' wife to testify. Even accepting these claims as true (and there is a serious question whether they are), such \"mistakes\" fall far short of a denial of due process. See Toscano-Gil v. Trominski, 210 F.3d 470, 474 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In 1989, Hernandez was convicted in state court of distributing cocaine. As a result, the INS commenced deportation proceedings against Hernandez, charging him with being removable under section 241 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251 (1988), because his conviction qualified as an aggravated felony, id. &#167; 1251(a)(4)(B), and a narcotics violation, id. &#167; 1251(a)(11). (U.S. Code references are to the 1994 edition unless otherwise indicated.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, Hernandez conceded deportability and applied for a waiver of deportation under INA section 212(c), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c). At his hearing which commenced in August 1990, Hernandez argued that his family ties to the United States, job history, and rehabilitation made him eligible for discretionary relief from deportation. The immigration judge disagreed, denying Hernandez' request for waiver because the \"adverse factors in [his] case so greatly outweigh[ed] the social and human considerations presented.\" Hernandez was ordered deported on September 4, 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Five days later, Hernandez' counsel filed a timely notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"Board\"). The notice stated that a brief on the issues would be filed separately, but Hernandez' counsel failed to submit one. As a result, on October 28, 1993, the Board summarily dismissed the appeal, stating that Hernandez had failed to \"meaningfully identify the particular basis\" for his claim. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.1(d)(1-a)(i)(A) (1993). Although under then-existing law Hernandez had the option of appealing the Board's decision to this court, no appeal was taken. See INA &#167; 106(a), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a), repealed by Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub. L. No. 104-208, &#167; 242, 110 Stat. 3009-546, -612 (1996) (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252 (Supp. II 1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Why Hernandez did not pursue his remedies is unclear. Hernandez had arguments to make to the Board but none, on our preliminary review, had great promise of success. Hernandez' then counsel has since said that he and Hernandez agreed that no court appeal from the Board's decision should be taken because it would be hopeless and that it was more useful for Hernandez to defer any clear-cut affirmance and in the meantime accumulate \"equities.\" But it is doubtful that Hernandez would endorse this description of what happened, nor is it certain what Hernandez was told at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the strategy--if there was one--was initially successful. For reasons not explained to us, no action was taken against Hernandez for almost four years. Then, in May 1997, the INS issued a so-called \"bag and baggage\" letter to Hernandez, which directed him to appear for deportation the following month. On the day of his scheduled deportation, Hernandez hired a new attorney who immediately filed a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241, and a motion to reopen his case with the Board, 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 3.2(a) &amp; (c) (2000); both pleadings claimed that Hernandez had been denied due process in the deportation proceedings because of prior counsel's ineffectiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unsure of its jurisdiction, the district court stayed Hernandez' deportation based on the \"facial seriousness\" of his due process claim. Hernandez v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456527\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456527/hernandez-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 100 (D. Mass. 1999). At Hernandez' request, the district court also stayed his habeas proceeding in light of then-pending litigation in which we proposed to consider, inter alia, whether newly-passed legislation barred section 212(c) discretionary relief for deportable criminals who had sought a waiver prior to the new restrictions. Thereafter, in Goncalves v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197952\"><a href=\"/opinion/197952/perceira-goncalves-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 133 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></span> (1999), we held that the new restrictions did not apply to such persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then proceeded with Hernandez' petition but now found relief barred by an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118264\"><a href=\"/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 482-87 (1999), construing section 242(g) of IIRIRA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g) (Supp. II 1996). Hernandez, 63 F. Supp. 2d at 103. By its terms, that section precludes jurisdiction by any court, apart from direct court of appeals review as authorized in that section, over claims:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Read literally, this language could easily be taken to bar district court habeas jurisdiction insofar as the \"claim\" related to any one of the three described types of \"decision or action.\" The district court viewed the relief sought by Hernandez --effectively requiring the Board to reopen his section 212(c) waiver case--as interfering with the Attorney General's decision to \"adjudicate\" cases. Hernandez, 63 F. Supp. 2d at 103. The court therefore dismissed Hernandez' petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction but stayed its order to permit an appeal, finding the issue \"not without doubt.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez now appeals, claiming that the district court's reading of section 242(g) and American-Arab is inconsistent with our later decision in Wallace v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198695\"><a href=\"/opinion/198695/wolde-wallace-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 285 (1st Cir. 1999). The government responds that the habeas petition was correctly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction for two other reasons: because former section 106(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a), made direct review the exclusive avenue to review deportation orders, and in the alternative, because Hernandez has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, id. &#167; 1105a(c). The government also says that Hernandez has failed to show either ineffective assistance of counsel or that the immigration judge erred in denying discretionary relief to Hernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded by either the district court's or the government's jurisdictional objections. The district court's reading of section 242(g) is not without force, but it was rejected in Goncalves--based on an unwillingness to find an implied repeal of habeas corpus. Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 119-23. Goncalves was reaffirmed in Wallace--notwithstanding American-Arab. Wallace, 194 F.3d at 284-85. Indeed, while American-Arab was not concerned with habeas, its surprisingly narrow reading of section 242(g) indirectly reinforces Wallace and Goncalves. The government itself agrees that American-Arab's reading of section 242(g) \"does not divest the district court of jurisdiction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relies instead on former section 106(a) of the INA. That section, now repealed but still pertinent to Hernandez' claim, see IIRIRA &#167;&#167; 309(a) &amp; (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 note (Supp. II 1996), made court of appeals review the \"sole and exclusive procedure\" to review final orders of deportation. INA &#167; 106(a), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a). But in the pertinent time frame, section 106 itself explicitly endorsed habeas corpus as a remedy, id. &#167; 1105a(a)(10), and even if this were not so, the logic of Goncalves' objection to implied repeal of habeas applies with equal force where an asserted constitutional default by counsel forfeits direct review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the government argues that Hernandez has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Under former section 106(a)(c), review of an order of deportation was barred if, inter alia, \"the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right . . . .\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(c). The government appears to rely both on Hernandez' past failure to utilize available remedies and on his present pending motion to reopen. It is useful to treat past and present remedies separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the past, at one time Hernandez did have at least two remedies as of right, namely, briefing a timely appeal to the Board and moving to reopen by September 30, 1996, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(c)(2) (2000). Sometimes courts do talk of \"failure to exhaust\" past remedies that are no longer available, meaning either that the party did not seek the agency remedy at all or did not make a particular argument. E.g., Roman-Martinez v. Runyon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197089\"><a href=\"/opinion/197089/roman-martinez-v-runyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir. 1996). These are essentially arguments that a claim or contention has been waived or forfeited--which is quite different than saying that there is an existing agency remedy that should be invoked before turning to the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However labeled, the government's objection based on now-forgone remedies essentially overlaps, in this case, with the \"merits.\" Hernandez' central claim in the district court was that counsel's failure seriously to pursue an appeal to the Board, and his failure entirely to appeal to this court, created a constitutional defect. If this were so--and we will return to the merits shortly--it would be very odd to say that counsel's unconstitutional conduct created a waiver, forfeit, or failure to exhaust that prevented his client from ever litigating that issue. The same is true of the failure to move to reopen within the time limits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us back to the pending motion before the Board. This is not a remedy \"as of right\" under former section 106(a)(6), because Hernandez' motion to reopen was filed long after the time period for such motions. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(c)(2) (2000). But to the extent that the Board does provide currently available remedies as a matter of grace, a court is free to require exhaustion of such remedies--not because of any jurisdictional objection or statutory command but simply because it makes sense. See McCarthy v. Madigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112701\"><a href=\"/opinion/112701/mccarthy-v-madigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 144 (1992); Davis, Administrative Law &#167; 15.2 (3d ed. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board, admirably in our view, has sought to cope with the type of problem raised in this case by setting up a procedure for respondents to seek reopening of deportation orders based on incompetence of counsel. In re Lozada, 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Recognizing that such claims are easily made and compromise finality, the Board's criteria require an affidavit describing the alleged agreement with counsel, notice to counsel (who can respond), and a statement whether the alleged default by counsel has been reported to state authorities and, if so, with what result (and if not, why not). Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinary case, we agree that the respondent must use the Board's own procedures to resolve his competency of counsel claims. Absent a threat of immediate deportation, a district court should in general decline to entertain a habeas petition challenging competency of counsel. See Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198702\"><a href=\"/opinion/198702/vallejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir. 1999). Even if such a threat impends, the respondent still ought to show good cause why he has not previously sought a discretionary stay of deportation, as well as reopening, from the Board. However, unless rigidly prescribed by statute, exhaustion may be excused where there is reason to do so. See Sousa v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199083\"><a href=\"/opinion/199083/sousa-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Hernandez is threatened with immediate deportation and his petition to reopen has been pending with the Board for well over three years. Cf. Dabone v. Karn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453196\"><a href=\"/opinion/453196/haruna-dabone-v-lyle-l-karn-district-director-of-the-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, 597 n.2 (3d Cir. 1985) (holding that the Board's \"failure to act within a reasonable period\" on a motion to reopen may be treated as an \"effective denial\"). Under these circumstances, to await further action by the Board would, on the one hand, frustrate Congress' plain intent to expedite deportation of aggravated felons, see IIRIRA &#167; 304(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229(d)(1) (Supp. II 1996), and, on the other, risk deporting Hernandez without giving him an opportunity to make his constitutional objection in court. We therefore turn to the merits of the due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in deportation, which is a civil proceeding, but several courts of appeals (including this one) have said that where counsel does appear for the respondent, incompetence in some situations may make the proceeding fundamentally unfair and give rise to a Fifth Amendment due process objection. Lozada v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511756\"><a href=\"/opinion/511756/julio-lozada-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1988). We have said that a process becomes fundamentally unfair when \"the alien [is] prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one threshold issue. Hernandez has never had a legal defense to deportation. He does not say that he is not an alien or that he was wrongly convicted of a deportable crime. Rather, all that stands between him and deportation is his request for a section 212(c) discretionary waiver, based on the Attorney General's weighing of equities. It is this request for a discretionary waiver that Hernandez says his attorney mishandled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit has taken the view that waiver relief is so speculative and so much a matter of grace that \"an attorney's deficient representation does not deprive an alien of due process if the deficient representation merely prevents the alien from being eligible for suspension of deportation.\" Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764472\"><a href=\"/opinion/764472/ernesto-alonso-mejia-rodriguez-v-janet-reno-as-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1139</span></a></span>, 1148 (11th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 121 S.Ct. 563(2000). Yet waivers are granted or withheld according to largely fixed criteria, Yepes-Prado v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658351\"><a href=\"/opinion/658351/rigoberto-yepes-prado-v-us-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1363</span></a></span>, 1365-66 (9th Cir. 1993), and have an enormous practical impact. We think it best to treat the speculative and discretionary character of waivers not as an absolute bar but as bearing on the likelihood that counsel's conduct affected the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning then to the due process claim itself, Hernandez did have a fair opportunity to present his waiver case to the immigration judge. There was a hearing, substantial testimony, and a reasoned decision. Hernandez says that his attorney erred during the proceedings, but these are garden-variety claims that counsel should have handled matters somewhat differently and in this context do not even approach a showing that Hernandez has been deprived of a constitutionally adequate opportunity to make his case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, everything turns on the claim that counsel's failure to brief the appeal to the Board and seek review in this court comprised such a deprivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both steps may have been strategic--Hernandez' counsel so claims explicitly as to judicial review--but we will assume arguendo that attorney negligence is involved. Even in a criminal proceeding, attorney negligence creates a constitutional flaw only if it is extreme and there is a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></span>, 694 (1983); Prou v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198748\"><a href=\"/opinion/198748/prou-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></span> (2000). We have reviewed the immigration judge's decision and cannot find any such \"reasonable probability\" that the result would have been different if counsel had carried through with an appeal to the Board or to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his contrary claim, Hernandez points to two equitable considerations that he argues would have led to the grant of a waiver by the Board. Hernandez says that the extent of his family ties in the United States are an \"unusual and outstanding equity\" and that his \"genuine rehabilitation\" also weighed in favor of a waiver. As to the first, Hernandez argues that he has sixty-five \"close\" family members who are either U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. As evidence of the second, Hernandez points to his limited criminal history (one conviction), steady employment, community involvement, and removal of his family from welfare support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having been convicted of a serious drug offense, Hernandez needed to demonstrate \"unusual or outstanding countervailing equities.\" Hazzard v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573876\"><a href=\"/opinion/573876/ronald-hazzard-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 438 (1st Cir. 1991). The numerous relatives that Hernandez now cites as equities are more distant than those that the immigration judge did consider (his children, wife, mother, and sisters). It is difficult to see why consideration of such attenuated relationships should alter the equitable balance. As for rehabilitation, Hernandez' seems only to have seriously begun after deportation proceedings originally commenced in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, there is at least some evidence of other, less admirable behavior by Hernandez. This led the immigration judge to say that even accepting that Hernandez had established unusual or outstanding equities, he still believed that a waiver would not be justified. In all events, we can identify nothing in Hernandez' case that leads us to believe that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the result of the proceedings would have been different had an appeal been perfected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were this a criminal case, counsel's failure to comply with a defendant's request to appeal would be treated as prejudice per se. Roe v. Flores-Ortega, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118339\"><a href=\"/opinion/118339/roe-v-flores-ortega/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span>, 1038-39 (2000). But we are unwilling, unless directed to do so, to incorporate into civil deportation proceedings the whole apparatus of Sixth Amendment precedent. But see Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771176\"><a href=\"/opinion/771176/david-j-dearinger-and-victor-litovchenko-ex-rel-natalia-volkova-v-janet/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span>, 1045-46 (9th Cir. 2000). Our concern in the immigration context is not with the Sixth Amendment but with preserving a fair opportunity to have a waiver claim considered; it does not include an opportunity to tie up deportation proceedings in knots through collateral attacks on defects that would not plausibly have altered the result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not Hernandez' counsel engaged in strategic behavior in this case, the threat is a very real one. A convicted criminal sits in jail while his habeas petition is pending; someone threatened with deportation but at large has every incentive to string out the deportation process, especially after an initial adverse decision by the immigration judge makes prospects of getting a waiver dim. Sixth Amendment precedent is worth consulting where counsel's performance is attacked in a deportation proceeding, but it is not binding and should not be blindly imported wholesale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an alternative reason in this case why the due process claim should fail even if we extended the prejudice per se notion from criminal convictions to review of waiver denials in deportations. On September 4, 1992, the immigration judge denied Hernandez' request for waiver (Hernandez having conceded deportability in 1989). Hernandez does not deny that he knew of that decision; on the contrary, he says--in a very cursory affidavit--that his then counsel assured him that he had appealed and would continue to pursue all avenues; after that, the affidavit indicates, Hernandez knew little more about what happened. At most, it appears that Hernandez had a cursory conversation with his lawyer in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard to stomach the idea that Hernandez could sit on his hands for almost five years and then say that he was unconstitutionally denied an opportunity to pursue an appeal from the denial of waiver. Knowing that he had been denied a waiver and was subject to deportation, it would seem that Hernandez had some duty--as a condition of a successful due process claim--to monitor his lawyer's actions and assure that his appeal was being pursued. Cf. Leblanc v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423902\"><a href=\"/opinion/423902/thomas-leblanc-and-marie-margaret-leblanc-v-immigration-and-naturalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 694 (1st Cir. 1983). So far as his affidavit reveals, he did nothing whatever after 1995 when he says that his then lawyer told him that there was \"no word on the appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only in 1997, five years after the original denial of waiver (and on the day he was faced with a bag and baggage letter order) did Hernandez claim on collateral attack that all this time he has been denied an opportunity to appeal. What he now wants is a judicial stay pending his petition to the Board to reopen or a judicial determination providing him with a new opportunity to appeal to the Board. This is not due process but overkill of the kind that has led Congress increasingly to limit judicial review and to abolish waivers even for those who may fully deserve them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in this opinion should be read as altering the status of Hernandez' pending motion to reopen. Although we can identify no due process violation in Hernandez' original proceedings, it is within the Board's power to reopen Hernandez' case, and to stay deportation pending its decision on the motion, if it thinks that the circumstances so warrant. We express no opinion as to these matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decision is affirmed and this court's September 9, 1999, stay of deportation is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There were three days of hearings conducted over the course of two years. Much of the delay resulted from requests by Hernandez' counsel for continuances and, in at least one instance, because Hernandez failed to appear at a scheduled hearing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Hernandez also points to errors made by the immigration judge concerning the length of time Hernandez' children were receiving welfare support, Hernandez' rehabilitation, and permitting Hernandez' wife to testify. Even accepting these claims as true (and there is a serious question whether they are), such \"mistakes\" fall far short of a denial of due process. See Toscano-Gil v. Trominski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"20738\"><a href=\"/opinion/20738/toscano-gil-v-trominski/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 474 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
