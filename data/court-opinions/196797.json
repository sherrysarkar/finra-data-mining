For the  reasons stated\r\n\nherein,  we  affirm the  decision of  the  district court  on all\r\n\npoints.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On the evening  of February  6, 1989,  the Boston  Fire\r\n\nDepartment responded to a multiple-alarm fire at 295-297 Franklin\r\n\nStreet  (the \"Building\"),  in  Boston, which  was  owned by  Jack\r\n\nGateman  (\"Gateman\").   At  that  time, the  defendant,  James L.\r\n\nMitchell (\"Mitchell\"),  was  a tenant  occupying  the  Building's\r\n\nsecond,  third and fourth floors, where he and his partner, Allen\r\n\nGallant (\"Gallant\"),  ran a  private social  club known as  \"Club\r\n\n297\" (the  \"Club\").  The Club had been ordered closed by the City\r\n\nof Boston  for violation of City  codes in January 1989.   On the\r\n\nday  of   the  fire,   several  men,  including   Ronald  Wallace\r\n\n(\"Wallace\"),  had been working on  repairs at the  Club.  Wallace\r\n\ntestified  at trial that during  the course of  that day Mitchell\r\n\ntold him  he would pay him  $11,000 to set fire  to the Building,\r\n\nmaking  an initial  payment.   Mitchell returned  to his  home in\r\n\nVermont, while Wallace returned to the Club.  Mitchell called the\r\n\nClub  from his car telephone, and spoke to Wallace, who testified\r\n\nthat Mitchell asked him whether he would set the fire.  After the\r\n\nphone call, Wallace went  to the fourth floor of the Building and\r\n\nset some mattresses stacked there on fire.  He and  the other men\r\n\nin the Club fled the Building.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          Over the  next months,  Mitchell wired Wallace  sums of\r\n\nmoney through Western  Union.  Evidence was  entered that Gallant\r\n\nreported  the loss the  Club suffered in  the fire  to the Club's\r\n\ninsurance  broker, and  pursued  the claim  through an  insurance\r\n\nbroker.   Testimony at  trial established  that some  $59,400 was\r\n\npaid  out on  the  Club's policies,  most  of which  went to  the\r\n\nInternal Revenue Service.\r\n\n          In November 1991, Mitchell  was charged under a twenty-\r\n\ntwo  count indictment  with  conspiracy, arson,  use  of fire  to\r\n\ncommit a felony,  and wire fraud.   He was  prosecuted on six  of\r\n\nthose  counts.  After  a jury trial,  he was found  guilty on the\r\n\nconspiracy  and arson  charges,  but acquitted  of the  remaining\r\n\ncounts.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                II.  ADMISSION OF SEIZED EVIDENCE\r                          II.  ADMISSION OF SEIZED EVIDENCE\r\n\n          The   district    court   adopted   the    report   and\r\n\nrecommendation of  the magistrate judge, who  found the following\r\n\nfacts.   See United States  v. Mart nez-Molina, 64  F.3d 719, 723\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1995) (\"We recite  the facts adduced  at a suppression\r\n\nhearing  in  the light  most  favorable to  the  district court's\r\n\nruling to the extent that they derive support from the record and\r\n\nare  not clearly  erroneous.\").    On  the  night  of  the  fire,\r\n\nLieutenant   Paul  R.   LeBlanc  (\"Lt. LeBlanc\")   of  the   Fire\r\n\nInvestigation Unit reported  to the scene of the  fire.  After it\r\n\nwas \"put  down,\" within an  hour or so  of being reported  to the\r\n\nFire Department at 9:15  p.m., Lt. LeBlanc entered  the premises,\r\n\nalong  with two associates, in  order to determine  the cause and\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\norigin  of the fire.   He seized  carpet samples and  sections of\r\n\nstair rises, later  entered in evidence at  trial. Irregular burn\r\n\npatterns   prompted  him  to  suspect  that   the  fire  was  not\r\n\naccidental, and that it originated on the fourth floor.  Adequate\r\n\nphotographs could not be taken, however, since there was no light\r\n\nand the  water on the floor precluded reliable flash photography.\r\n\nThe following morning, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., Lieutenant Roy\r\n\nBurrill (\"Lt. Burrill\"), also of the Fire Investigation Unit, was\r\n\nsent to  the site without a  warrant.  He seized  two sections of\r\n\nflooring from the  fourth floor.  A third search was conducted by\r\n\nFirst Security Company, a  private investigation company hired by\r\n\nGateman  to determine the  cause of the  fire.  They  also seized\r\n\nsamples from the fourth floor.\r\n\n          On  appeal,  Mitchell  challenges  the   trial  court's\r\n\nadmission of the  evidence seized  by Lt. Burrill,  on the  basis\r\n\nthat there were no  exigent circumstances justifying his entrance\r\n\nwithout a warrant.1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Although he does not clearly state that his appeal is limited\r\nto the  evidence admitted  from Lt. Burrill's  search, Mitchell's\r\nargument does not address the other two searches, and so we limit\r\nour analysis to  Lt. Burrill's search  and seizure.   We note  in\r\npassing,  however, that even if Mitchell has not waived the right\r\nto  object  to  the admission  of  the  evidence  from the  other\r\nsearches, see infra,  the district court undoubtedly did  not err\r                             \r\nin admitting that  evidence, for the  very reasons pronounced  by\r\nthe  magistrate   judge.     First,  Lt.  LeBlanc's   search  was\r\nconstitutional under the rationale of Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n499,  510 (1978)  (\"Officials  need no  warrant  to remain  in  a\r\nbuilding  for a  reasonable time  to investigate  the cause  of a\r\nblaze after it has been  extinguished.\").  Second, First Security\r\nCompany's search was a purely private search and seizure that did\r\nnot involve official action; as such, it does not come  under the\r\nFourth Amendment, which does not proscribe unreasonable  searches\r\nand  seizures by private persons.  See United States v. Jacobsen,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          A.  Waiver\r                    A.  Waiver\r                              \r\n\n          The United States claims that Mitchell waived the right\r\n\nto appeal the  admission of  this evidence by  failing to  object\r\n\nwithin   ten  days   to   the  magistrate   judge's  report   and\r\n\nrecommendation on the defendant's Motion to Suppress the Physical\r\n\nEvidence.   See Rule 3(b), Rules for United States Magistrates in\r                         \r\n\nthe   United  States   District   Court  for   the  District   of\r\n\nMassachusetts.     As  the  report  and   recommendation  of  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge itself pointed out, we have repeatedly indicated\r\n\nthat  failure to comply with  Rule 3(b) precludes  review by this\r\n\ncourt.   See, e.g., United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4,\r                                                              \r\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1986); United States  v. Vega, 678 F.2d 376, 379 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1982) (\"There can be  no appeal from  a magistrate's report\r\n\nand recommendation unless objections are filed thereto.\").\r\n\n          Mitchell  now  maintains  that  his  objection  to  the\r\n\nevidence seized by Lt. Burrill has been saved from waiver despite\r\n\nhis failure  to  object because,  subsequent  to the  report  and\r\n\nrecommendation,  the district  court issued  an order  stating it\r\n\nwould reconsider  the suppression  issue as regards  the evidence\r\n\nseized  by  Lt.  Burrill.   In  that  order,  the district  court\r\n\nrequested,  among   other  things,  that  Mitchell  identify  the\r\n\nportions  of memoranda and evidence  the court should consider in\r\n\ndeciding the motion to suppress the evidence seized.  All of  the\r\n\nseized evidence offered was admitted at trial.  We need not delve\r\n\ninto  the  intricacies  of   whether  the  district  court  order\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984).\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\neffectively revived  Mitchell's motion  to suppress  the evidence\r\n\nseized  by Lt.  Burrill, however,  as we  find that  the district\r\n\ncourt did not err in admitting the disputed evidence.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          B.

The basic Fourth  Amendment framework  is\r\n\nclear.     \"Courts  have  consistently  followed  'one  governing\r\n\nprinciple' in  interpreting [the  Fourth Amendment]:   'except in\r\n\ncertain carefully defined classes of  cases, a search of  private\r\n\nproperty without  proper consent is 'unreasonable'  unless it has\r\n\nbeen  authorized by a  valid search warrant.'\"    Mann v. Cannon,\r                                                                          \r\n\n731  F.2d 54,  58 (1st  Cir. 1984)  (quoting Camara  v. Municipal\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nCourt, 387 U.S. 523, 528-29 (1967)).  Nonetheless, \"a warrantless\r               \r\n\nentry by  criminal law  enforcement officials  may be  legal when\r\n\nthere  is  compelling need  for official  action  and no  time to\r\n\nsecure  a warrant.\"   Tyler,  436 U.S. at  509.   Mitchell's core\r                                     \r\n\ncontention here is that there were no  such exigent circumstances\r\n\nin  the present case, and so Lt. Burrill's warrantless search was\r\n\nunconstitutional,  and the  evidence he  seized should  have been\r\n\nsuppressed.\r\n\n          The  analysis   in  Michigan  v.  Tyler   controls  our\r                                                           \r\n\ndecision.   In  Tyler, a  fire  broke out  in  a furniture  store\r                               \r\n\nshortly before midnight; the fire had been reduced to \"smoldering\r\n\nembers\" when the Fire  Chief reported to  the scene at 2:00  a.m.\r\n\nId.  at 501.  He concluded that  the fire was possibly the result\r             \r\n\nof  arson,  and  called  a   police  detective,  who  took   some\r\n\nphotographs, but  \"abandoned his efforts because of the smoke and\r\n\nsteam.\"   Id. at 502.  After  a brief survey through  the rest of\r                       \r\n\nthe building  to look for  further evidence of  the cause  of the\r\n\nfire, the Chief and police  detective left the site.   Four hours\r\n\nlater, the Chief returned with the Assistant Chief, whose task it\r\n\nwas to  determine the origin of  all fires in the  township.  The\r\n\nfire was  out, and  the building was  empty.  They  quickly left,\r\n\nreturning  with the police detective around 9:00 a.m.  They found\r\n\nsuspicious burn marks, not visible  earlier, and took samples  of\r\n\ncarpet and stairs.\r\n\n          Rejecting  the premise that  \"the exigency justifying a\r\n\nwarrantless  entry to fight  a fire ends,  and the need  to get a\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nwarrant begins, with the dousing of the last flame,\" id. at  510,\r                                                                  \r\n\nthe Court found the  two searches conducted on the  morning after\r\n\nthe fire were constitutionally permitted.  After noting  that the\r\n\ninvestigation  on the  night  of the  fire  was hindered  by  the\r\n\ndarkness as well as the steam and smoke, the Court found that the\r\n\nfire officials\r\n\n            departed at 4  a.m. and returned  shortly\r\n            after   daylight    to   continue   their\r\n            investigation.  Little purpose would have\r\n            been  served  by their  remaining  in the\r\n            building,  except  to  remove  any  doubt\r\n            about  the  legality  of the  warrantless\r\n            search  and  seizure   later  that   same\r\n            morning.  Under  these circumstances,  we\r\n            find that  the  morning entries  were  no\r\n            more than an  actual continuation of  the\r\n            first . . . .\r\nId. at 511.\r             \r\n\n          The  facts  here  closely  parallel   those  of  Tyler.\r                                                                          \r\n\nLt. LeBlanc  entered the scene after the fire was \"put down,\" and\r\n\nwithin  roughly an  hour of  the time  the fire was  reported, in\r\n\norder  to  determine the  cause  and  origin of  the  fire.   The\r\n\ninvestigation  was hampered  by  the lack  of  light and  by  the\r\n\npresence of water on  the floor:  photographs could not be taken.\r\n\nThe following morning, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., roughly twelve\r\n\nhours after the fire  had been reported, Lt. Burrill  entered the\r\n\nscene in order to take additional  samples.  He removed the water\r\n\nand debris from the fourth floor, and then seized two sections of\r\n\nflooring,  the  challenged  evidence.    These  facts  speak  for\r\n\nthemselves:    Lt. Burrill's search  and  seizure  was clearly  a\r\n\ncontinuation  of  the first  search by  Lt.  LeBlanc.   Unlike in\r\n\nTyler, of  course,  the  same individual  did  not  conduct  both\r               \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nsearches,  but  both  fire  officials  were  of  the  same   Fire\r\n\nInvestigation Unit.  Ultimately,  as in Tyler, the \"investigation\r                                                       \r\n\nof the fire's origin  was [] temporarily suspended on  account of\r\n\nthe  conditions on the scene and resumed at the first opportunity\r\n\nwhen  the  conditions  hampering  the   investigation  subsided.\"\r\n\nClifford, 464 U.S. at 301.\r                  \r\n\n          That Lt. Burrill's morning  entrance onto the  premises\r\n\nwas in fact a continuation of the nighttime search is underscored\r\n\nby  the  distinctions the  Court  drew  between its  decision  in\r\n\nClifford and its Tyler holding.  In Clifford, a fire broke out in\r                                                      \r\n\na private residence and the fire department reported to the scene\r\n\nat about 5:42 in the morning.  The fire was extinguished, and the\r\n\nfire officials  and police  left the  premises at  7:04 a.m.   At\r\n\nabout 1:00 p.m. that afternoon a fire investigator arrived at the\r\n\nscene, having  been informed  that the fire  department suspected\r\n\narson.   Despite the fact that the  house was being boarded up on\r\n\nbehalf  of the  out-of-town  owners, the  Cliffords, and  despite\r\n\ntheir  knowledge that the Cliffords  did not plan  to return that\r\n\nday, the fire  investigator and his  partner searched the  house.\r\n\nAfter determining that the fire had been set in the basement, and\r\n\nhow,  the  investigators  searched   the  entire  house,   taking\r\n\nphotographs.   Id.  at 289-91.   In  finding that  the challenged\r                            \r\n\nsearch  by the  fire investigator  was not  a continuation  of an\r\n\nearlier search,  as in Tyler,  and in distinguishing  between the\r                                      \r\n\ntwo cases, the Court noted:\r\n\n            Between  the  time  the firefighters  had\r\n            extinguished the blaze and left the scene\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n            and the arson investigators first arrived\r\n            about   1:00   p.m.   to    begin   their\r\n            investigation,  the  Cliffords had  taken\r\n            steps  to  secure  the privacy  interests\r\n            that remained in their  residence against\r\n            further   intrusion.      These   efforts\r\n            separate the entry made to extinguish the\r\n            blaze  by that  made  later by  different\r\n            officers   to  investigate   its  origin.\r\n            Second,  the  privacy  interests  in  the\r\n            residence   --  particularly   after  the\r\n            Cliffords had acted -- were significantly\r\n            greater  than  those in  the fire-damaged\r\n            furniture  store  [in Tyler],  making the\r                                                 \r\n            delay  between the  fire and  the mid-day\r\n            search  unreasonable  absent  a  warrant,\r\n            consent, or exigent circumstances.\r\n\nId.  at  296.   These  facts play  no role  here:   there  was no\r             \r\n\nevidence  of an effort to secure the burned-out premises, and the\r\n\nheightened privacy interests a  property owner has in a  home are\r\n\nnot present.  See  id. at 297 (noting that \"privacy interests are\r                                \r\n\nespecially strong in a private residence.\").   Unlike the private\r\n\ndwelling in Clifford, this  was a commercial property.   Mitchell\r                              \r\n\npoints out that he was in Vermont  at the time of the fire in the\r\n\npremises he had leased; however, he made no effort to arrange for\r\n\nthe premises to be closed off, unlike the defendants in Clifford,\r                                                                          \r\n\nwho were similarly away  from their home.  These  facts permitted\r\n\nthe magistrate judge to  conclude that the search by  Lt. Burrill\r\n\nwas merely  a continuation of  Lt. LeBlanc's  search, and,  thus,\r\n\nthat \"there was simply  nothing unreasonable, in Fourth Amendment\r\n\nterms,  to  [sic]  reentering  the building  and  completing  the\r\n\nalready commenced  investigation of the  cause and origin  of the\r\n\nfire when  circumstances --  i.e., adequate lighting  provided by\r\n\ndaylight  and removal of the debris and water -- first reasonably\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\npermitted.\"  (Report and Recommendation, page 11).\r\n\n          In  Clifford  the  Court  laid out  three  factors  for\r                                \r\n\nanalyzing the constitutionality of warrantless  searches of fire-\r\n\ndamaged premises:\r\n\n            whether  there   are  legitimate  privacy\r\n            interests  in  the fire-damaged  property\r\n            that   are   protected   by  the   Fourth\r\n            Amendment; whether  exigent circumstances\r\n            justify    the    government    intrusion\r\n            regardless of  any reasonable expectation\r\n            of  privacy; and,  whether the  object of\r\n            the search  is to determine  the cause of\r\n            the  fire   or  to  gather   evidence  of\r\n            criminal activity.\r\n\nClifford, 464 U.S. at 291; see  Mann, 731 F.2d at 59-60 (weighing\r                                              \r\n\nthe Clifford factors in evaluating warrantless entry onto private\r                      \r\n\npremises  for  health and  safety  reasons).    First, as  noted,\r\n\nMitchell  can have  had few  privacy interests  in the  Building.\r\n\n\"Privacy expectations will  vary with the  type of property,  the\r\n\namount  of  fire  damage, the  prior  and  continued  use of  the\r\n\npremises,  and in  some cases  the owner's  efforts to  secure it\r\n\nagainst intruders.\"   Clifford, 464  U.S. at 292;  see Mann,  731\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d  at  59 (noting  that  privacy  considerations in  virtually\r\n\nabandoned residence used as storehouse were minimal).\r\n\n          Mitchell  focuses  his argument  on the  second factor,\r\n\nexigent  circumstances.   As he  notes, at  the time  Lt. Burrill\r\n\nentered the  grounds, the fire  was out, there were  no people in\r\n\nthe building,  and there was no  danger of further  damage, or of\r\n\nflammable  materials  being  present.   However,  the  Court  has\r\n\nclearly established that \"officials need no warrant to  remain in\r\n\na building for  a reasonable time to  investigate the cause  of a\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nblaze after it  has been extinguished.\"  Tyler,  436 U.S. at 510;\r                                                        \r\n\nsee Clifford, 464 U.S. at 293 (noting that \"[b]ecause determining\r                      \r\n\nthe  cause  and  origin of  a  fire  serves  a compelling  public\r\n\ninterest,  the  warrant  requirement   does  not  apply  in  such\r\n\ncases.\").  Because the magistrate  judge properly found that  Lt.\r\n\nBurrill's entrance onto the  premises was in fact a  continuation\r\n\nof Lt.  LeBlanc's search,  and there  is no question  as to  that\r\n\nsearch's  constitutionality,   Mitchell's  exigent  circumstances\r\n\nargument  fails.  Indeed, this is precisely the level of exigency\r\n\n--  the  fire  was  extinguished,  the  building  was  empty, and\r\n\nconditions had hampered investigations  the night before -- whose\r\n\nconstitutionality the Supreme Court upheld in Tyler.\r                                                             \r\n\n          The third  Clifford factor examines the  purpose of the\r                                       \r\n\nsearch.  Here, the district court adopted  the magistrate judge's\r\n\nfinding  that Lt. LeBlanc entered the site to determine the cause\r\n\nand origin of  the fire, and that Lt. Burrill  \"was dispatched to\r\n\nthe scene for  the purpose  of taking additional  samples.\"   The\r\n\nlower court concluded  that there  was no showing  that the  fire\r\n\ndepartment suspected arson when Lt. Burrill was sent to the scene\r\n\nof  the  fire.    Indeed,  Lt.  LeBlanc  was  only  one of  three\r\n\ninvestigators on  the scene, and  no evidence was  presented that\r\n\nthe  other investigators shared his  opinions, much less that any\r\n\nof them communicated their impressions to Lt. Burrill.\r\n\n          In his brief, however, Mitchell seems to challenge that\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfinding, stating that Lt.  Burrill2 \"entered the premises without\r\n\na  warrant specifically to look for and seize evidence of arson.\"\r\n\n(Brief of  Appellant, p. 14).   Mitchell's  counsel contended  at\r\n\noral  argument  that  the  magistrate judge's  finding  that  Lt.\r\n\nBurrill  did not suspect  arson was  improbable, and  that common\r\n\nsense should indicate that  Lt. LeBlanc communicated his findings\r\n\nto Lt. Burrill.  We disagree.  Lt. Burrill testified that as soon\r\n\nas  he  started his  shift he  was sent  to  the scene,  and that\r\n\n\"[f]requently after a fire  has occurred at night, they  send the\r\n\nday crew to the scene .  . . because of the benefit of  daylight,\r\n\nit [is] easier to get samples.\" (Day 1, p. 96).  Lt. LeBlanc,  in\r\n\nturn, testified that the Fire Investigation Unit reported  to the\r\n\nfire  because it was a  multiple-alarm fire, to  which the Unit's\r\n\nresponse  is  automatic.    Based  on  this   testimony  and  our\r\n\ndeferential standard of review, we see no reason to find that the\r\n\ncourt erred in its finding of fact.\r\n\n          Based  on the  above,  we affirm  the district  court's\r\n\nrefusal to suppress the evidence from Lt. Burrill's search.\r\n\n            III.  ADMISSION OF THE TAPED CONVERSATIONS\r                      III.  ADMISSION OF THE TAPED CONVERSATIONS\r\n\n          Prior to  and after the fire,  Mitchell tape-recorded a\r\n\nseries  of  telephone conversations  he  had  with other  people,\r\n\nincluding  Wallace   and  Gallant,   without  their   consent  or\r\n\nknowledge.   Excerpted  portions of  three  of these  tapes  were\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  In  fact, defendant's  brief refers to  nameless \"Boston  Fire\r\nDepartment  Inspectors\"  who  entered  the building  on  the  day\r\nfollowing the fire.  As Lt. Burrill is the only  official fitting\r\nthat description  who seized  evidence at issue  here, we  assume\r\nthat defendant was describing him.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nadmitted  at trial.  On appeal, Mitchell argues that the district\r\n\ncourt  committed reversible  error  in limiting  the  use of  the\r\n\ntapes,  for  two  reasons.    First,  he  maintains,   the  taped\r\n\nconversations  were  admissible  to  show  bias and  inconsistent\r\n\ntestimony.   Second,  he contends  that all  the tapes,  not just\r\n\nfragments of  them, were admissible for  purposes of impeachment.\r\n\nAs he does not specify, in either his brief or  at oral argument,\r\n\nwhich tapes he actually  seeks to enter, why each  portion should\r\n\nbe played, or the  purpose for which each excerpt  not previously\r\n\nadmitted  should now be allowed, we limit our discussion to those\r\n\ntapes actually entered at trial.3\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Mitchell's counsel stated that there were twenty-one tapes in\r\nall, with roughly twenty-eight hours  of recordings.  Three tapes\r\nwere  actually  entered  at  trial,  but  two  other  tapes  were\r\ndiscussed.   First,  defense   counsel  offered   a  tape   of  a\r\nconversation  between Mitchell  and David  Collins, an  insurance\r\nbroker,  in his  cross-examination  of Collins  during voir  dire\r\noutside the jury's presence, in order to refresh his recollection\r\nand  knowledge.  At the  prosecution objection to  the tape being\r\nplayed,  and after some discussion, the court excused the witness\r\nfor the day so that the prosection could hear the tape.  The next\r\nday,  the  following  colloquy  ensued  (Mr.  Prince  is  defense\r\ncounsel; Mr. Cloherty is the prosecutor):\r\n\n               THE COURT:  .  . . . Now, with  regard\r\n            to  the  Collins'  [sic] telephone  call,\r\n            have you heard that tape?\r\n               MR. CLOHERTY:  Yes, Your Honor.\r\n               MR. PRINCE:    We have  resolved  that\r\n            issue, Your Honor.\r\n               MR. CLOHERTY:   Mr. Prince isn't going\r\n            to play it.  That's withdrawn.\r\n               THE COURT:  All right.\r\n\n(Day 9, p. 12).  Since the tape was withdrawn, we do not consider\r\nit here.  Similarly, there was some discussion of a tape recorded\r\non February 8, 1989, but defense counsel ultimately stated to the\r\ncourt  that he would not be offering anything from that tape, and\r\nso we do not address it here.  \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          A.

The February 7, 1989 Tape\r\n\n          Mitchell recorded two conversations between himself and\r\n\nWallace  on February 7, 1989.  Defendant sought to enter portions\r\n\nfrom  that tape as evidence of prior inconsistent statements.  At\r\n\na hearing on the admissibility of  the tape outside of the jury's\r\n\npresence,  the  following  colloquy  ensued (Mr.  Prince  is  the\r\n\ndefense counsel, Mr. Cloherty the prosecutor).\r\n\n               THE COURT: . .  . . Mr. Cloherty, what\r\n            is the Government's  position on  playing\r\n            all  of  the  February  7  tape  with the\r\n            exception of the two edits we discussed?\r\n               MR.  CLOHERTY:    We  would  want  the\r\n            entire tape played  with the exception of\r\n            those edits.\r\n               THE COURT:  And that remains agreeable\r\n            to the defendant?\r\n               MR.  PRINCE:    Yes,  Your  Honor, and\r\n            Mr. Cloherty   and   I   will  edit   the\r\n            conversation.\r\n\n(Day 5, pp. 112-13).   At the start of the next day of trial, the\r\n\ncourt asked the attorneys  whether the tapes had been  \"edited to\r\n\n[their] mutual satisfaction\"; Mitchell's counsel did not disagree\r\n\nwhen  the prosecution stated that they had.   (Day 6, p. 5).  Nor\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  In United States v. Taylor, we stated that the \"raise-or-waive\r                                       \r\nrule is not absolute.  But, rescue missions are restricted to the\r\ncorrection  of 'plain' errors,\"  54 F.3d at  972, without delving\r\ninto the difference between forfeiture and waiver.  We  therefore\r\nnote that the  distinction we  draw today between  them does  not\r\nconflict with Taylor,  in that Taylor was  concerned with failure\r                                               \r\nto  timely object  --  i.e., forfeiture.    Id. (noting  that  \"a\r                                                         \r\nlitigant who deems himself aggrieved . . . ordinarily must object\r\nthen and  there, or  forfeit any  right  to complain  at a  later\r\ntime.\"). \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\ndid he object when the tapes were offered.\r\n\n          Clearly,  Mitchell  has  waived any  objection  to  the\r\n\ncourt's failure  to play the  entire tape.   Not only did  he not\r\n\nobject to the use  of the tape, but he  affirmatively stated that\r\n\nhe was agreeable  to the use of  the edited tape  -- there was  a\r\n\n\"direct inquiry  from the court\" and an \"unequivocal assent\" from\r\n\ncounsel for  the defense.  Marder,  48 F.3d at  571 (holding that\r                                           \r\n\ndefendant  did  not waive  issue where  there  was no  such clear\r\n\ncolloquy,  but merely a failure  to object).   That action raises\r\n\nhis later silence from mere forfeiture to waiver.\r\n\n            2.  The February 1, 1989 Tape\r                      2.  The February 1, 1989 Tape\r\n\n          Mitchell  next  sought  to  introduce  excerpts  from a\r\n\nconversation  taped between  Mitchell  and Gallant  prior to  the\r\n\nfire.   He offered  the dialogue, which  discussed re-opening the\r\n\nClub, as evidence of  his then-existing state of mind.   See Fed.\r                                                                      \r\n\nR. Evid. 803(3).  The court stated that the entire tape could not\r\n\nbe  played, on  the  basis that  most  of it  was irrelevant  and\r\n\ninadmissible.   However,  the  next day,  based  on a  transcript\r\n\nindicating what  excerpts the defendant wanted to  use, and which\r\n\nof those the government  objected to, the court admitted  all the\r\n\nexcerpts  Mitchell requested.   Mitchell  now appears  to contend\r\n\nthat the entire tape should have been admitted.\r\n\n          Had Mitchell merely submitted  the entire tape, and the\r\n\ncourt  only admitted  excerpts, the  defense's failure  to object\r\n\nthat the remainder of the tape was not submitted to  the jury may\r\n\nonly  have resulted  in forfeiture,  Olano, 507  U.S. at  733, as\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nthere   may  have   been  no   \"'intentional  relinquishment   or\r\n\nabandonment  of a known right,'\" and so  no waiver.  Id. (quoting\r                                                                  \r\n\nJohnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938)).   But the defense's\r                           \r\n\nactions  went beyond  this:   Mitchell  took  an active  role  in\r\n\nlimiting  the  portions  considered  by  the  district  court  by\r\n\nproviding the  excerpts himself.  Ultimately,  the court admitted\r\n\nall the  excerpts he submitted.  This, paired with his failure to\r\n\nobject, raises his acts to  the level of waiver.  See  Marder, 48\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 570-71.  Indeed, Mitchell does not offer any  argument as\r\n\nto why we  should not deem the  portions not actually  offered as\r\n\nwaived.  We will not  look beyond the waiver and ask  whether the\r\n\ncourt committed plain error.\r\n\n            3.  The February 11, 1989 Tape\r                      3.  The February 11, 1989 Tape\r\n\n          The  third tape discussed  at trial was  a February 11,\r\n\n1989,  recording  of  Mitchell's conversation  with  his  partner\r\n\nGallant about whether  the Club had insurance at the  time of the\r\n\nfire.   At  a  hearing  on  the  tape's  admissibility  prior  to\r\n\nGallant's  testimony, the  court  characterized it  as \"a  really\r\n\ntransparent effort  by the defendant, Mr.  Mitchell, knowing that\r\n\nhe was accused  of setting the arsons [sic],  . . . [to  say] all\r\n\nsorts of things that  would be very inadmissible and  also things\r\n\nof  doubtful admissibility  on  the  stand.\"    (Day  9,  p.  7).\r\n\nAccordingly,  the court ruled  that the tape  was inadmissible to\r\n\nprove   state  of  mind  under  Fed.  R.  Evid.  803(3),  as  the\r\n\nconversation occurred after  the fire.   The defense objected  on\r\n\nthe basis that the  tape was in fact relevant  to the defendant's\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nstate of mind  regarding the  alleged wire fraud,  and the  court\r\n\nreconsidered its  ruling.  Accordingly, it  requested a marked-up\r\n\ntranscript  of the  portions of  the tape  the defense  sought to\r\n\nadmit on that basis, so it could \"see what is at issue.\"  (Day 9,\r\n\np. 141).\r\n\n          The next day, the court held that the first  of the two\r\n\nmarked pages defendant submitted  could be admitted; it  was read\r\n\nto the jury later that day,  without a limiting instruction.  The\r\n\ncourt also allowed the  second submitted page to be  entered, but\r\n\nas  a   prior  inconsistent   statement,  and  gave   a  limiting\r\n\ninstruction to the jury.   Defense counsel did not object  to the\r\n\ncourt's  rulings.  For the  same reasons discussed  above, as the\r\n\nonly portions of the  tape the defense actually submitted  to the\r\n\ncourt were entered, and  there was no objection entered,  we find\r\n\nthat the defense waived any appeal that the remainder of the tape\r\n\nshould have been admitted.  See id. \r                                             \r\n\n          As we find that  the defendant has waived the  right to\r\n\nargue that these three  tapes should have been admitted  in their\r\n\ntotality,  we need  not consider his  contentions that  they were\r\n\nadmissible  to  show  bias  and  inconsistent  testimony  or  for\r\n\npurposes of impeachment.\r\n\n                    IV.

For  the reasons\r                                \r\n\nstated  below, we  find  the district  court  did not  abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in making its instructions to the jury.\r\n\n          Count  I  of  the  indictment  alleged   that  Mitchell\r\n\nconspired  with Wallace  to  violate the  arson  statute, see  18\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.    844(i), and  the wire  fraud statute,  see 18 U.S.C.   \r                                                              \r\n\n1343.5   The charge  was made in  the conjunctive.   The district\r\n\ncourt, however, instructed the jury in the disjunctive:\r\n\n               The first count  charges a  conspiracy\r\n            to  commit  arson  and  a  conspiracy  to\r\n            commit wire fraud.\r\n\n               In  order to  prove  the defendant  is\r\n            guilty of Count 1, the government doesn't\r\n            have  to  prove  that   any  demonstrated\r\n            conspiracy had  both laws or  a violation\r\n            of both laws as its object.\r\n\n               It's  sufficient  that the  government\r\n            prove  either  the  conspiracy to  commit\r\n            arson  or the  conspiracy to  commit wire\r\n            fraud.\r\n\n               But  you  have  to unanimously  agree.\r\n            That is essential.   When you deliberate,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   The remaining five  counts charged Mitchell  with arson, wire\r\nfraud, and  use of  a fire  to commit  a felony.   See  18 U.S.C.\r                                                                \r\n   844(i), 1343, &amp; 844(h).\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n            all   12  of   you  have   to  agree   on\r\n            everything.  So  it would be insufficient\r\n            if  six  of  you   thought  there  was  a\r\n            conspiracy to commit arson and six of you\r\n            thought there was  a conspiracy to commit\r\n            wire  fraud.    You  have  to unanimously\r\n            agree, or try to.\r\n\n               But  if you  agree unanimously  that a\r\n            conspiracy  to  violate   one  of   those\r\n            statutes   has   been  proven   beyond  a\r\n            reasonable  doubt,  that's sufficient  to\r\n            find the defendant guilty on Count 1.\r\n\n(Day  12,  pp. 159-60).6    Mitchell  contends  that the  court's\r\n\ninstruction  that   finding  him  guilty   of  one  of   the  two\r\n\nconspiracies   is   sufficient   impermissibly    broadened   the\r\n\nallegations in Count I so as to create, in effect, two conspiracy\r\n\ncounts.7\r\n\n          In answering defendant's argument we take our lead from\r\n\nthe  Supreme Court.   In Griffin  v. United  States, 502  U.S. 46\r                                                             \r\n\n(1991), the petitioner was  charged with a conspiracy alleged  to\r\n\nhave  two objects, but was implicated in  only one of those.  The\r\n\ncourt instructed the jury  that it could return a  guilty verdict\r\n\nagainst  petitioner if  it  found that  she  had participated  in\r\n\neither  of the  two  objects, and  the  jury returned  a  general\r\n\nverdict of guilty,  without specifying on which  count it relied.\r\n\nId. at 47-48.

In so doing, it relied\r\n\non a  common law rule  dating back  to pre-revolutionary  England\r\n\nstating  that  \"'[w]hen a  jury returns  a  guilty verdict  on an\r\n\nindictment  charging several acts in  the conjunctive, .  . . the\r\n\nverdict  stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any\r\n\none  of the  acts charged.'\"   Id.  at  56-57 (quoting  Turner v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States, 396 U.S. 398,  420 (1970)); see  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nNieves-Burgos,  62  F.3d 431,  436  (1st  Cir. 1995)  (discussing\r                       \r\n\nGriffin and  the relevant  case  law).8   Accordingly, in  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Therefore,  we  need  not discuss  this\r                                \r\nexception here.  See  id. at  55 (noting  that the  exception has\r                                   \r\ngenerally been  applied \"to general-verdict  convictions that may\r\nhave rested on an unconstitutional ground.\").\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nobject  offenses, we  did not  need to  decide whether  there was\r\n\nsufficient  evidence of a conspiracy to commit  any or all of the\r\n\nother  object offenses, id. at 982-83 (holding that the fact that\r                                     \r\n\nthere  was  sufficient  evidence  allowed  a  new  trial  despite\r\n\nvacation of the conspiracy count on other grounds).

Rather, he seems to  make two\r                 \r\n\nintertwined arguments.  First,  he contends that Count I  must be\r\n\nread to charge  him with  only one offense,  namely, agreeing  to\r\n\nburn  the  Building  and  using  interstate  wire  facilities  to\r\n\ntransfer  money  to Wallace.    The  instructions, he  maintains,\r\n\nexpanded this offense  into two, opening him up to  the danger of\r\n\nbeing  convicted on facts different from those charged.  A \"court\r\n\nmay  not   substantially   amend  the   indictment  through   its\r\n\ninstructions  to the  jury.\"  United  States v.  Stewart Clinical\r                                                                           \r\n\nLab.,  Inc., 652  F.2d  804, 807  (9th  Cir. 1981)  (reversing  a\r                     \r\n\nconviction where the indictment charged defendants with violating\r\n\none subsection of  42 U.S.C.    1396h(b)(2) but the  government's\r\n\ncase  proved a violation of  another); see also  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTrexler,  474  F.2d 369,  371 (5th  Cir.)  (stating that  \"[a]s a\r                 \r\n\ngeneral rule, the Government  cannot broaden an indictment  so as\r\n\nto convict the defendant on different facts from those charged in\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nthe indictment\"), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 929 (1973).  As a result\r                                        \r\n\nof this broadening  of the indictment, he  states, the Government\r\n\nwas allowed to argue a \"grab bag\" of theories and ask the jury to\r\n\nguess as to which agreement Mitchell contemplated.\r\n\n          This   argument  is   substantially  answered   by  our\r\n\ndiscussion  of Griffin above.   It is manifest  that the district\r                                \r\n\ncourt instruction that  the jury  could find  Mitchell guilty  on\r\n\nCount I  if the government  proved either  of the objects  of the\r\n\nconspiracy complies with Griffin.   See Griffin, 502 U.S.  at 56-\r                                                         \r\n\n57.  Indeed, an instruction that both objects of the multi-object\r\n\nconspiracy had to be proved would go  against the cited case law.\r\n\nAs  the district court  did not err  in presenting the  charge in\r\n\nthis  manner, the fairness and  integrity of the proceedings were\r\n\nnot  affected,  contrary  to  Mitchell's   contention  otherwise.\r\n\nSimilarly, Mitchell's argument that  the instructions allowed the\r\n\njury to  use conjecture as to  his role is quickly  dismissed, as\r\n\nthe  instructions  clearly  limit  the jury  to  the  indictment,\r\n\nrequiring them  to reach unanimity to find guilt on either of the\r\n\ntwo  objects  of the  conspiracy.   Finally,  to the  extent that\r\n\nMitchell's  position is  that the instructions  were inconsistent\r\n\nwith  the Government's argument at  trial, he is  on shaky ground\r\n\ngiven  that from the start of the trial the Government approached\r\n\nthe  conspiracy  charge  as  a  multiple  object  conspiracy,  as\r\n\ndemonstrated  by its  opening argument  (describing the  arson as\r\n\n\"the first object of the conspiracy\" and separately outlining the\r\n\nalleged  wire fraud  (Day  3, pp.  55  - 58))  and  proposed jury\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ninstructions  (\"you need not . . .  find that the defendant . . .\r\n\nconspired to commit both arson and wire fraud.\").\r\n\n          Second,  although he never states it  in so many words,\r\n\nMitchell seems to contend that there was insufficient evidence to\r\n\nprove the wire fraud charge of  the conspiracy, and thus the jury\r\n\nverdict  was against  the  weight of  the evidence.   As  we have\r\n\nestablished  that \"'a  guilty verdict  on an  indictment charging\r\n\nseveral acts  in the conjunctive, . . . stands if the evidence is\r\n\nsufficient  with  respect  to  any one  of  the  acts  charged,'\"\r\n\nGriffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57 (quoting Turner, 396 U.S. at 420), and\r                                                    \r\n\nMitchell does not contest  the sufficiency of the evidence  as to\r\n\nthe charge  of conspiracy to  commit arson,9  this position  must\r\n\nalso fail.\r\n\n                   V.  THE MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL\r                             V.  THE MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL\r\n\n          Mitchell's next contention also centers on the evidence\r\n\n--  or lack thereof -- regarding the alleged conspiracy to commit\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9  Mitchell lists  the elements the Government  had to prove  for\r\nboth objects of the conspiracy, but the only evidence he actually\r\nquestions, regarding the use  of interstate wire facilities, goes\r\nsolely to the wire fraud claim.\r\n\n   In a  footnote, Mitchell also  argues that the  court expanded\r\nthe  conspiracy's scope \"by allowing the Government to argue that\r\nMitchell caused Gallant to  file false and fraudulent information\r                         \r\nwith the  insurance company.\"   (Appellant's Brief, p.  34 n.39).\r\nHe  maintains that the Government  was allowed to  prove its case\r\nagainst  Mitchell  by  showing  (1)  that  he  was  partners with\r\nGallant,  and (2)  that  Gallant  filed  a  claim  for  insurance\r\nproceeds without  Mitchell's assistance.   As this  argument also\r\ngoes solely to  the sufficiency  of the  evidence regarding  wire\r\nfraud,  and there  is  no challenge  to  the sufficiency  of  the\r\nevidence  on the conspiracy to  commit arson charge,  we need not\r\naddress it.\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nwire fraud.   18 U.S.C.    1343.10  He  posits that the  district\r\n\ncourt  committed  reversible  error  in denying  his  motion  for\r\n\njudgment  of acquittal  because  there was  no evidence  that the\r\n\ndefendant filed, or caused  to be filed, an insurance  claim.  As\r\n\nhe does not  specify which count or counts he  contends should be\r\n\nreversed,  we focus  on Count  I, the  conspiracy count,  as this\r\n\nevidence clearly goes to the insurance fraud claim, not the arson\r\n\nclaim.    We  review  Mitchell's \"challenge  to  the  evidentiary\r\n\nsufficiency of  the government's  case by examining  'whether the\r\n\ntotal  evidence,  taken  in  the  light  most  amicable  to   the\r\n\nprosecution, together with all reasonable inferences favorable to\r\n\nit, would  allow  a  rational  factfinder to  conclude  beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt that  the  defendant was  guilty as  charged.'\"\r\n\nUnited States v.

To prove\r\n\nwire fraud  the Government had to prove:  \"1) a scheme to defraud\r\n\nby  means of  false  pretenses, 2)  the  defendant's knowing  and\r\n\nwillful  participation in the scheme  with the intent to defraud,\r\n\nand 3) the use of  interstate wire communications in  furtherance\r\n\nof the scheme.\"  Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1011.  The Government failed\r                                   \r\n\nto prove the first prong of the test because it did not show that\r\n\nMitchell  made   any  false  representations  to   the  insurance\r\n\ncarriers, and so there  was no false pretense.   Instead, Gallant\r\n\nwas responsible for preparing  and presenting the insurance claim\r\n\nand proof  of loss to the insurers.  The prosecution did not show\r\n\nMitchell knew or reasonably  foresaw the filing of the  claims as\r\n\nthe consequence of  his conduct.   Since the Government's  theory\r\n\nwas that Mitchell hired  Wallace to burn the Building  because it\r\n\nhad been closed by the city and he could no longer operate it, it\r\n\nwas essential to  the Government's  claim to  show that  Mitchell\r\n\nknew the Club was insured  and made a claim for the  proceeds, or\r\n\ncaused another to do so.  However, Gallant testified that he made\r\n\nthe claim without Mitchell's assistance, and that he actually had\r\n\na  dispute  with  Mitchell  as  to  whether  a  claim  should  be\r\n\nprocessed.   The only evidence  that Mitchell filed  an insurance\r\n\nclaim was a letter from an Edward  Garguilo to David Collins, the\r\n\ninsurance broker,  but there was no  evidence connecting Mitchell\r\n\nto  this letter, and no  evidence showing that  the letter formed\r\n\nthe basis  for a request for  payment, and so it  cannot form the\r\n\nbasisfor anargument thatMitchell attemptedto consummatethe fraud.\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\n          Even  if we accept all  of his contentions  as true, at\r\n\nmost they establish that there  was insufficient evidence to find\r\n\nMitchell guilty  of  the  wire  fraud object  of  the  conspiracy\r\n\ncharge.   As we have noted, \"'if  a jury returns a guilty verdict\r\n\non an indictment charging several  acts in the conjunctive,'\"  as\r\n\nthe  arson and wire fraud  charges were made  here, \"'the verdict\r\n\nstands if the evidence is  sufficient with respect to any  one of\r\n\nthe  acts charged.'\"  Griffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57 (quoting Turner,\r                                                                          \r\n\n396 U.S.  at 420); see, e.g., Lanoue,  71 F.3d at 982-83; Nieves-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBurgos, 62  F.3d at 436.   As Mitchell does not  argue that there\r                \r\n\nwas insufficient evidence for  the arson charge, we deem  that he\r\n\nhas waived  the  opportunity to  do  so.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nZannino,  895  F.2d 1,  17  (1st  Cir.)

R. Evid. 803(6), because\r                                             \r\nGarguilo did not testify regarding the authenticity of the letter\r\nor  its  accuracy,  and there  was  no  testimony regarding  what\r\nhappened  to the  letter  after Collins  received  it.   However,\r\nSharon  Motyl,  a  claims  technician  for Insurance  Innovators,\r\ntestified  that the claims files  were maintained in the ordinary\r\ncourse of business  and included documents received  from a third\r\nparty.   She  specifically stated  that the  Garguilo letter  was\r\nmaintained  as part of the  pertinent claim file  in the ordinary\r\ncourse of business.  Given this, we doubt that the district court\r\nabused its discretion in admitting the letter.  See United States\r                                                                           \r\nv.

See United States  v. Akitoye,  923\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 221, 227  (1st Cir. 1991).

Here,  the district  court  found at  sentencing  that\r\n\nMitchell hired Wallace to burn the Club, as he was concerned that\r\n\nthe City of  Boston would not let the Club  reopen, and he wanted\r\n\nto collect the insurance  proceeds.  It also found  that Mitchell\r\n\ncalled the Club the night of the fire and, in  effect, instructed\r\n\nWallace to  start the fire.   Mitchell  challenges these  factual\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13   At the time of the offense that section stated:\r\n\n            If  the  defendant   was  an   organizer,\r\n            leader,  manager,  or  supervisor in  any\r\n            criminal  activity   [involving  four  or\r\n            fewer   participants],   increase  by   2\r\n            levels.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c) (1987).\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nfindings.  He  notes that Wallace  testified that, when  Mitchell\r\n\ncalled  him at the Club  on the night of the  fire, he asked \"are\r\n\nyou  going to do  it?\"  The  inference, Mitchell  argues, is that\r\n\nWallace  was a free agent.   Indeed, he  maintains, their contact\r\n\nwas almost  casual, and it was up to  Wallace to burn the Club or\r\n\nnot.  His argument is  of no avail.  There was evidence  at trial\r\n\nthat  Mitchell  initiated  discussion  of  the  arson,  recruited\r\n\nWallace to  carry it out, told him specifically how to do it, and\r\n\npromised to pay him.  Given the record, we find no clear error in\r\n\nthe district court's factual findings.  Compare United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBalogun, 989 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.  1993) (finding no clear error\r                 \r\n\nin trial court's application of   3B1.1(c) where the facts showed\r\n\ndefendant initiated the conspiracy,  received more money than his\r\n\nco-conspirator, paid  his co-conspirator  for his cooperation  in\r\n\nthe scheme,  and used  cars fraudulently  registered  to the  co-\r\n\nconspirator to stage accidents) with United States v.

McGregor, 11 F.3d 1133, 1139 (2d Cir. 1993),\r                                       \r\n\nin  arguing that section  3B1.1(a) does not apply  here.  In that\r\n\ncase, the  court found that a  drug dealer who asked  his wife to\r\n\ngive  a  package to  buyers was  not  an organizer  under section\r\n\n3B1.1, since it was  an isolated occurrence.  Mitchell  relies on\r\n\nMcGregor to argue  that the  isolated request  for assistance  he\r                  \r\n\nmade to Wallace did not rise to the level the Guideline requires,\r\n\nnoting that there was no evidence that they had acted  in concert\r\n\nfor any  other criminal  activity.   His  reliance is  misplaced,\r\n\nhowever.  The dealer in McGregor bought  and resold at least four\r                                          \r\n\nounces of cocaine  a week for over a year,  and involved his wife\r\n\non only one occasion.   His sentence reflected all his prior drug\r\n\ndealing  activity.  In this context, the court held that \"against\r\n\nthe  whole background of the case\" McGregor's use of his wife did\r\n\nnot  rise  to  the level  of  an  organizer,  leader, manager  or\r\n\nsupervisor.  Id.  at 1138  (noting that \"[i]f  McGregor had  been\r                          \r\n\ncharged  with drug activity on any other day during the preceding\r\n\nyear, he  would have received a  sentence without enhancement.\").\r\n\nIn the present case, the district court found that Mitchell hired\r\n\nWallace to  burn the Club and  instructed him how and  when to do\r\n\nit.  Clearly, these facts are distinguishable from the husband in\r\n\nMcGregor who  asks his  wife to give  buyers a  package since  he\r                  \r\n\nwould not be home to do it himself.  As the McGregor court noted,\r                                                              \r\n\n\"[i]n the usual  case, obtaining  the services  of a  participant\r\n\nwould make  one a  supervisor subject to  an enhanced  sentence.\"\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nId.  This is just such a usual case.14\r             \r\n\n          C.  Obstruction of Justice\r                    C.  Obstruction of Justice\r                                              \r\n\n          The district  court concluded that  Mitchell obstructed\r\n\njustice  through his  use of  his tape  recordings to  attempt to\r\n\ncover up the conspiracy  to commit arson, finding that  they were\r\n\nmade in an effort to create a false record, and were \"intended to\r\n\nmislead authorities  investigating this  case and to  deceive the\r\n\njury,  indeed, a judge, should the matter develop to that point.\"\r\n\n(Sentencing hearing, at 45).  The court accordingly increased the\r\n\nB.O.L. by  two additional  points.  See  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1.15   In\r                                                 \r\n\nhis brief, Mitchell does not contest the district court's factual\r\n\nfindings.   Instead, he makes  three arguments  designed to  show\r\n\nthat  his  use  of  the  tapes  did  not  rise  to  the level  of\r\n\nobstruction required to apply  this section.  We address  each in\r\n\nturn.\r\n\n          First, Mitchell  points out that the  investigation was\r\n\nnot obstructed in any  manner, as the investigators did  not know\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n14    Mitchell's point  that he  did  not conduct  other criminal\r\nactivity in  concert with Wallace  is irrelevant:   when weighing\r\napplication of  section 3B1.1(a),  the sentencing court  looks to\r\nthe criminal activity charged.   See, e.g., Balogun, 989  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n23.\r\n\n15  At the time of the offense that section stated:\r\n\n            If  the  defendant  willfully impeded  or\r\n            obstructed,  or  attempted  to impede  or\r\n            obstruct  the  administration of  justice\r\n            during  the investigation  or prosecution\r\n            of  the  instant  offense,  increase  the\r\n            offense level . . . by 2 levels.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3C1.1 (1987).\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nof the tapes' existence  until after his  arrest.  They were  not\r\n\nmisled  by them in  any way.   See United States  v. Manning, 955\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  770  (1st Cir.  1992) (finding  that  giving false  name to\r\n\narresting officers did not amount to obstruction of justice under\r\n\n  3C1.1, as  it did not mislead  them).  This  argument is a  red\r\n\nherring, however:   the guideline itself provides that it applies\r\n\nif a defendant attempts to obstruct the administration of justice\r\n\nnot  only   during  the   investigation,  but  also   during  the\r\n\nprosecution  of   an  offense.     Thus,   whether  or   not  the\r\n\ninvestigation  was impacted  by  the tapes  is irrelevant,  since\r\n\nMitchell used them at trial.\r\n\n          Mitchell's second argument is that his use of the tapes\r\n\ndid  not thwart the administration of justice, since there was no\r\n\nintimidation  of the witnesses,  and no  attempt to  prevent them\r\n\nfrom testifying  at trial.   This, too, is  a red herring,  since\r\n\nintimidating or influencing a witness is not required in order to\r\n\nfind obstruction of justice  under section 3C1.1.  Of  course, it\r\n\nis  one  method that  the commentary  to  that section  notes may\r\n\nprovide a  basis for finding a defendant  obstructed justice, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3C1.1  comment. (n.  1(d)), but the  commentary's list\r\n\nis, by its terms, not exclusive.\r\n\n          Finally, Mitchell argues that his use of the tapes does\r\n\nnot qualify for an enhancement under section 3C1.1 because he did\r\n\nnot use them as  an affirmative weapon, since they were only used\r\n\nfor  impeachment  purposes.    The  trial  court's  decision,  he\r\n\nmaintains, seeks to punish passive, defensive conduct designed to\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nprotect  the   cross-examination  process.     However,   as  the\r\n\nGovernment  points  out, Mitchell's  use  of  the tapes  was  not\r\n\npassive.   He used  portions of  the February  1 and  February 11\r\n\ntapes to demonstrate his  state of mind, and used  the February 7\r\n\ntape to cross-examine Wallace.\r\n\n          Indeed,  Mitchell  does   not  challenge  the  district\r\n\ncourt's factual finding that the tapes were made in an attempt to\r\n\ncreate a  false record, and we find no clear error in the court's\r\n\nfinding.   Given that, the  court's application of  section 3C1.1\r\n\nwas  clearly proper.  As  the current commentary  to that section\r\n\nnotes, \"producing or attempting  to produce a false . .  . record\r\n\nduring  a  .  . .  judicial  proceeding\" rises  to  the  level of\r\n\nobstructing justice.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of February 6, 1989, the Boston Fire Department responded to a multiple-alarm fire at 295-297 Franklin Street (the \"Building\"), in Boston, which was owned by Jack Gateman (\"Gateman\").   At that time, the defendant, James L. Mitchell (\"Mitchell\"), was a tenant occupying the Building's second, third and fourth floors, where he and his partner, Allen Gallant (\"Gallant\"), ran a private social club known as \"Club 297\" (the \"Club\").   The Club had been ordered closed by the City of Boston for violation of City codes in January 1989.   On the day of the fire, several men, including Ronald Wallace (\"Wallace\"), had been working on repairs at the Club.   Wallace testified at trial that during the course of that day Mitchell told him he would pay him $11,000 to set fire to the Building, making an initial payment.   Mitchell returned to his home in Vermont, while Wallace returned to the Club.   Mitchell called the Club from his car telephone, and spoke to Wallace, who testified that Mitchell asked him whether he would set the fire.   After the phone call, Wallace went to the fourth floor of the Building and set some mattresses stacked there on fire.   He and the other men in the Club fled the Building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next months, Mitchell wired Wallace sums of money through Western Union.   Evidence was entered that Gallant reported the loss the Club suffered in the fire to the Club's insurance broker, and pursued the claim through an insurance broker.   Testimony at trial established that some $59,400 was paid out on the Club's policies, most of which went to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1991, Mitchell was charged under a twenty-two count indictment with conspiracy, arson, use of fire to commit a felony, and wire fraud.   He was prosecuted on six of those counts.   After a jury trial, he was found guilty on the conspiracy and arson charges, but acquitted of the remaining counts.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ADMISSION OF SEIZED EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, who found the following facts.   See United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 723 (1st Cir.1995) (\"We recite the facts adduced at a suppression hearing in the light most favorable to the district court's ruling to the extent that they derive support from the record and are not clearly erroneous.\").   On the night of the fire, Lieutenant Paul R. LeBlanc (\"Lt. LeBlanc\") of the Fire Investigation Unit reported to the scene of the fire.   After it was \"put down,\" within an hour or so of being reported to the Fire Department at 9:15 p.m., Lt. LeBlanc entered the premises, along with two associates, in order to determine the cause and origin of the fire.   He seized carpet samples and sections of stair rises, later entered in evidence at trial.   Irregular burn patterns prompted him to suspect that the fire was not accidental, and that it originated on the fourth floor.   Adequate photographs could not be taken, however, since there was no light and the water on the floor precluded reliable flash photography.   The following morning, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., Lieutenant Roy Burrill (\"Lt. Burrill\"), also of the Fire Investigation Unit, was sent to the site without a warrant.   He seized two sections of flooring from the fourth floor.   A third search was conducted by First Security Company, a private investigation company hired by Gateman to determine the cause of the fire.   They also seized samples from the fourth floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mitchell challenges the trial court's admission of the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill, on the basis that there were no exigent circumstances justifying his entrance without a warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States claims that Mitchell waived the right to appeal the admission of this evidence by failing to object within ten days to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation on the defendant's Motion to Suppress the Physical Evidence.   See Rule 3(b), Rules for United States Magistrates in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.   As the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge itself pointed out, we have repeatedly indicated that failure to comply with Rule 3(b) precludes review by this court.   See, e.g., United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1986);  United States v. Vega, 678 F.2d 376, 379 (1st Cir.1982) (\"There can be no appeal from a magistrate's report and recommendation unless objections are filed thereto.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell now maintains that his objection to the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill has been saved from waiver despite his failure to object because, subsequent to the report and recommendation, the district court issued an order stating it would reconsider the suppression issue as regards the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill.   In that order, the district court requested, among other things, that Mitchell identify the portions of memoranda and evidence the court should consider in deciding the motion to suppress the evidence seized.   All of the seized evidence offered was admitted at trial.   We need not delve into the intricacies of whether the district court order effectively revived Mitchell's motion to suppress the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill, however, as we find that the district court did not err in admitting the disputed evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Analysis of Search and Seizure Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally, in the context of a motion to suppress, we have reviewed the district court's findings of fact, as well as any mixed findings of law and fact, for clear error.   See United States v. Schiavo, 29 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 929 F.2d 780, 783 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1030 (1992).   A recent Supreme Court case, however, determines that \"as a general matter determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo on appeal.\"  Ornelas v. United States, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663 (1996) (noting that findings of historical fact are reviewed only for clear error and that \"due weight\" should be given \"to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers\").   Therefore, to the extent that our analysis turns on making those determinations, our review is de novo, as is our review of the district court findings of law.   See Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d at 726.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis is framed by two Supreme Court decisions:  Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S. 499, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978), and Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U.S. 287, 104 S.Ct. 641, 78 L.Ed.2d 477 (1984).   The basic Fourth Amendment framework is clear.  \"Courts have consistently followed 'one governing principle' in interpreting [the Fourth Amendment]:  except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is 'unreasonable' unless it has been authorized by a 'valid search warrant.' \"  Mann v. Cannon, 731 F.2d 54, 58 (1st Cir.1984) (quoting Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 528-29, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1731, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967)).   Nonetheless, \"a warrantless entry by criminal law enforcement officials may be legal when there is compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.\"  Tyler, 436 U.S. at 509, 98 S.Ct. at 1949.   Mitchell's core contention here is that there were no such exigent circumstances in the present case, and so Lt. Burrill's warrantless search was unconstitutional, and the evidence he seized should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analysis in Michigan v. Tyler controls our decision.   In Tyler, a fire broke out in a furniture store shortly before midnight;  the fire had been reduced to \"smoldering embers\" when the Fire Chief reported to the scene at 2:00 a.m.  Id. at 501, 98 S.Ct. at 1946.   He concluded that the fire was possibly the result of arson, and called a police detective, who took some photographs, but \"abandoned his efforts because of the smoke and steam.\"  Id. at 502, 98 S.Ct. at 1946.   After a brief survey through the rest of the building to look for further evidence of the cause of the fire, the Chief and police detective left the site.   Four hours later, the Chief returned with the Assistant Chief, whose task it was to determine the origin of all fires in the township.   The fire was out, and the building was empty.   They quickly left, returning with the police detective around 9:00 a.m.   They found suspicious burn marks, not visible earlier, and took samples of carpet and stairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rejecting the premise that \"the exigency justifying a warrantless entry to fight a fire ends, and the need to get a warrant begins, with the dousing of the last flame,\" id. at 510, 98 S.Ct. at 1950, the Court found the two searches conducted on the morning after the fire were constitutionally permitted.   After noting that the investigation on the night of the fire was hindered by the darkness as well as the steam and smoke, the Court found that the fire officials</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>departed at 4 a.m. and returned shortly after daylight to continue their investigation.   Little purpose would have been served by their remaining in the building, except to remove any doubt about the legality of the warrantless search and seizure later that same morning.   Under these circumstances, we find that the morning entries were no more than an actual continuation of the first....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 511, 98 S.Ct. at 1951.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts here closely parallel those of Tyler.   Lt. LeBlanc entered the scene after the fire was \"put down,\" and within roughly an hour of the time the fire was reported, in order to determine the cause and origin of the fire.   The investigation was hampered by the lack of light and by the presence of water on the floor:  photographs could not be taken.   The following morning, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., roughly twelve hours after the fire had been reported, Lt. Burrill entered the scene in order to take additional samples.   He removed the water and debris from the fourth floor, and then seized two sections of flooring, the challenged evidence.   These facts speak for themselves:  Lt. Burrill's search and seizure was clearly a continuation of the first search by Lt. LeBlanc.   Unlike in Tyler, of course, the same individual did not conduct both searches, but both fire officials were of the same Fire Investigation Unit.   Ultimately, as in Tyler, the \"investigation of the fire's origin was [ ] temporarily suspended on account of the conditions on the scene and resumed at the first opportunity when the conditions hampering the investigation subsided.\"  Clifford, 464 U.S. at 301, 104 S.Ct. at 650.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Lt. Burrill's morning entrance onto the premises was in fact a continuation of the nighttime search is underscored by the distinctions the Court drew between its decision in Clifford and its Tyler holding.   In Clifford, a fire broke out in a private residence and the fire department reported to the scene at about 5:42 in the morning.   The fire was extinguished, and the fire officials and police left the premises at 7:04 a.m.   At about 1:00 p.m. that afternoon a fire investigator arrived at the scene, having been informed that the fire department suspected arson.   Despite the fact that the house was being boarded up on behalf of the out-of-town owners, the Cliffords, and despite their knowledge that the Cliffords did not plan to return that day, the fire investigator and his partner searched the house.   After determining that the fire had been set in the basement, and how, the investigators searched the entire house, taking photographs.  Id. at 289-91, 104 S.Ct. at 645-46.   In finding that the challenged search by the fire investigator was not a continuation of an earlier search, as in Tyler, and in distinguishing between the two cases, the Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Between the time the firefighters had extinguished the blaze and left the scene and the arson investigators first arrived about 1:00 p.m. to begin their investigation, the Cliffords had taken steps to secure the privacy interests that remained in their residence against further intrusion.   These efforts separate the entry made to extinguish the blaze by that made later by different officers to investigate its origin.   Second, the privacy interests in the residence--particularly after the Cliffords had acted--were significantly greater than those in the fire-damaged furniture store [in Tyler ], making the delay between the fire and the mid-day search unreasonable absent a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 296, 104 S.Ct. at 648.   These facts play no role here:  there was no evidence of an effort to secure the burned-out premises, and the heightened privacy interests a property owner has in a home are not present.   See id. at 296, 104 S.Ct. at 648 (noting that \"privacy interests are especially strong in a private residence.\").   Unlike the private dwelling in Clifford, this was a commercial property.   Mitchell points out that he was in Vermont at the time of the fire in the premises he had leased;  however, he made no effort to arrange for the premises to be closed off, unlike the defendants in Clifford, who were similarly away from their home.   These facts permitted the magistrate judge to conclude that the search by Lt. Burrill was merely a continuation of Lt. LeBlanc's search, and, thus, that \"there was simply nothing unreasonable, in Fourth Amendment terms, to [sic] reentering the building and completing the already commenced investigation of the cause and origin of the fire when circumstances--i.e., adequate lighting provided by daylight and removal of the debris and water--first reasonably permitted.\"  (Report and Recommendation, page 11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Clifford the Court laid out three factors for analyzing the constitutionality of warrantless searches of fire-damaged premises:whether there are legitimate privacy interests in the fire-damaged property that are protected by the Fourth Amendment;  whether exigent circumstances justify the government intrusion regardless of any reasonable expectation of privacy;  and, whether the object of the search is to determine the cause of the fire or to gather evidence of criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clifford, 464 U.S. at 291, 104 S.Ct. at 646;  see Mann, 731 F.2d at 59-60 (weighing the Clifford factors in evaluating warrantless entry onto private premises for health and safety reasons).   First, as noted, Mitchell can have had few privacy interests in the Building.  \"Privacy expectations will vary with the type of property, the amount of fire damage, the prior and continued use of the premises, and in some cases the owner's efforts to secure it against intruders.\"  Clifford, 464 U.S. at 292, 104 S.Ct. at 646;  see Mann, 731 F.2d at 59 (noting that privacy considerations in virtually abandoned residence used as storehouse were minimal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell focuses his argument on the second factor, exigent circumstances.   As he notes, at the time Lt. Burrill entered the grounds, the fire was out, there were no people in the building, and there was no danger of further damage, or of flammable materials being present.   However, the Court has clearly established that \"officials need no warrant to remain in a building for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of a blaze after it has been extinguished.\"  Tyler, 436 U.S. at 510, 98 S.Ct. at 1950;  see Clifford, 464 U.S. at 293, 104 S.Ct. at 647 (noting that \"[b]ecause determining the cause and origin of a fire serves a compelling public interest, the warrant requirement does not apply in such cases.\").   Because the magistrate judge properly found that Lt. Burrill's entrance onto the premises was in fact a continuation of Lt. LeBlanc's search, and there is no question as to that search's constitutionality, Mitchell's exigent circumstances argument fails.   Indeed, this is precisely the level of exigency--the fire was extinguished, the building was empty, and conditions had hampered investigations the night before--whose constitutionality the Supreme Court upheld in Tyler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third Clifford factor examines the purpose of the search.   Here, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's finding that Lt. LeBlanc entered the site to determine the cause and origin of the fire, and that Lt. Burrill \"was dispatched to the scene for the purpose of taking additional samples.\"   The lower court concluded that there was no showing that the fire department suspected arson when Lt. Burrill was sent to the scene of the fire.   Indeed, Lt. LeBlanc was only one of three investigators on the scene, and no evidence was presented that the other investigators shared his opinions, much less that any of them communicated their impressions to Lt. Burrill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, however, Mitchell seems to challenge that finding, stating that Lt. Burrill<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> \"entered the premises without a warrant specifically to look for and seize evidence of arson.\"  (Brief of Appellant, p. 14).   Mitchell's counsel contended at oral argument that the magistrate judge's finding that Lt. Burrill did not suspect arson was improbable, and that common sense should indicate that Lt. LeBlanc communicated his findings to Lt. Burrill.   We disagree.   Lt. Burrill testified that as soon as he started his shift he was sent to the scene, and that \"[f]requently after a fire has occurred at night, they send the day crew to the scene ... because of the benefit of daylight, it [is] easier to get samples.\"  (Day 1, p. 96).   Lt. LeBlanc, in turn, testified that the Fire Investigation Unit reported to the fire because it was a multiple-alarm fire, to which the Unit's response is automatic.   Based on this testimony and our deferential standard of review, we see no reason to find that the court erred in its finding of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the above, we affirm the district court's refusal to suppress the evidence from Lt. Burrill's search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ADMISSION OF THE TAPED CONVERSATIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to and after the fire, Mitchell tape-recorded a series of telephone conversations he had with other people, including Wallace and Gallant, without their consent or knowledge.   Excerpted portions of three of these tapes were admitted at trial.   On appeal, Mitchell argues that the district court committed reversible error in limiting the use of the tapes, for two reasons.   First, he maintains, the taped conversations were admissible to show bias and inconsistent testimony.   Second, he contends that all the tapes, not just fragments of them, were admissible for purposes of impeachment.   As he does not specify, in either his brief or at oral argument, which tapes he actually seeks to enter, why each portion should be played, or the purpose for which each excerpt not previously admitted should now be allowed, we limit our discussion to those tapes actually entered at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party waives a right when it makes an \" 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment' \" of it.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938));  see United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564, 571 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1441, 131 L.Ed.2d 320 (1995).   However, if a defendant merely fails to make a timely assertion of that right, only forfeiture results.  Olano, 507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. at 1777;  see Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).   The distinction is a key one, for</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>[m]ere forfeiture, as opposed to waiver, does not extinguish an \"error\" under Rule 52(b)....   If a legal rule was violated during the District Court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an \"error\" within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite the absence of a timely objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 733-34, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   In short, where there was forfeiture, we apply a plain error analysis;  where there was waiver, we do not.   See United States v. Lakich, 23 F.3d 1203, 1207 (7th Cir.1994) (noting that the \" 'Plain Error Rule' may only be invoked in instances of 'forfeited-but-reversible error,' .... because if there has been a valid waiver, there is no 'error' for us to correct.\");   see, e.g., United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino, 61 F.3d 986, 995 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that where defendant did not object to prosecution's use of taped conversations, the issue was not preserved for appeal, but plain error analysis applied);  Marder, 48 F.3d at 571 (holding that, because there was no waiver, plain error analysis applied).   See generally, United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972-73 (1st Cir.1995) (stating the policy reasons and rationale for the raise-or-waive rule).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Tapes</p>\n    <p>1. The February 7, 1989 Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell recorded two conversations between himself and Wallace on February 7, 1989.   Defendant sought to enter portions from that tape as evidence of prior inconsistent statements.   At a hearing on the admissibility of the tape outside of the jury's presence, the following colloquy ensued (Mr. Prince is the defense counsel, Mr. Cloherty the prosecutor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  ....  Mr. Cloherty, what is the Government's position on playing all of the February 7 tape with the exception of the two edits we discussed?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. CLOHERTY:  We would want the entire tape played with the exception of those edits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  And that remains agreeable to the defendant?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR. PRINCE:  Yes, Your Honor, and Mr. Cloherty and I will edit the conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 5, pp. 112-13).   At the start of the next day of trial, the court asked the attorneys whether the tapes had been \"edited to [their] mutual satisfaction\";  Mitchell's counsel did not disagree when the prosecution stated that they had.  (Day 6, p. 5).   Nor did he object when the tapes were offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, Mitchell has waived any objection to the court's failure to play the entire tape.   Not only did he not object to the use of the tape, but he affirmatively stated that he was agreeable to the use of the edited tape--there was a \"direct inquiry from the court\" and an \"unequivocal assent\" from counsel for the defense.  Marder, 48 F.3d at 571 (holding that defendant did not waive issue where there was no such clear colloquy, but merely a failure to object).   That action raises his later silence from mere forfeiture to waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The February 1, 1989 Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell next sought to introduce excerpts from a conversation taped between Mitchell and Gallant prior to the fire.   He offered the dialogue, which discussed re-opening the Club, as evidence of his then-existing state of mind.   See Fed.R.Evid. 803(3).   The court stated that the entire tape could not be played, on the basis that most of it was irrelevant and inadmissible.   However, the next day, based on a transcript indicating what excerpts the defendant wanted to use, and which of those the government objected to, the court admitted all the excerpts Mitchell requested.   Mitchell now appears to contend that the entire tape should have been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Mitchell merely submitted the entire tape, and the court only admitted excerpts, the defense's failure to object that the remainder of the tape was not submitted to the jury may only have resulted in forfeiture, Olano, 507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. at 1777, as there may have been no \" 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right,' \" and so no waiver.  Id. (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)).   But the defense's actions went beyond this:  Mitchell took an active role in limiting the portions considered by the district court by providing the excerpts himself.   Ultimately, the court admitted all the excerpts he submitted.   This, paired with his failure to object, raises his acts to the level of waiver.   See Marder, 48 F.3d at 570-71.   Indeed, Mitchell does not offer any argument as to why we should not deem the portions not actually offered as waived.   We will not look beyond the waiver and ask whether the court committed plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The February 11, 1989 Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third tape discussed at trial was a February 11, 1989, recording of Mitchell's conversation with his partner Gallant about whether the Club had insurance at the time of the fire.   At a hearing on the tape's admissibility prior to Gallant's testimony, the court characterized it as \"a really transparent effort by the defendant, Mr. Mitchell, knowing that he was accused of setting the arsons [sic], ... [to say] all sorts of things that would be very inadmissible and also things of doubtful admissibility on the stand.\"  (Day 9, p. 7).   Accordingly, the court ruled that the tape was inadmissible to prove state of mind under Fed.R.Evid. 803(3), as the conversation occurred after the fire.   The defense objected on the basis that the tape was in fact relevant to the defendant's state of mind regarding the alleged wire fraud, and the court reconsidered its ruling.   Accordingly, it requested a marked-up transcript of the portions of the tape the defense sought to admit on that basis, so it could \"see what is at issue.\"  (Day 9, p. 141).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the court held that the first of the two marked pages defendant submitted could be admitted;  it was read to the jury later that day, without a limiting instruction.   The court also allowed the second submitted page to be entered, but as a prior inconsistent statement, and gave a limiting instruction to the jury.   Defense counsel did not object to the court's rulings.   For the same reasons discussed above, as the only portions of the tape the defense actually submitted to the court were entered, and there was no objection entered, we find that the defense waived any appeal that the remainder of the tape should have been admitted.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we find that the defendant has waived the right to argue that these three tapes should have been admitted in their totality, we need not consider his contentions that they were admissible to show bias and inconsistent testimony or for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell challenges the district court's jury instructions regarding the conspiracy charge.   We review the propriety of jury instructions for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1022 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Campusano, 947 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1991).   Accordingly, \"[w]e must look at the instructions in light of the evidence and determine whether they 'fairly and adequately submit[ ] the issues in the case to the jury.' \"  United States v. Picciandra, 788 F.2d 39, 46 (1st Cir.)  (quoting United States v. Fischbach and Moore, Inc., 750 F.2d 1183, 1195 (3d Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1029, 105 S.Ct. 1397, 84 L.Ed.2d 785 and sub nom.  Sargent Elec. Co. v. United States, 470 U.S. 1085, 105 S.Ct. 1846, 85 L.Ed.2d 145 (1985)), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 847, 107 S.Ct. 166, 93 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986).   For the reasons stated below, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in making its instructions to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I of the indictment alleged that Mitchell conspired with Wallace to violate the arson statute, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i), and the wire fraud statute, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The charge was made in the conjunctive.   The district court, however, instructed the jury in the disjunctive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first count charges a conspiracy to commit arson and a conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove the defendant is guilty of Count 1, the government doesn't have to prove that any demonstrated conspiracy had both laws or a violation of both laws as its object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It's sufficient that the government prove either the conspiracy to commit arson or the conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But you have to unanimously agree.   That is essential.   When you deliberate, all 12 of you have to agree on everything.   So it would be insufficient if six of you thought there was a conspiracy to commit arson and six of you thought there was a conspiracy to commit wire fraud.   You have to unanimously agree, or try to.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if you agree unanimously that a conspiracy to violate one of those statutes has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, that's sufficient to find the defendant guilty on Count 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Day 12, pp. 159-60).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Mitchell contends that the court's instruction that finding him guilty of one of the two conspiracies is sufficient impermissibly broadened the allegations in Count I so as to create, in effect, two conspiracy counts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answering defendant's argument we take our lead from the Supreme Court.   In Griffin v. United States, 502 U.S. 46, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991), the petitioner was charged with a conspiracy alleged to have two objects, but was implicated in only one of those.   The court instructed the jury that it could return a guilty verdict against petitioner if it found that she had participated in either of the two objects, and the jury returned a general verdict of guilty, without specifying on which count it relied.  Id. at 47-48, 112 S.Ct. at 468-69.   Faced with the question whether the verdict should be set aside because the evidence was insufficient for one of the objects, the Court affirmed the verdict.   In so doing, it relied on a common law rule dating back to pre-revolutionary England stating that \" '[w]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, ... the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.' \"  Id. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 473 (quoting Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S.Ct. 642, 654, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970));  see United States v. Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d 431, 436 (1st Cir.1995) (discussing Griffin and the relevant case law).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Accordingly, in United States v. Lanoue, 71 F.3d 966 (1st Cir.1995), where the district court instructed the jury \"that it could convict Lanoue of conspiracy if it found he conspired to commit any one or more of six object offenses\" listed in the conspiracy count, id. at 979, we held that, as there was sufficient evidence for one of the object offenses, we did not need to decide whether there was sufficient evidence of a conspiracy to commit any or all of the other object offenses, id. at 982-83 (holding that the fact that there was sufficient evidence allowed a new trial despite vacation of the conspiracy count on other grounds).   Likewise, in United States v. Nieves-Burgos, we applied Griffin to uphold the jury verdict where there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty for only one of three violations alleged in one charge.  62 F.3d at 436.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell does not frame his argument in terms of Griffin and its progeny, however.   Rather, he seems to make two intertwined arguments.   First, he contends that Count I must be read to charge him with only one offense, namely, agreeing to burn the Building and using interstate wire facilities to transfer money to Wallace.   The instructions, he maintains, expanded this offense into two, opening him up to the danger of being convicted on facts different from those charged.   A \"court may not substantially amend the indictment through its instructions to the jury.\"  United States v. Stewart Clinical Lab., Inc., 652 F.2d 804, 807 (9th Cir.1981) (reversing a conviction where the indictment charged defendants with violating one subsection of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396h(b)(2) but the government's case proved a violation of another);  see also United States v. Trexler, 474 F.2d 369, 371 (5th Cir.)  (stating that \"[a]s a general rule, the Government cannot broaden an indictment so as to convict the defendant on different facts from those charged in the indictment\"), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 929, 93 S.Ct. 2759, 37 L.Ed.2d 157 (1973).   As a result of this broadening of the indictment, he states, the Government was allowed to argue a \"grab bag\" of theories and ask the jury to guess as to which agreement Mitchell contemplated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is substantially answered by our discussion of Griffin above.   It is manifest that the district court instruction that the jury could find Mitchell guilty on Count I if the government proved either of the objects of the conspiracy complies with Griffin.   See Griffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 472-73.   Indeed, an instruction that both objects of the multi-object conspiracy had to be proved would go against the cited case law.   As the district court did not err in presenting the charge in this manner, the fairness and integrity of the proceedings were not affected, contrary to Mitchell's contention otherwise.   Similarly, Mitchell's argument that the instructions allowed the jury to use conjecture as to his role is quickly dismissed, as the instructions clearly limit the jury to the indictment, requiring them to reach unanimity to find guilt on either of the two objects of the conspiracy.   Finally, to the extent that Mitchell's position is that the instructions were inconsistent with the Government's argument at trial, he is on shaky ground given that from the start of the trial the Government approached the conspiracy charge as a multiple object conspiracy, as demonstrated by its opening argument (describing the arson as \"the first object of the conspiracy\" and separately outlining the alleged wire fraud (Day 3, pp. 55-58)) and proposed jury instructions (\"you need not ... find that the defendant ... conspired to commit both arson and wire fraud.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although he never states it in so many words, Mitchell seems to contend that there was insufficient evidence to prove the wire fraud charge of the conspiracy, and thus the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence.   As we have established that \" 'a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, ... stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged,' \" Griffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 473 (quoting Turner, 396 U.S. at 420, 90 S.Ct. at 654), and Mitchell does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence as to the charge of conspiracy to commit arson,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> this position must also fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell's next contention also centers on the evidence--or lack thereof--regarding the alleged conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  He posits that the district court committed reversible error in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because there was no evidence that the defendant filed, or caused to be filed, an insurance claim.   As he does not specify which count or counts he contends should be reversed, we focus on Count I, the conspiracy count, as this evidence clearly goes to the insurance fraud claim, not the arson claim.   We review Mitchell's \"challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency of the government's case by examining 'whether the total evidence, taken in the light most amicable to the prosecution, together with all reasonable inferences favorable to it, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty as charged.' \"  United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 979 (1st Cir.1992) (upholding district court's denial of motion for judgment of acquittal), cert. denied sub nom.  Sarraff v. United States, 508 U.S. 962, 113 S.Ct. 2935, 124 L.Ed.2d 684 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, Mitchell argues the following.   To prove wire fraud the Government had to prove:  \"1) a scheme to defraud by means of false pretenses, 2) the defendant's knowing and willful participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud, and 3) the use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1011.   The Government failed to prove the first prong of the test because it did not show that Mitchell made any false representations to the insurance carriers, and so there was no false pretense.   Instead, Gallant was responsible for preparing and presenting the insurance claim and proof of loss to the insurers.   The prosecution did not show Mitchell knew or reasonably foresaw the filing of the claims as the consequence of his conduct.   Since the Government's theory was that Mitchell hired Wallace to burn the Building because it had been closed by the city and he could no longer operate it, it was essential to the Government's claim to show that Mitchell knew the Club was insured and made a claim for the proceeds, or caused another to do so.   However, Gallant testified that he made the claim without Mitchell's assistance, and that he actually had a dispute with Mitchell as to whether a claim should be processed.   The only evidence that Mitchell filed an insurance claim was a letter from an Edward Garguilo to David Collins, the insurance broker, but there was no evidence connecting Mitchell to this letter, and no evidence showing that the letter formed the basis for a request for payment, and so it cannot form the basis for an argument that Mitchell attempted to consummate the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we accept all of his contentions as true, at most they establish that there was insufficient evidence to find Mitchell guilty of the wire fraud object of the conspiracy charge.   As we have noted, \" 'if a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive,' \" as the arson and wire fraud charges were made here, \" 'the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.' \"  Griffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 473 (quoting Turner, 396 U.S. at 420, 90 S.Ct. at 654);  see, e.g., Lanoue, 71 F.3d at 982-83;  Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d at 436.   As Mitchell does not argue that there was insufficient evidence for the arson charge, we deem that he has waived the opportunity to do so.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (applying \"the settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).   Thus the court did not err in refusing to grant the motion to acquit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. MITCHELL'S SENTENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell's final contention on appeal is that the district court erred by enhancing his Basic Offense Level<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> (\"B.O.L.\") by four points:  two points for his role in the offense as an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), and two points for obstruction of justice, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.   After noting our standard of review, we address each of these enhancements in turn.   For the reasons given below, we affirm the sentence given by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"When we review a district court's application of a sentencing guideline, we utilize a bifurcated process.   First, we review the guideline's legal meaning and scope de novo.   Next, we review the court's factfinding for clear error, giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts.\"  United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994) (citations omitted).  \" 'Due deference' in this context means that, absent mistake of law, we will review the sentencing court's fact based application of the guidelines only for 'clear error.' \"  United States v. McDonough, 959 F.2d 1137, 1141 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 925 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Manager or Supervisor of a Criminal Activity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court enhanced Mitchell's B.O.L. because it found he acted as Wallace's organizer in committing the crime.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In order to apply section 3B1.1(c), a court must first determine that there were at least two participants in the crime.   See United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir.1991).   Here, the two participants were Wallace and Mitchell himself.   See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 n. 13 (1st Cir.1993) (\"The defendant himself may be counted in determining the overall number of participants.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The second requirement for the application of section 3B1.1(c) is that the defendant exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for organizing the activities of, at least one other individual in committing the crime.\"  Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 227.   Here, the district court found at sentencing that Mitchell hired Wallace to burn the Club, as he was concerned that the City of Boston would not let the Club reopen, and he wanted to collect the insurance proceeds.   It also found that Mitchell called the Club the night of the fire and, in effect, instructed Wallace to start the fire.   Mitchell challenges these factual findings.   He notes that Wallace testified that, when Mitchell called him at the Club on the night of the fire, he asked \"are you going to do it?\"   The inference, Mitchell argues, is that Wallace was a free agent.   Indeed, he maintains, their contact was almost casual, and it was up to Wallace to burn the Club or not.   His argument is of no avail.   There was evidence at trial that Mitchell initiated discussion of the arson, recruited Wallace to carry it out, told him specifically how to do it, and promised to pay him.   Given the record, we find no clear error in the district court's factual findings.   Compare United States v. Balogun, 989 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1993) (finding no clear error in trial court's application of &#167; 3B1.1(c) where the facts showed defendant initiated the conspiracy, received more money than his co-conspirator, paid his co-conspirator for his cooperation in the scheme, and used cars fraudulently registered to the co-conspirator to stage accidents) with United States v. Castellone, 985 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1993) (refusing to uphold application of &#167; 3B1.1(c) where the district court did not find defendant controlled anyone else's movements) and United States v. Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217, 1221 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that \"in the absence of any evidence that [defendant] exercised control over [other] persons or was otherwise responsible for organizing them in the commission of the offense, the mere fact that [defendant] had dealt with a large quantity of marijuana does not support a finding that he was an organizer, leader, supervisor, or manager\" in conspiracy to distribute marijuana).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell seeks to rely on the Second Circuit's decision in United States v. McGregor, 11 F.3d 1133, 1139 (2d Cir.1993), in arguing that section 3B1.1(a) does not apply here.   In that case, the court found that a drug dealer who asked his wife to give a package to buyers was not an organizer under section 3B1.1, since it was an isolated occurrence.   Mitchell relies on McGregor to argue that the isolated request for assistance he made to Wallace did not rise to the level the Guideline requires, noting that there was no evidence that they had acted in concert for any other criminal activity.   His reliance is misplaced, however.   The dealer in McGregor bought and resold at least four ounces of cocaine a week for over a year, and involved his wife on only one occasion.   His sentence reflected all his prior drug dealing activity.   In this context, the court held that \"against the whole background of the case\" McGregor's use of his wife did not rise to the level of an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor.  Id. at 1138 (noting that \"[i]f McGregor had been charged with drug activity on any other day during the preceding year, he would have received a sentence without enhancement.\").   In the present case, the district court found that Mitchell hired Wallace to burn the Club and instructed him how and when to do it.   Clearly, these facts are distinguishable from the husband in McGregor who asks his wife to give buyers a package since he would not be home to do it himself.   As the McGregor court noted, \"[i]n the usual case, obtaining the services of a participant would make one a supervisor subject to an enhanced sentence.\"  Id. This is just such a usual case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Mitchell obstructed justice through his use of his tape recordings to attempt to cover up the conspiracy to commit arson, finding that they were made in an effort to create a false record, and were \"intended to mislead authorities investigating this case and to deceive the jury, indeed, a judge, should the matter develop to that point.\"  (Sentencing hearing, at 45).   The court accordingly increased the B.O.L. by two additional points.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  In his brief, Mitchell does not contest the district court's factual findings.   Instead, he makes three arguments designed to show that his use of the tapes did not rise to the level of obstruction required to apply this section.   We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Mitchell points out that the investigation was not obstructed in any manner, as the investigators did not know of the tapes' existence until after his arrest.   They were not misled by them in any way.   See United States v. Manning, 955 F.2d 770 (1st Cir.1992) (finding that giving false name to arresting officers did not amount to obstruction of justice under &#167; 3C1.1, as it did not mislead them).   This argument is a red herring, however:  the guideline itself provides that it applies if a defendant attempts to obstruct the administration of justice not only during the investigation, but also during the prosecution of an offense.   Thus, whether or not the investigation was impacted by the tapes is irrelevant, since Mitchell used them at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell's second argument is that his use of the tapes did not thwart the administration of justice, since there was no intimidation of the witnesses, and no attempt to prevent them from testifying at trial.   This, too, is a red herring, since intimidating or influencing a witness is not required in order to find obstruction of justice under section 3C1.1.   Of course, it is one method that the commentary to that section notes may provide a basis for finding a defendant obstructed justice, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 1(d)), but the commentary's list is, by its terms, not exclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mitchell argues that his use of the tapes does not qualify for an enhancement under section 3C1.1 because he did not use them as an affirmative weapon, since they were only used for impeachment purposes.   The trial court's decision, he maintains, seeks to punish passive, defensive conduct designed to protect the cross-examination process.   However, as the Government points out, Mitchell's use of the tapes was not passive.   He used portions of the February 1 and February 11 tapes to demonstrate his state of mind, and used the February 7 tape to cross-examine Wallace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Mitchell does not challenge the district court's factual finding that the tapes were made in an attempt to create a false record, and we find no clear error in the court's finding.   Given that, the court's application of section 3C1.1 was clearly proper.   As the current commentary to that section notes, \"producing or attempting to produce a false ... record during a ... judicial proceeding\" rises to the level of obstructing justice.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 3(c)) (1995);  see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 1(c)) (1987) (\"producing or attempting to produce an altered, forced, or counterfeit ... record during a ... trial\" may be a basis for applying &#167; 3C1.1);  see, e.g., United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959, 969 (1st Cir.1991) (finding that submission of altered passport as verification of defendant's identity met obstruction of justice standard);  cf. United States v. Ruiz-Batista, 956 F.2d 351, 353-54 (1st Cir.)  (upholding use of sentencing guideline commentary added after date of offense where commentary clarified what conduct could be considered in determining defendant's role), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 834, 113 S.Ct. 105, 121 L.Ed.2d 64 (1992).   As Mitchell produced a falsified record at trial, we uphold the district court's enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although he does not clearly state that his appeal is limited to the evidence admitted from Lt. Burrill's search, Mitchell's argument does not address the other two searches, and so we limit our analysis to Lt. Burrill's search and seizure.   We note in passing, however, that even if Mitchell has not waived the right to object to the admission of the evidence from the other searches, see infra, the district court undoubtedly did not err in admitting that evidence, for the very reasons pronounced by the magistrate judge.   First, Lt. LeBlanc's search was constitutional under the rationale of Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S. 499, 510, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978) (\"Officials need no warrant to remain in a building for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of a blaze after it has been extinguished.\").   Second, First Security Company's search was a purely private search and seizure that did not involve official action;  as such, it does not come under the Fourth Amendment, which does not proscribe unreasonable searches and seizures by private persons.   See United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In fact, defendant's brief refers to nameless \"Boston Fire Department Inspectors\" who entered the building on the day following the fire.   As Lt. Burrill is the only official fitting that description who seized evidence at issue here, we assume that defendant was describing him</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Mitchell's counsel stated that there were twenty-one tapes in all, with roughly twenty-eight hours of recordings.   Three tapes were actually entered at trial, but two other tapes were discussed.   First, defense counsel offered a tape of a conversation between Mitchell and David Collins, an insurance broker, in his cross-examination of Collins during voir dire outside the jury's presence, in order to refresh his recollection and knowledge.   At the prosecution objection to the tape being played, and after some discussion, the court excused the witness for the day so that the prosecution could hear the tape.   The next day, the following colloquy ensued (Mr. Prince is defense counsel;  Mr. Cloherty is the prosecutor):</p>\n        <p>THE COURT:  ....  Now, with regard to the Collins' [sic] telephone call, have you heard that tape?</p>\n        <p>MR. CLOHERTY:  Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n        <p>MR. PRINCE:  We have resolved that issue, Your Honor.</p>\n        <p>MR. CLOHERTY:  Mr. Prince isn't going to play it.   That's withdrawn.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT:  All right.</p>\n        <p>(Day 9, p. 12).   Since the tape was withdrawn, we do not consider it here.   Similarly, there was some discussion of a tape recorded on February 8, 1989, but defense counsel ultimately stated to the court that he would not be offering anything from that tape, and so we do not address it here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In United States v. Taylor, we stated that the \"raise-or-waive rule is not absolute.   But, rescue missions are restricted to the correction of 'plain' errors,\" 54 F.3d at 972, without delving into the difference between forfeiture and waiver.   We therefore note that the distinction we draw today between them does not conflict with Taylor, in that Taylor was concerned with failure to timely object--i.e., forfeiture.  Id. (noting that \"a litigant who deems himself aggrieved ... ordinarily must object then and there, or forfeit any right to complain at a later time.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The remaining five counts charged Mitchell with arson, wire fraud, and use of a fire to commit a felony.

Neither the indictment nor the jury instructions mention Gallant, however</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There is an important exception to the rule discussed in Griffin, however.  \"Griffin distinguishes cases ... which concern convictions that may have rested on a basis that was not supported by the evidence, from those concerning convictions possibly resting on an invalid ground as a result of an error of law.\"  Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d at 436;  see Griffin, 502 U.S. at 59, 112 S.Ct. at 474 (defining \"legal error\" as \"a mistake about the law, as opposed to a mistake concerning the weight or the factual import of the evidence\").   In the case of legal errors \" 'the proper rule to be applied is that which requires a verdict to be set aside where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.' \"  Id. at 52, 112 S.Ct. at 470 (quoting Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 312, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1073, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1957), overruled by Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978)).   However, appellant does not argue that the conviction rested on an invalid ground, due to an error of law;  rather, he focuses on the sufficiency of the evidence of the charges, the very concern at issue in Griffin.   Therefore, we need not discuss this exception here.   See id. at 55, 112 S.Ct. at 472 (noting that the exception has generally been applied \"to general-verdict convictions that may have rested on an unconstitutional ground.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Mitchell lists the elements the Government had to prove for both objects of the conspiracy, but the only evidence he actually questions, regarding the use of interstate wire facilities, goes solely to the wire fraud claim</p>\n        <p>In a footnote, Mitchell also argues that the court expanded the conspiracy's scope \"by allowing the Government to argue that Mitchell caused Gallant to file false and fraudulent information with the insurance company.\"  (Appellant's Brief, p. 34 n. 39).   He maintains that the Government was allowed to prove its case against Mitchell by showing (1) that he was partners with Gallant, and (2) that Gallant filed a claim for insurance proceeds without Mitchell's assistance.   As this argument also goes solely to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding wire fraud, and there is no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on the conspiracy to commit arson charge, we need not address it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> That section states, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio or television communication interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Mitchell argues that the court erred in allowing the letter sent by Garguilo in evidence under the \"business records\" exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed.R.Evid. 803(6), because Garguilo did not testify regarding the authenticity of the letter or its accuracy, and there was no testimony regarding what happened to the letter after Collins received it.   However, Sharon Motyl, a claims technician for Insurance Innovators, testified that the claims files were maintained in the ordinary course of business and included documents received from a third party.   She specifically stated that the Garguilo letter was maintained as part of the pertinent claim file in the ordinary course of business.   Given this, we doubt that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the letter.   See United States v. Moore, 923 F.2d 910, 915 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that review of admission of evidence under the business records exception is for abuse of discretion).

For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the decision of the district court on all points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of February 6, 1989, the Boston Fire Department responded to a multiple-alarm fire at 295-297 Franklin Street (the \"Building\"), in Boston, which was owned by Jack Gateman (\"Gateman\").   At that time, the defendant, James L. Mitchell (\"Mitchell\"), was a tenant occupying the Building's second, third and fourth floors, where he and his partner, Allen Gallant (\"Gallant\"), ran a private social club known as \"Club 297\" (the \"Club\").   The Club had been ordered closed by the City of Boston for violation of City codes in January 1989.   On the day of the fire, several men, including Ronald Wallace (\"Wallace\"), had been working on repairs at the Club.   Wallace testified at trial that during the course of that day Mitchell told him he would pay him $11,000 to set fire to the Building, making an initial payment.   Mitchell returned to his home in Vermont, while Wallace returned to the Club.   Mitchell called the Club from his car telephone, and spoke to Wallace, who testified that Mitchell asked him whether he would set the fire.   After the phone call, Wallace went to the fourth floor of the Building and set some mattresses stacked there on fire.   He and the other men in the Club fled the Building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next months, Mitchell wired Wallace sums of money through Western Union.   Evidence was entered that Gallant reported the loss the Club suffered in the fire to the Club's insurance broker, and pursued the claim through an insurance broker.   Testimony at trial established that some $59,400 was paid out on the Club's policies, most of which went to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1991, Mitchell was charged under a twenty-two count indictment with conspiracy, arson, use of fire to commit a felony, and wire fraud.   He was prosecuted on six of those counts.   After a jury trial, he was found guilty on the conspiracy and arson charges, but acquitted of the remaining counts.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ADMISSION OF SEIZED EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, who found the following facts.   See United States v. Martinez-Molina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196268\"><a href=\"/opinion/196268/united-states-v-martinez-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 723 (1st Cir.1995) (\"We recite the facts adduced at a suppression hearing in the light most favorable to the district court's ruling to the extent that they derive support from the record and are not clearly erroneous.\").   On the night of the fire, Lieutenant Paul R. LeBlanc (\"Lt. LeBlanc\") of the Fire Investigation Unit reported to the scene of the fire.   After it was \"put down,\" within an hour or so of being reported to the Fire Department at 9:15 p.m., Lt. LeBlanc entered the premises, along with two associates, in order to determine the cause and origin of the fire.   He seized carpet samples and sections of stair rises, later entered in evidence at trial.   Irregular burn patterns prompted him to suspect that the fire was not accidental, and that it originated on the fourth floor.   Adequate photographs could not be taken, however, since there was no light and the water on the floor precluded reliable flash photography.   The following morning, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., Lieutenant Roy Burrill (\"Lt. Burrill\"), also of the Fire Investigation Unit, was sent to the site without a warrant.   He seized two sections of flooring from the fourth floor.   A third search was conducted by First Security Company, a private investigation company hired by Gateman to determine the cause of the fire.   They also seized samples from the fourth floor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Mitchell challenges the trial court's admission of the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill, on the basis that there were no exigent circumstances justifying his entrance without a warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States claims that Mitchell waived the right to appeal the admission of this evidence by failing to object within ten days to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation on the defendant's Motion to Suppress the Physical Evidence.   See Rule 3(b), Rules for United States Magistrates in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.   As the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge itself pointed out, we have repeatedly indicated that failure to comply with Rule 3(b) precludes review by this court.   See, e.g., United States v. Valencia-Copete, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471042\"><a href=\"/opinion/471042/united-states-v-emiliano-valencia-copete/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1986);  United States v. Vega, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403767\"><a href=\"/opinion/403767/united-states-v-pablo-escoboza-vega/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span>, 379 (1st Cir.1982) (\"There can be no appeal from a magistrate's report and recommendation unless objections are filed thereto.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell now maintains that his objection to the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill has been saved from waiver despite his failure to object because, subsequent to the report and recommendation, the district court issued an order stating it would reconsider the suppression issue as regards the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill.   In that order, the district court requested, among other things, that Mitchell identify the portions of memoranda and evidence the court should consider in deciding the motion to suppress the evidence seized.   All of the seized evidence offered was admitted at trial.   We need not delve into the intricacies of whether the district court order effectively revived Mitchell's motion to suppress the evidence seized by Lt. Burrill, however, as we find that the district court did not err in admitting the disputed evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Analysis of Search and Seizure Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally, in the context of a motion to suppress, we have reviewed the district court's findings of fact, as well as any mixed findings of law and fact, for clear error.   See United States v. Schiavo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195480\"><a href=\"/opinion/195480/united-states-v-schiavo/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v.

A recent Supreme Court case, however, determines that \"as a general matter determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo on appeal.\"  Ornelas v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1657</span></a></span>, 1663 (1996) (noting that findings of historical fact are reviewed only for clear error and that \"due weight\" should be given \"to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers\").   Therefore, to the extent that our analysis turns on making those determinations, our review is de novo, as is our review of the district court findings of law.   See Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d at 726.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis is framed by two Supreme Court decisions:  Michigan v.

The basic Fourth Amendment framework is clear.  \"Courts have consistently followed 'one governing principle' in interpreting [the Fourth Amendment]:  except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is 'unreasonable' unless it has been authorized by a 'valid search warrant.' \"  Mann v.

Nonetheless, \"a warrantless entry by criminal law enforcement officials may be legal when there is compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.\"  Tyler, 436 U.S. at 509, 98 S.Ct. at 1949.   Mitchell's core contention here is that there were no such exigent circumstances in the present case, and so Lt. Burrill's warrantless search was unconstitutional, and the evidence he seized should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analysis in Michigan v. Tyler controls our decision.   In Tyler, a fire broke out in a furniture store shortly before midnight;  the fire had been reduced to \"smoldering embers\" when the Fire Chief reported to the scene at 2:00 a.m.  Id. at 501, 98 S.Ct. at 1946.   He concluded that the fire was possibly the result of arson, and called a police detective, who took some photographs, but \"abandoned his efforts because of the smoke and steam.\"  Id. at 502, 98 S.Ct. at 1946.   After a brief survey through the rest of the building to look for further evidence of the cause of the fire, the Chief and police detective left the site.   Four hours later, the Chief returned with the Assistant Chief, whose task it was to determine the origin of all fires in the township.   The fire was out, and the building was empty.   They quickly left, returning with the police detective around 9:00 a.m.   They found suspicious burn marks, not visible earlier, and took samples of carpet and stairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rejecting the premise that \"the exigency justifying a warrantless entry to fight a fire ends, and the need to get a warrant begins, with the dousing of the last flame,\" id. at 510, 98 S.Ct. at 1950, the Court found the two searches conducted on the morning after the fire were constitutionally permitted.   After noting that the investigation on the night of the fire was hindered by the darkness as well as the steam and smoke, the Court found that the fire officials</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>departed at 4 a.m. and returned shortly after daylight to continue their investigation.   Little purpose would have been served by their remaining in the building, except to remove any doubt about the legality of the warrantless search and seizure later that same morning.   Under these circumstances, we find that the morning entries were no more than an actual continuation of the first....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 511, 98 S.Ct. at 1951.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts here closely parallel those of Tyler.   Lt. LeBlanc entered the scene after the fire was \"put down,\" and within roughly an hour of the time the fire was reported, in order to determine the cause and origin of the fire.   The investigation was hampered by the lack of light and by the presence of water on the floor:  photographs could not be taken.   The following morning, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., roughly twelve hours after the fire had been reported, Lt. Burrill entered the scene in order to take additional samples.   He removed the water and debris from the fourth floor, and then seized two sections of flooring, the challenged evidence.   These facts speak for themselves:  Lt. Burrill's search and seizure was clearly a continuation of the first search by Lt. LeBlanc.   Unlike in Tyler, of course, the same individual did not conduct both searches, but both fire officials were of the same Fire Investigation Unit.   Ultimately, as in Tyler, the \"investigation of the fire's origin was [ ] temporarily suspended on account of the conditions on the scene and resumed at the first opportunity when the conditions hampering the investigation subsided.\"  Clifford, 464 U.S. at 301, 104 S.Ct. at 650.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Lt. Burrill's morning entrance onto the premises was in fact a continuation of the nighttime search is underscored by the distinctions the Court drew between its decision in Clifford and its Tyler holding.   In Clifford, a fire broke out in a private residence and the fire department reported to the scene at about 5:42 in the morning.   The fire was extinguished, and the fire officials and police left the premises at 7:04 a.m.   At about 1:00 p.m. that afternoon a fire investigator arrived at the scene, having been informed that the fire department suspected arson.   Despite the fact that the house was being boarded up on behalf of the out-of-town owners, the Cliffords, and despite their knowledge that the Cliffords did not plan to return that day, the fire investigator and his partner searched the house.   After determining that the fire had been set in the basement, and how, the investigators searched the entire house, taking photographs.  Id. at 289-91, 104 S.Ct. at 645-46.   In finding that the challenged search by the fire investigator was not a continuation of an earlier search, as in Tyler, and in distinguishing between the two cases, the Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Between the time the firefighters had extinguished the blaze and left the scene and the arson investigators first arrived about 1:00 p.m. to begin their investigation, the Cliffords had taken steps to secure the privacy interests that remained in their residence against further intrusion.   These efforts separate the entry made to extinguish the blaze by that made later by different officers to investigate its origin.   Second, the privacy interests in the residence--particularly after the Cliffords had acted--were significantly greater than those in the fire-damaged furniture store [in Tyler ], making the delay between the fire and the mid-day search unreasonable absent a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 296, 104 S.Ct. at 648.   These facts play no role here:  there was no evidence of an effort to secure the burned-out premises, and the heightened privacy interests a property owner has in a home are not present.   See id. at 296, 104 S.Ct. at 648 (noting that \"privacy interests are especially strong in a private residence.\").   Unlike the private dwelling in Clifford, this was a commercial property.   Mitchell points out that he was in Vermont at the time of the fire in the premises he had leased;  however, he made no effort to arrange for the premises to be closed off, unlike the defendants in Clifford, who were similarly away from their home.   These facts permitted the magistrate judge to conclude that the search by Lt. Burrill was merely a continuation of Lt. LeBlanc's search, and, thus, that \"there was simply nothing unreasonable, in Fourth Amendment terms, to [sic] reentering the building and completing the already commenced investigation of the cause and origin of the fire when circumstances--i.e., adequate lighting provided by daylight and removal of the debris and water--first reasonably permitted.\"  (Report and Recommendation, page 11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Clifford the Court laid out three factors for analyzing the constitutionality of warrantless searches of fire-damaged premises:whether there are legitimate privacy interests in the fire-damaged property that are protected by the Fourth Amendment;  whether exigent circumstances justify the government intrusion regardless of any reasonable expectation of privacy;  and, whether the object of the search is to determine the cause of the fire or to gather evidence of criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clifford, 464 U.S. at 291, 104 S.Ct. at 646;  see Mann, 731 F.2d at 59-60 (weighing the Clifford factors in evaluating warrantless entry onto private premises for health and safety reasons).   First, as noted, Mitchell can have had few privacy interests in the Building.  \"Privacy expectations will vary with the type of property, the amount of fire damage, the prior and continued use of the premises, and in some cases the owner's efforts to secure it against intruders.\"  Clifford, 464 U.S. at 292, 104 S.Ct. at 646;  see Mann, 731 F.2d at 59 (noting that privacy considerations in virtually abandoned residence used as storehouse were minimal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell focuses his argument on the second factor, exigent circumstances.   As he notes, at the time Lt. Burrill entered the grounds, the fire was out, there were no people in the building, and there was no danger of further damage, or of flammable materials being present.   However, the Court has clearly established that \"officials need no warrant to remain in a building for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of a blaze after it has been extinguished.\"  Tyler, 436 U.S. at 510, 98 S.Ct. at 1950;  see Clifford, 464 U.S. at 293, 104 S.Ct. at 647 (noting that \"[b]ecause determining the cause and origin of a fire serves a compelling public interest, the warrant requirement does not apply in such cases.\").   Because the magistrate judge properly found that Lt. Burrill's entrance onto the premises was in fact a continuation of Lt. LeBlanc's search, and there is no question as to that search's constitutionality, Mitchell's exigent circumstances argument fails.   Indeed, this is precisely the level of exigency--the fire was extinguished, the building was empty, and conditions had hampered investigations the night before--whose constitutionality the Supreme Court upheld in Tyler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third Clifford factor examines the purpose of the search.   Here, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's finding that Lt. LeBlanc entered the site to determine the cause and origin of the fire, and that Lt. Burrill \"was dispatched to the scene for the purpose of taking additional samples.\"   The lower court concluded that there was no showing that the fire department suspected arson when Lt. Burrill was sent to the scene of the fire.   Indeed, Lt. LeBlanc was only one of three investigators on the scene, and no evidence was presented that the other investigators shared his opinions, much less that any of them communicated their impressions to Lt. Burrill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, however, Mitchell seems to challenge that finding, stating that Lt. Burrill<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> \"entered the premises without a warrant specifically to look for and seize evidence of arson.\"  (Brief of Appellant, p. 14).   Mitchell's counsel contended at oral argument that the magistrate judge's finding that Lt. Burrill did not suspect arson was improbable, and that common sense should indicate that Lt. LeBlanc communicated his findings to Lt. Burrill.   We disagree.   Lt. Burrill testified that as soon as he started his shift he was sent to the scene, and that \"[f]requently after a fire has occurred at night, they send the day crew to the scene ... because of the benefit of daylight, it [is] easier to get samples.\"  (Day 1, p. 96).   Lt. LeBlanc, in turn, testified that the Fire Investigation Unit reported to the fire because it was a multiple-alarm fire, to which the Unit's response is automatic.   Based on this testimony and our deferential standard of review, we see no reason to find that the court erred in its finding of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the above, we affirm the district court's refusal to suppress the evidence from Lt. Burrill's search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ADMISSION OF THE TAPED CONVERSATIONS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to and after the fire, Mitchell tape-recorded a series of telephone conversations he had with other people, including Wallace and Gallant, without their consent or knowledge.   Excerpted portions of three of these tapes were admitted at trial.   On appeal, Mitchell argues that the district court committed reversible error in limiting the use of the tapes, for two reasons.   First, he maintains, the taped conversations were admissible to show bias and inconsistent testimony.   Second, he contends that all the tapes, not just fragments of them, were admissible for purposes of impeachment.   As he does not specify, in either his brief or at oral argument, which tapes he actually seeks to enter, why each portion should be played, or the purpose for which each excerpt not previously admitted should now be allowed, we limit our discussion to those tapes actually entered at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

In short, where there was forfeiture, we apply a plain error analysis;  where there was waiver, we do not.   See United States v.

The Tapes</p>\n    <p>1. The February 7, 1989 Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell recorded two conversations between himself and Wallace on February 7, 1989.   Defendant sought to enter portions from that tape as evidence of prior inconsistent statements.   At a hearing on the admissibility of the tape outside of the jury's presence, the following colloquy ensued (Mr. Prince is the defense counsel, Mr. Cloherty the prosecutor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  ....

CLOHERTY:  We would want the entire tape played with the exception of those edits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT:  And that remains agreeable to the defendant?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MR.

At the start of the next day of trial, the court asked the attorneys whether the tapes had been \"edited to [their] mutual satisfaction\";  Mitchell's counsel did not disagree when the prosecution stated that they had.  (Day 6, p. 5).   Nor did he object when the tapes were offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, Mitchell has waived any objection to the court's failure to play the entire tape.   Not only did he not object to the use of the tape, but he affirmatively stated that he was agreeable to the use of the edited tape--there was a \"direct inquiry from the court\" and an \"unequivocal assent\" from counsel for the defense.  Marder, 48 F.3d at 571 (holding that defendant did not waive issue where there was no such clear colloquy, but merely a failure to object).   That action raises his later silence from mere forfeiture to waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The February 1, 1989 Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell next sought to introduce excerpts from a conversation taped between Mitchell and Gallant prior to the fire.   He offered the dialogue, which discussed re-opening the Club, as evidence of his then-existing state of mind.   See Fed.R.Evid. 803(3).   The court stated that the entire tape could not be played, on the basis that most of it was irrelevant and inadmissible.   However, the next day, based on a transcript indicating what excerpts the defendant wanted to use, and which of those the government objected to, the court admitted all the excerpts Mitchell requested.   Mitchell now appears to contend that the entire tape should have been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Mitchell merely submitted the entire tape, and the court only admitted excerpts, the defense's failure to object that the remainder of the tape was not submitted to the jury may only have resulted in forfeiture, Olano, 507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. at 1777, as there may have been no \" 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right,' \" and so no waiver.  Id. (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 464, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103050\"><a href=\"/opinion/103050/johnson-v-zerbst/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></a></span> (1938)).   But the defense's actions went beyond this:  Mitchell took an active role in limiting the portions considered by the district court by providing the excerpts himself.   Ultimately, the court admitted all the excerpts he submitted.   This, paired with his failure to object, raises his acts to the level of waiver.   See Marder, 48 F.3d at 570-71.   Indeed, Mitchell does not offer any argument as to why we should not deem the portions not actually offered as waived.   We will not look beyond the waiver and ask whether the court committed plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. The February 11, 1989 Tape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third tape discussed at trial was a February 11, 1989, recording of Mitchell's conversation with his partner Gallant about whether the Club had insurance at the time of the fire.   At a hearing on the tape's admissibility prior to Gallant's testimony, the court characterized it as \"a really transparent effort by the defendant, Mr. Mitchell, knowing that he was accused of setting the arsons [sic], ... [to say] all sorts of things that would be very inadmissible and also things of doubtful admissibility on the stand.\"  (Day 9, p. 7).   Accordingly, the court ruled that the tape was inadmissible to prove state of mind under Fed.R.Evid. 803(3), as the conversation occurred after the fire.   The defense objected on the basis that the tape was in fact relevant to the defendant's state of mind regarding the alleged wire fraud, and the court reconsidered its ruling.   Accordingly, it requested a marked-up transcript of the portions of the tape the defense sought to admit on that basis, so it could \"see what is at issue.\"  (Day 9, p. 141).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the court held that the first of the two marked pages defendant submitted could be admitted;  it was read to the jury later that day, without a limiting instruction.   The court also allowed the second submitted page to be entered, but as a prior inconsistent statement, and gave a limiting instruction to the jury.   Defense counsel did not object to the court's rulings.   For the same reasons discussed above, as the only portions of the tape the defense actually submitted to the court were entered, and there was no objection entered, we find that the defense waived any appeal that the remainder of the tape should have been admitted.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we find that the defendant has waived the right to argue that these three tapes should have been admitted in their totality, we need not consider his contentions that they were admissible to show bias and inconsistent testimony or for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

The court instructed the jury that it could return a guilty verdict against petitioner if it found that she had participated in either of the two objects, and the jury returned a general verdict of guilty, without specifying on which count it relied.  Id. at 47-48, 112 S.Ct. at 468-69.   Faced with the question whether the verdict should be set aside because the evidence was insufficient for one of the objects, the Court affirmed the verdict.   In so doing, it relied on a common law rule dating back to pre-revolutionary England stating that \" '[w]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, ... the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.' \"  Id. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 473 (quoting Turner v.

Likewise, in United States v. Nieves-Burgos, we applied Griffin to uphold the jury verdict where there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty for only one of three violations alleged in one charge.  62 F.3d at 436.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell does not frame his argument in terms of Griffin and its progeny, however.   Rather, he seems to make two intertwined arguments.   First, he contends that Count I must be read to charge him with only one offense, namely, agreeing to burn the Building and using interstate wire facilities to transfer money to Wallace.   The instructions, he maintains, expanded this offense into two, opening him up to the danger of being convicted on facts different from those charged.   A \"court may not substantially amend the indictment through its instructions to the jury.\"  United States v. Stewart Clinical Lab., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391948\"><a href=\"/opinion/391948/united-states-v-stewart-clinical-laboratory-inc-edward-morris-jorgensen/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 807 (9th Cir.1981) (reversing a conviction where the indictment charged defendants with violating one subsection of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396h(b)(2) but the government's case proved a violation of another);  see also United States v. Trexler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"308732\"><a href=\"/opinion/308732/united-states-v-gene-roy-trexler/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, 371 (5th Cir.)  (stating that \"[a]s a general rule, the Government cannot broaden an indictment so as to convict the defendant on different facts from those charged in the indictment\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></span> (1973).   As a result of this broadening of the indictment, he states, the Government was allowed to argue a \"grab bag\" of theories and ask the jury to guess as to which agreement Mitchell contemplated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is substantially answered by our discussion of Griffin above.   It is manifest that the district court instruction that the jury could find Mitchell guilty on Count I if the government proved either of the objects of the conspiracy complies with Griffin.   See Griffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 472-73.   Indeed, an instruction that both objects of the multi-object conspiracy had to be proved would go against the cited case law.   As the district court did not err in presenting the charge in this manner, the fairness and integrity of the proceedings were not affected, contrary to Mitchell's contention otherwise.   Similarly, Mitchell's argument that the instructions allowed the jury to use conjecture as to his role is quickly dismissed, as the instructions clearly limit the jury to the indictment, requiring them to reach unanimity to find guilt on either of the two objects of the conspiracy.   Finally, to the extent that Mitchell's position is that the instructions were inconsistent with the Government's argument at trial, he is on shaky ground given that from the start of the trial the Government approached the conspiracy charge as a multiple object conspiracy, as demonstrated by its opening argument (describing the arson as \"the first object of the conspiracy\" and separately outlining the alleged wire fraud (Day 3, pp. 55-58)) and proposed jury instructions (\"you need not ... find that the defendant ... conspired to commit both arson and wire fraud.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although he never states it in so many words, Mitchell seems to contend that there was insufficient evidence to prove the wire fraud charge of the conspiracy, and thus the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence.   As we have established that \" 'a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, ... stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged,' \" Griffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 473 (quoting Turner, 396 U.S. at 420, 90 S.Ct. at 654), and Mitchell does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence as to the charge of conspiracy to commit arson,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> this position must also fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell's next contention also centers on the evidence--or lack thereof--regarding the alleged conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  He posits that the district court committed reversible error in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because there was no evidence that the defendant filed, or caused to be filed, an insurance claim.   As he does not specify which count or counts he contends should be reversed, we focus on Count I, the conspiracy count, as this evidence clearly goes to the insurance fraud claim, not the arson claim.   We review Mitchell's \"challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency of the government's case by examining 'whether the total evidence, taken in the light most amicable to the prosecution, together with all reasonable inferences favorable to it, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty as charged.' \"  United States v. Castro-Lara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587572\"><a href=\"/opinion/587572/united-states-v-ramon-castro-lara-united-states-of-america-v-abraham/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span>, 979 (1st Cir.1992) (upholding district court's denial of motion for judgment of acquittal), cert. denied sub nom.

United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span> (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially, Mitchell argues the following.   To prove wire fraud the Government had to prove:  \"1) a scheme to defraud by means of false pretenses, 2) the defendant's knowing and willful participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud, and 3) the use of interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1011.   The Government failed to prove the first prong of the test because it did not show that Mitchell made any false representations to the insurance carriers, and so there was no false pretense.   Instead, Gallant was responsible for preparing and presenting the insurance claim and proof of loss to the insurers.   The prosecution did not show Mitchell knew or reasonably foresaw the filing of the claims as the consequence of his conduct.   Since the Government's theory was that Mitchell hired Wallace to burn the Building because it had been closed by the city and he could no longer operate it, it was essential to the Government's claim to show that Mitchell knew the Club was insured and made a claim for the proceeds, or caused another to do so.   However, Gallant testified that he made the claim without Mitchell's assistance, and that he actually had a dispute with Mitchell as to whether a claim should be processed.   The only evidence that Mitchell filed an insurance claim was a letter from an Edward Garguilo to David Collins, the insurance broker, but there was no evidence connecting Mitchell to this letter, and no evidence showing that the letter formed the basis for a request for payment, and so it cannot form the basis for an argument that Mitchell attempted to consummate the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we accept all of his contentions as true, at most they establish that there was insufficient evidence to find Mitchell guilty of the wire fraud object of the conspiracy charge.   As we have noted, \" 'if a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive,' \" as the arson and wire fraud charges were made here, \" 'the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.' \"  Griffin, 502 U.S. at 56-57, 112 S.Ct. at 473 (quoting Turner, 396 U.S. at 420, 90 S.Ct. at 654);  see, e.g., Lanoue, 71 F.3d at 982-83;  Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d at 436.   As Mitchell does not argue that there was insufficient evidence for the arson charge, we deem that he has waived the opportunity to do so.   See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.)

Thus the court did not err in refusing to grant the motion to acquit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.

See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In order to apply section 3B1.1(c), a court must first determine that there were at least two participants in the crime.

Here, the two participants were Wallace and Mitchell himself.   See United States v.

Here, the district court found at sentencing that Mitchell hired Wallace to burn the Club, as he was concerned that the City of Boston would not let the Club reopen, and he wanted to collect the insurance proceeds.   It also found that Mitchell called the Club the night of the fire and, in effect, instructed Wallace to start the fire.   Mitchell challenges these factual findings.   He notes that Wallace testified that, when Mitchell called him at the Club on the night of the fire, he asked \"are you going to do it?\"   The inference, Mitchell argues, is that Wallace was a free agent.   Indeed, he maintains, their contact was almost casual, and it was up to Wallace to burn the Club or not.   His argument is of no avail.   There was evidence at trial that Mitchell initiated discussion of the arson, recruited Wallace to carry it out, told him specifically how to do it, and promised to pay him.   Given the record, we find no clear error in the district court's factual findings.   Compare United States v.

In that case, the court found that a drug dealer who asked his wife to give a package to buyers was not an organizer under section 3B1.1, since it was an isolated occurrence.   Mitchell relies on McGregor to argue that the isolated request for assistance he made to Wallace did not rise to the level the Guideline requires, noting that there was no evidence that they had acted in concert for any other criminal activity.   His reliance is misplaced, however.   The dealer in McGregor bought and resold at least four ounces of cocaine a week for over a year, and involved his wife on only one occasion.   His sentence reflected all his prior drug dealing activity.   In this context, the court held that \"against the whole background of the case\" McGregor's use of his wife did not rise to the level of an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor.  Id. at 1138 (noting that \"[i]f McGregor had been charged with drug activity on any other day during the preceding year, he would have received a sentence without enhancement.\").   In the present case, the district court found that Mitchell hired Wallace to burn the Club and instructed him how and when to do it.   Clearly, these facts are distinguishable from the husband in McGregor who asks his wife to give buyers a package since he would not be home to do it himself.   As the McGregor court noted, \"[i]n the usual case, obtaining the services of a participant would make one a supervisor subject to an enhanced sentence.\"  Id. This is just such a usual case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that Mitchell obstructed justice through his use of his tape recordings to attempt to cover up the conspiracy to commit arson, finding that they were made in an effort to create a false record, and were \"intended to mislead authorities investigating this case and to deceive the jury, indeed, a judge, should the matter develop to that point.\"  (Sentencing hearing, at 45).   The court accordingly increased the B.O.L. by two additional points.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  In his brief, Mitchell does not contest the district court's factual findings.   Instead, he makes three arguments designed to show that his use of the tapes did not rise to the level of obstruction required to apply this section.   We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Mitchell points out that the investigation was not obstructed in any manner, as the investigators did not know of the tapes' existence until after his arrest.   They were not misled by them in any way.   See United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577109\"><a href=\"/opinion/577109/united-states-v-charles-robert-manning-aka-john-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992) (finding that giving false name to arresting officers did not amount to obstruction of justice under &#167; 3C1.1, as it did not mislead them).   This argument is a red herring, however:  the guideline itself provides that it applies if a defendant attempts to obstruct the administration of justice not only during the investigation, but also during the prosecution of an offense.   Thus, whether or not the investigation was impacted by the tapes is irrelevant, since Mitchell used them at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mitchell's second argument is that his use of the tapes did not thwart the administration of justice, since there was no intimidation of the witnesses, and no attempt to prevent them from testifying at trial.   This, too, is a red herring, since intimidating or influencing a witness is not required in order to find obstruction of justice under section 3C1.1.   Of course, it is one method that the commentary to that section notes may provide a basis for finding a defendant obstructed justice, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 1(d)), but the commentary's list is, by its terms, not exclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mitchell argues that his use of the tapes does not qualify for an enhancement under section 3C1.1 because he did not use them as an affirmative weapon, since they were only used for impeachment purposes.   The trial court's decision, he maintains, seeks to punish passive, defensive conduct designed to protect the cross-examination process.   However, as the Government points out, Mitchell's use of the tapes was not passive.   He used portions of the February 1 and February 11 tapes to demonstrate his state of mind, and used the February 7 tape to cross-examine Wallace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Mitchell does not challenge the district court's factual finding that the tapes were made in an attempt to create a false record, and we find no clear error in the court's finding.   Given that, the court's application of section 3C1.1 was clearly proper.   As the current commentary to that section notes, \"producing or attempting to produce a false ... record during a ... judicial proceeding\" rises to the level of obstructing justice.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 3(c)) (1995);  see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 1(c)) (1987) (\"producing or attempting to produce an altered, forced, or counterfeit ... record during a ... trial\" may be a basis for applying &#167; 3C1.1);  see, e.g., United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568494\"><a href=\"/opinion/568494/united-states-v-alvaro-rojo-alvarez-united-states-v-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span>, 969 (1st Cir.1991) (finding that submission of altered passport as verification of defendant's identity met obstruction of justice standard);  cf. United States v. Ruiz-Batista, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577675\"><a href=\"/opinion/577675/united-states-v-elvis-leonidas-ruiz-batista/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 353-54 (1st Cir.)  (upholding use of sentencing guideline commentary added after date of offense where commentary clarified what conduct could be considered in determining defendant's role), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></span> (1992).   As Mitchell produced a falsified record at trial, we uphold the district court's enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although he does not clearly state that his appeal is limited to the evidence admitted from Lt. Burrill's search, Mitchell's argument does not address the other two searches, and so we limit our analysis to Lt. Burrill's search and seizure.   We note in passing, however, that even if Mitchell has not waived the right to object to the admission of the evidence from the other searches, see infra, the district court undoubtedly did not err in admitting that evidence, for the very reasons pronounced by the magistrate judge.   First, Lt. LeBlanc's search was constitutional under the rationale of Michigan v. Tyler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109874\"><a href=\"/opinion/109874/michigan-v-tyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 510, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109874\"><a href=\"/opinion/109874/michigan-v-tyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1942</span></a></span>, 1950, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109874\"><a href=\"/opinion/109874/michigan-v-tyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span> (1978) (\"Officials need no warrant to remain in a building for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of a blaze after it has been extinguished.\").   Second, First Security Company's search was a purely private search and seizure that did not involve official action;  as such, it does not come under the Fourth Amendment, which does not proscribe unreasonable searches and seizures by private persons.   See United States v. Jacobsen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111143\"><a href=\"/opinion/111143/united-states-v-jacobsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 113, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111143\"><a href=\"/opinion/111143/united-states-v-jacobsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1652</span></a></span>, 1656, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111143\"><a href=\"/opinion/111143/united-states-v-jacobsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span> (1984)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In fact, defendant's brief refers to nameless \"Boston Fire Department Inspectors\" who entered the building on the day following the fire.   As Lt. Burrill is the only official fitting that description who seized evidence at issue here, we assume that defendant was describing him</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Mitchell's counsel stated that there were twenty-one tapes in all, with roughly twenty-eight hours of recordings.   Three tapes were actually entered at trial, but two other tapes were discussed.   First, defense counsel offered a tape of a conversation between Mitchell and David Collins, an insurance broker, in his cross-examination of Collins during voir dire outside the jury's presence, in order to refresh his recollection and knowledge.   At the prosecution objection to the tape being played, and after some discussion, the court excused the witness for the day so that the prosecution could hear the tape.   The next day, the following colloquy ensued (Mr. Prince is defense counsel;  Mr. Cloherty is the prosecutor):</p>\n        <p>THE COURT:  ....  Now, with regard to the Collins' [sic] telephone call, have you heard that tape?</p>\n        <p>MR. CLOHERTY:  Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n        <p>MR. PRINCE:  We have resolved that issue, Your Honor.</p>\n        <p>MR. CLOHERTY:  Mr. Prince isn't going to play it.   That's withdrawn.</p>\n        <p>THE COURT:  All right.</p>\n        <p>(Day 9, p. 12).   Since the tape was withdrawn, we do not consider it here.   Similarly, there was some discussion of a tape recorded on February 8, 1989, but defense counsel ultimately stated to the court that he would not be offering anything from that tape, and so we do not address it here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In United States v. Taylor, we stated that the \"raise-or-waive rule is not absolute.   But, rescue missions are restricted to the correction of 'plain' errors,\" 54 F.3d at 972, without delving into the difference between forfeiture and waiver.   We therefore note that the distinction we draw today between them does not conflict with Taylor, in that Taylor was concerned with failure to timely object--i.e., forfeiture.  Id. (noting that \"a litigant who deems himself aggrieved ... ordinarily must object then and there, or forfeit any right to complain at a later time.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The remaining five counts charged Mitchell with arson, wire fraud, and use of a fire to commit a felony.

In the case of legal errors \" 'the proper rule to be applied is that which requires a verdict to be set aside where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.' \"  Id. at 52, 112 S.Ct. at 470 (quoting Yates v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105537\"><a href=\"/opinion/105537/yates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 312, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105537\"><a href=\"/opinion/105537/yates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, appellant does not argue that the conviction rested on an invalid ground, due to an error of law;  rather, he focuses on the sufficiency of the evidence of the charges, the very concern at issue in Griffin.   Therefore, we need not discuss this exception here.   See id. at 55, 112 S.Ct. at 472 (noting that the exception has generally been applied \"to general-verdict convictions that may have rested on an unconstitutional ground.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Mitchell lists the elements the Government had to prove for both objects of the conspiracy, but the only evidence he actually questions, regarding the use of interstate wire facilities, goes solely to the wire fraud claim</p>\n        <p>In a footnote, Mitchell also argues that the court expanded the conspiracy's scope \"by allowing the Government to argue that Mitchell caused Gallant to file false and fraudulent information with the insurance company.\"  (Appellant's Brief, p. 34 n. 39).   He maintains that the Government was allowed to prove its case against Mitchell by showing (1) that he was partners with Gallant, and (2) that Gallant filed a claim for insurance proceeds without Mitchell's assistance.   As this argument also goes solely to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding wire fraud, and there is no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on the conspiracy to commit arson charge, we need not address it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> That section states, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio or television communication interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n        <p>18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Mitchell argues that the court erred in allowing the letter sent by Garguilo in evidence under the \"business records\" exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed.R.Evid. 803(6), because Garguilo did not testify regarding the authenticity of the letter or its accuracy, and there was no testimony regarding what happened to the letter after Collins received it.   However, Sharon Motyl, a claims technician for Insurance Innovators, testified that the claims files were maintained in the ordinary course of business and included documents received from a third party.   She specifically stated that the Garguilo letter was maintained as part of the pertinent claim file in the ordinary course of business.   Given this, we doubt that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the letter.   See United States v. Moore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554888\"><a href=\"/opinion/554888/united-states-v-iona-m-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 915 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that review of admission of evidence under the business records exception is for abuse of discretion).   Even if it had, its error would not be prejudicial, as the letter was not relevant to the arson object of the conspiracy count</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> As the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of the sentencing were more onerous than those in effect at the time of the offense (Oct. 15, 1988), the district court applied the latter set of guidelines.
