This is an appeal from a bench\n\ntrial in a medical malpractice case brought under the Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b).           Kenyeda Taft, on behalf of her\n\nminor son, Melvin Harrison, sued Dr. Louis Laz, her obstetrician\n\nand a federal employee, for injuries allegedly sustained by Melvin\n\nduring his birth.     The complaint set forth two grounds for finding\n\nnegligence: failure to meet the standard of care and lack of\n\ninformed consent.      The district court, after a five-day trial,\n\nconcluded that Dr. Laz was not negligent under either theory and\n\nconcomitantly entered judgment for the defendant of record, the\nUnited States.    Plaintiff-appellant, Melvin Harrison, appeals the\n\njudgment on the informed consent claim.         For the reasons discussed\nbelow, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court\njudge.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            In 1996, Kenyeda Taft (\"Ms. Taft\") was pregnant with\n\nMelvin    Harrison,   her   second   child.     In   March   of   that   year,\nMs. Taft, almost four months pregnant, began her prenatal care at\nthe Lynn Community Health Center (\"Lynn CHC\") with an initial\nscreening visit conducted by a nurse practitioner.                During this\n\nvisit, Ms. Taft provided a medical history, including the fact that\n\nher first child, due to her large size of 9 pounds and 3 ounces,\n\nsuffered an injury during vaginal birth that resulted in Erb's\n\nPalsy.1\n\n1\n    Erb's Palsy is a brachial plexus injury, which results in\ndecreased mobility and functionality of the affected upper\n\n                                     -2-\n\f             Ms. Taft first met with Dr. Louis Laz (\"Dr. Laz\"), a\n\nBoard-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, at the Lynn CHC on\n\nApril 29, 1996.      Ms. Taft informed Dr. Laz that her first child\nsuffers from Erb's Palsy as a result of a shoulder dystocia,2 due\nto the baby's large size.         At the time, Dr. Laz's general practice\n\nwith patients who had had a prior large baby was to determine the\nestimated fetal weight by ultrasound at about 37 weeks' gestation.\n\nIf the estimated weight was 4500 grams or more, Dr. Laz would offer\n\nthe patient an elective Cesarean section (\"C-section\").                If the\n\nestimated weight was under this threshold, Dr. Laz would recommend\n\ninducing labor at 37 or 38 weeks' gestation.\n\n             In   addition   to   her    previous   large   child,   Ms.   Taft\n\npresented with other risk factors that increased the likelihood\nthat her second baby would also be large, and therefore more likely\n\nto suffer complications, such as a shoulder dystocia or brachial\n\nplexus injury, during a vaginal birth: she was pregnant with her\nsecond child, and second children are usually larger than first;\n\nthe fetus was male, and males are generally larger; Ms. Taft was an\n\nobese woman at the time of her pregnancy; Ms. Taft experienced\n\nexcessive weight gain during the pregnancy; and her prior delivery\n\nresulted in an Erb's Palsy injury.            While Dr. Laz recognized these\n\n\n\n\nextremity.\n2\n   Shoulder dystocia is a complication that can occur during a\nvaginal birth where the fetus' shoulders impede the fetus' passage\nthrough the birth canal after the head has been delivered.\nShoulder dystocia can cause Erb's Palsy, although Erb's Palsy can\nalso occur spontaneously.\n\n                                        -3-\n\frisk factors, he considered them to be normal birth risks and\n\ntherefore did not discuss them with Ms. Taft.\n\n           After     meeting     with    Ms.    Taft,     Dr.     Laz    obtained     the\ndelivery record for Ms. Taft's first child, Keneisha Taft, from\n\nSalem Hospital.           At trial, Dr. Laz testified that it was his\n\ngeneral practice to request the hospital delivery notes for any\npatient who had a history of delivery complications.                     The delivery\n\nrecord of Dr. Orkin, the treating obstetrician, indicated that\n\nKeneisha's birth occurred \"without any complications.\"                           Dr. Laz,\n\nconsidering the obstetrician's delivery notes to be the \"gold\n\nstandard of what happened at that delivery,\" concluded that Ms.\n\nTaft did not experience a shoulder dystocia during her first birth.\n\nTherefore,     Dr.   Laz     believed    that      the    Erb's    Palsy     developed\nspontaneously, rather than as a result of a shoulder dystocia.\n\nAlthough Dr. Laz testified that he would have discussed an elective\n\nC-section with a patient where there was documented evidence of a\nprior shoulder dystocia resulting in an injury, he did not do so in\n\nthis   case,      since    the   delivery      notes     did    not     document     such\n\ncomplication.\n\n             On    September     12,    1996,      at   approximately        37    weeks'\n\ngestation, in accordance with Dr. Laz's general practice, Ms. Taft\n\nhad an ultrasound at Union Hospital to estimate the fetal weight.\n\nThe ultrasound report estimated the fetal weight to be 3676 grams\n\n(a little over 8 pounds).          Because the estimated weight was under\n\nthe 4500     grams    threshold,       Dr.   Laz    determined        that   a    vaginal\n\ndelivery, as opposed to a C-section, was the appropriate mode of\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fchildbirth. Dr. Laz recommended to Ms. Taft that labor be induced,\n\nbut he did not discuss with her either the risks of vaginal birth\n\nor the possibility of a C-section.\n           On    September        17,    1996,    Ms.    Taft,      at   37.5   weeks'\n\ngestation, was admitted to Beverly Hospital for induction of labor.\n\nDuring labor, the baby's head crowned, but the shoulders did not\ndeliver.   Dr. Laz and the delivery team followed standard steps to\n\nattempt to resolve the shoulder dystocia.                 After these steps were\n\nunsuccessful, Dr. Laz delivered the posterior (right) arm, which\n\nthen allowed delivery of the baby at 12:46 a.m. on September 18.\n\nThe baby, Melvin Harrison, weighed 4508 grams (9 pounds and 15\n\nounces) at birth and had a weakness of the right arm and hand,\n\nwhich was subsequently diagnosed as Erb's Palsy.\n           The plaintiff filed suit against Dr. Laz for medical\n\nmalpractice in Essex County Superior Court. However, since Dr. Laz\n\nwas a federal employee at the time he treated Ms. Taft, the action\nwas removed to the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts,        and   the   United    States      was   substituted       as   the\n\ndefendant.      The plaintiff's suit was premised on two grounds of\n\nnegligence: (1) Dr. Laz's failure to meet the standard of care by\n\nnot originally offering an elective C-section and by not performing\n\na C-section during labor based on fetal heart monitorings; and (2)\n\nDr. Laz's failure to obtain Ms. Taft's informed consent by not\n\ndiscussing      the    risks      of    vaginal   birth       and   disclosing       the\n\nalternative of a C-section.             A bench trial began on December 18,\n\n2000.   At the close of the plaintiff's case, the district court\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fgranted the United States' motion for judgment as a matter of law\n\non the question of Dr. Laz's compliance with the standard of care\n\nduring labor.\n            At the conclusion of the trial, the district court\n\ndetermined that Dr. Laz did not fail to obtain the patient's\n\ninformed consent and entered judgment for the defendant. The court\nfound that, although the risks of vaginal birth for the baby were\n\n\"something more than negligible,\" when these risks were balanced\n\nagainst the risks to the mother from a C-section, \"a cesarean\n\nsection to avoid brachial plexus injury was not a reasonable\n\nmedical judgment.\"     Therefore, even though the court found that\n\nMs. Taft would have opted for a C-section if informed of the\n\npossibility,    the court concluded that \"Dr. Laz was under no duty\nto afford [Ms. Taft] the opportunity to have a cesarean section .\n\n. . .\"\n\n            The plaintiff appeals the court's judgment only on the\ninformed    consent   claim,   arguing   that   Dr.   Laz,   because   such\n\ninformation was material to her decision to deliver vaginally, did\n\nhave a duty to inform Ms. Taft of both the risks of vaginal birth\n\nand the availability of a C-section as an alternative method of\n\nchildbirth.\n\n                                   II.\n\n            We review a district court's factual findings for clear\n\nerror.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); La Esperanza de P.R., Inc. v.\n\nPรฉrez y Cรญa. de P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1997).           \"We\n\ndeem a finding to be clearly erroneous only when, after reviewing\n\n                                   -6-\n\fthe   entire   record,   we   are    left   with   the   definite    and   firm\n\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\"            La Esperanza, 124\n\nF.3d at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted).                 Questions of\nnegligence decided in a bench trial are treated as questions of\n\nfact, or as mixed questions of fact and law, and are therefore\n\nevaluated under this deferential standard.           See id. at 15-16.\n\n            However, when the district court's factual findings are\n\npremised on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant legal\n\nprinciples, we do not owe the court the same level of deference.\n\nSee United States v. 15 Bosworth St., 236 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); Vinick v. United States, 205 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\"Instead, we treat the trial court's conclusion as a question of\n\nlaw,\" Vinick, 205 F.3d at 7, and review it de novo.             15 Bosworth\n\nSt., 236 F.3d at 53.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b),\nstate law is \"the source of substantive liability.\"            Fed. Deposit\n\nIns. Corp. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 477-78 (1994).           To recover under\na theory of informed consent in Massachusetts, a patient must prove\nthat the physician has a duty to disclose certain information and\n\nthat a breach of that duty caused the patient's injury.             See Halley\n\nv. Birbiglia, 458 N.E.2d 710, 715 (Mass. 1983).              To establish a\nbreach of the physician's duty of disclosure, the plaintiff must\n\nestablish      that:   (1)    a     sufficiently    close    doctor-patient\nrelationship exists; (2) the doctor knows or should know of the\n\ninformation to be disclosed; (3) the information is such that the\n\n                                      -7-\n\fdoctor should reasonably recognize that it is material to the\n\npatient's decision; and (4) the doctor fails to disclose this\n\ninformation.    See id.   In this case, only the materiality of the\ninformation to the patient is contested.3\n            If a duty exists, a physician must disclose \"sufficient\n\ninformation to enable the patient to make an informed judgment\nwhether to give or withhold consent to a medical or surgical\n\nprocedure.\" Harnish v. Children's Hosp. Med. Ctr., 439 N.E.2d 240,\n\n242   (Mass.   1982).     Failure    to   do   so   constitutes   medical\n\nmalpractice.   See id.\n\n            There are two primary standards for determining the\n\nrequisite scope of the physician's disclosure in informed consent\n\ncases: \"customary practice\" and \"materiality.\"        See id. at 243-44;\nCanterbury v. Spence, 464 F.2d 772, 786-87 (D.C. Cir. 1972).         Many\n\njurisdictions require a physician to disclose whatever information\n\na reasonable physician in similar circumstances would customarily\ndisclose.   See Harnish, 439 N.E.2d at 243; Canterbury, 464 F.2d at\n\n786 & n.70.      The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, however, has\n\nrejected the customary practice standard as providing insufficient\n\nprotection for the patient's autonomy, which is the very purpose of\n\ndisclosure.4    See Harnish, 439 N.E.2d at 243-44; Precourt v.\n\n3\n   Appellee, in its brief, states that the doctor's knowledge of\nthe information is also disputed. However, the doctor's knowledge\nis not at issue given his and defense counsel's admission at trial\nthat he was aware of Ms. Taft's risk factors for delivering a large\nchild.\n4\n  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has, in prior cases,\ncited Canterbury with approval for its explanation rejecting the\ncustomary practice standard:\n\n                                    -8-\n\fFrederick, 481 N.E.2d 1144, 1149 (Mass. 1985) (balancing patient's\n\nright   to   self-determination     and    desire   to   not    unduly   burden\n\npractice of medicine).         Instead, Massachusetts has adopted the\n\"materiality\"     standard,     requiring    the    physician    to   disclose\n\n\"information he should reasonably recognize is material to the\n\n[patient's] decision.\"        Harnish, 439 N.E.2d at 243.\n\n             \"'Materiality may be said to be the significance a\n\nreasonable person, in what the physician knows or should know is\n\nhis patient's position, would attach to the disclosed risk or risks\n\nin deciding whether to submit or not to submit to surgery or\n\ntreatment.'\" Id. at 243 (quoting Wilkinson v. Vesey, 295 A.2d 676\n\n(R.I. 1972)).    Material information \"may include the nature of the\n\npatient's condition, the nature and probability of risks involved,\nthe benefits to be reasonably expected, . . . the likely result of\n\n\n             The decision to unveil the patient's condition\n             and the chances as to remediation, as we shall\n             see, is ofttimes a non-medical judgment and,\n             if so, is a decision outside the ambit of the\n             special [medical] standard. Where that is the\n             situation,    professional    custom    hardly\n             furnishes the legal criterion for measuring\n             the physician's responsibility to reasonably\n             inform his patient of the options and the\n             hazards as to treatment.\n                                 . . . .\n                  . . . Any definition of scope [of\n             disclosure] in terms purely of a professional\n             standard is at odds with the patient's\n             prerogative to decide on projected therapy\n             himself. That prerogative, we have said, is\n             at the very foundation of the duty to\n             disclose, and both the patient's right to know\n             and the physician's correlative obligation to\n             tell him are diluted to the extent that its\n             compass is dictated by the medical profession.\n\n464 F.2d 785-86.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fno treatment, and the available alternatives, including their risks\n\nand benefits.\"     Id.\n\n             Whether a risk of injury is material to a patient depends\nupon   the   severity    of   the   potential   injury    as   well   as   the\n\nprobability of its occurrence.        See Precourt, 481 N.E.2d at 1148.\n\nIf the likelihood of an injury occurring is negligible, then the\nrisk is not considered material, and the risk is insufficient to\n\ntrigger the physician's duty to disclose.5        See Feeley v. Baer, 679\n\nN.E.2d 180, 182 (Mass. 1997) (holding that physician had no duty to\n\ndisclose risk of serious infection because plaintiffs failed to\n\nprove that there was \"more than a negligible risk\"); Precourt, 481\n\nN.E.2d at 1148 (noting that a risk of injury \"cannot be considered\n\na material factor\" if the probability of its occurrence \"is so\nsmall as to be practically nonexistent\").                Similarly, if the\n\nseverity of the potential injury is \"very minor,\"               the risk is\n\nimmaterial and need not be disclosed. Precourt, 481 N.E.2d at 1149\n\n(quoting LaCaze v. Collier, 434 So.2d 1039, 1046 (La. 1983))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             In the case at hand, the plaintiff, citing to Feeley,\n\nargues that any risk that is more than negligible automatically\n\nqualifies as a material factor that must be disclosed. See Feeley,\n\n679 N.E.2d at 182 (stating that \"[t]he risk that must exist in\n\norder to invoke informed consent principles in this case is a more\n\n5\n    We note, however, that there is no \"magic number\" for\ndetermining whether a probability of injury is sufficient to make\nthe risk material. See Canterbury, 464 F.2d at 788 & n.86 (citing\ncases, among which one percent chance of loss of hearing was\nmaterial but 1.5 percent chance of loss of eye was not material).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthan negligible risk . . . .\"). The defendant, however, challenges\n\nthe   plaintiff's   understanding   of   the   Commonwealth's   informed\n\nconsent law.    The defendant argues that Feeley and the other\nMassachusetts informed consent cases indicate that materiality\n\nrequires more than just non-negligibility.       The defendant contends\n\nthat Feeley stands for the proposition that if a plaintiff can show\n\nevidence of only a negligible risk, then there is no duty to\n\ndisclose, because such a risk is, as a matter of law, not material.\n\nSee id., 679 N.E.2d at 182 (holding that there was no duty to\n\ndisclose because plaintiff failed to show \"more than a negligible\n\nrisk\").\n\n           The district court seemingly adopted the plaintiff's\n\ninterpretation of the law by stating that \"the doctor must inform\nthe patient where there exists more than a negligible risk of one\n\nor more serious consequences from the course of treatment that is\n\nbeing undertaken by the doctor.\"     After hearing the evidence, the\ncourt found that Dr. Laz was aware of the risk factors for a birth\n\ninjury and that these risk factors were \"something more than\n\nnegligible.\"   However, the court then weighed the risks to the\n\nmother of a C-section, which the court found to be \"more than\n\nnormally associated with the birth of a child,\" against the risks\n\nto the child of a vaginal birth and found \"that Dr. Laz was under\n\nno duty to afford [Ms. Taft] the opportunity to have a cesarean\n\nsection and on the particular circumstances of this case a cesarean\n\nsection to avoid brachial plexus injury was not a reasonable\n\nmedical judgment.\"\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f            We    believe       that    the     district     court   erred   in     its\n\ninterpretation of Massachusetts law, thereby triggering de novo\n\nreview of its finding that Dr. Laz owed no duty to disclose the\nrisks and alternative methods of childbirth.                  See 15 Bosworth St.,\n\n236 F.3d at 54; Vinick, 205 F.3d at 6-7.                      As discussed above,\n\nHarnish and Precourt establish materiality as the standard for\ndetermining      whether    a    physician       has    an   affirmative     duty    to\n\ndisclose.    See Harnish, 439 N.E.2d at 243 (noting duty to disclose\n\nmaterial information, but that this does not require the disclosure\n\nof all risks); Precourt, 481 N.E.2d at 1148-49 (recognizing duty to\n\ndisclose material information, which does not include \"remote\n\nrisks\").    However, Precourt reserved the issue of how to determine\n\nwhen a risk need not be disclosed, except for indicating there is\nno duty to disclose negligible risks:\n\n            The development of our law concerning the\n            distinction between risks that as a matter of\n            law may be considered remote, and those that\n            may be left to the determination of a fact\n            finder, must await future cases. It is clear,\n            however, that when, as in this case, the\n            evidence does not permit the jury to draw an\n            inference   that    the   physician  knew  or\n            reasonably   should    have  known  that  the\n            probability that a particular risk would\n            materialize was other than negligible, the\n            evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding\n            that the physician violated his duty of\n            disclosure.\n\n481 N.E.2d at 1149-50.\n\n            Feeley   did    not        change    this   materiality    approach      to\n\ninformed consent. In Feeley, a mother sued for medical malpractice\n\nwhen her child died from streptococcus pneumonia five days after\n\nbirth.      See 679 N.E.2d at 181.                The mother alleged that the\n\n                                          -12-\n\ftreating physician, who opted for spontaneous labor (as opposed to\n\ninducing labor) after her water broke, failed to disclose any risk\n\nof infection from this procedure.         See id.   The Supreme Judicial\nCourt of Massachusetts, citing Harnish and Precourt, undertook a\n\nmateriality analysis and concluded that \"[t]he evidence would not\n\npermit a finding that the risk to the child of serious infection\nwas more than negligible.\"       679 N.E.2d at 181.    Thus, because the\n\nseverity of the potential injury was minimal, the court concluded\n\nthat the information was not material, and the doctor, therefore,\n\nhad no duty to disclose.       See id. at 181-82.\n\n            The plaintiffs in Feeley, similar to the plaintiff in\n\nthis case, argued that there was more than a negligible risk and,\n\nas a result, that risk had to be disclosed.            See id.      On the\nparticular facts, however, the Feeley court determined that the\n\nrisk was not more than negligible.          See id. at 182.       Thus, the\n\ncourt stated that \"[t]he risk that must exist in order to invoke\ninformed consent principles in this case is a more than negligible\n\nrisk   of   one   or    more   infections    that   will   have     serious\nconsequences.\"    Id.    This context clarifies that the court was\n\nmerely negating any duty to disclose negligible risks.            The court\n\nwas not, as plaintiff argues, declaring an affirmative duty to\n\ndisclose any risk that is \"more than negligible.\"             Thus, the\n\ncaselaw stands for the proposition that there is no duty to\n\ndisclose negligible risks, not that all non-negligible risks are\n\nactionable if not revealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f             As a result, when the district court's analysis focused\n\non whether the risks were \"more than negligible\" rather than on\n\nmateriality,    the   district   court    applied   the    incorrect   legal\nstandard. Thus, we vacate the district court's judgment and remand\n\nthe case to the district court judge to assess the materiality of\n\nthe risks of vaginal birth to a reasonable person in Ms. Taft's\nposition.6\n\n             Moreover,   the   court   made   a   second   legal   error   by\n\nbalancing the risks to the child from a vaginal birth against the\n\nrisks to the mother from a C-section and concluding that, because\n\nthe C-section presented a greater risk and was therefore not\n\nmedically recommended, the doctor had no duty to disclose the risks\n\nof either procedure.     The materiality standard for disclosure does\nnot incorporate a balancing test by which the court can weigh the\n\nrisks of alternate treatments in deciding what information is\n\nmaterial to the patient.       An obstetrician in the delivery room is\nin the unique situation of having to take into account the best\n\ninterests of two individuals, mother and child, in rendering\n\nmedical care.     Cf. Thomas v. Ellis, 106 N.E.2d 687, 689-90 (Mass.\n\n1952) (holding that evidence could support finding of negligence\n\nwhere doctor's external turning of fetus' position, causing a\n\n6\n   Materiality, since it is a factual determination, is properly\nleft for the district court to determine.        See Kissinger v.\nLofgren, 836 F.2d 678, 681 (1st Cir. 1988) (finding that once jury\nhad heard evidence on likelihood and severity of injury, it was\njury's responsibility to determine materiality); Harnish, 439\nN.E.2d at 243; Canterbury, 464 F.2d at 787, 788, 794; McMahon v.\nFinlayson, 632 N.E.2d 410, 413 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (stating that\nmateriality is issue for the fact finder once there has been expert\ntestimony regarding the likelihood of the injury).\n\n                                   -14-\n\fseparated placenta, endangered health of both mother and child).\n\nAs such, in recommending a course of treatment to his patients, the\n\nstandard of care may require the doctor to consider the risks to\nthe mother, the risks to the child, and the appropriate balance of\n\nthese risks.\n\n          However, the standard of care that governs a conventional\nmedical malpractice case differs from the materiality standard that\n\ngoverns informed consent cases. See Steinhilber v. McCarthy, 26 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 265, 272, 274-75 (D. Mass. 1998) (analyzing doctor's\n\nnegligence under the standard of care of an average member of his\n\nprofession but his duty to disclose under materiality of the\n\ninformation).   Under informed consent law, if a risk to the baby or\n\na risk to the mother is material to the patient-mother's decision,\nthe doctor has a duty to disclose that risk.      See Harnish, 439\n\nN.E.2d at 243 (asserting that physician has duty to disclose \"all\n\nsignificant information that the physician possesses\" that is\nmaterial to the patient's decision).    Once these risks and other\n\nmaterial information have been disclosed, it is the patient's\nprerogative to balance these risks and choose the form of treatment\n\nthat best meets that patient's needs.    See Harnish, 439 N.E.2d at\n\n244 (declaring it is \"the patient's right to decide for himself\");\n\nCanterbury, 464 F.2d at 781 (\"To the physician, whose training\n\nenables a self-satisfying evaluation, the answer may seem clear,\n\nbut it is the prerogative of the patient, not the physician, to\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fdetermine for himself the direction in which his interests seem to\n\nlie.\").7\n\n           Thus, if, on remand, the district court finds that a risk\nexisted either as to the mother's health or as to the child's\n\nhealth and that such information would have been material to a\n\nreasonable patient in Ms. Taft's position, then Dr. Laz had a duty\nto disclose that risk.      Moreover, because there are only two\n\nmethods of childbirth, if the district court finds the risk of\n\nvaginal birth to be material to the patient, then Dr. Laz also had\n\na duty to present the alternative option of a C-section that   might\n\nminimize such risk, regardless of his medical opinion on the proper\n\ncourse of treatment.8\n\n\n\n\n7\n   The patient's opportunity to perform this balancing may assume\nparticular importance when the patient is a mother giving birth.\nIn such a case, the mother may purposefully discount risks to\nherself in order to choose a treatment or procedure that will\npresent the least risk to her newborn child. While the treating\nphysician will undoubtedly feel the need to balance the welfare of\nmother and child, the mother may consider her baby's health as the\nparamount concern. See Statement by American Medical Association\non Forced Cesarean Section Court Case in Chicago, U.S. Newswire,\nDecember 15, 1993, available at 1993 WL 7132850 (opining that in\ncases where there is a \"trade-off\" between the health of the mother\nand the child, \"pregnant women routinely choose\" and \"should\"\nchoose a cesarean section \"for the benefit of their fetuses,\" even\nthough the risk to the woman is higher than from a vaginal\ndelivery).\n8\n   We emphasize that a duty to disclose, if it exists, does not\nnecessarily indicate any duty to offer or to perform a C-section if\nthe doctor does not consider one to be warranted in his medical\njudgment. See Canterbury, 464 F.2d at 781 (separating physician's\nduty \"to treat [and diagnose] his patient skillfully\" from his\n\"obligation to communicate specific information to the patient\").\nThe duty to disclose is intended to be limited, so as not to unduly\nburden the practice of medicine. See Harnish, 439 N.E.2d at 243.\n\n                                -16-\n\f                                      IV.\n\n           The plaintiff also challenges on appeal the district\n\ncourt's analysis of his claim for damages arising out of the\n\nalleged malpractice.        The district court, in an effort to provide\n\na   \"complete   record   of    factual      findings,\"   analyzed   the   case\n\nbackwards, starting with an assessment of damages, then proceeding\n\nto causation, negligence, and duty, in that order.               Although we\n\nunderstand why the court engaged in this method of analysis, rather\n\nthan simply concluding its ruling after finding there was no duty\n\nto disclose, such analysis resulted in extraneous factual findings.\nTherefore, because the district court did not need to reach the\n\nissue of damages, any findings regarding damages are dicta; the\ndistrict court did not actually award any damages.              As a result,\nplaintiff's claims of error in computing the damages are premature.\n\nSee United States v. Ottati & Goss, Inc., 900 F.2d 429, 443 (1st\n\nCir.   1990)    (refusing     to   address    appeal   of   district   court's\nliability finding since such finding was not necessary to the\n\njudgment below).    Rather, plaintiff should raise his claims if, on\nremand, the district court finds Dr. Laz liable and awards damages.\n\n                                      V.\n\n           For the reasons discussed herein, we vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment and remand the case to the district court judge\n\nfor a determination of materiality.\n\n           Vacated and remanded for actions consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f",

Kenyeda Taft, on behalf of her minor son, Melvin Harrison, sued Dr. Louis Laz, her obstetrician and a federal employee, for injuries allegedly sustained by Melvin during his birth. The complaint set forth two grounds for finding negligence: failure to meet the standard of care and lack of informed consent. The district court, after a five-day trial, concluded that Dr. Laz was not negligent under either theory and concomitantly entered judgment for the defendant of record, the United States. Plaintiff-appellant, Melvin Harrison, appeals the judgment on the informed consent claim. For the reasons discussed below, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Kenyeda Taft (\"Ms.Taft\") was pregnant with Melvin Harrison, her second child. In March of that year, Ms. Taft, almost four months pregnant, began her prenatal care at the Lynn Community Health Center (\"Lynn CHC\") with an initial screening visit conducted by a nurse practitioner. During this visit, Ms. Taft provided a medical history, including the fact that her first child, due to her large size of 9 pounds and 3 ounces, suffered an injury during vaginal birth that resulted in Erb's Palsy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Taft first met with Dr. Louis Laz (\"Dr.Laz\"), a Board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, at the Lynn CHC on April 29, 1996. Ms. Taft informed Dr. Laz that her first child suffers from Erb's Palsy as a result of a shoulder dystocia,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> due to the baby's large size. At the time, Dr. Laz's general practice with patients who had had a prior large baby was to determine the estimated fetal weight by ultrasound at about 37 weeks' gestation. If the estimated weight was 4500 grams or more, Dr. Laz would offer the patient an elective Cesarean section (\"C-section\"). If the estimated weight was under this threshold, Dr. Laz would recommend inducing labor at 37 or 38 weeks' gestation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to her previous large child, Ms. Taft presented with other risk factors that increased the likelihood that her second baby would also be large, and therefore more likely to suffer complications, such as a shoulder dystocia or brachial plexus injury, during a vaginal birth: she was pregnant with her second child, and second children are usually larger than first; the fetus was male, and males are generally larger; Ms. Taft was an obese woman at the time of her pregnancy; Ms. Taft experienced excessive weight gain during the pregnancy; and her prior delivery resulted in an Erb's Palsy injury. While Dr. Laz recognized these risk factors, he considered them to be normal birth risks and therefore did not discuss them with Ms. Taft.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After meeting with Ms. Taft, Dr. Laz obtained the delivery record for Ms. Taft's first child, Keneisha Taft, from Salem Hospital. At trial, Dr. Laz testified that it was his general practice to request the hospital delivery notes for any patient who had a history of delivery complications. The delivery record of Dr. Orkin, the treating obstetrician, indicated that Keneisha's birth occurred \"without any complications.\" Dr. Laz, considering the obstetrician's delivery notes to be the \"gold standard of what happened at that delivery,\" concluded that Ms. Taft did not experience a shoulder dystocia during her first birth. Therefore, Dr. Laz believed that the Erb's Palsy developed spontaneously, rather than as a result of a shoulder dystocia. Although Dr. Laz testified that he would have discussed an elective C-section with a patient where there was documented evidence of a prior shoulder dystocia resulting in an injury, he did not do so in this case, since the delivery notes did not document such complication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 1996, at approximately 37 weeks' gestation, in accordance with Dr. Laz's general practice, Ms. Taft had an ultrasound at Union Hospital to estimate the fetal weight. The ultrasound report estimated the fetal weight to be 3676 grams (a little over 8 pounds). Because the estimated weight was under the 4500 grams threshold, Dr. Laz determined that a vaginal delivery, as opposed to a C-section, was the appropriate mode of childbirth. Dr. Laz recommended to Ms. Taft that labor be induced, but he did not discuss with her either the risks of vaginal birth or the possibility of a C-section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 1996, Ms. Taft, at 37.5 weeks' gestation, was admitted to Beverly Hospital for induction of labor. During labor, the baby's head crowned, but the shoulders did not deliver. Dr. Laz and the delivery team followed standard steps to attempt to resolve the shoulder dystocia. After these steps were unsuccessful, Dr. Laz delivered the posterior (right) arm, which then allowed delivery of the baby at 12:46 a.m. on September 18. The baby, Melvin Harrison, weighed 4508 grams (9 pounds and 15 ounces) at birth and had a weakness of the right arm and hand, which was subsequently diagnosed as Erb's Palsy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff filed suit against Dr. Laz for medical malpractice in Essex County Superior Court. However, since Dr. Laz was a federal employee at the time he treated Ms. Taft, the action was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and the United States was substituted as the defendant. The plaintiff's suit was premised on two grounds of negligence: (1) Dr. Laz's failure to meet the standard of care by not originally offering an elective C-section and by not performing a C-section during labor based on fetal heart monitorings; and (2) Dr. Laz's failure to obtain Ms. Taft's informed consent by not discussing the risks of vaginal birth and disclosing the alternative of a C-section. A bench trial began on December 18, 2000. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the district court granted the United States' motion for judgment as a matter of law on the question of Dr. Laz's compliance with the standard of care during labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the trial, the district court determined that Dr. Laz did not fail to obtain the patient's informed consent and entered judgment for the defendant. The court found that, although the risks of vaginal birth for the baby were \"something more than negligible,\" when these risks were balanced against the risks to the mother from a C-section, \"a cesarean section to avoid brachial plexus injury was not a reasonable medical judgment.\" Therefore, even though the court found that Ms. Taft would have opted for a C-section if informed of the possibility, the court concluded that \"Dr. Laz was under no duty to afford [Ms. Taft] the opportunity to have a cesarean section....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff appeals the court's judgment only on the informed consent claim, arguing that Dr. Laz, because such information was material to her decision to deliver vaginally, did have a duty to inform Ms. Taft of both the risks of vaginal birth and the availability of a C-section as an alternative method of childbirth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's factual findings for clear error. <i>See</i> Fed.

The defendant, however, challenges the plaintiff's understanding of the Commonwealth's informed consent law. The defendant argues that <i>Feeley</i> and the other Massachusetts informed consent cases indicate that materiality requires more than just non-negligibility. The defendant contends that <i>Feeley</i> stands for the proposition that if a plaintiff can show evidence of only a negligible risk, then there is no duty to disclose, because such a risk is, as a matter of law, not material. <i>See id.,</i> 679 N.E.2d at 182 (holding that there was no duty to disclose because plaintiff failed to show \"more than a negligible risk\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court seemingly adopted the plaintiff's interpretation of the law by stating that \"the doctor must inform the patient where there exists more than a negligible risk of one or more serious consequences from the course of treatment that is being undertaken by the doctor.\" After hearing the evidence, the court found that Dr. Laz was aware of the risk factors for a birth injury and that these risk factors were \"something more than negligible.\" However, the court then weighed the risks to the mother of a C-section, which the court found to be \"more than normally associated with the birth of a child,\" against the risks to the child of a vaginal birth and found \"that Dr. Laz was under no duty to afford [Ms. Taft] the opportunity to have a cesarean section and on the particular circumstances of this case a cesarean section to avoid brachial plexus injury was not a reasonable medical judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the district court erred in its interpretation of Massachusetts law, thereby triggering de novo review of its finding that Dr. Laz owed no duty to disclose the risks and alternative methods of childbirth. <i>See 15 Bosworth St.,</i> 236 F.3d at 54; <i>Vinick,</i> 205 F.3d at 6-7.

It is clear, however, that when, as in this case, the evidence does not permit the jury to draw an inference that the physician knew or reasonably should have known that the probability that a particular risk would materialize was other than negligible, the evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding that the physician violated his duty of disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">481 N.E.2d at 1149-50.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Feeley</i> did not change this materiality approach to informed consent. In <i>Feeley,</i> a mother sued for medical malpractice when her child died from streptococcus pneumonia five days after birth. <i>See</i> 679 N.E.2d at 181. The mother alleged that the treating physician, who opted for spontaneous labor (as opposed to inducing labor) after her water broke, failed to disclose any risk of infection from this procedure. <i>See id.</i> The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, citing <i>Harnish</i> and <i>Precourt,</i> undertook a materiality analysis and concluded that \"[t]he evidence would not permit a finding that the risk to the child of <i>serious</i> infection was more than negligible.\" 679 N.E.2d at 181. Thus, because the severity of the potential injury was minimal, the court concluded that the information was not material, and the doctor, therefore, had no duty to disclose. <i>See id.</i> at 181-82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in <i>Feeley,</i> similar to the plaintiff in this case, argued that there was more than a negligible risk and, as a result, that risk had to be disclosed. <i>See id.</i> On the particular facts, however, the <i>Feeley</i> court determined that the risk was <i>not</i> more than negligible. <i>See id.</i> at 182. Thus, the court stated that \"[t]he risk that must exist in order to invoke informed consent principles in this case is a more than negligible risk of one or more infections that will have serious consequences.\" <i>Id.</i> This context clarifies that the court was merely negating any duty to disclose negligible risks. The court was not, as plaintiff argues, declaring an affirmative duty to disclose any risk that is \"more than negligible.\" Thus, the caselaw stands for the proposition that there is no duty to disclose negligible risks, not that all non-negligible risks are actionable if not revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, when the district court's analysis focused on whether the risks were \"more than negligible\" rather than on materiality, the district court applied the incorrect legal standard. Thus, we vacate the district court's judgment and remand the case to the district court judge to assess the materiality of the risks of vaginal birth to a reasonable person in Ms. Taft's position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the court made a second legal error by balancing the risks to the child from a vaginal birth against the risks to the mother from a C-section and concluding that, because the C-section presented a greater risk and was therefore not medically recommended, the doctor had no duty to disclose the risks of either procedure. The materiality standard for disclosure does not incorporate a balancing test by which the court can weigh the risks of alternate treatments in deciding what information is material to the patient. An obstetrician in the delivery room is in the unique situation of having to take into account the best interests of two individuals, mother and child, in rendering medical care. <i>Cf. Thomas v. Ellis,</i> 329 Mass. 93, 106 N.E.2d 687, 689-90 (Mass.1952) (holding that evidence could support finding of negligence where doctor's external turning of fetus' position, causing a separated placenta, endangered health of both mother and child). As such, in recommending a course of treatment to his patients, the standard of care may require the doctor to consider the risks to the mother, the risks to the child, and the appropriate balance of these risks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the standard of care that governs a conventional medical malpractice case differs from the materiality standard that governs informed consent cases. <i>See Steinhilber v. McCarthy,</i> 26 F.Supp.2d 265, 272, 274-75 (D.Mass.1998) (analyzing doctor's negligence under the standard of care of an average member of his profession but his duty to disclose under materiality of the information). Under informed consent law, if a risk to the baby <i>or</i> a risk to the mother is material to the patient-mother's decision, the doctor has a duty to disclose that risk. <i>See Harnish,</i> 439 N.E.2d at 243 (asserting that physician has duty to disclose \"all significant information that the physician possesses\" that is material to the patient's decision). Once these risks and other material information have been disclosed, it is the patient's prerogative to balance these risks and choose the form of treatment that best meets that patient's needs. <i>See Harnish,</i> 439 N.E.2d at 244 (declaring it is \"the patient's right to decide for himself\"); <i>Canterbury,</i> 464 F.2d at 781 (\"To the physician, whose training enables a self-satisfying evaluation, the answer may seem clear, but it is the prerogative of the patient, not the physician, to determine for himself the direction in which his interests seem to lie.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if, on remand, the district court finds that a risk existed either as to the mother's health <i>or</i> as to the child's health and that such information would have been material to a reasonable patient in Ms. Taft's position, then Dr. Laz had a duty to disclose that risk. Moreover, because there are only two methods of childbirth, if the district court finds the risk of vaginal birth to be material to the patient, then Dr. Laz also had a duty to present the alternative option of a C-section that might minimize such risk, regardless of his medical opinion on the proper course of treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also challenges on appeal the district court's analysis of his claim for damages arising out of the alleged malpractice. The district court, in an effort to provide a \"complete record of factual findings,\" analyzed the case backwards, starting with an assessment of damages, then proceeding to causation, negligence, and duty, in that order. Although we understand why the court engaged in this method of analysis, rather than simply concluding its ruling after finding there was no duty to disclose, such analysis resulted in extraneous factual findings. Therefore, because the district court did not need to reach the issue of damages, any findings regarding damages are dicta; the district court did not actually award any damages. As a result, plaintiff's claims of error in computing the damages are premature. <i>See United States v. Ottati &amp; Goss, Inc.,</i> 900 F.2d 429, 443 (1st Cir.1990) (refusing to address appeal of district court's liability finding since such finding was not necessary to the judgment below).

Kenyeda Taft, on behalf of her minor son, Melvin Harrison, sued Dr. Louis Laz, her obstetrician and a federal employee, for injuries allegedly sustained by Melvin during his birth. The complaint set forth two grounds for finding negligence: failure to meet the standard of care and lack of informed consent. The district court, after a five-day trial, concluded that Dr. Laz was not negligent under either theory and concomitantly entered judgment for the defendant of record, the United States. Plaintiff-appellant, Melvin Harrison, appeals the judgment on the informed consent claim. For the reasons discussed below, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Kenyeda Taft (\"Ms.Taft\") was pregnant with Melvin Harrison, her second child. In March of that year, Ms. Taft, almost four months pregnant, began her prenatal care at the Lynn Community Health Center (\"Lynn CHC\") with an initial screening visit conducted by a nurse practitioner. During this visit, Ms. Taft provided a medical history, including the fact that her first child, due to her large size of 9 pounds and 3 ounces, suffered an injury during vaginal birth that resulted in Erb's Palsy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Taft first met with Dr. Louis Laz (\"Dr.Laz\"), a Board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, at the Lynn CHC on April 29, 1996. Ms. Taft informed Dr. Laz that her first child suffers from Erb's Palsy as a result of a shoulder dystocia,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> due to the baby's large size. At the time, Dr. Laz's general practice with patients who had had a prior large baby was to determine the estimated fetal weight by ultrasound at about 37 weeks' gestation. If the estimated weight was 4500 grams or more, Dr. Laz would offer the patient an elective Cesarean section (\"C-section\"). If the estimated weight was under this threshold, Dr. Laz would recommend inducing labor at 37 or 38 weeks' gestation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to her previous large child, Ms. Taft presented with other risk factors that increased the likelihood that her second baby would also be large, and therefore more likely to suffer complications, such as a shoulder dystocia or brachial plexus injury, during a vaginal birth: she was pregnant with her second child, and second children are usually larger than first; the fetus was male, and males are generally larger; Ms. Taft was an obese woman at the time of her pregnancy; Ms. Taft experienced excessive weight gain during the pregnancy; and her prior delivery resulted in an Erb's Palsy injury. While Dr. Laz recognized these risk factors, he considered them to be normal birth risks and therefore did not discuss them with Ms. Taft.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After meeting with Ms. Taft, Dr. Laz obtained the delivery record for Ms. Taft's first child, Keneisha Taft, from Salem Hospital. At trial, Dr. Laz testified that it was his general practice to request the hospital delivery notes for any patient who had a history of delivery complications. The delivery record of Dr. Orkin, the treating obstetrician, indicated that Keneisha's birth occurred \"without any complications.\" Dr. Laz, considering the obstetrician's delivery notes to be the \"gold standard of what happened at that delivery,\" concluded that Ms. Taft did not experience a shoulder dystocia during her first birth. Therefore, Dr. Laz believed that the Erb's Palsy developed spontaneously, rather than as a result of a shoulder dystocia. Although Dr. Laz testified that he would have discussed an elective C-section with a patient where there was documented evidence of a prior shoulder dystocia resulting in an injury, he did not do so in this case, since the delivery notes did not document such complication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 1996, at approximately 37 weeks' gestation, in accordance with Dr. Laz's general practice, Ms. Taft had an ultrasound at Union Hospital to estimate the fetal weight. The ultrasound report estimated the fetal weight to be 3676 grams (a little over 8 pounds). Because the estimated weight was under the 4500 grams threshold, Dr. Laz determined that a vaginal delivery, as opposed to a C-section, was the appropriate mode of childbirth. Dr. Laz recommended to Ms. Taft that labor be induced, but he did not discuss with her either the risks of vaginal birth or the possibility of a C-section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 17, 1996, Ms. Taft, at 37.5 weeks' gestation, was admitted to Beverly Hospital for induction of labor. During labor, the baby's head crowned, but the shoulders did not deliver. Dr. Laz and the delivery team followed standard steps to attempt to resolve the shoulder dystocia. After these steps were unsuccessful, Dr. Laz delivered the posterior (right) arm, which then allowed delivery of the baby at 12:46 a.m. on September 18. The baby, Melvin Harrison, weighed 4508 grams (9 pounds and 15 ounces) at birth and had a weakness of the right arm and hand, which was subsequently diagnosed as Erb's Palsy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff filed suit against Dr. Laz for medical malpractice in Essex County Superior Court. However, since Dr. Laz was a federal employee at the time he treated Ms. Taft, the action was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and the United States was substituted as the defendant. The plaintiff's suit was premised on two grounds of negligence: (1) Dr. Laz's failure to meet the standard of care by not originally offering an elective C-section and by not performing a C-section during labor based on fetal heart monitorings; and (2) Dr. Laz's failure to obtain Ms. Taft's informed consent by not discussing the risks of vaginal birth and disclosing the alternative of a C-section. A bench trial began on December 18, 2000. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the district court granted the United States' motion for judgment as a matter of law on the question of Dr. Laz's compliance with the standard of care during labor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the trial, the district court determined that Dr. Laz did not fail to obtain the patient's informed consent and entered judgment for the defendant.

In <i>Feeley,</i> a mother sued for medical malpractice when her child died from streptococcus pneumonia five days after birth. <i>See</i> 679 N.E.2d at 181. The mother alleged that the treating physician, who opted for spontaneous labor (as opposed to inducing labor) after her water broke, failed to disclose any risk of infection from this procedure. <i>See id.</i> The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, citing <i>Harnish</i> and <i>Precourt,</i> undertook a materiality analysis and concluded that \"[t]he evidence would not permit a finding that the risk to the child of <i>serious</i> infection was more than negligible.\" 679 N.E.2d at 181. Thus, because the severity of the potential injury was minimal, the court concluded that the information was not material, and the doctor, therefore, had no duty to disclose. <i>See id.</i> at 181-82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in <i>Feeley,</i> similar to the plaintiff in this case, argued that there was more than a negligible risk and, as a result, that risk had to be disclosed. <i>See id.</i> On the particular facts, however, the <i>Feeley</i> court determined that the risk was <i>not</i> more than negligible. <i>See id.</i> at 182. Thus, the court stated that \"[t]he risk that must exist in order to invoke informed consent principles in this case is a more than negligible risk of one or more infections that will have serious consequences.\" <i>Id.</i> This context clarifies that the court was merely negating any duty to disclose negligible risks. The court was not, as plaintiff argues, declaring an affirmative duty to disclose any risk that is \"more than negligible.\" Thus, the caselaw stands for the proposition that there is no duty to disclose negligible risks, not that all non-negligible risks are actionable if not revealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, when the district court's analysis focused on whether the risks were \"more than negligible\" rather than on materiality, the district court applied the incorrect legal standard.

The materiality standard for disclosure does not incorporate a balancing test by which the court can weigh the risks of alternate treatments in deciding what information is material to the patient. An obstetrician in the delivery room is in the unique situation of having to take into account the best interests of two individuals, mother and child, in rendering medical care. <i>Cf. Thomas v.

Under informed consent law, if a risk to the baby <i>or</i> a risk to the mother is material to the patient-mother's decision, the doctor has a duty to disclose that risk. <i>See Harnish,</i> 439 N.E.2d at 243 (asserting that physician has duty to disclose \"all significant information that the physician possesses\" that is material to the patient's decision). Once these risks and other material information have been disclosed, it is the patient's prerogative to balance these risks and choose the form of treatment that best meets that patient's needs. <i>See Harnish,</i> 439 N.E.2d at 244 (declaring it is \"the patient's right to decide for himself\"); <i>Canterbury,</i> 464 F.2d at 781 (\"To the physician, whose training enables a self-satisfying evaluation, the answer may seem clear, but it is the prerogative of the patient, not the physician, to determine for himself the direction in which his interests seem to lie.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if, on remand, the district court finds that a risk existed either as to the mother's health <i>or</i> as to the child's health and that such information would have been material to a reasonable patient in Ms. Taft's position, then Dr. Laz had a duty to disclose that risk. Moreover, because there are only two methods of childbirth, if the district court finds the risk of vaginal birth to be material to the patient, then Dr. Laz also had a duty to present the alternative option of a C-section that might minimize such risk, regardless of his medical opinion on the proper course of treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also challenges on appeal the district court's analysis of his claim for damages arising out of the alleged malpractice.

Although we understand why the court engaged in this method of analysis, rather than simply concluding its ruling after finding there was no duty to disclose, such analysis resulted in extraneous factual findings. Therefore, because the district court did not need to reach the issue of damages, any findings regarding damages are dicta; the district court did not actually award any damages.
