We have reviewed  the record and have\r                                 \r\n\nread  the  parties' briefs  and  memorandum.   We  affirm the\r\n\njudgment  of the district court for the reasons stated in the\r\n\nRecommended  Decision  of  the  magistrate  judge  which  was\r\n\nadopted by the district  court.  The 100-page  second amended\r\n\ncomplaint plainly was \"redundant, rambling,  and unorganized\"\r\n\nas  the magistrate  judge described.   Thus,  to dismiss  it,\r\n\nespecially after plaintiff  had been warned  to file a  short\r\n\nand concise complaint, was  not an abuse of discretion.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nKuehl  v.

Ct.  1545 (1994).\r                                               \r\n\nWe add that, in  any event, the complaint suffered  from more\r\n\nfatal defects:\r\n\n          1.   The district court is without  power to review\r\n\nthe state court decisions -- the relief plaintiff clearly was\r\n\nseeking.   See  District  of  Columbia Court  of  Appeals  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFeldman,  460 U.S. 462, 476  (1983); Rooker v.

Plaintiff cannot  bring a civil  rights action\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.    1983  against private parties.   The  mere\r\n\nfact  that these parties  resorted to, or  appeared in, state\r\n\ncourt  is insufficient to turn  them into state  actors.  See\r                                                                         \r\r\n\nCasa Marie, Inc. v.  Superior Court of Puerto Rico,  988 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n252,  259 (1st  Cir. 1993).    Nor do  plaintiff's conclusory\r\n\nallegations that  these defendants were in  a conspiracy with\r\n\nthe  state court judges suffice to bring them within   1983's\r\n\nreach.  See id.\r                           \r\n\n          3.   The  state judges  are absolutely  immune from\r\n\nclaims for money damages.  See Cok v. Cosentino, 876 F.2d  1,\r                                                           \r\n\n2 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam).\r\n\n          The judgment  of  the district  court is  affirmed.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSee Local Rule 27.1.\r               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
