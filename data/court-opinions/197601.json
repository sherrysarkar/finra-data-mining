In 1994, the Massachusetts Commissioner of\r                            \r\n\nCorrection  promulgated a  \"sex  offender treatment\"  program\r\n\n(\"the  program\"),  see 103  DOC    446,  designed  to provide\r                                  \r\n\ntreatment for  those inmates  \"with a  present indication  or\r\n\nprior  history  of  involvement  in  the  commission  of  sex\r\n\noffenses,\"  id.    446.07.    With  a  sequential  series  of\r                           \r\n\ntreatment phases, first at the medium-security level and then\r\n\nin minimum-security and pre-release  settings, the program is\r\n\nintended to  offer \"a continuum  of service from the  time an\r\n\ninmate with such  a background is committed, until  he/she is\r\n\nreleased to the community, and hopefully beyond.\"  Id.  While\r                                                                  \r\n\nthe   program  is  voluntary,  any  inmate  who  declines  to\r\n\nparticipate (or who  has not completed the  initial treatment\r\n\nstages)  is barred from moving beyond  minimum security.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nDominique v.  Weld, 73  F.3d 1156, 1161  n.8 (1st  Cir. 1996)\r                              \r\n\n(discussing program).\r\n\n     The plaintiffs here  are four inmates who  have declined\r\n\nto  participate  in the  program,  allegedly out  of  fear of\r\n\nretribution  from other  prisoners should  their sex-offender\r\n\nstatus become known.  They  have accordingly been confined to\r\n\nmedium  security  with  a   consequent  loss  of  privileges.\r\n\nPlaintiff Tarrant further  complains that he has  been denied\r\n\nparole  as a result,  while plaintiff Masonoff  protests that\r\n\nhis  parole reserve  date has  been  rescinded.   All of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs committed  their offenses before  the program  was\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nintroduced.   Three  of  them  were  allegedly  screened  and\r\n\n\"cleared\"  under an earlier regime calling for the indefinite\r\n\ncivil  commitment of \"sexually dangerous persons.\"  See Mass.\r                                                                   \r\n\nG. L. c. 123A.  \r\n\n     In this pro se action under 42 U.S.C.   1983, plaintiffs\r\n\ninsist that applying  the program to them is impermissible on\r\n\na variety of  constitutional and other grounds.   Declaratory\r\n\nand   injunctive  relief   and   damages   are  sought;   the\r\n\nCommissioner of Correction is the sole named defendant.  From\r\n\nan  adverse award of summary judgment, plaintiffs now appeal.\r\n\nWe affirm.\r\n\n     Extended   discussion  is   unnecessary.     Plaintiffs'\r\n\nprincipal contention, which underlies  many of their  claims,\r\n\nis that it is improper  to subject them to the program  after\r\n\nthey had  been cleared under  the c. 123A  regime.  In  their\r\n\nview,  the program  is simply  a  \"mirror image\"--a  revamped\r\n\nversion--of the c. 123A system, which could not be applied to\r\n\nthem absent some  intervening sexual misconduct.   They argue\r\n\nthat   doing  so  violates  notions  of  due  process,  equal\r\n\nprotection,  ex post facto  law, res judicata  and collateral\r\n\nestoppel.  We  disagree.  The two regimes  share nothing more\r\n\nthan a common purpose of  treating sex offenders.  Whereas c.\r\n\n123A involves involuntary and indeterminate civil  commitment\r\n\nbased  upon a judicial  finding of sexual  dangerousness, the\r\n\nprogram involves a voluntary treatment scheme that can affect\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\na  prisoner's classification  level but  does  not alter  his\r\n\nunderlying criminal sentence.   That one has  previously been\r\n\ndetermined not  to be a \"sexually dangerous  person\" under c.\r\n\n123A thus does not preclude subjecting him to the program. \r\n\n     Applying  the program  to plaintiffs does  not otherwise\r\n\nviolate  due process.   Imposing limitations on  a prisoner's\r\n\naccess  to   minimum  security   entails  no   \"atypical  and\r\n\nsignificant hardship\" under  Sandin v. Conner, 515  U.S. 472,\r                                                         \r\n\n484  (1995).    See,  e.g.,  Dominique, 73  F.3d  at  1158-61\r                                                  \r\n\n(finding prisoner's removal from work release and restriction\r\n\nto medium security  to be permissible under Sandin).   Nor is\r                                                              \r\n\ndue process implicated  by the denial  of parole, see,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nGreenholtz v.

Nor   does  the  program  constitute  a  bill  of\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nattainder.  See, e.g., Schafer v.

See Parton v. Armontrout, 895 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1214, 1215-16  (8th Cir.  1990); cf. Knox  v.

Yet plaintiffs have presented no\r\n\ndirect  claim that this  is what  happened here;  indeed, the\r\n\ninterplay  between the  program  and  the  parole  system  is\r\n\nunexplained on  the present  record.  Nor,  in the  course of\r\n\ntheir  ex post facto discussion, have they referred to parole\r\n\nin anything  more than  oblique fashion--either  below or  on\r\n\nappeal.   Plaintiffs  bore the burden  of establishing  an ex\r\n\npost facto violation.  See Morales, 514 U.S. at 510 n.6.

They  have accordingly been confined to\r\n\nmedium  security  with  a   consequent  loss  of  privileges.\r\n\nPlaintiff Tarrant further  complains that he has  been denied\r\n\nparole  as a result,  while plaintiff Masonoff  protests that\r\n\nhis  parole reserve  date has  been  rescinded.   All of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs committed  their offenses before  the program  was\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nintroduced.   Three  of  them  were  allegedly  screened  and\r\n\n\"cleared\"  under an earlier regime calling for the indefinite\r\n\ncivil  commitment of \"sexually dangerous persons.\"  See Mass.\r                                                                   \r\n\nG. L. c. 123A.  \r\n\n     In this pro se action under 42 U.S.C.   1983, plaintiffs\r\n\ninsist that applying  the program to them is impermissible on\r\n\na variety of  constitutional and other grounds.   Declaratory\r\n\nand   injunctive  relief   and   damages   are  sought;   the\r\n\nCommissioner of Correction is the sole named defendant.  From\r\n\nan  adverse award of summary judgment, plaintiffs now appeal.\r\n\nWe affirm.\r\n\n     Extended   discussion  is   unnecessary.     Plaintiffs'\r\n\nprincipal contention, which underlies  many of their  claims,\r\n\nis that it is improper  to subject them to the program  after\r\n\nthey had  been cleared under  the c. 123A  regime.  In  their\r\n\nview,  the program  is simply  a  \"mirror image\"--a  revamped\r\n\nversion--of the c. 123A system, which could not be applied to\r\n\nthem absent some  intervening sexual misconduct.   They argue\r\n\nthat   doing  so  violates  notions  of  due  process,  equal\r\n\nprotection,  ex post facto  law, res judicata  and collateral\r\n\nestoppel.  We  disagree.  The two regimes  share nothing more\r\n\nthan a common purpose of  treating sex offenders.  Whereas c.\r\n\n123A involves involuntary and indeterminate civil  commitment\r\n\nbased  upon a judicial  finding of sexual  dangerousness, the\r\n\nprogram involves a voluntary treatment scheme that can affect\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\na  prisoner's classification  level but  does  not alter  his\r\n\nunderlying criminal sentence.   That one has  previously been\r\n\ndetermined not  to be a \"sexually dangerous  person\" under c.\r\n\n123A thus does not preclude subjecting him to the program. \r\n\n     Applying  the program  to plaintiffs does  not otherwise\r\n\nviolate  due process.   Imposing limitations on  a prisoner's\r\n\naccess  to   minimum  security   entails  no   \"atypical  and\r\n\nsignificant hardship\" under  Sandin v.
