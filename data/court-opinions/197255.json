This   case   involving   an\r                      STAHL, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nunderlying dispute over who is to pay for some $14 million in\r\n\nrepairs  to  a coal  cargo ship  requires  us to  resolve one\r\n\nquestion: whether claims  asserted by defendant-appellee  New\r\n\nEngland  Power  Company  (\"NEP\") against  plaintiff-appellant\r\n\nKeystone Shipping Co. (\"Keystone\")  are arbitrable.  We reach\r\n\ntwo conclusions pointing  to the same result.  First, because\r\n\nthe  issue  has  already  been litigated  by  the  parties in\r\n\nMassachusetts state court, it is precluded  from relitigation\r\n\nunder  the doctrine of issue preclusion.  Second, even if the\r\n\nissue  were not precluded, we find that Keystone and NEP have\r\n\na  legally-enforceable agreement  to arbitrate  disputes like\r\n\nthe one here.  We thus affirm.\r\n\n               Background and Prior Proceedings\r                           Background and Prior Proceedings\r                                                           \r\n\n          In order to resolve this appeal we must  consider a\r\n\nlong series  of agreements and disputes  between Keystone and\r\n\nNEP concerning  the S.S.  Energy Independence, now  named the\r\n\nS.S.  Energy  Enterprise  (\"the  Vessel\").   The  Vessel  was\r\n\nconstructed in the  early 1980s  by the  New England  Collier\r\n\nCompany  (\"NECCO\"), an  unincorporated joint  venture between\r\n\nKeystone   and  an   NEP   affiliate,   New  England   Energy\r\n\nIncorporated  (\"NEEI\").  NEP, in  turn, chartered  the Vessel\r\n\nfrom NECCO to deliver coal to its electric power plants.  The\r\n\njoint  venture  agreement  and  the  NEP  time  charter  both\r\n\ncontained arbitration provisions.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          The relationship was not  an entirely happy one and\r\n\na  dispute between the  parties followed.   In 1987, Keystone\r\n\ncommenced arbitration  against NEEI under  the joint  venture\r\n\nagreement,  while NEP  commenced  arbitration  against  NECCO\r\n\nunder the time  charter.  In a previous appeal to this Court,\r\n\nwe  held   that  the   two  arbitrations  were   amenable  to\r\n\nconsolidation by federal court order.  See New England Energy\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v. Keystone Shipping Co., 855 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1988),\r                                         \r\n\ncert. denied, 489 U.S. 1077 (1989).\r                        \r\n\n          Before the arbitration  was concluded, the  parties\r\n\nsettled  their  differences  through  a  settlement agreement\r\n\nsigned  by Keystone, NEP, and NEEI in October 1989 (\"the 1989\r\n\nsettlement  agreement\").     Under  the  agreement's   terms,\r\n\nownership of the Vessel was to pass from NECCO to Keystone or\r\n\na  Keystone nominee.    The parties  further agreed  that the\r\n\nVessel's  new owner would time  charter the Vessel  to NEP on\r\n\n\"terms and conditions agreed  to by Keystone and NEP.\"   They\r\n\nannexed  a draft of the proposed new time charter (\"the draft\r\n\ncharter\")  to  the  settlement  agreement.   Like  the  then-\r\n\noperative  NEP time  charter, the  draft charter  contained a\r\n\nsweeping arbitration provision.  In particular, Section 41 of\r\n\nthe draft  charter provided  that \"[a]ny and  all differences\r\n\nand disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this Charter\r\n\nwhich  cannot  be resolved  by the  parties  shall be  put to\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\narbitration in the  City of Boston  . . .  before a board  of\r\n\nthree persons.\"\r\n\n          Keystone nominated Intercoastal Bulk Carriers, Inc.\r\n\n(\"IBC\")  to be the Vessel's  new owner.1   In accordance with\r\n\nthe settlement  agreement, NECCO sold  the Vessel to  IBC and\r\n\nIBC,  in turn,  chartered the  Vessel to  NEP through  a time\r\n\ncharter agreement  executed by  IBC and  NEP on December  27,\r\n\n1989 (\"the 1989 time charter\"). The executed time charter was\r\n\nsubstantially similar  to the October draft  charter, but not\r\n\nexactly  identical.   The arbitration  provisions in  the two\r\n\ndocuments,  however, were alike  in all respects.   That same\r\n\nday, December 27, Keystone and  IBC entered into a management\r\n\nagreement  which provided  that  Keystone  would continue  to\r\n\nmanage the Vessel.\r\n\n          The executed 1989 time  charter gave NEP the option\r\n\nto purchase  the Vessel  and terminate  the charter with  six\r\n\nmonths' prior,  written  notice.   In  1994, NEP  decided  to\r\n\nexercise its  option,  resell  the  Vessel  to  International\r\n\nShipholding Corp. (\"ISC\"), and then recharter the Vessel from\r\n\nISC.  On October 27, 1994, NEP and ISC signed a Memorandum of\r\n\nAgreement to this effect.  Several days later, on November 1,\r\n\n1994, NEP notified  Keystone and IBC  that it was  exercising\r\n\nits six-month purchase option and would buy the Vessel on May\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Like Keystone itself, IBC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of\r\nChas. P. Kurz &amp; Co. (\"Kurz\").\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n1, 1995.  NEP concurrently demanded arbitration  of its right\r\n\nto do this, because Keystone had previously communicated that\r\n\nit would contest NEP's right to exercise the purchase option.\r\n\nKeystone alleged  that in the negotiations  that produced the\r\n\n1989 settlement  agreement NEP had represented  that it would\r\n\nnot  exercise  the time  charter's  purchase  option.   NEP's\r\n\nexercise of  the option,  Keystone suggested,  indicated that\r\n\nNEP had made misrepresentations at the time of the settlement\r\n\nnegotiations and had  violated Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A.   A\r\n\nthree-member  arbitration  panel  was  convened  to  hear the\r\n\nparties' dispute.\r\n\n          On March  15, 1995,  the arbitration panel  decided\r\n\nfour  threshold  issues  concerning   NEP's  service  of  the\r\n\npurchase notice and  demand for arbitration in  favor of NEP.\r\n\nIBC  responded by filing an action  in federal district court\r\n\nunder  9 U.S.C.   10  to vacate the  arbitrators' ruling, but\r\n\nthe  court  dismissed  the   complaint  as  premature.    See\r                                                                         \r\n\nIntercoastal Bulk  Carriers, Inc.  v. New England  Power Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nNo.  95-10880  RW2, (D.  Mass.  May 18,  1995).   Thereafter,\r\n\nKeystone  and IBC resumed arbitration of the dispute.  On May\r\n\n17,  1995,   Keystone  and  IBC  announced   that  they  were\r\n\nwithdrawing  the challenge  to  NEP's right  to exercise  the\r\n\npurchase option  from arbitration,  leaving to the  panel the\r\n\nissue  of whether NEP's actions had  violated Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n\nch. 93A.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          That  same  day,  May  17,  Keystone  sued  NEP  in\r\n\nMassachusetts  state  court,  claiming  that  NEP   had  made\r\n\nmisrepresentations  during  the  negotiations over  the  1989\r\n\nsettlement agreement.  NEP moved to dismiss Keystone's claims\r\n\non  the ground  that they  were governed  by the  arbitration\r\n\nprovision of the 1989 time charter.  Keystone  responded that\r\n\nits  claims against  NEP did  not arise  under the  1989 time\r\n\ncharter  signed by NEP and IBC, but  instead arose out of the\r\n\n1989 settlement agreement, which  did not have an arbitration\r\n\nprovision.  The  state court  agreed with  NEP and  dismissed\r\n\nKeystone's  complaint.   The state  court concluded  that the\r\n\nsettlement  agreement's provisions  meant  that Keystone  was\r\n\nbound  by   the  1989  time  charter's   arbitration  clause,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  the fact  that Keystone  had not  signed the\r\n\ncharter, which  had been executed  by its  nominee, IBC,  and\r\n\nNEP.  See Keystone Shipping Co. v. New England Power Co., No.\r                                                                    \r\n\n95-1141-B  (Mass. Superior  Court,  Essex County,  August 17,\r\n\n1995).\r\n\n          The   dispute   thus  returned   to   the  original\r\n\narbitration panel, which, on  August 21, 1995, concluded that\r\n\nNEP had the right to exercise the purchase option in the 1989\r\n\ntime charter. The arbitrators ordered IBC to sell the  Vessel\r\n\nto  NEP.   Two  days later,  IBC filed  an action  in federal\r\n\ndistrict  court seeking  to  vacate the  arbitrators'  latest\r\n\nrulings. See Intercoastal Bulk  Carriers, Inc. v. New England\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nPower  Co., C.A.  No. 95-11881-GAO.   Shortly  thereafter, on\r                      \r\n\nSeptember 5, 1995, Keystone filed a notice of appeal from the\r\n\nstate court's decision  to dismiss its state  cause of action\r\n\nagainst NEP.\r\n\n          This  was the  state of  legal affairs  between the\r\n\nparties when, on September 20, 1995, IBC and NEP entered into\r\n\na new settlement agreement (\"the 1995 settlement agreement\").\r\n\nUnder the  new settlement  agreement, IBC agreed  to transfer\r\n\nthe Vessel  in accordance with NEP's wishes to ISC's nominee,\r\n\nEnterprise Ship  Co. (\"Enterprise\").   The parties  expressly\r\n\nacknowledged that  the arbitration  clause found in  the 1989\r\n\ntime charter would govern the  new settlement agreement.  The\r\n\nsettlement agreement also provided  for the mutual release of\r\n\nclaims by  Keystone and IBC in  favor of NEP and  vice versa.\r\n\nThere was one exception  to this general release.   Exhibit B\r\n\nof the agreement  expressly provided that NEP did not release\r\n\nKeystone  and  IBC from  \"claims, if  any,  by reason  of the\r\n\nVessel not being in class at the Closing based upon a  survey\r\n\n.  . .  when the  Vessel is  drydocked immediately  after the\r\n\nClosing.\"\r\n\n          On  September 28,  1995,  the  Vessel's new  owner,\r\n\nEnterprise,  took title and sent the Vessel to a shipyard for\r\n\nthe  agreed-upon  inspection.    The  survey   that  followed\r\n\nrevealed corrosion damage to the Vessel's bulkheads and cargo\r\n\nholds  exceeding the  tolerances established by  the American\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nBureau of Shipping,  thereby making  the Vessel  unseaworthy.\r\n\nThe ship inspectors refused to allow the Vessel to sail until\r\n\nthe needed repairs were completed.  NEP alleges that the bulk\r\n\nof  the corrosion  damage was a  direct result  of Keystone's\r\n\nfailure to maintain  the Vessel.  The total cost to bring the\r\n\nVessel to standard is claimed to be approximately $14 million\r\n\ndollars. NEP argues that Keystone and IBC are responsible for\r\n\nmuch of that amount under the terms of the 1989 time charter.\r\n\n          On December 20, 1995, NEP notified  the arbitration\r\n\npanel  that  it  desired  to  arbitrate its  claims  for  the\r\n\nVessel's  repair costs  against Keystone  and IBC.   Keystone\r\n\ndenied that it was required to arbitrate NEP's claims, and on\r\n\nFebruary  27,  1996  filed  suit in  federal  district  court\r\n\nseeking a stay of arbitration pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n\n251,    2(b).  NEP cross-moved  under the Federal Arbitration\r\n\nAct,  9 U.S.C.   4, to compel  arbitration.  On May 24, 1996,\r\n\nthe district court granted NEP's motion to compel, concluding\r\n\nthat the  arbitrability of NEP's claims  against Keystone was\r\n\nan issue  that had  been previously decided  in Massachusetts\r\n\nstate court, and, in  any event, was the result  compelled by\r\n\nthe merits.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                  Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review de novo the district  court's application\r                                       \r\n\nof   the  doctrine   of   issue  preclusion   because  \"[t]he\r\n\napplicability vel non of  preclusion principles is a question\r                                 \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nof law.\"  Monarch Life Ins.

Each  of these  elements  is present  in  the\r\n\ninstant case.\r\n\n          First,  the arbitrability  of NEP's claims  in this\r\n\ncase raises the same issue  raised in the Massachusetts state\r\n\ncause of action.  Keystone ingeniously attempts to argue that\r\n\nthere  are two  separate and  distinct arbitrability  issues.\r\n\nKeystone in particular maintains that the state court decided\r\n\nthat claims  against it  under the 1989  settlement agreement\r\n\nwere arbitrable, but that this case raises a different issue:\r\n\n\"whether claims  asserted by  NEP against Keystone  under the\r\n\n1989 Time  Charter and 1995 NEP-IBC  Settlement Agreement are\r\n\narbitrable.\"   Keystone fails to persuade for  a very simple,\r\n\nbut  inescapable, reason.    The state  court concluded  that\r\n\nKeystone was bound to  arbitrate claims concerning the Vessel\r\n\nunder the 1989  settlement agreement because (1) it was bound\r\n\nto arbitrate such claims under the terms of the executed 1989\r\n\ntime charter,  and (2) Keystone  had expressly agreed  in the\r\n\n1989 settlement agreement that  ownership of the Vessel would\r\n\npass  to Keystone or a Keystone nominee and that the Vessel's\r\n\nnew  owner would time charter the Vessel to NEP on \"terms and\r\n\nconditions  agreed   to  by  Keystone  and   NEP.\"    Because\r\n\narbitrability of  claims concerning  the Vessel was  one such\r\n\nterm and  condition in the  executed time charter,  the state\r\n\ncourt  concluded  that  the  settlement  agreement's  express\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nlanguage bound Keystone  to arbitrate  such claims.   Put  in\r\n\nanother  fashion, the state court found that Keystone, in the\r\n\n1989 settlement agreement, had expressly  agreed that it or a\r\n\nnominee would execute a time charter on terms and  conditions\r\n\nagreeable to  Keystone, and thus  was bound to  arbitrate all\r\n\ndisputes because  the executed  time charter, like  the draft\r\n\ncharter attached to the settlement agreement and initialed on\r\n\nevery  page by  Keystone, made  claims concerning  the Vessel\r\n\narbitrable.\r\n\n          Keystone's  argument  about  the   1995  settlement\r\n\nagreement likewise  fails to persuade because  the parties to\r\n\nthe  agreement expressly  acknowledged  that the  arbitration\r\n\nclause  found in the 1989 time charter would apply and govern\r\n\nthe  new settlement  agreement.   While it  is true  that the\r\n\nsettlement  agreement  provided  for  the mutual  release  of\r\n\nclaims by Keystone  and IBC in favor  of NEP and  vice versa,\r\n\nthe  agreement  expressly  carved  out an  exception  to  the\r\n\ngeneral  release for \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel\r\n\nnot being  in class  at the  Closing.\"   Because NEP did  not\r\n\nrelease  such claims, and because such claims arise under the\r\n\n1989 settlement agreement and  are arbitrable under the terms\r\n\nof  that   agreement  and   the  1989  time   charter,  their\r\n\narbitrability  in the  instant case  is the  very same  issue\r\n\npreviously  litigated  and  decided  in  Massachusetts  state\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          This point carries us to the  second element of the\r\n\nissue preclusion  standard: the  issue raised here  on appeal\r\n\nhas  been  \"actually litigated.\"    Grella,  42 F.3d  at  30.\r                                                      \r\n\nKeystone  opposed NEP's  motion to dismiss  the Massachusetts\r\n\nstate cause  of action  before the  state court  with briefs,\r\n\naffidavits, and at a motion hearing.  Keystone  feebly argues\r\n\nthat the state court should not have disposed of its cause of\r\n\naction  by  motion,  but  instead should  have  conducted  an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing.      As  NEP   correctly   notes,   the\r\n\nMassachusetts court  had before it  the relevant  contractual\r\n\ndocuments, read  and heard  the litigants' opposing  views on\r\n\nwhat meaning and effect should be afforded to those documents\r\n\nand  the history  of  the parties'  arbitration efforts,  and\r\n\nproperly concluded  that the arbitrability question  could be\r\n\ndecided on  motion.  Well-settled principles  of law indicate\r\n\nthat  the  arbitrability  issue  was  actually litigated  for\r\n\npreclusion purposes  because it was \"subject  to an adversary\r\n\npresentation and consequent judgment\" that was not \"a product\r\n\nof  the parties'  consent  and is  a  final decision  on  the\r\n\nmerits.\"   Jack  H.

See Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 978;\r                                                        \r\n\nGrella,  42  F.3d at  30.   Keystone  does not  challenge the\r                  \r\n\nvalidity  and binding  nature  of the  state court  judgment.\r\n\nRather, Keystone argues that the state court judgment focused\r\n\non the 1989  settlement agreement and thus  did not determine\r\n\nthe arbitrability  of NEP's current claims  because the court\r\n\ndid not decide whether claims against Keystone are arbitrable\r\n\nunder  either the 1989  time charter  or the  1995 settlement\r\n\nagreement.   This  argument is  nothing more than  a recycled\r\n\nversion  of the contention we have just rejected.  As we have\r\n\nseen, the state  court determined that Keystone was  bound to\r\n\narbitrate under  the 1989  settlement agreement because  that\r\n\nagreement contemplated the 1989 time charter, which contained\r\n\na  sweeping arbitration  clause.   The  arbitrability of  any\r\n\nclaims,  including NEP's  present ones,  under the  1989 time\r\n\ncharter was an essential component in the state court's prior\r\n\ndetermination, even if it itself  was not the ultimate  issue\r\n\nthe court decided.   As we recently explained, an  \"issue may\r\n\nbe  actually  litigated  and  resolved  'even if  it  is  not\r\n\nexplicitly  decided,' as long as it is logically necessary to\r\n\n[the  court's] final decision.\"  Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 982\r                                                         \r\n\n(quoting and  construing Grella, 42 F.3d  at 30-31) (emphasis\r                                           \r\n\nin original omitted).\r\n\n          Our  review  of  the  record  indicates  that   the\r\n\narbitrability of NEP's present  claims against Keystone is an\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nissue  that  has already  been litigated  and decided  by the\r\n\nparties  in Massachusetts state court.  Under the doctrine of\r\n\nissue preclusion,  Keystone cannot  seek to  undo or  redo in\r\n\nfederal court what has already been done in state court.   \r\n\n            The Merits of the Arbitrability Issue\r                        The Merits of the Arbitrability Issue\r                                                             \r\n\n          Our  decision  today  would  be the  same  even  if\r\n\nprinciples  of collateral  estoppel  did  not bar  Keystone's\r\n\nattempt  to  relitigate the  arbitrability  of  NEP's current\r\n\nclaims against it.  Our review of the record and the relevant\r\n\ncontractual  documents  contained therein  convinces  us that\r\n\nKeystone  is bound  to arbitrate  NEP's claims  regarding the\r\n\nVessel.  In view  of the detailed factual discussion  we have\r\n\nalready undertaken, we do not feel it necessary to replay all\r\n\nof  the evidence.    We shall  only  briefly explain  why  we\r\n\nconclude  that Keystone is bound to  arbitrate such claims as\r\n\nthose NEP presently advances.\r\n\n          Keystone entered into the 1989 settlement agreement\r\n\nwith NEP.   In that agreement, Keystone expressly agreed that\r\n\nownership  of the  Vessel  would pass  to  it or  a  Keystone\r\n\nnominee  and that the  Vessel's new owner  would time charter\r\n\nthe  Vessel  to NEP  on \"terms  and  conditions agreed  to by\r\n\nKeystone and NEP.\" Attached to the settlement agreement was a\r\n\ndraft   of  the  contemplated   time  charter  that  Keystone\r\n\ninitialed  on every  page.   The  draft  charter contained  a\r\n\nsweeping arbitration clause,  which provided that  \"[a]ny and\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nall differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out\r\n\nof this Charter which cannot be resolved by the parties shall\r\n\nbe  put  to arbitration  in the  City  of Boston.\"   Keystone\r\n\nsubsequently nominated IBC  to take title  to the Vessel  and\r\n\nIBC, in turn,  executed the  time charter with  NEP that  was\r\n\ncontemplated in the 1989  settlement agreement.  The executed\r\n\ntime charter  contained the exact same  arbitration provision\r\n\nas the  draft  attached to  the  settlement agreement.    The\r\n\ninescapable  conclusion from the  foregoing is  that Keystone\r\n\nagreed to time  charter the  Vessel to NEP,  via its  nominee\r\n\nIBC,  under  the  terms  and conditions  established  in  the\r\n\nexecuted  time charter,  including the  terms  and conditions\r\n\nregarding the arbitrability of claims.\r\n\n          The 1995  settlement agreement between IBC  and NEP\r\n\ndoes not change this legal state of affairs.  Both parties to\r\n\nthe  agreement  expressly acknowledged  that  the arbitration\r\n\nclause  found in the 1989  time charter would  govern the new\r\n\nsettlement  agreement.  While  the new  settlement  agreement\r\n\nprovided for the mutual release of claims by Keystone and IBC\r\n\nin  favor  of  NEP  and vice  versa,  as  we  have  said, the\r\n\nagreement  expressly  carves  out  one  exception  from  this\r\n\ngeneral  release. The  relevant  language could  not be  more\r\n\nclear: NEP does not release Keystone and IBC from \"claims, if\r\n\nany, by  reason of  the  Vessel not  being  in class  at  the\r\n\nClosing  based  upon a  survey  .  .  .  when the  Vessel  is\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\ndrydocked immediately  after the Closing.\"   Because NEP does\r\n\nnot release  such claims  against Keystone, and  because such\r\n\nclaims  arise under  the  1989 settlement  agreement and  are\r\n\narbitrable  under the  executed time charter  contemplated by\r\n\nthat earlier settlement agreement,  Keystone is obligated  to\r\n\narbitrate NEP's present claims.\r\n\n          The fact  that Keystone itself did  not sign either\r\n\nthe 1989 time charter or the 1995 settlement agreement is not\r\n\ndispositive.  Keystone is  bound by the terms and  conditions\r\n\nof the executed  time charter because  of the commitments  it\r\n\nundertook in  the 1989  settlement agreement.   And the  fact\r\n\nthat  Keystone is  not  a signatory  to  the 1995  settlement\r\n\nagreement is  nothing more than a clever  red herring because\r\n\nthat  agreement  specifically   preserves  Keystone's   prior\r\n\nexposure and liability  under the  1989 settlement  agreement\r\n\nand  time  charter, for  \"claims, if  any,  by reason  of the\r\n\nVessel not being in class at the Closing.\"\r\n\n          Having weighed  the merits vel non  of this appeal,\r                                                        \r\n\nwe  find that the balance swings clearly  in NEP's favor.  We\r\n\nconclude  that  NEP's  claims   are  arbitrable  and  decline\r\n\nKeystone's invitation to visit additional corollary issues.\r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          Principles    of    collateral   estoppel    (issue\r\n\npreclusion) raise a bar to Keystone's attempt to litigate the\r\n\narbitrability of NEP's present  claims for recovery of repair\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\ncosts  to the Vessel.  Even if  this were not the case, NEP's\r\n\nclaims against  Keystone are  arbitrable as a  consequence of\r\n\nKeystone's contractual  commitments.

(\"Keystone\") are arbitrable.  We reach two conclusions pointing to the same result.  First, because the issue has already been litigated by the parties in Massachusetts state court, it is precluded from relitigation under the doctrine of issue preclusion.  Second, even if the issue were not precluded, we find that Keystone and NEP have a legally-enforceable agreement to arbitrate disputes like the one here.  We thus affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to resolve this appeal we must consider a long series of agreements and disputes between Keystone and NEP concerning the S.S. Energy Independence, now named the S.S. Energy Enterprise (\"the Vessel\").  The Vessel was constructed in the early 1980s by the New England Collier Company (\"NECCO\"), an unincorporated joint venture between Keystone and an NEP affiliate, New England Energy Incorporated (\"NEEI\").  NEP, in turn, chartered the Vessel from NECCO to deliver coal to its electric power plants.  The joint venture agreement and the NEP time charter both contained arbitration provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship was not an entirely happy one and a dispute between the parties followed.  In 1987, Keystone commenced arbitration against NEEI under the joint venture agreement, while NEP commenced arbitration against NECCO under the time charter.  In a previous appeal to this Court, we held that the two arbitrations were amenable to consolidation by federal court order.  See New England Energy Inc. v. Keystone Shipping Co., 855 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1077, 109 S.Ct. 1527, 103 L.Ed.2d 832 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the arbitration was concluded, the parties settled their differences through a settlement agreement signed by Keystone, NEP, and NEEI in October 1989 (\"the 1989 settlement agreement\").  Under the agreement's terms, ownership of the Vessel was to pass from NECCO to Keystone or a Keystone nominee.  The parties further agreed that the Vessel's new owner would time charter the Vessel to NEP on \"terms and conditions agreed to by Keystone and NEP.\"   They annexed a draft of the proposed new time charter (\"the draft charter\") to the settlement agreement.  Like the then-operative NEP time charter, the draft charter contained a sweeping arbitration provision.  In particular, Section 41 of the draft charter provided that \"[a]ny and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this Charter which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be put to arbitration in the City of Boston ... before a board of three persons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keystone nominated Intercoastal Bulk Carriers, Inc.  (\"IBC\") to be the Vessel's new owner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In accordance with the settlement agreement, NECCO sold the Vessel to IBC and IBC, in turn, chartered the Vessel to NEP through a time charter agreement executed by IBC and NEP on December 27, 1989 (\"the 1989 time charter\").  The executed time charter was substantially similar to the October draft charter, but not exactly identical.  The arbitration provisions in the two documents, however, were alike in all respects.  That same day, December 27, Keystone and IBC entered into a management agreement which provided that Keystone would continue to manage the Vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The executed 1989 time charter gave NEP the option to purchase the Vessel and terminate the charter with six months' prior, written notice.  In 1994, NEP decided to exercise its option, resell the Vessel to International Shipholding Corp.  (\"ISC\"), and then recharter the Vessel from ISC.  On October 27, 1994, NEP and ISC signed a Memorandum of Agreement to this effect.  Several days later, on November 1, 1994, NEP notified Keystone and IBC that it was exercising its six-month purchase option and would buy the Vessel on May 1, 1995.  NEP concurrently demanded arbitration of its right to do this, because Keystone had previously communicated that it would contest NEP's right to exercise the purchase option.  Keystone alleged that in the negotiations that produced the 1989 settlement agreement NEP had represented that it would not exercise the time charter's purchase option.  NEP's exercise of the option, Keystone suggested, indicated that NEP had made misrepresentations at the time of the settlement negotiations and had violated Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 93A.  A three-member arbitration panel was convened to hear the parties' dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 1995, the arbitration panel decided four threshold issues concerning NEP's service of the purchase notice and demand for arbitration in favor of NEP.  IBC responded by filing an action in federal district court under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10 to vacate the arbitrators' ruling, but the court dismissed the complaint as premature.  See Intercoastal Bulk Carriers, Inc. v. New England Power Co., No. 95-10880 RW2, (D.Mass. May 18, 1995).  Thereafter, Keystone and IBC resumed arbitration of the dispute.  On May 17, 1995, Keystone and IBC announced that they were withdrawing the challenge to NEP's right to exercise the purchase option from arbitration, leaving to the panel the issue of whether NEP's actions had violated Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same day, May 17, Keystone sued NEP in Massachusetts state court, claiming that NEP had made misrepresentations during the negotiations over the 1989 settlement agreement.  NEP moved to dismiss Keystone's claims on the ground that they were governed by the arbitration provision of the 1989 time charter.  Keystone responded that its claims against NEP did not arise under the 1989 time charter signed by NEP and IBC, but instead arose out of the 1989 settlement agreement, which did not have an arbitration provision.  The state court agreed with NEP and dismissed Keystone's complaint.  The state court concluded that the settlement agreement's provisions meant that Keystone was bound by the 1989 time charter's arbitration clause, notwithstanding the fact that Keystone had not signed the charter, which had been executed by its nominee, IBC, and NEP.  See Keystone Shipping Co. v. New England Power Co., No. 95-1141-B (Mass.  Superior Court, Essex County, August 17, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispute thus returned to the original arbitration panel, which, on August 21, 1995, concluded that NEP had the right to exercise the purchase option in the 1989 time charter.  The arbitrators ordered IBC to sell the Vessel to NEP.  Two days later, IBC filed an action in federal district court seeking to vacate the arbitrators' latest rulings.  See Intercoastal Bulk Carriers, Inc. v. New England Power Co., C.A. No. 95-11881-GAO.   Shortly thereafter, on September 5, 1995, Keystone filed a notice of appeal from the state court's decision to dismiss its state cause of action against NEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was the state of legal affairs between the parties when, on September 20, 1995, IBC and NEP entered into a new settlement agreement (\"the 1995 settlement agreement\").  Under the new settlement agreement, IBC agreed to transfer the Vessel in accordance with NEP's wishes to ISC's nominee, Enterprise Ship Co.  (\"Enterprise\").  The parties expressly acknowledged that the arbitration clause found in the 1989 time charter would govern the new settlement agreement.  The settlement agreement also provided for the mutual release of claims by Keystone and IBC in favor of NEP and vice versa.  There was one exception to this general release.  Exhibit B of the agreement expressly provided that NEP did not release Keystone and IBC from \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing based upon a survey ... when the Vessel is drydocked immediately after the Closing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28, 1995, the Vessel's new owner, Enterprise, took title and sent the Vessel to a shipyard for the agreed-upon inspection.  The survey that followed revealed corrosion damage to the Vessel's bulkheads and cargo holds exceeding the tolerances established by the American Bureau of Shipping, thereby making the Vessel unseaworthy.  The ship inspectors refused to allow the Vessel to sail until the needed repairs were completed.  NEP alleges that the bulk of the corrosion damage was a direct result of Keystone's failure to maintain the Vessel.  The total cost to bring the Vessel to standard is claimed to be approximately $14 million dollars.  NEP argues that Keystone and IBC are responsible for much of that amount under the terms of the 1989 time charter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 1995, NEP notified the arbitration panel that it desired to arbitrate its claims for the Vessel's repair costs against Keystone and IBC.  Keystone denied that it was required to arbitrate NEP's claims, and on February 27, 1996 filed suit in federal district court seeking a stay of arbitration pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 251, &#167; 2(b).  NEP cross-moved under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 4, to compel arbitration.  On May 24, 1996, the district court granted NEP's motion to compel, concluding that the arbitrability of NEP's claims against Keystone was an issue that had been previously decided in Massachusetts state court, and, in any event, was the result compelled by the merits.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's application of the doctrine of issue preclusion because \"[t]he applicability vel non of preclusion principles is a question of law.\"  Monarch Life Ins.

On appeal, Keystone maintains that the district court misapplied the issue preclusion doctrine.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, we note that \"[t]he full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738, requires us to give 'the same preclusive effect to state court judgments--both as to claims and issues previously adjudicated--as would be given in the state court system in which the federal court sits.' \"  Kyricopoulos v. Town of Orleans, 967 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam) (quoting Willhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 704 (1st Cir.1991)).  Massachusetts law thus governs the preclusion question in this case.  However, we have previously recognized that Massachusetts courts \"apply the doctrine of issue preclusion in a traditional manner.\"  Willhauck, 953 F.2d at 705 (citing Martin v. Ring, 401 Mass. 59, 514 N.E.2d 663, 664 (1987);  Fireside Motors, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp., 395 Mass. 366, 479 N.E.2d 1386 (1985);  Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 27 (1982)).  Because our cases apply the same traditional preclusion principles that would control in a Massachusetts court, our previous pronouncements in this area of law are persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The principle of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion,\" we have explained, \"bars relitigation of any factual or legal issue that was actually decided in previous litigation 'between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.' \"  Grella, 42 F.3d at 30 (quoting Dennis v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust, 744 F.2d 893, 899 (1st Cir.1984) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 27 (1982))).  When the parties in a subsequent action are the same as those in a prior one, a party seeking to invoke the doctrine of issue preclusion needs to establish four essential elements:  \"(1) the issue sought to be precluded must be the same as that involved in the prior action;  (2) the issue must have been actually litigated;  (3) the issue must have been determined by a valid and binding final judgment;  and (4) the determination of the issue must have been essential to the judgment.\"  Grella, 42 F.3d at 30;  accord Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 981.   Each of these elements is present in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the arbitrability of NEP's claims in this case raises the same issue raised in the Massachusetts state cause of action.  Keystone ingeniously attempts to argue that there are two separate and distinct arbitrability issues.  Keystone in particular maintains that the state court decided that claims against it under the 1989 settlement agreement were arbitrable, but that this case raises a different issue:  \"whether claims asserted by NEP against Keystone under the 1989 Time Charter and 1995 NEP-IBC Settlement Agreement are arbitrable.\"   Keystone fails to persuade for a very simple, but inescapable, reason.  The state court concluded that Keystone was bound to arbitrate claims concerning the Vessel under the 1989 settlement agreement because (1) it was bound to arbitrate such claims under the terms of the executed 1989 time charter, and (2) Keystone had expressly agreed in the 1989 settlement agreement that ownership of the Vessel would pass to Keystone or a Keystone nominee and that the Vessel's new owner would time charter the Vessel to NEP on \"terms and conditions agreed to by Keystone and NEP.\"   Because arbitrability of claims concerning the Vessel was one such term and condition in the executed time charter, the state court concluded that the settlement agreement's express language bound Keystone to arbitrate such claims.  Put in another fashion, the state court found that Keystone, in the 1989 settlement agreement, had expressly agreed that it or a nominee would execute a time charter on terms and conditions agreeable to Keystone, and thus was bound to arbitrate all disputes because the executed time charter, like the draft charter attached to the settlement agreement and initialed on every page by Keystone, made claims concerning the Vessel arbitrable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keystone's argument about the 1995 settlement agreement likewise fails to persuade because the parties to the agreement expressly acknowledged that the arbitration clause found in the 1989 time charter would apply and govern the new settlement agreement.  While it is true that the settlement agreement provided for the mutual release of claims by Keystone and IBC in favor of NEP and vice versa, the agreement expressly carved out an exception to the general release for \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing.\"   Because NEP did not release such claims, and because such claims arise under the 1989 settlement agreement and are arbitrable under the terms of that agreement and the 1989 time charter, their arbitrability in the instant case is the very same issue previously litigated and decided in Massachusetts state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This point carries us to the second element of the issue preclusion standard:  the issue raised here on appeal has been \"actually litigated.\"  Grella, 42 F.3d at 30.   Keystone opposed NEP's motion to dismiss the Massachusetts state cause of action before the state court with briefs, affidavits, and at a motion hearing.  Keystone feebly argues that the state court should not have disposed of its cause of action by motion, but instead should have conducted an evidentiary hearing.  As NEP correctly notes, the Massachusetts court had before it the relevant contractual documents, read and heard the litigants' opposing views on what meaning and effect should be afforded to those documents and the history of the parties' arbitration efforts, and properly concluded that the arbitrability question could be decided on motion.  Well-settled principles of law indicate that the arbitrability issue was actually litigated for preclusion purposes because it was \"subject to an adversary presentation and consequent judgment\" that was not \"a product of the parties' consent and is a final decision on the merits.\"   Jack H. Friedenthal et al., Civil Procedure &#167; 14.11, at 672, 673 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reach the third and fourth essential elements of collateral estoppel:  the issue sought to be precluded must have been determined by a valid and binding final judgment and the issue's determination must have been essential to the judgment.  See Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 978;  Grella, 42 F.3d at 30.   Keystone does not challenge the validity and binding nature of the state court judgment.  Rather, Keystone argues that the state court judgment focused on the 1989 settlement agreement and thus did not determine the arbitrability of NEP's current claims because the court did not decide whether claims against Keystone are arbitrable under either the 1989 time charter or the 1995 settlement agreement.  This argument is nothing more than a recycled version of the contention we have just rejected.  As we have seen, the state court determined that Keystone was bound to arbitrate under the 1989 settlement agreement because that agreement contemplated the 1989 time charter, which contained a sweeping arbitration clause.  The arbitrability of any claims, including NEP's present ones, under the 1989 time charter was an essential component in the state court's prior determination, even if it itself was not the ultimate issue the court decided.  As we recently explained, an \"issue may be actually litigated and resolved 'even if it is not explicitly decided,' as long as it is logically necessary to [the court's] final decision.\"  Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 982 (quoting and construing Grella, 42 F.3d at 30-31) (emphasis in original omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record indicates that the arbitrability of NEP's present claims against Keystone is an issue that has already been litigated and decided by the parties in Massachusetts state court.  Under the doctrine of issue preclusion, Keystone cannot seek to undo or redo in federal court what has already been done in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Merits of the Arbitrability Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision today would be the same even if principles of collateral estoppel did not bar Keystone's attempt to relitigate the arbitrability of NEP's current claims against it.  Our review of the record and the relevant contractual documents contained therein convinces us that Keystone is bound to arbitrate NEP's claims regarding the Vessel.  In view of the detailed factual discussion we have already undertaken, we do not feel it necessary to replay all of the evidence.  We shall only briefly explain why we conclude that Keystone is bound to arbitrate such claims as those NEP presently advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keystone entered into the 1989 settlement agreement with NEP.  In that agreement, Keystone expressly agreed that ownership of the Vessel would pass to it or a Keystone nominee and that the Vessel's new owner would time charter the Vessel to NEP on \"terms and conditions agreed to by Keystone and NEP.\"   Attached to the settlement agreement was a draft of the contemplated time charter that Keystone initialed on every page.  The draft charter contained a sweeping arbitration clause, which provided that \"[a]ny and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this Charter which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be put to arbitration in the City of Boston.\"   Keystone subsequently nominated IBC to take title to the Vessel and IBC, in turn, executed the time charter with NEP that was contemplated in the 1989 settlement agreement.  The executed time charter contained the exact same arbitration provision as the draft attached to the settlement agreement.  The inescapable conclusion from the foregoing is that Keystone agreed to time charter the Vessel to NEP, via its nominee IBC, under the terms and conditions established in the executed time charter, including the terms and conditions regarding the arbitrability of claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1995 settlement agreement between IBC and NEP does not change this legal state of affairs.  Both parties to the agreement expressly acknowledged that the arbitration clause found in the 1989 time charter would govern the new settlement agreement.  While the new settlement agreement provided for the mutual release of claims by Keystone and IBC in favor of NEP and vice versa, as we have said, the agreement expressly carves out one exception from this general release.  The relevant language could not be more clear:  NEP does not release Keystone and IBC from \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing based upon a survey ... when the Vessel is drydocked immediately after the Closing.\"   Because NEP does not release such claims against Keystone, and because such claims arise under the 1989 settlement agreement and are arbitrable under the executed time charter contemplated by that earlier settlement agreement, Keystone is obligated to arbitrate NEP's present claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Keystone itself did not sign either the 1989 time charter or the 1995 settlement agreement is not dispositive.  Keystone is bound by the terms and conditions of the executed time charter because of the commitments it undertook in the 1989 settlement agreement.  And the fact that Keystone is not a signatory to the 1995 settlement agreement is nothing more than a clever red herring because that agreement specifically preserves Keystone's prior exposure and liability under the 1989 settlement agreement and time charter, for \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having weighed the merits vel non of this appeal, we find that the balance swings clearly in NEP's favor.  We conclude that NEP's claims are arbitrable and decline Keystone's invitation to visit additional corollary issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Principles of collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) raise a bar to Keystone's attempt to litigate the arbitrability of NEP's present claims for recovery of repair costs to the Vessel.  Even if this were not the case, NEP's claims against Keystone are arbitrable as a consequence of Keystone's contractual commitments.  We thus conclude that the district court's order to compel arbitration was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

(\"Keystone\") are arbitrable.  We reach two conclusions pointing to the same result.  First, because the issue has already been litigated by the parties in Massachusetts state court, it is precluded from relitigation under the doctrine of issue preclusion.  Second, even if the issue were not precluded, we find that Keystone and NEP have a legally-enforceable agreement to arbitrate disputes like the one here.  We thus affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to resolve this appeal we must consider a long series of agreements and disputes between Keystone and NEP concerning the S.S. Energy Independence, now named the S.S. Energy Enterprise (\"the Vessel\").  The Vessel was constructed in the early 1980s by the New England Collier Company (\"NECCO\"), an unincorporated joint venture between Keystone and an NEP affiliate, New England Energy Incorporated (\"NEEI\").  NEP, in turn, chartered the Vessel from NECCO to deliver coal to its electric power plants.  The joint venture agreement and the NEP time charter both contained arbitration provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship was not an entirely happy one and a dispute between the parties followed.  In 1987, Keystone commenced arbitration against NEEI under the joint venture agreement, while NEP commenced arbitration against NECCO under the time charter.  In a previous appeal to this Court, we held that the two arbitrations were amenable to consolidation by federal court order.  See New England Energy Inc. v. Keystone Shipping Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under the agreement's terms, ownership of the Vessel was to pass from NECCO to Keystone or a Keystone nominee.  The parties further agreed that the Vessel's new owner would time charter the Vessel to NEP on \"terms and conditions agreed to by Keystone and NEP.\"   They annexed a draft of the proposed new time charter (\"the draft charter\") to the settlement agreement.  Like the then-operative NEP time charter, the draft charter contained a sweeping arbitration provision.  In particular, Section 41 of the draft charter provided that \"[a]ny and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this Charter which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be put to arbitration in the City of Boston ... before a board of three persons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keystone nominated Intercoastal Bulk Carriers, Inc.  (\"IBC\") to be the Vessel's new owner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In accordance with the settlement agreement, NECCO sold the Vessel to IBC and IBC, in turn, chartered the Vessel to NEP through a time charter agreement executed by IBC and NEP on December 27, 1989 (\"the 1989 time charter\").  The executed time charter was substantially similar to the October draft charter, but not exactly identical.  The arbitration provisions in the two documents, however, were alike in all respects.  That same day, December 27, Keystone and IBC entered into a management agreement which provided that Keystone would continue to manage the Vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The executed 1989 time charter gave NEP the option to purchase the Vessel and terminate the charter with six months' prior, written notice.  In 1994, NEP decided to exercise its option, resell the Vessel to International Shipholding Corp.  (\"ISC\"), and then recharter the Vessel from ISC.  On October 27, 1994, NEP and ISC signed a Memorandum of Agreement to this effect.  Several days later, on November 1, 1994, NEP notified Keystone and IBC that it was exercising its six-month purchase option and would buy the Vessel on May 1, 1995.  NEP concurrently demanded arbitration of its right to do this, because Keystone had previously communicated that it would contest NEP's right to exercise the purchase option.  Keystone alleged that in the negotiations that produced the 1989 settlement agreement NEP had represented that it would not exercise the time charter's purchase option.  NEP's exercise of the option, Keystone suggested, indicated that NEP had made misrepresentations at the time of the settlement negotiations and had violated Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 93A.  A three-member arbitration panel was convened to hear the parties' dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 15, 1995, the arbitration panel decided four threshold issues concerning NEP's service of the purchase notice and demand for arbitration in favor of NEP.  IBC responded by filing an action in federal district court under 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10 to vacate the arbitrators' ruling, but the court dismissed the complaint as premature.  See Intercoastal Bulk Carriers, Inc. v. New England Power Co., No. 95-10880 RW2, (D.Mass. May 18, 1995).  Thereafter, Keystone and IBC resumed arbitration of the dispute.  On May 17, 1995, Keystone and IBC announced that they were withdrawing the challenge to NEP's right to exercise the purchase option from arbitration, leaving to the panel the issue of whether NEP's actions had violated Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same day, May 17, Keystone sued NEP in Massachusetts state court, claiming that NEP had made misrepresentations during the negotiations over the 1989 settlement agreement.  NEP moved to dismiss Keystone's claims on the ground that they were governed by the arbitration provision of the 1989 time charter.  Keystone responded that its claims against NEP did not arise under the 1989 time charter signed by NEP and IBC, but instead arose out of the 1989 settlement agreement, which did not have an arbitration provision.  The state court agreed with NEP and dismissed Keystone's complaint.  The state court concluded that the settlement agreement's provisions meant that Keystone was bound by the 1989 time charter's arbitration clause, notwithstanding the fact that Keystone had not signed the charter, which had been executed by its nominee, IBC, and NEP.  See Keystone Shipping Co. v. New England Power Co., No. 95-1141-B (Mass.  Superior Court, Essex County, August 17, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dispute thus returned to the original arbitration panel, which, on August 21, 1995, concluded that NEP had the right to exercise the purchase option in the 1989 time charter.  The arbitrators ordered IBC to sell the Vessel to NEP.  Two days later, IBC filed an action in federal district court seeking to vacate the arbitrators' latest rulings.  See Intercoastal Bulk Carriers, Inc. v. New England Power Co., C.A. No. 95-11881-GAO.   Shortly thereafter, on September 5, 1995, Keystone filed a notice of appeal from the state court's decision to dismiss its state cause of action against NEP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was the state of legal affairs between the parties when, on September 20, 1995, IBC and NEP entered into a new settlement agreement (\"the 1995 settlement agreement\").  Under the new settlement agreement, IBC agreed to transfer the Vessel in accordance with NEP's wishes to ISC's nominee, Enterprise Ship Co.  (\"Enterprise\").  The parties expressly acknowledged that the arbitration clause found in the 1989 time charter would govern the new settlement agreement.  The settlement agreement also provided for the mutual release of claims by Keystone and IBC in favor of NEP and vice versa.  There was one exception to this general release.  Exhibit B of the agreement expressly provided that NEP did not release Keystone and IBC from \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing based upon a survey ... when the Vessel is drydocked immediately after the Closing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28, 1995, the Vessel's new owner, Enterprise, took title and sent the Vessel to a shipyard for the agreed-upon inspection.  The survey that followed revealed corrosion damage to the Vessel's bulkheads and cargo holds exceeding the tolerances established by the American Bureau of Shipping, thereby making the Vessel unseaworthy.  The ship inspectors refused to allow the Vessel to sail until the needed repairs were completed.  NEP alleges that the bulk of the corrosion damage was a direct result of Keystone's failure to maintain the Vessel.  The total cost to bring the Vessel to standard is claimed to be approximately $14 million dollars.  NEP argues that Keystone and IBC are responsible for much of that amount under the terms of the 1989 time charter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 20, 1995, NEP notified the arbitration panel that it desired to arbitrate its claims for the Vessel's repair costs against Keystone and IBC.  Keystone denied that it was required to arbitrate NEP's claims, and on February 27, 1996 filed suit in federal district court seeking a stay of arbitration pursuant to Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 251, &#167; 2(b).  NEP cross-moved under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 4, to compel arbitration.  On May 24, 1996, the district court granted NEP's motion to compel, concluding that the arbitrability of NEP's claims against Keystone was an issue that had been previously decided in Massachusetts state court, and, in any event, was the result compelled by the merits.

When the parties in a subsequent action are the same as those in a prior one, a party seeking to invoke the doctrine of issue preclusion needs to establish four essential elements:  \"(1) the issue sought to be precluded must be the same as that involved in the prior action;  (2) the issue must have been actually litigated;  (3) the issue must have been determined by a valid and binding final judgment;  and (4) the determination of the issue must have been essential to the judgment.\"  Grella, 42 F.3d at 30;  accord Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 981.   Each of these elements is present in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the arbitrability of NEP's claims in this case raises the same issue raised in the Massachusetts state cause of action.  Keystone ingeniously attempts to argue that there are two separate and distinct arbitrability issues.  Keystone in particular maintains that the state court decided that claims against it under the 1989 settlement agreement were arbitrable, but that this case raises a different issue:  \"whether claims asserted by NEP against Keystone under the 1989 Time Charter and 1995 NEP-IBC Settlement Agreement are arbitrable.\"   Keystone fails to persuade for a very simple, but inescapable, reason.  The state court concluded that Keystone was bound to arbitrate claims concerning the Vessel under the 1989 settlement agreement because (1) it was bound to arbitrate such claims under the terms of the executed 1989 time charter, and (2) Keystone had expressly agreed in the 1989 settlement agreement that ownership of the Vessel would pass to Keystone or a Keystone nominee and that the Vessel's new owner would time charter the Vessel to NEP on \"terms and conditions agreed to by Keystone and NEP.\"   Because arbitrability of claims concerning the Vessel was one such term and condition in the executed time charter, the state court concluded that the settlement agreement's express language bound Keystone to arbitrate such claims.  Put in another fashion, the state court found that Keystone, in the 1989 settlement agreement, had expressly agreed that it or a nominee would execute a time charter on terms and conditions agreeable to Keystone, and thus was bound to arbitrate all disputes because the executed time charter, like the draft charter attached to the settlement agreement and initialed on every page by Keystone, made claims concerning the Vessel arbitrable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keystone's argument about the 1995 settlement agreement likewise fails to persuade because the parties to the agreement expressly acknowledged that the arbitration clause found in the 1989 time charter would apply and govern the new settlement agreement.  While it is true that the settlement agreement provided for the mutual release of claims by Keystone and IBC in favor of NEP and vice versa, the agreement expressly carved out an exception to the general release for \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing.\"   Because NEP did not release such claims, and because such claims arise under the 1989 settlement agreement and are arbitrable under the terms of that agreement and the 1989 time charter, their arbitrability in the instant case is the very same issue previously litigated and decided in Massachusetts state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This point carries us to the second element of the issue preclusion standard:  the issue raised here on appeal has been \"actually litigated.\"  Grella, 42 F.3d at 30.   Keystone opposed NEP's motion to dismiss the Massachusetts state cause of action before the state court with briefs, affidavits, and at a motion hearing.  Keystone feebly argues that the state court should not have disposed of its cause of action by motion, but instead should have conducted an evidentiary hearing.  As NEP correctly notes, the Massachusetts court had before it the relevant contractual documents, read and heard the litigants' opposing views on what meaning and effect should be afforded to those documents and the history of the parties' arbitration efforts, and properly concluded that the arbitrability question could be decided on motion.  Well-settled principles of law indicate that the arbitrability issue was actually litigated for preclusion purposes because it was \"subject to an adversary presentation and consequent judgment\" that was not \"a product of the parties' consent and is a final decision on the merits.\"   Jack H. Friedenthal et al., Civil Procedure &#167; 14.11, at 672, 673 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus reach the third and fourth essential elements of collateral estoppel:  the issue sought to be precluded must have been determined by a valid and binding final judgment and the issue's determination must have been essential to the judgment.  See Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 978;  Grella, 42 F.3d at 30.   Keystone does not challenge the validity and binding nature of the state court judgment.  Rather, Keystone argues that the state court judgment focused on the 1989 settlement agreement and thus did not determine the arbitrability of NEP's current claims because the court did not decide whether claims against Keystone are arbitrable under either the 1989 time charter or the 1995 settlement agreement.  This argument is nothing more than a recycled version of the contention we have just rejected.  As we have seen, the state court determined that Keystone was bound to arbitrate under the 1989 settlement agreement because that agreement contemplated the 1989 time charter, which contained a sweeping arbitration clause.  The arbitrability of any claims, including NEP's present ones, under the 1989 time charter was an essential component in the state court's prior determination, even if it itself was not the ultimate issue the court decided.  As we recently explained, an \"issue may be actually litigated and resolved 'even if it is not explicitly decided,' as long as it is logically necessary to [the court's] final decision.\"  Ropes &amp; Gray, 65 F.3d at 982 (quoting and construing Grella, 42 F.3d at 30-31) (emphasis in original omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record indicates that the arbitrability of NEP's present claims against Keystone is an issue that has already been litigated and decided by the parties in Massachusetts state court.  Under the doctrine of issue preclusion, Keystone cannot seek to undo or redo in federal court what has already been done in state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Merits of the Arbitrability Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision today would be the same even if principles of collateral estoppel did not bar Keystone's attempt to relitigate the arbitrability of NEP's current claims against it.  Our review of the record and the relevant contractual documents contained therein convinces us that Keystone is bound to arbitrate NEP's claims regarding the Vessel.  In view of the detailed factual discussion we have already undertaken, we do not feel it necessary to replay all of the evidence.  We shall only briefly explain why we conclude that Keystone is bound to arbitrate such claims as those NEP presently advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keystone entered into the 1989 settlement agreement with NEP.  In that agreement, Keystone expressly agreed that ownership of the Vessel would pass to it or a Keystone nominee and that the Vessel's new owner would time charter the Vessel to NEP on \"terms and conditions agreed to by Keystone and NEP.\"   Attached to the settlement agreement was a draft of the contemplated time charter that Keystone initialed on every page.  The draft charter contained a sweeping arbitration clause, which provided that \"[a]ny and all differences and disputes of whatsoever nature arising out of this Charter which cannot be resolved by the parties shall be put to arbitration in the City of Boston.\"   Keystone subsequently nominated IBC to take title to the Vessel and IBC, in turn, executed the time charter with NEP that was contemplated in the 1989 settlement agreement.  The executed time charter contained the exact same arbitration provision as the draft attached to the settlement agreement.  The inescapable conclusion from the foregoing is that Keystone agreed to time charter the Vessel to NEP, via its nominee IBC, under the terms and conditions established in the executed time charter, including the terms and conditions regarding the arbitrability of claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1995 settlement agreement between IBC and NEP does not change this legal state of affairs.  Both parties to the agreement expressly acknowledged that the arbitration clause found in the 1989 time charter would govern the new settlement agreement.  While the new settlement agreement provided for the mutual release of claims by Keystone and IBC in favor of NEP and vice versa, as we have said, the agreement expressly carves out one exception from this general release.  The relevant language could not be more clear:  NEP does not release Keystone and IBC from \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing based upon a survey ... when the Vessel is drydocked immediately after the Closing.\"   Because NEP does not release such claims against Keystone, and because such claims arise under the 1989 settlement agreement and are arbitrable under the executed time charter contemplated by that earlier settlement agreement, Keystone is obligated to arbitrate NEP's present claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Keystone itself did not sign either the 1989 time charter or the 1995 settlement agreement is not dispositive.  Keystone is bound by the terms and conditions of the executed time charter because of the commitments it undertook in the 1989 settlement agreement.  And the fact that Keystone is not a signatory to the 1995 settlement agreement is nothing more than a clever red herring because that agreement specifically preserves Keystone's prior exposure and liability under the 1989 settlement agreement and time charter, for \"claims, if any, by reason of the Vessel not being in class at the Closing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having weighed the merits vel non of this appeal, we find that the balance swings clearly in NEP's favor.  We conclude that NEP's claims are arbitrable and decline Keystone's invitation to visit additional corollary issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Principles of collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) raise a bar to Keystone's attempt to litigate the arbitrability of NEP's present claims for recovery of repair costs to the Vessel.  Even if this were not the case, NEP's claims against Keystone are arbitrable as a consequence of Keystone's contractual commitments.  We thus conclude that the district court's order to compel arbitration was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.
