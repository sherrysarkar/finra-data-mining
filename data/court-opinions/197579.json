The district court granted summary judgment to Mt.\r\n\nAiry Insurance Company.  This appeal ensued.1\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Jonah  Jacob filed  a malpractice action  against eight\r\n\nattorneys, including Stephen A. Greenbaum, Richard Oshana, Ira A.\r\n\nNagel, Howard S. Fisher, and Gerald A. Hamelburg (the Law Firm).2\r\n\nThe factual allegations of Jacob's complaint as summarized by the\r\n\ndistrict court  are  as  follows.   In  1984,  Jacob,  Greenbaum,\r\n\nOshana,  and  Richard Gold  (not  a party)  formed  a partnership\r\n\nstyled as South Copley Limited Partnership (South Copley).  South\r\n\nCopley was  created to  acquire, develop  and manage  residential\r\n\nreal  estate.    Jacob  was  a  passive  investor  who  entrusted\r\n\nGreenbaum,  Oshana and the Law Firm with management and oversight\r\n\nof these investment business affairs.  \r\n\n          Over the next  five years the partnership  created four\r\n\ntrusts and  two partnerships to  hold title to  various projects:\r\n\nthe Horace Street Trust, the Trenton Street Trust, the Westbridge\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   We find no  merit in defendants'  suggestion, raised  for the\r\nfirst time in their Reply Brief, that we have no jurisdiction  to\r\nhear this  appeal because  the district  court  made no  findings\r\njustifying its exercise of its discretionary declaratory judgment\r\nauthority.  An  insurance company's claim that it has  no duty to\r\ndefend  in another  action is  the  archetypal case  for which  a\r\ndeclaratory judgment is appropriate.\r\n\n2  Other  defendants are named in the malpractice action, but are\r\nnot parties to this appeal.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nTrust,  the Queensbury Realty  Trust, Northeast Glen  Limited and\r\n\nWestwood Limited.   Also,  in 1986,  Northeast Realty  Investment\r\n\nGroup  was incorporated to  manage the partnership's  real estate\r\n\nholdings.   Jacob's complaint describes these collectively as the\r\n\n\"Business Entities.\"  \r\n\n          All of the Business  Entities were operated out  of the\r\n\noffices of  the Law  Firm and were  allegedly funded  either with\r\n\nseed money from Jacob, or with real estate equity and loans which\r\n\nJacob,  Gold,   Oshana  and/or   Greenbaum  co-made   and/or  co-\r\n\nguaranteed.    The  Business Entities  either  owned  real estate\r\n\nprojects outright  or they were  used to channel  borrowed monies\r\n\nfor the acquisition and operation of the real estate projects.\r\n\n          At or  about  the time  that South  Copley was  formed,\r\n\nGreenbaum, Oshana and  Gold incorporated two  close corporations,\r\n\nSouth Copley  Development Corporation and South Copley Management\r\n\nCorporation, naming  themselves as  the sole  officers, directors\r\n\nand  shareholders.  According to the complaint, Greenbaum, Oshana\r\n\nand Gold  used these  two corporations,  together with  Northeast\r\n\nRealty   Investment  Group,  as   \"Related  Cash   Conduits\"  \"to\r\n\nimproperly  funnel fiduciary  monies  (belonging to  the Business\r\n\nEntities or to  Jacob) to each  named defendant, either  directly\r\n\nfor  no  reason  or  disguised  in  the  form  of  income  and/or\r\n\nreimbursement of expenses.\"\r\n\n          On August 13, 1986,  Jacob, Gold and Oshana  executed a\r\n\n\"Mortgage Investors Line of Credit and Collateral Pool Agreement\"\r\n\n(Collateral  Pool Agreement) under  which the  Mortgage Investors\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nCorporation (MIC) agreed  to extend a five  year, $5,000,000 line\r\n\nof credit  secured by the assets  of the Business Entities  and a\r\n\npromissory  note given by South  Copley Limited Partnership.  The\r\n\nterm \"Collateral  Pool\" was used  because Jacob agreed to  sign a\r\n\nnumber of  anticipatory  notes, mortgages,  guaranties and  other\r\n\nrelated security instruments or documents.\r\n\n          Over the  next five  years, MIC  advanced various  sums\r\n\npursuant to the Collateral Pool Agreement.  The complaint alleges\r\n\nthat \"[t]he  management of  virtually all  of [Jacob's]  business\r\n\naffairs with  MIC was, at all  times and in all  matters material\r\n\nhereto, in the hands of (and entrusted to) Richard  T. Oshana and\r\n\nRichard Gold, his co-borrowers, co-partner(s), co-beneficiary(s),\r\n\nco-shareholder(s)  and/or  trustee(s)  in  the  real  estate  and\r\n\nbusiness matters related to the MIC Loan Documents.  At all times\r\n\nmaterial hereto,  Defendants Oshana  and Greenbaum (as  attorneys\r\n\nworking  frequently   hand-in-glove)  and   the  Law   Firm  each\r\n\nrepresented Plaintiff's interests in and related to the MIC Loans\r\n\nand the Collateral Pool Agreement,  in and related to the various\r\n\nBusiness Entities. . . .\"  \r\n\n          While  managing the  Business  Entities, Jacob  alleges\r\n\nthat Greenbaum and  Oshana misappropriated funds  in the form  of\r\n\nloans, unexplained disbursements and management fees.  Jacob also\r\n\nalleges that  Greenbaum and Oshana abused Jacob's trust by taking\r\n\nadvantage  of  their  position as  principals  of  these Business\r\n\nEntities and  as his  attorney by  concealing the  aforementioned\r\n\nconduct and failing  to advise Jacob of these  breaches of trust.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nAll  of the  alleged misappropriation  occurred  through Business\r\n\nEntities  in which Greenbaum and Oshana were officers, directors,\r\n\nor partners.\r\n\n          Jacob  also alleges that  Oshana and Gold  were forging\r\n\nhis  signature to  obtain  monies  from  another  joint  business\r\n\nventure, and that Greenbaum knew  it.  He asserts that Greenbaum,\r\n\nOshana  and Gold  treated the  assets  of these  various business\r\n\nventures as their own in complete disregard of the rights, duties\r\n\nand obligations each owed Jacob.\r\n\n          Jacob also alleges that  Greenbaum and Oshana's conduct\r\n\nconstitutes  legal malpractice in that they stole fiduciary funds\r\n\nfrom  him and concealed  the misappropriation; failed  to account\r\n\nfor fiduciary funds, or to segregate Jacob's portion of the funds\r\n\nfrom the Business Entities'  funds; failed to protect or  promote\r\n\nJacob's  interest in  the Business  Entities,  acting instead  in\r\n\ntheir own self-interest by  misappropriating funds and concealing\r\n\nthe wrongdoing.3\r\n\n          Mt. Airy Insurance  Company (Mt. Airy) insures  the Law\r\n\nFirm against malpractice  claims and initially agreed  to defend,\r\n\nunder a reservation of rights.  Upon learning facts demonstrating\r\n\nthat Jacob's claim  is not covered by its policy,  Mt. Airy filed\r\n\nthis declaratory judgment action.  Mt. Airy  continued to provide\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3     Jacob's  ten-count   complaint  asserts  claims   of  legal\r\nmalpractice,  law  partnership  liability   by  estoppel,  fraud,\r\nnegligent   misrepresentation,   breach    of   fiduciary   duty,\r\nconversion, monies had  and received, unfair and  deceptive trade\r\npractices, and  equitable relief  in the  form of an  accounting,\r\nimposition of a  receivership, a permanent injunction,  and reach\r\nand apply.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\na  defense to  the Law Firm  until the district  court ruled that\r\n\nExclusion G  of its policy  with the Law Firm  precludes coverage\r\n\nfor Jacob's claims  against it and that  Mt. Airy has no  duty to\r\n\ndefend.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          A  liability insurer  in Massachusetts  has  a duty  to\r\n\ndefend  its  insured  \"if  the  allegations  in  the  third-party\r\n\ncomplaint are  reasonably susceptible  of an interpretation  that\r\n\nthey state or adumbrate a claim covered  by the policy terms. . .\r\n\n.\"   Sterilite Corp. v.

Airy argues that,  because Jacob's  claims involve\r\n\nlosses connected  with independent businesses  owned, controlled,\r\n\nor  managed  by the  Insureds,  the  claims  are excluded.    The\r\n\ndefendants,  joined by Jacob,  argue that, because  at least some\r\n\nclaims in  the Jacob complaint  allege breach of  fiduciary duty,\r\n\nMt. Airy has an unqualified duty to defend.   The defendants also\r\n\ncontest that Exclusion G applies  to exclude all claims raised by\r\n\nJacob's complaint.  \r\n\n          The district court  held, as a matter of  law, that all\r\n\nof  Jacob's claims  come  within  Exclusion G.    We review  this\r\n\njudgment de novo.   Alan Corp. v. Int. Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 22\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 339, 341-42 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                               IV.\r\n\n          Exclusion  G applies  to any  of  Jacob's claims  which\r\n\narise  out of,  or are  in  connection with,  the conduct  of any\r\n\nbusiness  which is owned  in whole or  in part by  any Insured or\r\n\nwhich  any Insured  controls, operates  or  manages.   Defendants\r\n\nargue that  Exclusion G  is inapplicable  because Jacob's  claims\r\n\narise out of  an alleged breach of their fiduciary  duty to Jacob\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nas  his lawyers  rather  than  out of  their  roles as  partners,\r\n\nofficers,  directors, shareholders  or  trustees  of their  joint\r\n\nbusiness   ventures   as  his   partners,   officers,  directors,\r\n\nshareholders or trustees of the joint business ventures.  \r\n\n          Defendants'  argument  that  the  duty  to   defend  is\r\n\ntriggered  by allegations of  legal malpractice misses  the mark.\r\n\nExclusion G does  not even come into play  unless the allegations\r\n\ncharge  legal malpractice, because  coverage under the  policy is\r\n\nlimited to malpractice.  \"There will always be an attorney-client\r\n\nrelationship  when these  exclusions  are at  issue.   Absent  an\r\n\nattorney-client  relationship, the  insuring  agreement does  not\r\n\napply and the  language of the specific exclusions  does not come\r\n\ninto  play.  [Defendants']  contention would create  an illogical\r\n\nresult;  the  policy   exclusions  would  be   rendered  entirely\r\n\nmeaningless and of no effect.\"   Senger v.

If attorney  negligence, rather than\r\n\nthe conduct of the business, is  the proximate cause of the loss,\r\n\nthey argue, the exclusion is inapplicable.  \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          The  argument ignores the plain language of Exclusion G\r\n\nwhich  excludes coverage  for  any  claim arising  out  of or  in\r                                            \r\n\nconnection  with the  conduct of  a business  entity in  which an\r\n\nInsured has an interest.  The  cases cited by defendants are  not\r\n\nto the contrary.  See  Clauder v. Home Ins. Co., 790 F. Supp. 162\r                                                         \r\n\n(S.D.

In Clauder, the policy  exclusion required that\r                                      \r\n\nthe  claim arise out of  work performed for  a business entity in\r\n\nwhich  the lawyer  had a  pecuniary or  beneficiary interest,  an\r\n\nexclusion  that is  narrower that  Exclusion G.   The  lawyer was\r\n\naccused of selling an  estate asset to a company in  which he had\r\n\nan interest without  disclosing that fact to his client.   790 F.\r\n\nSupp. at 164-65.   The Morris  court held that  application of  a\r                                       \r\n\nsimilar exclusion  depended on  whether the attorney  represented\r\n\nhis own company, the client, or both.  805 S.W.2d at  952.  Here,\r\n\nJacob's  complaint alleges  that Greenbaum  and  Oshana were,  at\r\n\nbest, representing both their companies and Jacob, and, at worst,\r\n\nrepresenting their companies to Jacob's detriment.  In Pepicelli,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthe attorney's interest in another business was not at issue; the\r\n\nplaintiff rather alleged  negligence on the part of  his law firm\r\n\nin its handling of the plaintiff's insurance claim.   821 F.2d at\r\n\n220-21.\r\n\n          Furthermore, the  law of  Massachusetts is  contrary to\r\n\ndefendants'  position.

See also Murdock v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDinsmoor,  892  F.2d 7,  8  (1st  Cir.  1989) (\"arising  out  of\"\r                  \r\n\nordinarily held  to mean  \"originating from,\"  \"growing out  of,\"\r\n\n\"flowing  from,\" \"incident  to,\"  or \"having  connection  with\").\r\n\nExclusion G extends to include  all claims in connection with the\r\n\nconduct of an Insured's business entities.\r\n\n          In  summary, Exclusion  G  precludes  coverage for  any\r                                                                           \r\n\nclaim  which arises  out  of  or in  connection  with a  business\r\n\nventure  controlled, operated  or  managed by  any Insured  or in\r                                                            \r\n\nwhich the Insured has an interest as an owner or a partner.  This\r\n\nincludes  all claims sounding  in malpractice if  the allegations\r\n\ncharge wrongdoing  in connection  with a  business  in which  the\r\n\nInsured has such an interest.\r\n\n          We must  determine, then,  whether an  insured attorney\r\n\nplayed a  role as an  officer, shareholder, director,  trustee or\r\n\npartner in  every Business  Entity about  which Jacob  complains.\r\n\nThe district court  found the undisputed facts to  be that either\r\n\nGreenbaum or Oshana did play such a role.\r\n\n          Greenbaum and  Oshana were  partners  in South  Copley,\r\n\nshareholders   and   officers   of   South   Copley   Development\r\n\nCorporation,  and  shareholders  and  officers  of  South  Copley\r\n\nManagement Corporation.  Oshana was a  shareholder and officer of\r\n\nNortheast  Realty  Investment   Group,  while  Greenbaum  was   a\r\n\ndirector.   Oshana was  a beneficiary of  Horace Street  Trust; a\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ntrustee and  beneficiary of Trenton  Street Trust; a  trustee and\r\n\nbeneficiary of the Westbridge Trust; a trustee and beneficiary of\r\n\nQueensbury Realty Trust; a partner in Northeast Glen Limited; and\r\n\na partner in Westwood Limited.  Greenbaum served as a trustee and\r\n\nbeneficiary of Horace Street Trust; and as a partner in Northeast\r\n\nGlen Limited.  \r\n\n          The  parties do not dispute that Greenbaum qualifies as\r\n\nan \"Insured\" under  the policy at all relevant times.  There is a\r\n\ndispute,  however, as  to  Oshana's  status  after May  8,  1988.\r\n\nGreenbaum attests that Oshana was terminated from the Law Firm on\r\n\nthat date.  Oshana disputes this fact.  \r\n\n          If Oshana was not an Insured after May of 1988, he has,\r\n\nof course, no coverage at all under the policy for his acts after\r\n\nthat date.  The Law Firm argues, however, that its coverage would\r\n\nbe revived for  malpractice claims arising after May  1988 and in\r\n\nconnection with business  entities to which Oshana is  their only\r\n\nlink.\r\n\n          A dispute  on a fact  necessary to the resolution  of a\r\n\nmotion  for  summary judgment  precludes  its  entry.   We  hold,\r\n\nhowever,  that the district  court correctly reasoned  that under\r\n\nthe undisputed facts  of this case, Oshana's status  after May of\r\n\n1988 is irrelevant to the issue of coverage.  \r\n\n          The facts  are that either Greenbaum or Oshana played a\r\n\nrole or had an interest in  each and every business venture about\r\n\nwhich Jacob complains.  In  each case these interests began prior\r                                                                           \r\n\nto May 1988 and continued uninterrupted until Jacob uncovered the\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nscheme.    Jacob's claims  all  arise  in connection  with  these\r\n\nbusiness schemes,  all of which  began prior to  Oshana's leaving\r\n\nthe firm, whenever that was.  \r\n\n          The issue, in fact, is not whether  Greenbaum or Oshana\r\n\nhad an  interest in  each Business Entity  for the  entire period\r\n\nalleged in  the complaint.   The relevant inquiry is  whether the\r\n\nclaim arises out  of the  conduct of a  Business Entity to  which\r\n\nGreenbaum or  Oshana had the  requisite relationship at  the time\r\n\nthe conduct began.  \r\n\n          For example, although  an alleged misappropriation from\r\n\nthe 11 Horace Street Trust may have occurred after  May 1988, the\r\n\nscheme began as  early as May  1985, and continued  uninterrupted\r\n\nuntil Jacob discovered  it in 1990. Greenbaum was  a director and\r\n\nOshana a beneficiary of the  trust at its inception.5  Similarly,\r\n\nthe defendants attempt to  separate the forged notes  executed to\r\n\nobtain  Collateral Pool  funds, arguing  that  claims related  to\r\n\nthese notes are  covered because Oshana was no  longer an Insured\r\n\nat  the  time.   It  was  in  1986,  however,  that  the  alleged\r\n\nmisappropriation and forgery first began.  The fact that Oshana's\r\n\nalleged misconduct continued uninterrupted until Jacob discovered\r\n\nit does not negate the  applicability of the Exclusion. The claim\r\n\nstill arises out of the conduct of a business enterprise in which\r\n\nan Insured was a partner at the time the conduct began.  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   In fact, it  is undisputed that  Greenbaum was a  Trustee and\r\nBeneficiary of the Trust from its formation in 1985 through 1990.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          Jacob's complaint alleges  an integrated ongoing scheme\r\n\nof deception  and misappropriation  that began  while Oshana  was\r\n\nstill an Insured.  If, out of hundred of individual transactions,\r\n\nsome  might  not  fall  under   Exclusion  G  if  they   occurred\r\n\nindependently,  that fact  is irrelevant.   An additional  act of\r\n\nwrongdoing at the tail end of the scheme does not create coverage\r\n\nfor  conduct which  began at  a time  when the  Insureds  had the\r\n\nrequisite relationship with the Business Entities.\r\n\n                               V.  \r\n\n          Jacob's claims  only allege  wrongdoing by  Insureds in\r\n\nconnection  with  businesses  in  which  they  had  an  interest.\r\n\nExclusion G  of the  Mt. Airy policy  excludes coverage  for such\r\n\nclaims.  Mt.  Airy, therefore, has no duty  to defend appellants.\r\n\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.  \r                                                        \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n",

Greenbaum, Richard Oshana, Ira A. Nagel, Howard S. Fisher, and Gerald A. Hamelburg (the Law Firm).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The factual allegations of Jacob's complaint as summarized by the district court are as follows.  In 1984, Jacob, Greenbaum, Oshana, and Richard Gold (not a party) formed a partnership styled as South Copley Limited Partnership (South Copley).  South Copley was created to acquire, develop and manage residential real estate.  Jacob was a passive investor who entrusted Greenbaum, Oshana and the Law Firm with management and oversight of these investment business affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next five years the partnership created four trusts and two partnerships to hold title to various projects:  the Horace Street Trust, the Trenton Street Trust, the Westbridge Trust, the Queensbury Realty Trust, Northeast Glen Limited and Westwood Limited.  Also, in 1986, Northeast Realty Investment Group was incorporated to manage the partnership's real estate holdings.  Jacob's complaint describes these collectively as the \"Business Entities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the Business Entities were operated out of the offices of the Law Firm and were allegedly funded either with seed money from Jacob, or with real estate equity and loans which Jacob, Gold, Oshana and/or Greenbaum co-made and/or co-guaranteed.  The Business Entities either owned real estate projects outright or they were used to channel borrowed monies for the acquisition and operation of the real estate projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At or about the time that South Copley was formed, Greenbaum, Oshana and Gold incorporated two close corporations, South Copley Development Corporation and South Copley Management Corporation, naming themselves as the sole officers, directors and shareholders.  According to the complaint, Greenbaum, Oshana and Gold used these two corporations, together with Northeast Realty Investment Group, as \"Related Cash Conduits\" \"to improperly funnel fiduciary monies (belonging to the Business Entities or to Jacob) to each named defendant, either directly for no reason or disguised in the form of income and/or reimbursement of expenses.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1986, Jacob, Gold and Oshana executed a \"Mortgage Investors Line of Credit and Collateral Pool Agreement\" (Collateral Pool Agreement) under which the Mortgage Investors Corporation (MIC) agreed to extend a five year, $5,000,000 line of credit secured by the assets of the Business Entities and a promissory note given by South Copley Limited Partnership.  The term \"Collateral Pool\" was used because Jacob agreed to sign a number of anticipatory notes, mortgages, guaranties and other related security instruments or documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next five years, MIC advanced various sums pursuant to the Collateral Pool Agreement.  The complaint alleges that \"[t]he management of virtually all of [Jacob's] business affairs with MIC was, at all times and in all matters material hereto, in the hands of (and entrusted to) Richard T. Oshana and Richard Gold, his co-borrowers, co-partner(s), co-beneficiary(s), co-shareholder(s) and/or trustee(s) in the real estate and business matters related to the MIC Loan Documents.  At all times material hereto, Defendants Oshana and Greenbaum (as attorneys working frequently hand-in-glove) and the Law Firm each represented Plaintiff's interests in and related to the MIC Loans and the Collateral Pool Agreement, in and related to the various Business Entities....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While managing the Business Entities, Jacob alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana misappropriated funds in the form of loans, unexplained disbursements and management fees.  Jacob also alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana abused Jacob's trust by taking advantage of their position as principals of these Business Entities and as his attorney by concealing the aforementioned conduct and failing to advise Jacob of these breaches of trust.  All of the alleged misappropriation occurred through Business Entities in which Greenbaum and Oshana were officers, directors, or partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob also alleges that Oshana and Gold were forging his signature to obtain monies from another joint business venture, and that Greenbaum knew it.  He asserts that Greenbaum, Oshana and Gold treated the assets of these various business ventures as their own in complete disregard of the rights, duties and obligations each owed Jacob.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob also alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana's conduct constitutes legal malpractice in that they stole fiduciary funds from him and concealed the misappropriation;  failed to account for fiduciary funds, or to segregate Jacob's portion of the funds from the Business Entities' funds;  failed to protect or promote Jacob's interest in the Business Entities, acting instead in their own self-interest by misappropriating funds and concealing the wrongdoing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mt.

Airy continued to provide a defense to the Law Firm until the district court ruled that Exclusion G of its policy with the Law Firm precludes coverage for Jacob's claims against it and that Mt.

Airy policy with the Law Firm, coverage is provided for claims arising out of professional services rendered by an \"Insured.\"   The policy defines \"Insured\" to include \"any lawyer ... who was or is a partner, officer, director, or employee of the [Law Firm], but only as respects professional services rendered on behalf of the Named Insured....\"  There is no dispute that a defense is owed under the policy unless some exclusion applies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policy contains an Exclusion G which precludes coverage for:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>any claim arising out of or in connection with the conduct of a business enterprise other than the Named Insured (including the ownership, maintenance or care of any property in connection therewith) which is owned by any Insured or in which any Insured is a partner, or which is directly or indirectly controlled, operated or managed by any Insured either individually or in a fiduciary capacity;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mt. Airy argues that, because Jacob's claims involve losses connected with independent businesses owned, controlled, or managed by the Insureds, the claims are excluded.  The defendants, joined by Jacob, argue that, because at least some claims in the Jacob complaint allege breach of fiduciary duty, Mt. Airy has an unqualified duty to defend.  The defendants also contest that Exclusion G applies to exclude all claims raised by Jacob's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held, as a matter of law, that all of Jacob's claims come within Exclusion G. We review this judgment de novo.  Alan Corp. v. Int.  Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 22 F.3d 339, 341-42 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exclusion G applies to any of Jacob's claims which arise out of, or are in connection with, the conduct of any business which is owned in whole or in part by any Insured or which any Insured controls, operates or manages.  Defendants argue that Exclusion G is inapplicable because Jacob's claims arise out of an alleged breach of their fiduciary duty to Jacob as his lawyers rather than out of their roles as partners, officers, directors, shareholders or trustees of their joint business ventures as his partners, officers, directors, shareholders or trustees of the joint business ventures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' argument that the duty to defend is triggered by allegations of legal malpractice misses the mark.  Exclusion G does not even come into play unless the allegations charge legal malpractice, because coverage under the policy is limited to malpractice.  \"There will always be an attorney-client relationship when these exclusions are at issue.  Absent an attorney-client relationship, the insuring agreement does not apply and the language of the specific exclusions does not come into play.  [Defendants'] contention would create an illogical result;  the policy exclusions would be rendered entirely meaningless and of no effect.\"  Senger v. Minnesota Lawyers Mut. Ins. Co., 415 N.W.2d 364, 368 (Minn.App.1987).  See also Potomac Ins. Co. v. McIntosh, 167 Ariz. 30, 804 P.2d 759, 762 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the Exclusion's requirement that the claim \"arise out of or in connection with\" the conduct of a controlled business enterprise should be interpreted to mean that the only acts excluded are those which are the proximate cause of the alleged loss.  If attorney negligence, rather than the conduct of the business, is the proximate cause of the loss, they argue, the exclusion is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument ignores the plain language of Exclusion G which excludes coverage for any claim arising out of or in connection with the conduct of a business entity in which an Insured has an interest.  The cases cited by defendants are not to the contrary.  See Clauder v. Home Ins. Co., 790 F.Supp. 162 (S.D.Ohio 1992);  Morris v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., 305 Ark. 25, 805 S.W.2d 948 (1991);  and Niagara Fire Ins. Co. v. Pepicelli, 821 F.2d 216 (3d Cir.1987).  In Clauder, the policy exclusion required that the claim arise out of work performed for a business entity in which the lawyer had a pecuniary or beneficiary interest, an exclusion that is narrower that Exclusion G. The lawyer was accused of selling an estate asset to a company in which he had an interest without disclosing that fact to his client.  790 F.Supp. at 164-65.   The Morris court held that application of a similar exclusion depended on whether the attorney represented his own company, the client, or both.  805 S.W.2d at 952.   Here, Jacob's complaint alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana were, at best, representing both their companies and Jacob, and, at worst, representing their companies to Jacob's detriment.  In Pepicelli, the attorney's interest in another business was not at issue;  the plaintiff rather alleged negligence on the part of his law firm in its handling of the plaintiff's insurance claim.  821 F.2d at 220-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the law of Massachusetts is contrary to defendants' position.  See New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 40 Mass.App.Ct. 722, 726, 667 N.E.2d 295 (1996) (the term \"arising out of\" is much broader than the term \"caused by,\" particularly in the context of an exclusionary clause in an insurance policy).  See also Murdock v. Dinsmoor, 892 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir.1989) (\"arising out of\" ordinarily held to mean \"originating from,\" \"growing out of,\" \"flowing from,\" \"incident to,\" or \"having connection with\").  Exclusion G extends to include all claims in connection with the conduct of an Insured's business entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Exclusion G precludes coverage for any claim which arises out of or in connection with a business venture controlled, operated or managed by any Insured or in which the Insured has an interest as an owner or a partner.  This includes all claims sounding in malpractice if the allegations charge wrongdoing in connection with a business in which the Insured has such an interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must determine, then, whether an insured attorney played a role as an officer, shareholder, director, trustee or partner in every Business Entity about which Jacob complains.  The district court found the undisputed facts to be that either Greenbaum or Oshana did play such a role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenbaum and Oshana were partners in South Copley, shareholders and officers of South Copley Development Corporation, and shareholders and officers of South Copley Management Corporation.  Oshana was a shareholder and officer of Northeast Realty Investment Group, while Greenbaum was a director.  Oshana was a beneficiary of Horace Street Trust;  a trustee and beneficiary of Trenton Street Trust;  a trustee and beneficiary of the Westbridge Trust;  a trustee and beneficiary of Queensbury Realty Trust;  a partner in Northeast Glen Limited;  and a partner in Westwood Limited.  Greenbaum served as a trustee and beneficiary of Horace Street Trust;  and as a partner in Northeast Glen Limited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that Greenbaum qualifies as an \"Insured\" under the policy at all relevant times.  There is a dispute, however, as to Oshana's status after May 8, 1988.  Greenbaum attests that Oshana was terminated from the Law Firm on that date.  Oshana disputes this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Oshana was not an Insured after May of 1988, he has, of course, no coverage at all under the policy for his acts after that date.  The Law Firm argues, however, that its coverage would be revived for malpractice claims arising after May 1988 and in connection with business entities to which Oshana is their only link.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dispute on a fact necessary to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment precludes its entry.  We hold, however, that the district court correctly reasoned that under the undisputed facts of this case, Oshana's status after May of 1988 is irrelevant to the issue of coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are that either Greenbaum or Oshana played a role or had an interest in each and every business venture about which Jacob complains.  In each case these interests began prior to May 1988 and continued uninterrupted until Jacob uncovered the scheme.  Jacob's claims all arise in connection with these business schemes, all of which began prior to Oshana's leaving the firm, whenever that was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, in fact, is not whether Greenbaum or Oshana had an interest in each Business Entity for the entire period alleged in the complaint.  The relevant inquiry is whether the claim arises out of the conduct of a Business Entity to which Greenbaum or Oshana had the requisite relationship at the time the conduct began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, although an alleged misappropriation from the 11 Horace Street Trust may have occurred after May 1988, the scheme began as early as May 1985, and continued uninterrupted until Jacob discovered it in 1990.  Greenbaum was a director and Oshana a beneficiary of the trust at its inception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Similarly, the defendants attempt to separate the forged notes executed to obtain Collateral Pool funds, arguing that claims related to these notes are covered because Oshana was no longer an Insured at the time.  It was in 1986, however, that the alleged misappropriation and forgery first began.  The fact that Oshana's alleged misconduct continued uninterrupted until Jacob discovered it does not negate the applicability of the Exclusion.  The claim still arises out of the conduct of a business enterprise in which an Insured was a partner at the time the conduct began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob's complaint alleges an integrated ongoing scheme of deception and misappropriation that began while Oshana was still an Insured.  If, out of hundred of individual transactions, some might not fall under Exclusion G if they occurred independently, that fact is irrelevant.  An additional act of wrongdoing at the tail end of the scheme does not create coverage for conduct which began at a time when the Insureds had the requisite relationship with the Business Entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob's claims only allege wrongdoing by Insureds in connection with businesses in which they had an interest.  Exclusion G of the Mt. Airy policy excludes coverage for such claims.  Mt. Airy, therefore, has no duty to defend appellants.  The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We find no merit in defendants' suggestion, raised for the first time in their Reply Brief, that we have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the district court made no findings justifying its exercise of its discretionary declaratory judgment authority.

Airy Insurance Company sought a declaratory judgment that it does not have a duty to defend the named defendants in an underlying malpractice action against them.  The district court granted summary judgment to Mt. Airy Insurance Company.  This appeal ensued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jonah Jacob filed a malpractice action against eight attorneys, including Stephen A. Greenbaum, Richard Oshana, Ira A. Nagel, Howard S. Fisher, and Gerald A. Hamelburg (the Law Firm).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The factual allegations of Jacob's complaint as summarized by the district court are as follows.  In 1984, Jacob, Greenbaum, Oshana, and Richard Gold (not a party) formed a partnership styled as South Copley Limited Partnership (South Copley).  South Copley was created to acquire, develop and manage residential real estate.  Jacob was a passive investor who entrusted Greenbaum, Oshana and the Law Firm with management and oversight of these investment business affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next five years the partnership created four trusts and two partnerships to hold title to various projects:  the Horace Street Trust, the Trenton Street Trust, the Westbridge Trust, the Queensbury Realty Trust, Northeast Glen Limited and Westwood Limited.  Also, in 1986, Northeast Realty Investment Group was incorporated to manage the partnership's real estate holdings.  Jacob's complaint describes these collectively as the \"Business Entities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the Business Entities were operated out of the offices of the Law Firm and were allegedly funded either with seed money from Jacob, or with real estate equity and loans which Jacob, Gold, Oshana and/or Greenbaum co-made and/or co-guaranteed.  The Business Entities either owned real estate projects outright or they were used to channel borrowed monies for the acquisition and operation of the real estate projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At or about the time that South Copley was formed, Greenbaum, Oshana and Gold incorporated two close corporations, South Copley Development Corporation and South Copley Management Corporation, naming themselves as the sole officers, directors and shareholders.  According to the complaint, Greenbaum, Oshana and Gold used these two corporations, together with Northeast Realty Investment Group, as \"Related Cash Conduits\" \"to improperly funnel fiduciary monies (belonging to the Business Entities or to Jacob) to each named defendant, either directly for no reason or disguised in the form of income and/or reimbursement of expenses.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1986, Jacob, Gold and Oshana executed a \"Mortgage Investors Line of Credit and Collateral Pool Agreement\" (Collateral Pool Agreement) under which the Mortgage Investors Corporation (MIC) agreed to extend a five year, $5,000,000 line of credit secured by the assets of the Business Entities and a promissory note given by South Copley Limited Partnership.  The term \"Collateral Pool\" was used because Jacob agreed to sign a number of anticipatory notes, mortgages, guaranties and other related security instruments or documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next five years, MIC advanced various sums pursuant to the Collateral Pool Agreement.  The complaint alleges that \"[t]he management of virtually all of [Jacob's] business affairs with MIC was, at all times and in all matters material hereto, in the hands of (and entrusted to) Richard T. Oshana and Richard Gold, his co-borrowers, co-partner(s), co-beneficiary(s), co-shareholder(s) and/or trustee(s) in the real estate and business matters related to the MIC Loan Documents.  At all times material hereto, Defendants Oshana and Greenbaum (as attorneys working frequently hand-in-glove) and the Law Firm each represented Plaintiff's interests in and related to the MIC Loans and the Collateral Pool Agreement, in and related to the various Business Entities....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While managing the Business Entities, Jacob alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana misappropriated funds in the form of loans, unexplained disbursements and management fees.  Jacob also alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana abused Jacob's trust by taking advantage of their position as principals of these Business Entities and as his attorney by concealing the aforementioned conduct and failing to advise Jacob of these breaches of trust.  All of the alleged misappropriation occurred through Business Entities in which Greenbaum and Oshana were officers, directors, or partners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob also alleges that Oshana and Gold were forging his signature to obtain monies from another joint business venture, and that Greenbaum knew it.  He asserts that Greenbaum, Oshana and Gold treated the assets of these various business ventures as their own in complete disregard of the rights, duties and obligations each owed Jacob.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob also alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana's conduct constitutes legal malpractice in that they stole fiduciary funds from him and concealed the misappropriation;  failed to account for fiduciary funds, or to segregate Jacob's portion of the funds from the Business Entities' funds;  failed to protect or promote Jacob's interest in the Business Entities, acting instead in their own self-interest by misappropriating funds and concealing the wrongdoing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mt.

Airy argues that, because Jacob's claims involve losses connected with independent businesses owned, controlled, or managed by the Insureds, the claims are excluded.  The defendants, joined by Jacob, argue that, because at least some claims in the Jacob complaint allege breach of fiduciary duty, Mt. Airy has an unqualified duty to defend.  The defendants also contest that Exclusion G applies to exclude all claims raised by Jacob's complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held, as a matter of law, that all of Jacob's claims come within Exclusion G.

Defendants argue that Exclusion G is inapplicable because Jacob's claims arise out of an alleged breach of their fiduciary duty to Jacob as his lawyers rather than out of their roles as partners, officers, directors, shareholders or trustees of their joint business ventures as his partners, officers, directors, shareholders or trustees of the joint business ventures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' argument that the duty to defend is triggered by allegations of legal malpractice misses the mark.  Exclusion G does not even come into play unless the allegations charge legal malpractice, because coverage under the policy is limited to malpractice.  \"There will always be an attorney-client relationship when these exclusions are at issue.  Absent an attorney-client relationship, the insuring agreement does not apply and the language of the specific exclusions does not come into play.

If attorney negligence, rather than the conduct of the business, is the proximate cause of the loss, they argue, the exclusion is inapplicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument ignores the plain language of Exclusion G which excludes coverage for any claim arising out of or in connection with the conduct of a business entity in which an Insured has an interest.  The cases cited by defendants are not to the contrary.  See Clauder v. Home Ins.

In Clauder, the policy exclusion required that the claim arise out of work performed for a business entity in which the lawyer had a pecuniary or beneficiary interest, an exclusion that is narrower that Exclusion G. The lawyer was accused of selling an estate asset to a company in which he had an interest without disclosing that fact to his client.  790 F.Supp. at 164-65.   The Morris court held that application of a similar exclusion depended on whether the attorney represented his own company, the client, or both.  805 S.W.2d at 952.   Here, Jacob's complaint alleges that Greenbaum and Oshana were, at best, representing both their companies and Jacob, and, at worst, representing their companies to Jacob's detriment.  In Pepicelli, the attorney's interest in another business was not at issue;  the plaintiff rather alleged negligence on the part of his law firm in its handling of the plaintiff's insurance claim.  821 F.2d at 220-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the law of Massachusetts is contrary to defendants' position.

Exclusion G extends to include all claims in connection with the conduct of an Insured's business entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Exclusion G precludes coverage for any claim which arises out of or in connection with a business venture controlled, operated or managed by any Insured or in which the Insured has an interest as an owner or a partner.  This includes all claims sounding in malpractice if the allegations charge wrongdoing in connection with a business in which the Insured has such an interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must determine, then, whether an insured attorney played a role as an officer, shareholder, director, trustee or partner in every Business Entity about which Jacob complains.  The district court found the undisputed facts to be that either Greenbaum or Oshana did play such a role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenbaum and Oshana were partners in South Copley, shareholders and officers of South Copley Development Corporation, and shareholders and officers of South Copley Management Corporation.  Oshana was a shareholder and officer of Northeast Realty Investment Group, while Greenbaum was a director.  Oshana was a beneficiary of Horace Street Trust;  a trustee and beneficiary of Trenton Street Trust;  a trustee and beneficiary of the Westbridge Trust;  a trustee and beneficiary of Queensbury Realty Trust;  a partner in Northeast Glen Limited;  and a partner in Westwood Limited.  Greenbaum served as a trustee and beneficiary of Horace Street Trust;  and as a partner in Northeast Glen Limited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties do not dispute that Greenbaum qualifies as an \"Insured\" under the policy at all relevant times.  There is a dispute, however, as to Oshana's status after May 8, 1988.  Greenbaum attests that Oshana was terminated from the Law Firm on that date.  Oshana disputes this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Oshana was not an Insured after May of 1988, he has, of course, no coverage at all under the policy for his acts after that date.  The Law Firm argues, however, that its coverage would be revived for malpractice claims arising after May 1988 and in connection with business entities to which Oshana is their only link.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dispute on a fact necessary to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment precludes its entry.  We hold, however, that the district court correctly reasoned that under the undisputed facts of this case, Oshana's status after May of 1988 is irrelevant to the issue of coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are that either Greenbaum or Oshana played a role or had an interest in each and every business venture about which Jacob complains.  In each case these interests began prior to May 1988 and continued uninterrupted until Jacob uncovered the scheme.  Jacob's claims all arise in connection with these business schemes, all of which began prior to Oshana's leaving the firm, whenever that was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue, in fact, is not whether Greenbaum or Oshana had an interest in each Business Entity for the entire period alleged in the complaint.  The relevant inquiry is whether the claim arises out of the conduct of a Business Entity to which Greenbaum or Oshana had the requisite relationship at the time the conduct began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, although an alleged misappropriation from the 11 Horace Street Trust may have occurred after May 1988, the scheme began as early as May 1985, and continued uninterrupted until Jacob discovered it in 1990.  Greenbaum was a director and Oshana a beneficiary of the trust at its inception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Similarly, the defendants attempt to separate the forged notes executed to obtain Collateral Pool funds, arguing that claims related to these notes are covered because Oshana was no longer an Insured at the time.  It was in 1986, however, that the alleged misappropriation and forgery first began.  The fact that Oshana's alleged misconduct continued uninterrupted until Jacob discovered it does not negate the applicability of the Exclusion.  The claim still arises out of the conduct of a business enterprise in which an Insured was a partner at the time the conduct began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob's complaint alleges an integrated ongoing scheme of deception and misappropriation that began while Oshana was still an Insured.  If, out of hundred of individual transactions, some might not fall under Exclusion G if they occurred independently, that fact is irrelevant.  An additional act of wrongdoing at the tail end of the scheme does not create coverage for conduct which began at a time when the Insureds had the requisite relationship with the Business Entities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jacob's claims only allege wrongdoing by Insureds in connection with businesses in which they had an interest.  Exclusion G of the Mt. Airy policy excludes coverage for such claims.  Mt. Airy, therefore, has no duty to defend appellants.  The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We find no merit in defendants' suggestion, raised for the first time in their Reply Brief, that we have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the district court made no findings justifying its exercise of its discretionary declaratory judgment authority.  An insurance company's claim that it has no duty to defend in another action is the archetypal case for which a declaratory judgment is appropriate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Other defendants are named in the malpractice action, but are not parties to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Jacob's ten-count complaint asserts claims of legal malpractice, law partnership liability by estoppel, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, monies had and received, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and equitable relief in the form of an accounting, imposition of a receivership, a permanent injunction, and reach and apply</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Indemnification, of course, is another issue.
