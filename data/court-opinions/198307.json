Morton A. Brody, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\nGibson, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\nand Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nDawn M. Pelletier with whom Pelletier &amp; Faircloth was on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\nMargaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and James L.\r\nMcCarthy, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJanuary 29, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  On May 21, 1996, Michael Merric\r\nwalked into the Margaret Chase Smith Federal Building in Bangor,\r\nMaine, with a homemade, double-barreled shotgun tucked into a\r\nbedroll.  He told the security officer that he was going to the\r\noffice handling social security matters in order to change his\r\naddress.  Later information reveals that Merric was at the time\r\nhomeless and mentally disturbed.\r\nThe shotgun was discovered after Merric placed the\r\nbedroll on the conveyor belt of the x-ray machine at the building's\r\nentrance.  The search revealed Merric was carrying several rounds\r\nof ammunition for the shotgun.  He was arrested and later charged\r\nwith possession of a firearm not registered to him in the National\r\nFirearms Registration and Transfer Record in violation of 26 U.S.C.\r\n5861(d), 5871.\r\nIn November 1996, after psychiatric evaluations and an\r\nincompetency hearing before a magistrate judge, the district court\r\naffirmed and adopted a recommendation that Merric was found\r\nincompetent to stand trial.  Thereafter, Merric was confined to a\r\nfederal prison hospital facility in Buttner, North Carolina, until\r\nNovember 1997, when he was found competent and released from the\r\nhospital.  The diagnosis was that Merric suffered from\r\nschizophrenia.\r\nIn December 1997, Merric was indicted on the firearms\r\noffense already described.  Shortly before his scheduled trial in\r\nFebruary 1998, Merric pled guilty.  In April 1998, the district\r\njudge sentenced Merric to time already served in federal custody,\r\na $4,000 fine, and a three-year term of supervised release\r\nconditioned, inter alia, on his repayment of $3,000 in counsel fees\r\npaid to Merric's assigned counsel by the government under the\r\nCriminal Justice Act.  Merric now appeals from the final judgment,\r\nchallenging the fine and the requirement that he repay counsel fees\r\nas a condition of supervised release.\r\nMerric's first argument against the fine is that the\r\ndistrict judge made inconsistent findings regarding Merric's\r\nability to pay.  This argument turns on the fact that the\r\n\"judgment\"--an eight-page form document--contains a page captioned\r\n\"Statement of Reasons\" which, in addition to other information\r\n(e.g., offense level, criminal history category) has a next-to-last\r\nsentence reading:  \"Fine waived or below the guideline range\r\nbecause of inability to pay.\"\r\nIt is evident from the record as a whole that the\r\ndistrict judge deliberately considered whether Merric should be\r\nfined and concluded that he did have the ability to pay a $4,000\r\nfine.  At the sentencing hearing, the district judge heard\r\ntestimony, which Merric did not contest,  that Merric was to\r\nreceive about $20,000 in accrued social security disability\r\nbenefits, heard Merric's objection to the imposition of any fine,\r\nrejected the government's recommendation of a fine of $15,000,\r\nstated that the court did not \"see why a reasonable fine at the low\r\nend of the scale would not be appropriate,\" and then, \"with all\r\nthis in mind,\" imposed a $4,000 fine.  The page in the judgment\r\n\"Criminal Monetary Penalties\" specifies that a fine is imposed in\r\nthe amount of $4,000.  The separate memorandum entered on the same\r\nday by the district judge explicitly states that \"[t]he defendant\r\nis able to pay a minimal fine but is not able\" to pay more even in\r\ninstallments.  In short, the \"inability to pay\" finding is patently\r\na clerical error--as defense counsel came close to admitting at\r\noral argument--and the case bears no relation to United States v.\r\nMomen, 104 F.3d 905, 911-13 (7th Cir. 1997), where there were\r\ngenuine ambiguities.\r\nMerric's second challenge to the fine is that the\r\ndistrict court erred in not expressly considering or making\r\nfindings on the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C.  3572(a).  The\r\nstatute provides that in addition to more general factors bearing\r\non punishment (see id.  3553(a)), the court in considering a fine\r\nshould take account of such factors as the defendant's income,\r\nearning capacity, financial resources, and the burden of the fine\r\nimposed on the defendant and on anyone who is dependent on the\r\ndefendant or who would be responsible for the welfare of a person\r\nfinancially dependent on the defendant.\r\nThis court has ruled that \"a district court need not make\r\nexpress findings regarding a defendant's financial condition so\r\nlong as the record is sufficient for adequate appellate review.\" \r\nUnited States v. Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1996).  See alsoUnited States v. Wilfred Am. Educ. Corp., 953 F.2d 717, 720 (1st\r\nCir. 1992).  Where the pertinent information is presented in the\r\ndistrict court, this court will assume that the district court\r\nconsidered it.  Id. at 719.  Here, the district court learned that\r\nMerric planned to remain in Ellsworth, Maine, and to live on his\r\nsocial security disability benefits of $835 per month after his\r\nrelease.  His parents were willing to pay for him to stay at a\r\nhotel in Bangor for the time being.  Merric, as already said, was\r\nalso entitled to $20,000 in back benefits.\r\nOn this appeal, Merric points out that combining the\r\n$4,000 fine with $3,000 in counsel fees represents a considerable\r\nportion of his $20,000 net worth (he has no other assets or\r\nliabilities) and makes it more difficult to start a new life and\r\nget himself out of poverty.  On the other hand, there is a\r\npresumption that the defendant will pay a fine.  See U.S.S.G. \r\n5E1.2(a); United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 572 (1st Cir.\r\n1993), and the burden is on the defendant to show that his case\r\nwarrants an exception.  Peppe, 80 F.3d at 22.  On the facts before\r\nthe district judge, there was nothing improper about the decision\r\nto impose a $4,000 fine.\r\nMerric's final objection to the fine is that the district\r\ncourt erred in \"delegating\" to the probation officer the schedule\r\nfor paying the fine.  Merric points out that the memorandum\r\naccompanying the judgment includes a paragraph providing that\r\nMerric is to pay a fine of $4,000 to the Clerk's Office in Bangor\r\nand continues:  \"Any amount that the defendant is unable to pay now\r\nshall be paid in monthly installments, to be determined in amount\r\nby the supervising officer, during the period of his supervised\r\nrelease.\"  There is little doubt that this language was meant to\r\ngovern, even though the judgment contains a boilerplate statement\r\nthat the fine was due \"[i]n full immediately.\"\r\nThe government first says that we should review Merric's\r\nclaim only for plain error because no objection was raised at\r\nsentencing to the allegedly improper delegation.  The difficulty is\r\nthat there is no indication that Merric was told at the sentencing\r\nhearing that a payment schedule for the fine would be delegated to\r\nthe probation officer; it appears that Merric learned of this only\r\nafter the formal judgment had been entered.  Thus, the government\r\nis effectively arguing that to preserve his claim, Merric had to\r\nreturn to the district judge with a post-judgment motion.  Cf. Fed.\r\nR. Crim. P. 35(c).\r\nMost \"errors\" occur in a context in which counsel is on\r\nnotice that the court is taking or has just taken an objectionable\r\naction.  In such a case the failure to object does normally remit\r\nthe defaulting party whatever protection the plain error doctrine\r\naffords.  E.g., Fed. R. Evid 103(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.  But where\r\nthe error occurs in the judgment itself, there is no settled\r\ngeneral rule that counsel has to return to the district court and\r\nseek correction there.  Efficient though this result might be, this\r\nis no occasion for us to create such an exhaustion requirement,\r\nwhich could well entail problems of its own.\r\nAlthough this court has not previously ruled on the\r\ndelegation issue, we agree with Merric that the district judge\r\ncould not empower the probation officer to make a final decision as\r\nto the installment schedule for payments.  The text of 18 U.S.C. \r\n3572(d)(2) may not be conclusive in saying that \"[t]he length of\r\ntime over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the\r\n[sentencing] court\" (conceivably, \"set\" could include delegation);\r\nbut we join the other circuit courts that have held that it is the\r\ninherent responsibility of the judge to determine matters of\r\npunishment and this includes final authority over all payment\r\nmatters.  The government does not explicitly disagree.\r\nThe government points out that in United States v. Lilly,\r\n80 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996), we read a judgment requiring\r\nrestitution \"as directed\" by the probation officer to reserve final\r\nauthority to the district court.  But Lilly is not on all fours,\r\nbecause we there relied on a later explanation by the district\r\njudge that he had not given the probation officer the authority to\r\nset a binding payment schedule.  Id.  Because we think that the\r\njudge rather than the probation officer must have the final\r\nauthority to determine the payment schedule, we will vacate the\r\nsentence and remand so that the district judge can insert into the\r\njudgment a phrase or sentence making this reservation of authority\r\nexplicit.\r\nWe now turn our attention to the other element of the\r\nsentence challenged by Merric on this appeal, namely, the district\r\ncourt's requirement that Merric repay the government the counsel\r\nfees it paid for his representation, an amount that later proved to\r\nbe about $3,000.  It clear enough that the district court can\r\nrequire such repayment, since 18 U.S.C.  3006A(f) so provides. \r\nHowever, Merric objects to making this repayment a condition of\r\nsupervised release.\r\nThe transcript shows that Merric was explicitly advised \r\nat the sentencing hearing that the judgment would contain such a\r\nprovision and neither he nor his counsel made any objection to it. \r\nAccordingly, the imposition of this condition is reviewed for plain\r\nerror only.  This requires Merric to establish \"an obvious and\r\nclear error under law\" that \"seriously affect[s] the fairness,\r\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  United\r\nStates v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting United\r\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993)).\r\nAs it happens, we think that the district court's\r\ndecision to make repayment a condition of supervised release was\r\nnot error at all.  Admittedly, there has been a certain amount of\r\ndisagreement among the circuits--not as to whether CJA counsel fees\r\ncan be recovered from a defendant (the statute specifically permits\r\nit)--but as to whether such repayment can be made a condition\r\neither of probation or of supervised release.  Merric has, or\r\nshortly will have, the funds to repay the government, and the issue\r\nhere is merely whether the district judge had authority to make\r\nthis a condition of supervised release.\r\nThe statute governing conditions of supervised release,\r\n18 U.S.C.  3583(d), requires the court to order certain\r\nconditions--not relevant here--for any supervised release and then\r\nprovides that the court \"may\" order \"any other condition it\r\nconsiders to be appropriate\" so long as the condition is (1)\r\nreasonably related to certain specified statutory factors, (2)\r\ninvolves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably\r\nnecessary to satisfy certain specified statutory purposes, and (3)\r\nit is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the\r\nSentencing Commission.  The statutory factors and purposes\r\nspecified--taken by cross-reference from a longer list set forth in\r\n18 U.S.C.  3553(a) as factors generally to be considered in\r\nimposing a sentence--are (so far as arguably pertinent here) the\r\nfollowing:\r\n--   \"the need . . . to afford\r\n     adequate deterrence to criminal\r\n     conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. \r\n     3553(2)(B), and\r\n\n--   \"the need . . . to protect the\r\n     public from further crimes of\r\n     the defendant,\" id. 3553(2)(C).\r\n\nIn our view, imposing the cost of CJA counsel on the\r\ndefendant, where the defendant proves able to pay, is a deterrent\r\nto crime just like any other financial imposition.  That monetary\r\npayments deter crime is the notion that underlines the elaborate\r\ncode of fines reflected in the Federal Criminal Code and the\r\nSentencing Guidelines.  This point has been explained so thoroughly\r\nby Judge Easterbrook, sustaining a requirement that defendant pay\r\nthe cost of a 90-day work release program to which he had been\r\nsentenced, that further discussion of this point is unnecessary. \r\nUnited States v. Turner, 998 F.2d 534, 536-38 (7th Cir.), cert.\r\ndenied, 510 U.S. 1026 (1993).\r\nThe condition that Merric repay counsel fees out of\r\navailable funds is thus \"reasonably related\" to deterrence, one of\r\nthe factors specified by Congress, and therefore also satisfies a\r\nfurther factor (\"the need to protect the public from further crimes\r\nof the defendant\").  Congress' second requirement in 18 U.S.C. \r\n3583(d)--that the condition \"involve[ ] no greater deprivation of\r\nliberty than is reasonably necessary\" for deterrence or other\r\nspecified factors, 18 U.S.C.  3583(d)--is satisfied not only\r\nbecause (among other reasons) Merric can afford to pay but also\r\nbecause he will not be deprived of liberty at all.  The final\r\nrequirement under the statute is that the condition be \"consistent\r\nwith any pertinent policy statements\" issued by the Sentencing\r\nCommission.  Id.\r\nThe guideline addressed to \"conditions of supervised\r\nrelease\" (U.S.S.G.  5D1.3) is replete with repayment conditions: \r\nthese include, as mandatory conditions, adherence to an installment\r\nschedule to pay any yet unpaid fine and payment under various\r\nsections for victim restitution.  Id.  5D1.3(a)(5),(6).  Among\r\nrecommended standard conditions, the Commission suggests that the\r\ndefendant be required to provide support to the defendant's\r\ndependents and meet other family responsibilities, and also that\r\nthe defendant pay the statutory special assessment or adhere to a\r\ncourt-ordered installment schedule for paying it.  Id. \r\n5D1.3(c)(4), (14).\r\nGiven the number of repayment conditions that the\r\nCommission either required or encouraged, the requirement to repay\r\nCJA counsel fees is facially consistent with the Commission's\r\npolicy guidelines.  Of course, one could argue that the guideline's\r\nfailure to require or recommend repayment of counsel fees as a\r\nstandard condition suggests that the Commission was opposed to such\r\na requirement, but it is at least as likely that the Commission did\r\nnot focus upon the issue.  In any event, the same guideline\r\nprovision provides that the court \"may impose other conditions of\r\nsupervised release\" so long as they meet the three requirements set\r\nforth by Congress and already described.\r\nThis court has held that the requirement that counsel\r\nfees be repaid to the government is a proper condition of\r\nprobation.  United States v. Santarpio, 560 F.2d 448 (1st Cir.),\r\ncert denied, 434 U.S. 984 (1977).  Although the case contains\r\nlanguage consistent with our present view, Santarpio is a pre-\r\nguideline case and we have preferred therefore to make our own\r\nanalysis of the statute and guidelines.  However, it is worth\r\nadding that we are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit's decision in\r\nUnited States v. Eyler, 67 F.3d 1386 (9th Cir. 1995), which holds\r\nthat repayment of counsel fees cannot be made a condition of\r\nsupervised release and saying without explanation that such a\r\ncondition does not serve the purposes of deterrence.\r\nTo say that repayment of counsel fees is a permissible\r\ncondition of probation or supervised release is a different\r\nquestion from whether such a condition is wise, an issue that is\r\nprimarily one for the district court.  Here, no such objection was\r\nmade in the district court.  In any case, the record there showed\r\nthat Merric was about to receive a large sum in back payments for\r\nsocial security disability--some of it seemingly for a period in\r\nwhich the government was maintaining him in a prison hospital at\r\nButtner--and the district court was told nothing that would\r\nreasonably have given it pause in requiring that a small portion of\r\nthe $20,000 back payment should reimburse the Treasury for what it\r\nhad just spent on Merric's behalf to provide him with counsel.\r\nObviously, a court could not properly make it a condition\r\nof probation or supervised release that a penniless defendant make\r\nimmediate payments, nor can we imagine sending defendant back to\r\njail where he had done his best to comply with an installment\r\nschedule.  See Santarpio, 560 F.2d at 455.  Further, there may be\r\ncircumstances in which requiring repayment of counsel fees even on\r\nan installment basis would interfere with the defendant's other\r\nobligations (such as paying fines or support payments).  Here, the\r\namount in question was modest and well covered by the prospective\r\nback payments for social security.\r\nMerric draws our attention to a Judicial Conference\r\nrecommendation which urges as a matter of policy that repaying the\r\ncost of counsel \"should not be made a condition of probation.\" \r\nThe reason for the recommendation is unclear: possibly the Judicial\r\nConference had primarily in mind the risk that a defendant,\r\notherwise eligible for probation, might be denied this opportunity\r\nfor lack of funds.  It is also possible that the Judicial\r\nConference was concerned with discouraging a defendant from\r\naccepting appointed counsel, although this seems unlikely since\r\nacquittal is usually a defendant's main objective.\r\nIn all events, while the views of the Judicial Conference\r\nare entitled to respectful attention on any matter--and on a few\r\nmatters have binding legal force--the lawfulness of particular\r\nconditions of probation and supervised release are governed solely\r\nby statute and by the guidelines of the Sentencing Commission. \r\nFurther, we are here dealing with supervised release and, in the\r\nabsence of explicit rationale for the Judicial Conference\r\nrecommendation, we have no idea whether its reasons also apply to\r\nsupervised release or to a case in which the defendant has\r\nvirtually in hand the money necessary to repay counsel fees. \r\nAccordingly, the recommendation does not control in this case.\r\nThere is one final matter to address.  At oral argument\r\nMerric's able counsel informed the court that it now appears that\r\nvery expensive drugs are important in controlling Merric's\r\nschizophrenia and that he may not be able to afford these drugs,\r\nwhich could increase his ability to function lawfully in society. \r\nCandidly admitting that this issue had never been presented to the\r\ndistrict court, defense counsel urged that this unusual need ought\r\nto be taken into account in assessing Merric's ability to pay the\r\n$4,000 fine (and so far as appears, this same argument can be made\r\nas to counsel fees).\r\nThe government responded at oral argument that avenues\r\nexist for Merric to raise this medical-need issue in the district\r\ncourt even after the judgment becomes final, but our own\r\npreliminary review suggests to us that the district court might\r\nhave little flexibility to remit or reduce the fine if we simply\r\naffirmed.  Seemingly, 18 U.S.C.  3573 does no more than permit the\r\ngovernment to move to remit unpaid portions of a fine or a special\r\nassessment where \"reasonable efforts to collect . . . are not\r\nlikely to be effective.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b) also permits the\r\ngovernment to move for a reduction in sentence but only where the\r\ndefendant provides substantial assistance.\r\nNeedless to say, Merric's need for medicine, assuming the\r\nallegations are true, does not in any way invalidate any of the\r\npayment obligations imposed by the district court, the issue having\r\nnever been raised and there being no plain error on this record. \r\nHowever, we have already concluded that the judgment should be\r\nremanded to correct the judgment on the delegation issue, and we\r\nhave broad authority to shape a remand in the interests of justice. \r\nSee 28 U.S.C.  2106.  Exercising this authority, we expressly give\r\nthe district court leave to consider any argument based on Merric's\r\nalleged need for medicine.\r\nMerric has not argued either in the district court or on\r\nthis appeal that consideration of Merric's back payments for social\r\nsecurity disability--merely to determine his ability to pay a fine\r\nor repay counsel fees--is at odds with the anti-assignment\r\nprovision of the social security statute.  42 U.S.C.  407.  The\r\npoint is an obscure one, raised more by case law than statutory\r\nlanguage; and we take no position on it since there is certainly no\r\nplain error.  However, again in the interests of justice, the\r\ndistrict court is free to consider the matter if it chooses.\r\nThe sentence but not the conviction is vacated, and the\r\nmatter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion.\r\nIt is so ordered.\n",

Monem, 104 F.3d 905, 911-13 (7th Cir.1997), where there were genuine ambiguities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric's second challenge to the fine is that the district court erred in not expressly considering or making findings on the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(a).  The statute provides that in addition to more general factors bearing on punishment (see id. &#167; 3553(a)), the court in considering a fine should take account of such factors as the defendant's income, earning capacity, financial resources, and the burden of the fine imposed on the defendant and on anyone who is dependent on the defendant or who would be responsible for the welfare of a person financially dependent on the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has ruled that \"a district court need not make express findings regarding a defendant's financial condition so long as the record is sufficient for adequate appellate review.\"  United States v. Peppe, 80 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1996).  See also United States v. Wilfred Am.  Educ. Corp., 953 F.2d 717, 720 (1st Cir.1992).  Where the pertinent information is presented in the district court, this court will assume that the district court considered it.  Id. at 719.   Here, the district court learned that Merric planned to remain in Ellsworth, Maine, and to live on his social security disability benefits of $835 per month after his release.  His parents were willing to pay for him to stay at a hotel in Bangor for the time being.  Merric, as already said, was also entitled to $20,000 in back benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Merric points out that combining the $4,000 fine with $3,000 in counsel fees represents a considerable portion of his $20,000 net worth (he has no other assets or liabilities) and makes it more difficult to start a new life and get himself out of poverty.  On the other hand, there is a presumption that the defendant will pay a fine, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(a);  United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 572 (1st Cir.1993), and the burden is on the defendant to show that his case warrants an exception.  Peppe, 80 F.3d at 22.   On the facts before the district judge, there was nothing improper about the decision to impose a $4,000 fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric's final objection to the fine is that the district court erred in \"delegating\" to the probation officer the schedule for paying the fine.  Merric points out that the memorandum accompanying the judgment includes a paragraph providing that Merric is to pay a fine of $4,000 to the Clerk's Office in Bangor and continues:  \"Any amount that the defendant is unable to pay now shall be paid in monthly installments, to be determined in amount by the supervising officer, during the period of his supervised release.\"   There is little doubt that this language was meant to govern, even though the judgment contains a boilerplate statement that the fine was due \"[i]n full immediately.\"The government first says that we should review Merric's claim only for plain error because no objection was raised at sentencing to the allegedly improper delegation.  The difficulty is that there is no indication that Merric was told at the sentencing hearing that a payment schedule for the fine would be delegated to the probation officer;  it appears that Merric learned of this only after the formal judgment had been entered.  Thus, the government is effectively arguing that to preserve his claim, Merric had to return to the district judge with a post-judgment motion.  Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most \"errors\" occur in a context in which counsel is on notice that the court is taking or has just taken an objectionable action.  In such a case the failure to object does normally remit the defaulting party whatever protection the plain error doctrine affords.  E.g., Fed.  R. Evid 103(a);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.  But where the error occurs in the judgment itself, there is no settled general rule that counsel has to return to the district court and seek correction there.  Efficient though this result might be, this is no occasion for us to create such an exhaustion requirement, which could well entail problems of its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this court has not previously ruled on the delegation issue, we agree with Merric that the district judge could not empower the probation officer to make a final decision as to the installment schedule for payments.  The text of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(d)(2) may not be conclusive in saying that \"[t]he length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the [sentencing] court\" (conceivably, \"set\" could include delegation);  but we join the other circuit courts that have held that it is the inherent responsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and this includes final authority over all payment matters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The government does not explicitly disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points out that in United States v. Lilly, 80 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996), we read a judgment requiring restitution \"as directed\" by the probation officer to reserve final authority to the district court.  But Lilly is not on all fours, because we there relied on a later explanation by the district judge that he had not given the probation officer the authority to set a binding payment schedule.  Id. Because we think that the judge rather than the probation officer must have the final authority to determine the payment schedule, we will vacate the sentence and remand so that the district judge can insert into the judgment a phrase or sentence making this reservation of authority explicit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn our attention to the other element of the sentence challenged by Merric on this appeal, namely, the district court's requirement that Merric repay the government the counsel fees it paid for his representation, an amount that later proved to be about $3,000.  It clear enough that the district court can require such repayment, since 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(f) so provides.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, Merric objects to making this repayment a condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The transcript shows that Merric was explicitly advised at the sentencing hearing that the judgment would contain such a provision and that neither he nor his counsel made any objection to it.  Accordingly, the imposition of this condition is reviewed for plain error only.  This requires Merric to establish \"an obvious and clear error under law\" that \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  United States v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, we think that the district court's decision to make repayment a condition of supervised release was not error at all.  Admittedly, there has been a certain amount of disagreement among the circuits--not as to whether CJA counsel fees can be recovered from a defendant (the statute specifically permits it)--but as to whether such repayment can be made a condition either of probation or of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Merric has, or shortly will have, the funds to repay the government, and the issue here is merely whether the district judge had authority to make this a condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute governing conditions of supervised release, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), requires the court to order certain conditions--not relevant here--for any supervised release and then provides that the court \"may\" order \"any other condition it considers to be appropriate\" so long as the condition is (1) reasonably related to certain specified statutory factors, (2) involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to satisfy certain specified statutory purposes, and (3) it is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.  The statutory factors and purposes specified--taken by cross-reference from a longer list set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) as factors generally to be considered in imposing a sentence--are (so far as arguably pertinent here) the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- \"the need ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(2)(B), and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- \"the need ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" id.  &#167; 3553(2)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, imposing the cost of CJA counsel on the defendant, where the defendant proves able to pay, is a deterrent to crime just like any other financial imposition.  That monetary payments deter crime is the notion that underlines the elaborate code of fines reflected in the Federal Criminal Code and the Sentencing Guidelines.  This point has been explained so thoroughly by Judge Easterbrook, sustaining a requirement that defendant pay the cost of a 90-day work release program to which he had been sentenced, that further discussion of this point is unnecessary.  United States v. Turner, 998 F.2d 534, 536-38 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1026, 114 S.Ct. 639, 126 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The condition that Merric repay counsel fees out of available funds is thus \"reasonably related\" to deterrence, one of the factors specified by Congress, and therefore also satisfies a further factor (\"the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\").  Congress' second requirement in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)--that the condition \"involve[ ] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" for deterrence or other specified factors, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)--is satisfied not only because (among other reasons) Merric can afford to pay but also because he will not be deprived of liberty at all.  The final requirement under the statute is that the condition be \"consistent with any pertinent policy statements\" issued by the Sentencing Commission.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guideline addressed to \"conditions of supervised release\" (U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3) is replete with repayment conditions:  these include, as mandatory conditions, adherence to an installment schedule to pay any yet unpaid fine and payment under various sections for victim restitution.  Id. &#167;&#167; 5D1.3(a)(5),(6).  Among recommended standard conditions, the Commission suggests that the defendant be required to provide support to the defendant's dependents and to meet other family responsibilities, and also that the defendant pay the statutory special assessment or adhere to a court-ordered installment schedule for paying it.  Id. &#167;&#167; 5D1.3(c)(4), (14).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the number of repayment conditions that the Commission either required or encouraged, the requirement to repay CJA counsel fees is facially consistent with the Commission's policy guidelines.  Of course, one could argue that the guideline's failure to require or recommend repayment of counsel fees as a standard condition suggests that the Commission was opposed to such a requirement, but it is at least as likely that the Commission did not focus upon the issue.  In any event, the same guideline provision provides that the court \"may impose other conditions of supervised release\" so long as they meet the three requirements set forth by Congress and already described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that the requirement that counsel fees be repaid to the government is a proper condition of probation.  United States v. Santarpio, 560 F.2d 448 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 984, 98 S.Ct. 609, 54 L.Ed.2d 478 (1977).  Although the case contains language consistent with our present view, Santarpio is a pre-guideline case and we have preferred therefore to make our own analysis of the statute and guidelines.  However, it is worth adding that we are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Eyler, 67 F.3d 1386 (9th Cir.1995), which holds that repayment of counsel fees cannot be made a condition of supervised release and says without explanation that such a condition does not serve the purposes of deterrence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say that repayment of counsel fees is a permissible condition of probation or supervised release is a different question from whether such a condition is wise, an issue that is primarily one for the district court.  Here, no such objection was made in the district court.  In any case, the record there showed that Merric was about to receive a large sum in back payments for social security disability--some of it seemingly for a period in which the government was maintaining him in a prison hospital at Buttner--and the district court was told nothing that would reasonably have given it pause in requiring that a small portion of the $20,000 back payment should reimburse the Treasury for what it had just spent on Merric's behalf to provide him with counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, a court could not properly make it a condition of probation or supervised release that a penniless defendant make immediate payments, nor can we imagine sending defendant back to jail where he had done his best to comply with an installment schedule.  See Santarpio, 560 F.2d at 455.   Further, there may be circumstances in which requiring repayment of counsel fees even on an installment basis would interfere with the defendant's other obligations (such as paying fines or support payments).  Here, the amount in question was modest and well covered by the prospective back payments for social security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric draws our attention to a Judicial Conference recommendation which urges as a matter of policy that repaying the cost of counsel \"should not be made a condition of probation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The reason for the recommendation is unclear:  possibly the Judicial Conference had primarily in mind the risk that a defendant, otherwise eligible for probation, might be denied this opportunity for lack of funds.  It is also possible that the Judicial Conference was concerned with discouraging a defendant from accepting appointed counsel, although this seems unlikely since acquittal is usually a defendant's main objective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, while the views of the Judicial Conference are entitled to respectful attention on any matter--and on a few matters have binding legal force--the lawfulness of particular conditions of probation and supervised release are governed solely by statute and by the guidelines of the Sentencing Commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Further, we are here dealing with supervised release and, in the absence of explicit rationale for the Judicial Conference recommendation, we have no idea whether its reasons also apply to supervised release or to a case in which the defendant has virtually in hand the money necessary to repay counsel fees.  Accordingly, the recommendation does not control in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one final matter to address.  At oral argument Merric's able counsel informed the court that it now appears that very expensive drugs are important in controlling Merric's schizophrenia and that he may not be able to afford these drugs, which could increase his ability to function lawfully in society.  Candidly admitting that this issue had never been presented to the district court, defense counsel urged that this unusual need ought to be taken into account in assessing Merric's ability to pay the $4,000 fine (and so far as appears, this same argument can be made as to counsel fees).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded at oral argument that avenues exist for Merric to raise this medical-need issue in the district court even after the judgment becomes final, but our own preliminary review suggests to us that the district court might have little flexibility to remit or reduce the fine if we simply affirmed.  Seemingly, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3573 does no more than permit the government to move to remit unpaid portions of a fine or a special assessment where \"reasonable efforts to collect ... are not likely to be effective.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) also permits the government to move for a reduction in sentence but only where the defendant provides substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, Merric's need for medicine, assuming the allegations are true, does not in any way invalidate any of the payment obligations imposed by the district court, the issue having never been raised and there being no plain error on this record.  However, we have already concluded that the judgment should be remanded to correct the judgment on the delegation issue, and we have broad authority to shape a remand in the interests of justice.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106.  Exercising this authority, we expressly give the district court leave to consider any argument based on Merric's alleged need for medicine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric has not argued either in the district court or on this appeal that consideration of Merric's back payments for social security disability--merely to determine his ability to pay a fine or repay counsel fees--is at odds with the anti-assignment provision of the social security statute.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 407.  The point is an obscure one, raised more by case law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> than statutory language;  and we take no position on it since there is certainly no plain error.  However, again in the interests of justice, the district court is free to consider the matter if it chooses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence but not the conviction is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

He was arrested and later charged with possession of a firearm not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5861(d), 5871.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1996, after psychiatric evaluations and an incompetency hearing before a magistrate judge, the district court affirmed and adopted a recommendation that Merric be found incompetent to stand trial.  Thereafter, Merric was confined to a federal prison hospital facility in Buttner, North Carolina, until November 1997, when he was found competent and released from the hospital.  The diagnosis was that Merric suffered from schizophrenia.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1997, Merric was indicted on the firearms offense already described.  Shortly before his scheduled trial in February 1998, Merric pled guilty.  In April 1998, the district judge sentenced Merric to time already served in federal custody, a $4,000 fine, and a three-year term of supervised release conditioned, inter alia, on his repayment of $3,000 in counsel fees paid to Merric's assigned counsel by the government under the Criminal Justice Act.  Merric now appeals from the final judgment, challenging the fine and the requirement that he repay counsel fees as a condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric's first argument against the fine is that the district judge made inconsistent findings regarding Merric's ability to pay.  This argument turns on the fact that the \"judgment\"--an eight-page form document--contains a page captioned \"Statement of Reasons\" which, in addition to other information (e.g., offense level, criminal history category) has a next-to-last sentence reading:  \"Fine waived or below the guideline range because of inability to pay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is evident from the record as a whole that the district judge deliberately considered whether Merric should be fined and concluded that he did have the ability to pay a $4,000 fine.  At the sentencing hearing, the district judge heard testimony, which Merric did not contest, that Merric was to receive about $20,000 in accrued social security disability benefits, heard Merric's objection to the imposition of any fine, rejected the government's recommendation of a fine of $15,000, stated that the court did not \"see why a reasonable fine at the low end of the scale would not be appropriate,\" and then, \"with all this in mind,\" imposed a $4,000 fine.  The page in the judgment \"Criminal Monetary Penalties\" specifies that a fine is imposed in the amount of $4,000.  The separate memorandum entered on the same day by the district judge explicitly states that \"[t]he defendant is able to pay a minimal fine but is not able\" to pay more even in installments.  In short, the \"inability to pay\" finding is patently a clerical error--as defense counsel came close to admitting at oral argument--and the case bears no relation to United States v. Monem, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733295\"><a href=\"/opinion/733295/united-states-v-hanafi-monem/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span>, 911-13 (7th Cir.1997), where there were genuine ambiguities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric's second challenge to the fine is that the district court erred in not expressly considering or making findings on the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(a).  The statute provides that in addition to more general factors bearing on punishment (see id. &#167; 3553(a)), the court in considering a fine should take account of such factors as the defendant's income, earning capacity, financial resources, and the burden of the fine imposed on the defendant and on anyone who is dependent on the defendant or who would be responsible for the welfare of a person financially dependent on the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has ruled that \"a district court need not make express findings regarding a defendant's financial condition so long as the record is sufficient for adequate appellate review.\"  United States v.

Where the pertinent information is presented in the district court, this court will assume that the district court considered it.  Id. at 719.   Here, the district court learned that Merric planned to remain in Ellsworth, Maine, and to live on his social security disability benefits of $835 per month after his release.  His parents were willing to pay for him to stay at a hotel in Bangor for the time being.  Merric, as already said, was also entitled to $20,000 in back benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, Merric points out that combining the $4,000 fine with $3,000 in counsel fees represents a considerable portion of his $20,000 net worth (he has no other assets or liabilities) and makes it more difficult to start a new life and get himself out of poverty.  On the other hand, there is a presumption that the defendant will pay a fine, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(a);  United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1993), and the burden is on the defendant to show that his case warrants an exception.  Peppe, 80 F.3d at 22.   On the facts before the district judge, there was nothing improper about the decision to impose a $4,000 fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric's final objection to the fine is that the district court erred in \"delegating\" to the probation officer the schedule for paying the fine.  Merric points out that the memorandum accompanying the judgment includes a paragraph providing that Merric is to pay a fine of $4,000 to the Clerk's Office in Bangor and continues:  \"Any amount that the defendant is unable to pay now shall be paid in monthly installments, to be determined in amount by the supervising officer, during the period of his supervised release.\"   There is little doubt that this language was meant to govern, even though the judgment contains a boilerplate statement that the fine was due \"[i]n full immediately.\"The government first says that we should review Merric's claim only for plain error because no objection was raised at sentencing to the allegedly improper delegation.  The difficulty is that there is no indication that Merric was told at the sentencing hearing that a payment schedule for the fine would be delegated to the probation officer;  it appears that Merric learned of this only after the formal judgment had been entered.  Thus, the government is effectively arguing that to preserve his claim, Merric had to return to the district judge with a post-judgment motion.  Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most \"errors\" occur in a context in which counsel is on notice that the court is taking or has just taken an objectionable action.  In such a case the failure to object does normally remit the defaulting party whatever protection the plain error doctrine affords.  E.g., Fed.  R. Evid 103(a);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.  But where the error occurs in the judgment itself, there is no settled general rule that counsel has to return to the district court and seek correction there.  Efficient though this result might be, this is no occasion for us to create such an exhaustion requirement, which could well entail problems of its own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this court has not previously ruled on the delegation issue, we agree with Merric that the district judge could not empower the probation officer to make a final decision as to the installment schedule for payments.  The text of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(d)(2) may not be conclusive in saying that \"[t]he length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the [sentencing] court\" (conceivably, \"set\" could include delegation);  but we join the other circuit courts that have held that it is the inherent responsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and this includes final authority over all payment matters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The government does not explicitly disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government points out that in United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196681\"><a href=\"/opinion/196681/united-states-v-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1996), we read a judgment requiring restitution \"as directed\" by the probation officer to reserve final authority to the district court.  But Lilly is not on all fours, because we there relied on a later explanation by the district judge that he had not given the probation officer the authority to set a binding payment schedule.  Id. Because we think that the judge rather than the probation officer must have the final authority to determine the payment schedule, we will vacate the sentence and remand so that the district judge can insert into the judgment a phrase or sentence making this reservation of authority explicit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn our attention to the other element of the sentence challenged by Merric on this appeal, namely, the district court's requirement that Merric repay the government the counsel fees it paid for his representation, an amount that later proved to be about $3,000.  It clear enough that the district court can require such repayment, since 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(f) so provides.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  However, Merric objects to making this repayment a condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The transcript shows that Merric was explicitly advised at the sentencing hearing that the judgment would contain such a provision and that neither he nor his counsel made any objection to it.  Accordingly, the imposition of this condition is reviewed for plain error only.  This requires Merric to establish \"an obvious and clear error under law\" that \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  United States v.

Admittedly, there has been a certain amount of disagreement among the circuits--not as to whether CJA counsel fees can be recovered from a defendant (the statute specifically permits it)--but as to whether such repayment can be made a condition either of probation or of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Merric has, or shortly will have, the funds to repay the government, and the issue here is merely whether the district judge had authority to make this a condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute governing conditions of supervised release, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), requires the court to order certain conditions--not relevant here--for any supervised release and then provides that the court \"may\" order \"any other condition it considers to be appropriate\" so long as the condition is (1) reasonably related to certain specified statutory factors, (2) involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to satisfy certain specified statutory purposes, and (3) it is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.  The statutory factors and purposes specified--taken by cross-reference from a longer list set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) as factors generally to be considered in imposing a sentence--are (so far as arguably pertinent here) the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- \"the need ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(2)(B), and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">-- \"the need ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\" id.  &#167; 3553(2)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, imposing the cost of CJA counsel on the defendant, where the defendant proves able to pay, is a deterrent to crime just like any other financial imposition.  That monetary payments deter crime is the notion that underlines the elaborate code of fines reflected in the Federal Criminal Code and the Sentencing Guidelines.  This point has been explained so thoroughly by Judge Easterbrook, sustaining a requirement that defendant pay the cost of a 90-day work release program to which he had been sentenced, that further discussion of this point is unnecessary.

Congress' second requirement in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)--that the condition \"involve[ ] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" for deterrence or other specified factors, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)--is satisfied not only because (among other reasons) Merric can afford to pay but also because he will not be deprived of liberty at all.  The final requirement under the statute is that the condition be \"consistent with any pertinent policy statements\" issued by the Sentencing Commission.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guideline addressed to \"conditions of supervised release\" (U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3) is replete with repayment conditions:  these include, as mandatory conditions, adherence to an installment schedule to pay any yet unpaid fine and payment under various sections for victim restitution.  Id. &#167;&#167; 5D1.3(a)(5),(6).  Among recommended standard conditions, the Commission suggests that the defendant be required to provide support to the defendant's dependents and to meet other family responsibilities, and also that the defendant pay the statutory special assessment or adhere to a court-ordered installment schedule for paying it.  Id. &#167;&#167; 5D1.3(c)(4), (14).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the number of repayment conditions that the Commission either required or encouraged, the requirement to repay CJA counsel fees is facially consistent with the Commission's policy guidelines.  Of course, one could argue that the guideline's failure to require or recommend repayment of counsel fees as a standard condition suggests that the Commission was opposed to such a requirement, but it is at least as likely that the Commission did not focus upon the issue.  In any event, the same guideline provision provides that the court \"may impose other conditions of supervised release\" so long as they meet the three requirements set forth by Congress and already described.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that the requirement that counsel fees be repaid to the government is a proper condition of probation.

Although the case contains language consistent with our present view, Santarpio is a pre-guideline case and we have preferred therefore to make our own analysis of the statute and guidelines.  However, it is worth adding that we are not persuaded by the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Eyler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706017\"><a href=\"/opinion/706017/95-cal-daily-op-serv-7816-95-daily-journal-dar-13416-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1386</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1995), which holds that repayment of counsel fees cannot be made a condition of supervised release and says without explanation that such a condition does not serve the purposes of deterrence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say that repayment of counsel fees is a permissible condition of probation or supervised release is a different question from whether such a condition is wise, an issue that is primarily one for the district court.  Here, no such objection was made in the district court.  In any case, the record there showed that Merric was about to receive a large sum in back payments for social security disability--some of it seemingly for a period in which the government was maintaining him in a prison hospital at Buttner--and the district court was told nothing that would reasonably have given it pause in requiring that a small portion of the $20,000 back payment should reimburse the Treasury for what it had just spent on Merric's behalf to provide him with counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, a court could not properly make it a condition of probation or supervised release that a penniless defendant make immediate payments, nor can we imagine sending defendant back to jail where he had done his best to comply with an installment schedule.  See Santarpio, 560 F.2d at 455.   Further, there may be circumstances in which requiring repayment of counsel fees even on an installment basis would interfere with the defendant's other obligations (such as paying fines or support payments).  Here, the amount in question was modest and well covered by the prospective back payments for social security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric draws our attention to a Judicial Conference recommendation which urges as a matter of policy that repaying the cost of counsel \"should not be made a condition of probation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The reason for the recommendation is unclear:  possibly the Judicial Conference had primarily in mind the risk that a defendant, otherwise eligible for probation, might be denied this opportunity for lack of funds.  It is also possible that the Judicial Conference was concerned with discouraging a defendant from accepting appointed counsel, although this seems unlikely since acquittal is usually a defendant's main objective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, while the views of the Judicial Conference are entitled to respectful attention on any matter--and on a few matters have binding legal force--the lawfulness of particular conditions of probation and supervised release are governed solely by statute and by the guidelines of the Sentencing Commission.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Further, we are here dealing with supervised release and, in the absence of explicit rationale for the Judicial Conference recommendation, we have no idea whether its reasons also apply to supervised release or to a case in which the defendant has virtually in hand the money necessary to repay counsel fees.  Accordingly, the recommendation does not control in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one final matter to address.  At oral argument Merric's able counsel informed the court that it now appears that very expensive drugs are important in controlling Merric's schizophrenia and that he may not be able to afford these drugs, which could increase his ability to function lawfully in society.  Candidly admitting that this issue had never been presented to the district court, defense counsel urged that this unusual need ought to be taken into account in assessing Merric's ability to pay the $4,000 fine (and so far as appears, this same argument can be made as to counsel fees).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded at oral argument that avenues exist for Merric to raise this medical-need issue in the district court even after the judgment becomes final, but our own preliminary review suggests to us that the district court might have little flexibility to remit or reduce the fine if we simply affirmed.  Seemingly, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3573 does no more than permit the government to move to remit unpaid portions of a fine or a special assessment where \"reasonable efforts to collect ... are not likely to be effective.\"  Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) also permits the government to move for a reduction in sentence but only where the defendant provides substantial assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, Merric's need for medicine, assuming the allegations are true, does not in any way invalidate any of the payment obligations imposed by the district court, the issue having never been raised and there being no plain error on this record.  However, we have already concluded that the judgment should be remanded to correct the judgment on the delegation issue, and we have broad authority to shape a remand in the interests of justice.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106.  Exercising this authority, we expressly give the district court leave to consider any argument based on Merric's alleged need for medicine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merric has not argued either in the district court or on this appeal that consideration of Merric's back payments for social security disability--merely to determine his ability to pay a fine or repay counsel fees--is at odds with the anti-assignment provision of the social security statute.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 407.  The point is an obscure one, raised more by case law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> than statutory language;  and we take no position on it since there is certainly no plain error.

United States v.

The Third Circuit has taken a similar view in a different context, saying there is \"no reason\" to believe that assessing the costs of imprisonment deters criminal conduct.  United States v. Spiropoulos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591403\"><a href=\"/opinion/591403/united-states-v-rene-spiropoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 164-69 (3d Cir.1992).  Whether or not this proposition \"leaves us flabbergasted,\" as it did Judge Easterbrook, Turner, 998 F.2d at 536, we do think that any substantial financial penalty has to be regarded as a deterrent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> See Guidelines for the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act, 7 Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures 20 (1990).  The full recommendation states that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(f) does not itself authorize reimbursement as a condition of probation, which is self-evident from a reading of the statute, but the balance of the recommendation is hortatory</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The only specific authority arguably pertinent allows the Judicial Conference to regulate plans for representation of the indigent, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006A(h), but that power has been treated by the case law case as primarily addressed to the administrative aspects of representation.
