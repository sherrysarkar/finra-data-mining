Having carefully reviewed the summary\r\njudgment below in light of the record and the arguments on this\r\nappeal, we agree with the district court's conclusion that the\r\nNew Hampshire Supreme Court's decision was neither contrary to,\r\nnor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\r\nlaw.  See 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1).  We add only that nothing in\r\nDoggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647 (1992), compels a\r\ndifferent result on federal habeas review.  Substantially for\r\nthe reasons stated in the district court's well-reasoned\r\nopinion and order of September 3, 1998, the judgment is\r\naffirmed.   See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
