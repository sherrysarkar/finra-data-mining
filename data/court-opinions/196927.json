Fern ndez now raises  a series of challenges  to his\r\n\nconviction, and  the government cross-appeals his  sentence.  For\r\n\nthe reasons stated herein, we affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  begin with a basic outline of the case, and address\r\n\nthe particulars in  more detail  as they arise,  as the  specific\r\n\nissues Fern ndez  raises require that  we examine the  facts from\r\n\ndiffering perspectives.   Fern ndez  was one of  20 co-defendants\r\n\ncharged  in Count One of  a September 1993 superseding indictment\r\n\nof conspiring  to  possess with  intent to  distribute more  than\r\n\n1,000  kilograms of  cocaine  and more  than  1,000 kilograms  of\r\n\nmarijuana in  violation of 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1) &amp; 846.   Count\r\n\nOne alleged 56 overt  acts in furtherance of the  conspiracy (the\r\n\n\"Sardinas operation\"),  beginning  in 1981  and  continuing  over\r\n\ntwelve years.  \r\n\n          The  central allegation regarding Fern ndez was that in\r\n\nor about the  month of April 1991, he entered into an association\r\n\nwith  co-defendants  Jorge Loredo-Alonso  (\"Loredo\")  and Horacio\r\n\nSardinas-Albo (\"Sardinas\") to use Carrier  Transportation Company\r\n\n(\"Carrier\"), a transportation  company which Fern ndez owned,  to\r\n\nship  loads of cocaine from Puerto Rico to the continental United\r\n\nStates.  The indictment  alleged that some nine loads  of cocaine\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nhad been shipped through Carrier by early 1993.\r\n\n          Fern ndez   was   tried   with   co-defendant   Antonio\r\n\nContreras.   The evidence against Fern ndez at the jury trial was\r\n\nprimarily   made  up  of  the   testimony  of  four  alleged  co-\r\n\nconspirators:  Jos  Bruno (\"Bruno\"), Elmo De  Jes s (\"De Jes s\"),\r\n\nMichael Frame  (\"Frame\"), and  Lambert Aloisi (\"Aloisi\").   Bruno\r\n\ntestified  that  nine  loads  of  cocaine  were  shipped  through\r\n\nCarrier,  the first seven between  April and August  of 1991, and\r\n\nthat he visited  Carrier's warehouse in New  Jersey several times\r\n\nin  connection  with those  loads.    Fern ndez' counsel  offered\r\n\nevidence indicating that Carrier  did not in fact exist  in April\r\n\n1991, but rather was  incorporated in August 1991, and  began its\r\n\noccupation  of the warehouse Bruno  identified in October of that\r\n\nyear.  The prosecution in turn questioned defense witnesses about\r\n\nGulf Transportation1  (\"Gulf\"); according to the  testimony, Gulf\r\n\nwas  a shipping company at  which Fern ndez had  worked before he\r\n\nowned  Carrier.  In  its closing argument,  the government argued\r\n\nthat  Fern ndez had used Gulf to transport cocaine prior to using\r\n\nCarrier.  Fern ndez  was found  guilty and was  sentenced to  151\r\n\nmonths. \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n                           A. Variance\r                                     A. Variance\r                                                \r\n\n          Fern ndez argues  on appeal  that there was  a material\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The defendant  refers to Gulf as \"Gulf  Transportation,\" while\r\nthe government uses \"Gulf Carrier Transportation.\"  We express no\r\nopinion as  to which name  is more accurate,  and use \"Gulf\"  for\r\nconvenience.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nvariance between  the superseding indictment and  the evidence on\r\n\nwhich the government relied  at trial.2  We find a variance \"when\r\n\nthe  proof  differs  from  the allegations  in  the  indictment.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.  1993).  Not\r                                   \r\n\nevery variance mandates a  new trial:  reversal is  only required\r\n\nif the variance proves  both material and prejudicial.   See Fed.\r                                                                      \r\n\nR. Crim. P. 52(a); United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\r                                                        \r\n\nCir.  1994).   Thus, where,  as here,  \"the government  charges a\r\n\ndefendant with a crime  . . . but the facts  proven at trial vary\r\n\nsomewhat from those charged in the indictment . . . it is settled\r\n\nlaw  that a  conviction for  the crime  charged will  be affirmed\r\n\nunless the variance  as to the facts is  shown to have prejudiced\r\n\nthe defendant.\"  United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1304 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1993).    Our review  of whether  a retrial  is required  is\r\n\nplenary.  Arcadipane, 41 F.3d at 6.\r                              \r\n\n          The  superseding  indictment  specifically stated  that\r\n\nFern ndez used  Carrier to transport cocaine.3   The government's\r\n\ncase was consistent with this theory.  Thus, Fern ndez maintains,\r\n\nwhile  Carrier was  neither  a defendant  nor  an object  of  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Fern ndez'  motion for a bill of particulars, which included a\r\nrequest for discovery of other transportation  companies utilized\r\nby Sardinas, was denied by the court.\r\n\n3   Paragraph 28 of the superseding indictment charged that \"[o]n\r\nor about the month of April, 1991,  HORACIO SARDINAS-ALBO, a/k/a/\r\nHIPPIE,  and  JORGE  ALONSO-LOREDO  [sic]  associated  with  JUAN\r\nFERNANDEZ to use the  services of Carrier Transportation Company,\r\na transportation  company owned  by JUAN FERNANDEZ,  to transport\r\nlarge  amounts of  cocaine  from Puerto  Rico to  the continental\r\nUnited  States  using  containers.\"    The  following  paragraphs\r\ndetailed the nine alleged shipments of cocaine.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nindictment,  it was  nonetheless a key  part of  the government's\r\n\ncase.  However, Fern ndez continues,  when he offered evidence in\r\n\nhis  defense  which refuted  the  charges  concerning Carrier  by\r\n\nproving  that it  could  not have  been  used as  alleged  in the\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment, the  government abruptly  switched gears\r\n\nand  argued that Fern ndez used Gulf.  The prejudice against him,\r\n\nFern ndez contends,  was obvious:  his  trial preparations, which\r\n\nhad  centered around Carrier, were no longer adequate, since Gulf\r\n\nbecame the focus of the trial and the jury's deliberations.\r\n\n          We do  not find  such  \"obvious\" prejudice;  nor do  we\r\n\nagree  that Gulf became the focus of the trial and deliberations.\r\n\nWe  recognize that there  was a variance,  but do not  believe it\r\n\n\"work[ed] a substantial  interference with the  defendant's right\r\n\nto be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep.\"  Arcadipane,\r                                                                          \r\n\n41  F.3d at  6.   Simply  put,  although Carrier  was  repeatedly\r\n\nmentioned in  the indictment,  the charge was  against Fern ndez,\r\n\nnot  his company.    Regardless of  whether  Carrier or  Gulf  is\r\n\ndiscussed, the  charge is  the same:   that  Fern ndez associated\r\n\nwith Sardinas and Loredo to transport cocaine.  Fern ndez  cannot\r\n\nnow claim that he was misinformed of the charges against  him, or\r\n\nthat his substantial rights were somehow affected.

See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., United States  v. Disanto,  1996 WL 312368,  *11 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1996);  United States v. Rivera-G mez, 67 F.3d 993, 997 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1995).\r\n\n          Testimony   regarding   Gulf   was   elicited   by  the\r\n\ngovernment,   over  Fern ndez'   objection,  during   its  cross-\r\n\nexamination  of defense  witness  Rosa Sanjurjo,  an employee  in\r\n\nCarrier's  collection  department.   She  stated  that she  began\r\n\nworking for Carrier in January of 1992, prior to which she worked\r\n\nfor  Gulf until 1990.   She acknowledged that  Fern ndez had also\r\n\nworked  for  Gulf, that  it  did  the same  type  of  business as\r\n\nCarrier, and that it closed before Carrier was created.  She also\r\n\nstated that Gulf did not become Carrier.  On redirect, Fern ndez'\r\n\ncounsel  elicited  her  testimony  that Gulf  was  a  corporation\r\n\ncontrolled  by Fern ndez  and  two  other individuals,  including\r\n\nSanjurjo's  stepson.  She stated on recross that Carrier and Gulf\r\n\nhad  different offices  and  used different  warehouses.   George\r\n\nWyle, a salesman for Carrier for part of 1992, testified on cross\r\n\nthat  he knew  Fern ndez through the  shipping business  prior to\r\n\n1992,  that  Fern ndez was  involved  with  Gulf, that  Gulf  did\r\n\nessentially  the same kind of business that Carrier did, and that\r\n\nGulf's full name was Gulf Carrier.\r\n\n          After the  first few questions to  Sanjurjo about Gulf,\r\n\ndefense  counsel objected  to  the cross-examination  on Gulf  as\r\n\nbeing outside the  scope of  examination; the  court allowed  the\r\n\nprosecution to continue, but  asking questions on direct, instead\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nof on cross.   After a few more  questions, defense counsel asked\r\n\nfor  a sidebar, and objected that the questioning was outside the\r\n\nscope  of  the testimony  and the  entire  case.   The prosecutor\r\n\nargued that the evidence was being used for impeachment, pointing\r\n\nout  that since Fern ndez was arguing that it was impossible that\r\n\nCarrier could have  been used,  the evidence on  Gulf would  show\r\n\nthat even before Carrier  started Fern ndez was in the  same line\r\n\nof  business, at a company which operated in essentially the same\r\n\nfashion, offering  Fern ndez access to shipping  services, albeit\r\n\nunder a different name.  The court denied Fern ndez' objection.\r\n\n          Before closing arguments, Fern ndez' counsel raised the\r\n\nissue  of  whether  the  government  should  be  allowed to  make\r\n\nreference  to  Gulf in  its  closing argument.    Defense counsel\r\n\nprotested that the government was trying to make an inference not\r\n\nbased on  the evidence,  since there  was  no evidence  regarding\r\n\nwhether  Gulf  and  Carrier  had  a  similar  identity,  or  when\r\n\nFern ndez was  involved with  Gulf.  Indeed,  counsel noted,  the\r\n\ntestimony  indicated  no  continuity  of  ownership  between  the\r\n\ncompanies, and  that they used different facilities.   The court,\r\n\nhowever,  rejected  the   defense's  argument  and   allowed  the\r\n\ngovernment to discuss Gulf in its closing argument.\r\n\n          Fern ndez now  argues that the district  court erred in\r\n\nallowing evidence  and  argument regarding  Gulf.   He  does  not\r\n\nspecify his reasons, however.  Rather, he simply refers us to the\r\n\nreasons  stated  in  his  additional  arguments,  leaving  us  to\r\n\nspeculate  as to which reasons  would apply in  this context, and\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nrunning  the risk  of waiver.   As  we address  those contentions\r\n\nwhere they are made, we add only a few comments here.\r\n\n          Briefly stated,  while it could have  decided the issue\r\n\nseveral different ways, we  find that the district court  did not\r\n\nabuse its  discretion  in choosing  to  allow the  government  to\r\n\nelicit  and use the evidence regarding Gulf.  While not detailed,\r\n\nthe evidence was  certainly relevant,  for the  very reasons  the\r\n\ngovernment outlined.   See Fed.  R. Evid. 401;  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGriffin, 818 F.2d 97,  101-02 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  484 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n844 (1987) (noting the broad discretion district courts enjoy  in\r\n\ndetermining  relevance).   Allowing the  line of  questioning and\r\n\nargument was neither unfairly prejudicial, see Fed. R. Evid. 403,\r                                                        \r\n\nnor constituted an  unfair surprise:  Fern ndez' defense was that\r\n\nit  was impossible for  him to have used  Carrier to ship cocaine\r\n\nbecause  Carrier  was not  in operation  --  a line  of reasoning\r\n\nfairly inviting  the question  of what other  companies Fern ndez\r\n\nhad access to  during the  relevant time period,  and whether  he\r\n\ncould have used them in a similar manner.\r\n\n                    2.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nOlden  v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 231 (1988) (per curiam) (noting\r                            \r\n\nthat the  right of confrontation  \"includes the right  to conduct\r\n\nreasonable  cross-examination\").  As we find no error on the part\r\n\nof  the district court, we  need not enter  into a harmless error\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nanalysis.  See id. at 232; Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673,\r                                                            \r\n\n680-81 (1986).\r\n\n          First, Bruno  and two other witnesses  testified that a\r\n\nPuerto  Rico  senator was  implicated  in the  conspiracy:   they\r\n\nalleged that in 1990,  when other members of the  conspiracy were\r\n\narrested in Tortola, the senator attempted to gain their release.\r\n\nBruno testified that  the senator received  close to two  hundred\r\n\nfifty  thousand dollars in order to bribe the magistrate handling\r\n\nthe  case in  the  British  Virgin  Islands,  as  well  as  other\r\n\nindividuals.  Another  witness  testified  that he  believed  the\r\n\nsenator had met with representatives of the Sardinas operation in\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico  Senate -- the witness claimed  that he waited in\r\n\nthe car outside while they met.\r\n\n          At trial, the court ruled in limine  that counsel could\r                                                       \r\n\nnot  mention the  senator's  name.   Fern ndez  argues that  this\r\n\nconstituted error requiring a new trial.  First, he contends that\r\n\nidentification  of  the senator's  name  could  have \"tipped  the\r\n\nbalance\" in  the impeachment of Bruno by showing that he would go\r\n\nto  any lengths  to  obstruct justice,  and  thus should  not  be\r\n\nbelieved  in  his testimony  at trial.    Second, he  posits that\r\n\nidentification could  have  led  the  jury to  believe  that  the\r\n\naccount of the  senator's involvement in  the Tortola events  was\r\n\nfabricated  by  witnesses  in  order to  gain  leniency  from the\r\n\ngovernment,  because  of the  prominence  and  importance of  the\r\n\nparticular senator.  Thus,  the argument goes, the identification\r\n\nwould  have  added  to  the  evidence  that  the  witnesses  were\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nfabricating stories  in a  desperate attempt to  obtain leniency.\r\n\nFinally, Fern ndez maintains that members  of the jury could have\r\n\nfelt  that  the  failure  to  prosecute  the  senator was  unfair\r\n\nselective prosecution.\r\n\n          We  do  not find  any  of  these arguments  convincing.\r\n\nThere can be no question that the Sixth Amendment entails a right\r\n\nto  cross examine  a witness;  nonetheless, \"trial  judges retain\r\n\nwide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to\r\n\nimpose  reasonable limits  on  such cross-examination  [regarding\r\n\npotential  bias] based  on  concerns about,  among other  things,\r\n\nharassment, prejudice,  confusion  of the  issues,  the  witness'\r\n\nsafety, or  interrogation that  is repetitive or  only marginally\r\n\nrelevant.\"    Van  Arsdall, 475  U.S.  at  679;  see Delaware  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nFensterer,  474  U.S.  15,  20 (1985)  (per  curiam)  (\"Generally\r                   \r\n\nspeaking, the Confrontation Clause  guarantees an opportunity for\r                                                                       \r\n\neffective  cross-examination,  not   cross-examination  that   is\r\n\neffective  in whatever way,  and to whatever  extent, the defense\r\n\nmight wish.\").  The  court informed  the jury  that it  had ruled\r\n\nthat the name of the senator \"would not be mentioned  in order to\r\n\nprotect an ongoing investigation  with respect to activities that\r\n\nhe may have been  engaged in.\"   Tr. at 515.   The jury was  also\r\n\ninformed  that  the  parties  stipulated  that  the  senator  was\r\n\n\"prominent.\"  Further, as noted above, the scope of the senator's\r\n\nalleged  actions  was  explored  through testimony  from  several\r\n\nwitnesses:   the sole  element the court ordered  be left out was\r\n\nthe senator's name.  Certainly the jury had enough information in\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nfront  of it  to be able  to weigh  the impeachment  value of the\r\n\nalleged plot:  it had  \"the facts from which jurors, as  the sole\r\n\ntriers  of  fact   and  credibility,  could  appropriately   draw\r\n\ninferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\"  Davis v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAlaska,  415  U.S.  308,  318  (1974).    As  for  the  selective\r                \r\n\nprosecution claim, we note that the court told the jury there was\r\n\nan ongoing investigation:   the implication that the  senator had\r\n\nnot  been charged is  clear.   We do  not find  any error  in the\r\n\ndistrict court's ruling.\r\n\n          The  second  claim  focuses  on  the  De  Jes s  cross-\r\n\nexamination.  He testified that he assisted in the transportation\r\n\nof more than 1,000  kilograms of cocaine, yet his  plea agreement\r\n\nstated that he was responsible for only 3.5 to 5  kilograms.  The\r\n\nprosecution   objected   to   defense's   questioning   on   this\r\n\ndiscrepancy, and  the court sustained  the objection.   The court\r\n\nruled that the defense could not cross-examine De Jes s regarding\r\n\nthe quantity of cocaine for which he was held  accountable in his\r\n\nplea  agreement, but  could question  him on  the difference  the\r\n\nagreement made in  his sentence.   De Jes s  duly testified  that\r\n\nwithout the plea  he faced from  thirty years to  life, and  that\r\n\nwith it, he was facing seven years.  He agreed that by testifying\r\n\nin this case, he was hoping to  have the sentence further reduced\r\n\nso as to not have to spend any time in jail.\r\n\n          Fern ndez argues that the  court erred, since any proof\r\n\nof false, self-serving statements by a government witness -- such\r\n\nas  the plea agreement figure -- would aid the defense in showing\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nthe witnesses' untrustworthiness.   Thus, Fern ndez contends, his\r\n\nSixth Amendment right of confrontation  was violated.  See Olden,\r                                                                          \r\n\n488 U.S. at  231.  We disagree.  First,  defense counsel was able\r\n\nto impeach De Jes s through eliciting his testimony on the impact\r\n\nthe  plea agreement  had  on his  sentence and  his  hopes for  a\r\n\nreduced  sentence  based  on  his participation  in  this  trial.\r\n\nSecond,  the court's  ruling  seems to  have  been based  on  the\r\n\nconcern that the jury  understand that De Jes s was  not actually\r\n\nlying in his plea agreement, but rather that the figure  used was\r\n\na  mechanism of  convenience  in  order  to  get  to  a  specific\r\n\nsentence:  \"I think the whole  concept is to show . . .  [that it\r\n\nwas a] deal, a wow deal, but not to show that he's a liar because\r\n\nthat's not  the real facts.\"  Tr.  at 1879.  We  do not find that\r\n\nthe district  court  erred in  striking  a balance  between  this\r\n\nconcern and  the importance  of impeachment through  limiting the\r\n\ntestimony  to the sentence obtained.   Indeed, we  agree with the\r\n\ncourt's comment to the effect that to do otherwise  would run the\r\n\nrisk of  having defense  counsel impeach  the government,  not De\r\n\nJes s.\r\n\n          Fern ndez' reliance on United  States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n430  (1st Cir.  1988), is  misplaced.   There, we found  that the\r\n\ntrial  court  erred  in restricting  cross-examination  into  the\r\n\ncircumstances underlying  a witness' plea bargain.   The witness'\r\n\nagreement  with   the  government  required  that   he  take  and\r\n\n\"successfully  complete\" a  polygraph examination.   He  took the\r\n\ntest,  twice, and  the examiner  labeled some  of his  answers as\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n\"inconclusive.\"   The  defense sought to  impeach the  witness by\r\n\nimplying that  the witness  had not \"successfully  completed\" the\r\n\ntest,  and so  had  motive to  lie  on the  stand  to please  the\r\n\ngovernment.   The court cut  off all questioning  about the test,\r\n\nand  informed  the  jury   that  such  tests  yielded  inherently\r\n\nunreliable results.  Id. at 432.  We held that the district court\r                                  \r\n\nabused its discretion by cutting off all cross-examination into a\r\n\n\"relevant and not fully explored area.\"  Id. at 434.  The same is\r                                                      \r\n\nnot  true  here.    The  district  court  did  not  cut  off  all\r\n\nexamination in the area of De Jes s' credibility:  rather, it set\r\n\nlimits on the examination so as to permit the introduction of the\r\n\ninformation  in a  manner which  would not  mislead the  jury yet\r\n\nprovide  it  \"with 'sufficient  information  concerning formative\r\n\nevents  to  make  a  \"discriminating appraisal\"  of  [De  Jes s']\r\n\nmotives and bias.'\"  Id. at 433 (quoting United States v.

However, the government  need not\r\n\nprove a formal agreement existed:  as it points out, \"the illegal\r\n\nagreement  may be either 'express  or tacit.'\"   United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nS nchez,  917 F.2d  607, 610  (1st Cir.  1990).

Bruno testified about sending the\r\n\nnine  shipments   of  cocaine,  and   about  Fern ndez'  personal\r\n\nparticipation in  the operation,  including  telephone calls  and\r\n\nmeetings.  He stated that he went to the Carrier warehouse in New\r\n\nJersey,  his first visit being  in July 1991,  and that Fern ndez\r\n\nwas there on at least one occasion.  Aloisi's testimony generally\r\n\ncorroborated  Bruno's statements.    De Jes s  testified that  he\r\n\nparticipated  in at  least four  shipments of  cocaine, including\r\n\ndeliveries of  cocaine to Fern ndez  at a warehouse  in Carolina,\r\n\nPuerto  Rico, and retrieval from  the New Jersey  warehouse.  His\r\n\ntestimony contradicted Bruno's on  several points, regarding  the\r\n\namount  of cocaine  in particular  loads and who  participated in\r\n\nspecific meetings and loads.4  Our review of this record leads us\r\n\nto conclude  that, \"having heard the  evidence, including nuances\r\n\nand intimations  that a  cold record  cannot capture,  a rational\r\n\njury could find  beyond a reasonable  doubt that [Fern ndez]  was\r\n\nguilty of conspiracy.\"  Mor n, 984 F.2d at 1301-02.\r                                       \r\n\n          Fern ndez also argues that  this court must reverse the\r\n\nverdict below  because it was physically  impossible that Carrier\r\n\nwas the company used to transport cocaine in 1991:  he  presented\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4    Frame testified  that Fern ndez  was  already active  in the\r\noperation  in  1989  or  1990  and  that  he  was  instructed  to\r\ncommunicate  with   Fern ndez  whenever  he  needed   to  contact\r\nSardinas, which he did several times.  These allegations were not\r\nin the superseding indictment.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nevidence that Carrier did  not exist until after April  1991, and\r\n\nthat it did not  occupy the New Jersey warehouse until October of\r\n\nthat  year.  Since the chief  government witnesses testified that\r\n\nCarrier was used, the  argument continues, there is no  reason to\r\n\ncredit the witnesses' testimony  as to this point, or  any other.\r\n\nThus,  Fern ndez concludes  that  the trial  court  erred in  not\r\n\ngranting his motion for acquittal.\r\n\n          While  there  were  inconsistencies  in  the witnesses'\r\n\ntestimony,  and while  they all  had an  incentive to  please the\r\n\ngovernment, these aspects of the evidence were pointed out to the\r\n\njury by defense counsel.   As the government notes, Bruno  and De\r\n\nJes s did not go to any  warehouse for the first loads -- indeed,\r\n\nBruno  testified  that Carrier  had  previously  had a  different\r\n\naddress  --  and  the   evidence  regarding  Gulf  suggests  that\r\n\nFern ndez  had knowledge  of  and access  to shipping  facilities\r\n\nduring the  relevant time frame.   It was within the  province of\r\n\nthe jury to disregard  some of the inconsistencies and  to accept\r\n\naspects of the witnesses'  testimony as credible.  \"The  force of\r\n\nthe  evidence as  a  whole, including  all reasonable  inferences\r\n\nfavorable to  the verdict, was  sufficient to support  a rational\r\n\njury finding:   that defendant was guilty.\"   L pez, 944  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n40.\r\n\n                    2.

Fern ndez argues\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nthat  the government's  case here  was wholly  circumstantial and\r\n\nrested  solely  on  the   testimony  of  blatantly  untrustworthy\r\n\nwitnesses,  as  demonstrated by  the many  contradictions between\r\n\ntheir  stories  and  Fern ndez'  evidence that  Carrier  had  not\r\n\noccupied a warehouse until October 1991.   The evidence regarding\r\n\nGulf, he continues, is  insufficient to support the eleventh-hour\r\n\nclaim that Fern ndez used it.\r\n\n          We review  for abuse  of discretion, see,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Statements Objected to at Trial\r                         2.  Statements Objected to at Trial\r                                                            \r\n\n          (1)  During  trial, a lease  application filled out  by\r\n\nLoredo in November,  1991, which  stated that he  had worked  for\r\n\nCarrier for six years -- well before the time the  defense argued\r\n\nCarrier began to exist -- was admitted for the limited purpose of\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nshowing  that Loredo claimed he  worked for Carrier,  not for the\r\n\ntruth of the  matters in  the document.   Fern ndez now  contends\r\n\nthat  the prosecutor  went  beyond that  limited  purpose in  his\r\n\nclosing argument.   Referring to the  application, the prosecutor\r\n\nstated:\r\n\n            You remember,  as you  look  at it  here,\r\n            there is a part . . . where he's supposed\r\n            to or he has  to list his employer.   His\r\n            list what [sic]?  Carrier Transportation.\r\n            Just   Carrier   Transportation  as   his\r\n            employer. . . .\r\n\n               And  most importantly, he  said he was\r\n            working for that  company for six  years.\r\n            Six years.   The phone numbers are right.\r\n            The  address is right.   Working  for the\r\n            company, he says, for six years.  This is\r\n            proof   that   there   was    a   Carrier\r\n            Transportation  that operated  before the\r\n            date that counsel --\r\n\nTr. at  2472.   The  prosecutor  was  cut off  by  the  defense's\r\n\nobjection.  \r\n\n          We agree with Fern ndez  that the prosecutor was moving\r\n\nbeyond the stipulation  to assert that the lease  application was\r\n\n\"proof  that there  was  a Carrier  Transportation that  operated\r\n\nbefore the date\" the defense alleged it began business.  Thus, we\r\n\nturn  to  our four-factor  test.   We  note that  the misconduct,\r\n\nthough  disingenuous, was not severe, and  occurred only once, in\r\n\nrelative isolation.   More importantly, the  court gave immediate\r\n\ncurative instructions,  admonishing the  jury that the  lease did\r\n\nnot  come in  as anything  more than  a claim  by Loredo  to have\r\n\nworked   for  Carrier,   and  reminding   them  of   its  earlier\r\n\ninstruction,  made  when  the  lease  application  was   entered.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nIndeed, in its closing, the defense also reminded the jury of the\r\n\nlimited use of the lease.  On balance, we find that \"the curative\r\n\ninstruction sufficed  to dispel  any prejudice from  the improper\r\n\ncomment.\"   United  States v.  Boldt, 929 F.2d  35, 41  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1991); see United  States v. Savarese, 649 F.2d 83,  88 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1981).\r\n\n          (2)    Fern ndez  objects   to  other  references   the\r\n\nprosecution  made  to Gulf  on  the  basis  that they  encouraged\r\n\nspeculation and  attempted to  argue facts  not presented  in the\r\n\nevidence.5  First, the prosecutor stated:\r\n\n            we  had to wait  for cross-examination by\r\n            [co-counsel for the  government] to  find\r\n            out  that there  was  a previous  company\r\n            before  1992, in  fact from  1986 it  had\r\n            started, which did the exact same type of\r\n            job.  It had -- it was a shipping company\r\n            that  did  transportation  in   the  same\r\n            manner,   through   the  containers   and\r\n            Mr. Juan  Fern ndez was  also one  of the\r\n            owners or partners in the operation.\r\n\nTr. at  2475.   Like Fern ndez,  we can find  no evidence  in the\r\n\nrecord  stating that Gulf began in 1986.   The offer of this fact\r\n\nis  harmless, however, since  the pertinent time  period is 1991,\r\n\nand Sanjurjo testified that Gulf  was in operation in 1990.   The\r\n\nreference leaves open the  crucial question, which is,  when Gulf\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  Fern ndez objected  to the prosecution's being allowed  to use\r\nGulf in  its closing.   However, his counsel did  not object when\r\nthe court held that the prosecution could \"tell it to the  jury.\"\r\nTr. at  2438.  The government  points out that  Fern ndez did not\r\nmake  specific  objections to  these  references  to Gulf  during\r\nclosing\r\nargument,  presumably  asking us  to review  them under  the more\r\nlenient plain  error standard.  As we  find no error under either\r\nstandard,  we need not  determine here whether  the objection was\r\npreserved.\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nceased operation.   As for the form in  which the prosecutor made\r                \r\n\nhis statement, it is consistent with the framework the government\r\n\nused for its argument, discussed in (1), above.\r\n\n          Fern ndez objects to the  cited passage and four others\r\n\nfor  asserting that Carrier  and Gulf  were essentially  the same\r\n\nthing, doing the exact same job:\r\n\n            [O]ur argument is  that before, when  the\r\n            company  was  operating  as Gulf  Carrier\r\n            Transportation he  used another warehouse\r\n            in New Jersey. \r\n\n               . . . [It]  was known as Gulf Carrier,\r\n            also.  Gulf Carrier just like -- the same\r\n            name, just slightly different wording and\r\n            same owners, same business, same thing.\r\n\nTr. at 2476.   These statements, he  contends, urged the jury  to\r\n\nspeculate in a  manner unsupported and contradicted by the actual\r\n\nevidence  regarding Gulf.  There was evidence that they were both\r\n\ntransportation companies,  but not that  they did the  exact same\r\n\njob.   Indeed, the owners were not  the same:  Fern ndez was part\r\n\nowner of Gulf, and the sole owner of Carrier.  Finally, there was\r\n\nno evidence that Gulf was actually in business in 1991.\r\n\n          On balance,  we cannot find that this  line of argument\r\n\nso  poisoned the trial  well that a  new trial is  required.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nManning, 23 F.3d at 574.   The government made an argument  based\r                 \r\n\non the limited evidence regarding Gulf.   The defense was able to\r\n\nargue  the counter position,  pointing out the  lack of evidence,\r\n\nand did so.  \r\n\n             3.  Statements Not Objected to at Trial\r                       3.  Statements Not Objected to at Trial\r                                                              \r\n\n          We  examine  the  statements  which  Fern ndez  did not\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nobject to at trial in the order in which he raised them.  We find\r\n\nthat  most are not  improper; of the  few that are,  none of them\r\n\nprove  so  serious  that  the  district  court  plainly erred  in\r\n\nallowing them. \r\n\n          (1)   Fern ndez first argues that  the prosecutor erred\r\n\nby  trying to \"secure the empathy  of the jury\" through asking it\r\n\nto step into  the government's  shoes and align  itself with  the\r\n\nprosecution team through statements like the following.\r\n\n            Now, the way I  would like to discuss the\r\n            evidence with you is in the order that we\r\n            received  it.   Okay.   The  way we  were\r\n            interviewing  these  witnesses,  in  that\r\n            order,  to give  you a  feel for  what we\r\n            went  through as you determine whether we\r\n            have proven, as we submit to you we have,\r\n            beyond a reasonable  doubt the  existence\r\n            of the conspiracy and their participation\r\n            . . . .\r\n\nTr. at  2443.  The prosecutor  made a series of  comments such as\r\n\n\"[w]e seek  [co-conspirators or drug  traffickers] out and  we go\r\n\nout  and corroborate  them.\"   Tr. at  2442.   We agree  with the\r\n\ngovernment,  however,  that,  read  in  context,  the  statements\r\n\nFern ndez points to were simply establishing a  framework for the\r\n\npresentation of the government's  argument.  They also served  to\r\n\npoint out that even  though the government's witnesses  were drug\r\n\ntraffickers with  a motive  to fabricate evidence  -- as  defense\r\n\ncounsel had emphasized in opening argument -- their testimony was\r\n\ncorroborated.   Indeed,  in the first  passage quoted  above, the\r\n\nprosecution  reminded  the  jury  that it  carried  the  duty  of\r\n\ndetermining  whether the government proved its case.  While we do\r\n\nnot necessarily recommend this framework for argument as an ideal\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\none, we do not find that the statements were improper.\r\n\n          (2)  Fern ndez' second  argument is that the prosecutor\r\n\nmisstated  the law on proof of conspiracy in making the following\r\n\nstatements:\r\n\n            the only way we can prove a conspiracy is\r\n            through  the  testimony of  the  very co-\r\n            conspirators  who  were  members of  that\r\n            conspiracy.\r\n\nTr. at 2441.\r\n\n            you're always going to need the testimony\r\n            of   the   co-conspirator   to  prove   a\r\n            conspiracy because of the secrecy  of the\r\n            conspiracy.\r\n\nTr. at 2442.\r\n\n               You're  never going  to find  a decent\r\n            person testifying to a drug deal.  That's\r\n            what we got to deal with.  That's what we\r\n            got to do.\r\n\nTr.  2571-72.    Contrary  to appellant's  assertion,  these  are\r\n\narguments, not statements of fact, and are thus permissible.\r\n\n          Even if  they were improper,  they would not  require a\r\n\nnew trial.  For, viewed in context, it is clear that they did not\r\n\npoison  the   trial  proceeding.    In   his  opening  statement,\r\n\nFern ndez' counsel had emphasized  the fact that no actual  drugs\r\n\nwere  offered   in  evidence:    the   challenged  comments  were\r\n\napparently   designed  to  counter   those  statements   with  an\r\n\nexplanation of  why the government  relied so heavily  on witness\r\n\ntestimony.    The  first  two  statements  are  addressed  to the\r\n\npractical difficulties  of proving a conspiracy.   The prosecutor\r\n\nfollowed  the first with an explanation of why the government did\r\n\nnot introduce any actual drugs.  Further, the prosecutor followed\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nup  these  comments  with  a  discussion  of  the  importance  of\r\n\ndocumentary  evidence  in  corroborating   witnesses'  testimony,\r\n\nbelying  his own comments.   As for the  \"decent person\" comment,\r\n\nits logical  flaws are  obvious.   Moreover, defense counsel  had\r\n\nemphasized the  witnesses' dishonesty  in his opening,6  to which\r\n\nthis is apparently a response.  These statements do not warrant a\r\n\nnew trial.  \r\n\n          (3)   The prosecutor made two statements to the jury to\r\n\nthe  effect  that  \"[t]o acquit,  you  would  have  to find  that\r\n\neverybody was lying  in this case.\"   Tr. at 2590-91.   Fern ndez\r\n\nargues,  and  the government  seems  to  agree, that  these  were\r\n\nimproper.  To the contrary, we feel they amounted to nothing more\r\n\nthan argument, and were not improper.  \r\n\n          (4)     Fern ndez'  fourth   contention  is  that   the\r\n\nprosecutor  made statements  without  evidentiary  support.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSantana-Camacho, 833  F.2d at 373 (reversing  conviction on basis\r                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6   For  example, in  his opening  statement, Fern ndez'  counsel\r\nstated:\r\n\n               And  the evidence  is that  these drug\r\n            pushers have consistently taken  the easy\r\n            way  out of everything that is meaningful\r\n            in life. . . . \r\n\n               . .  .

They simply\r\n            only care about themselves . . . .

The prosecutor erroneously stated that the testifying\r\n\ndrug traffickers were \"either in jail  or go to [sic] jail,\"  Tr.\r\n\nat 2442, and that Bruno specifically would be going to jail when,\r\n\nin  fact, Aloisi had  a non-prosecution agreement,  and Bruno was\r\n\nnot incarcerated at  the time  of trial.   Again, the  government\r\n\nacknowledges that the  statements were  not factually  true.   We\r\n\nagree with the  government, however, that any error  in admitting\r\n\nthese statements does not rise to  the level of plain error.  The\r\n\nagreements  between  the government  and  the  witnesses were  in\r\n\nevidence, each of the  four witnesses against Fern ndez testified\r\n\nabout his agreement with the government, defense counsel reminded\r\n\nthe jury of  their agreements  in his closing  argument, and  the\r\n\njudge  instructed  the jurors  that  counsel's  argument did  not\r\n\nconstitute  evidence, but  that their  recollection of  the facts\r\n\ncontrolled.  Cf. United  States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d  456, 482\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.)

DeMarco v.  United States, 510\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 955 (1993).\r\n\n          (5)  Fern ndez  points out that  the government made  a\r\n\nsecond misstatement of  the evidence by arguing that  the payment\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nwhich  the two  lead  conspirators  were  alleged to  have  given\r\n\nFern ndez  in order  to buy  into Carrier  was \"not  an  over the\r\n\ncounter deal\" but  rather \"a  criminal association.   It [was]  a\r\n\npaper bag  with eighty  thousand dollars.\"    Tr. at  2575.   The\r\n\ngovernment acknowledges that the paper  bag details pertain to  a\r\n\ndifferent transaction, not involving Fern ndez.  The misstatement\r\n\nis troublesome  in its  characterization of the  transaction, the\r\n\ndetails  of which  were not  in evidence.   However,  between the\r\n\nbrevity  and isolation  of  the misstatement,  the court's  later\r\n\ninstruction to the jury that their memory controlled, and defense\r\n\ncounsel's failure  to make  a timely objection,  Fern ndez cannot\r\n\nclear the plain error hurdle. \r\n\n          (6)    Next, Fern ndez  alleges  that  in his  rebuttal\r\n\nargument the  prosecutor provided  information to contradict  the\r\n\ntestimony  of a witness at  trial.  Without  specifying what that\r\n\ninformation  is, he  cites the  following passage  discussing the\r\n\ntestimony of  Enrique Nieves  (\"Nieves\"), Special Agent  with the\r\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration.  \r\n\n               Now,  the other thing with Mr. Nieves.\r\n            He said  that there was a  search warrant\r\n            served on or about the time Mr. Fern ndez\r\n            was  indicted.   And  that's false.   You\r\n            recall the testimony, that was the search\r\n            warrant was at an unrelated  warehouse of\r\n            Mr. Velasco before  we had any  knowledge\r\n            of the fact that they were using  Carrier\r\n            Transportation  at the time  of the first\r\n            indictment.    That's  when  that  search\r\n            warrant  was served  and  that's when  we\r\n            were going after Mr.  Velasco who was  in\r\n            the  first indictment.   So the fact that\r\n            that  search  warrant   was  served   and\r\n            nothing was found, we were not after  Mr.\r\n            Juan  Fern ndez's  business  at the  time\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\n            because we didn't know about it.\r\n\nTr. at 2578.  \r\n\n          Examination  of  the record  sheds  some  light on  the\r\n\npassage.   First, the depiction  of Nieves' testimony is correct:\r\n\nthe  warrant  was  for  an  unrelated  warehouse,  prior  to  any\r\n\nsuspicion that the warehouse  Carrier used was involved, and  was\r\n\nserved  following  the  first  indictment,  which  did  not  name\r\n\nFern ndez.   Second, the \"he\" of \"he said that there was a search\r\n\nwarrant served\" seems to  refer not to Nieves, but  to Fern ndez'\r\n\ncounsel.   The  latter  had stated  in  his closing  that  Nieves\r\n\ntestified  that  in  September 1993  --  the  time  of the  first\r\n\nindictment -- he had testified at a bond hearing that a  specific\r\n\nwarehouse  used by  Carrier was  not involved  with  the Sardinas\r\n\noperation.  Defense counsel also  referred to the search  warrant\r\n\nfor  a different warehouse.   It would seem  that the prosecution\r\n\nblurred  the line between the  reference to the  bond hearing and\r\n\nthe search warrant and attributed the date given for the first to\r\n\nthe second.  While perhaps  an error, it does not  constitute the\r\n\npresentation  of information  to  contradict the  testimony of  a\r\n\nwitness at trial.   Since Fern ndez  did not see fit  to actually\r\n\nspecify what  element of  the passage presented  new information,\r\n\nand we see none ourselves, we find  no plain error on the part of\r\n\nthe district court in allowing the statement.\r\n\n          (7)   The prosecutor's statement that  \"[t]hey could be\r\n\ndoing  additional  loads  besides the  ones  that  Mr. Bruno  was\r\n\naware,\"  Tr. at 2465-66,  was not improper  speculation, since it\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nwas made in  the context of the prosecutor  noting that De Jes s'\r\n\ntestimony  was  that  Bruno  was   not  always  involved  in  the\r\n\ntransportation of loads of cocaine, and so the government was not\r\n\nalways sure what number  a load was:  \"they  probably skipped the\r\n\nfifth  and  this is  the sixth  load, or  it  could be  a totally\r\n\ndifferent  load.   We don't  know.\"   Tr. at 2465.   Even  if the\r\n\nstatement could be construed  as improper speculation,  Fern ndez\r\n\nagain fails  to clear the  hurdle of  the four factors  and prove\r\n\nthat there was plain error on the part of the district court.\r\n\n          (8)  Similarly, Fern ndez contends  that the prosecutor\r\n\nimproperly generalized about his experiences in stating that\r\n\n            even on some minor details there is a lot\r\n            of  corroboration in this  case, which is\r\n            unusual.   You  will usually  have little\r\n            corroboration in that aspect, but even on\r\n            details, as  I  go through  the  evidence\r\n            I'll     mention    them,     there    is\r\n            corroboration.\r\n\nTr. at 2444.  See United States v. Rosa, 705 F.2d 1375, 1379 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1983) (\"It is settled law in this circuit  that a prosecutor\r\n\nmay not inject into his jury argument his personal opinions about\r\n\nconclusions  to be  drawn from the  evidence.\").   The prosecutor\r\n\nmade this statement  in the  context of encouraging  the jury  to\r\n\nrecognize that  the presence  of some inconsistencies  in witness\r\n\ntestimony  does  not  preclude  granting  them  credence.    This\r\n\nstatement  falls somewhere  on  the spectrum  between proper  and\r\n\nimproper argument.   However, even  assuming it was  improper, we\r\n\ncannot  find that it is so  severe as to warrant  a mistrial.  In\r\n\ntruth, the  prosecutor  was telling  the  jury what  it  probably\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\nalready  knows:   that there  will likely  be differences  in the\r\n\nstories  told by  two people  recounting an  event that  occurred\r\n\nyears earlier.   \r\n\n          Fern ndez  makes  the   similar  contention  that   the\r\n\nprosecution  twice vouched  for  the credibility  of  prosecution\r\n\nwitnesses by telling the jury that the witnesses were telling the\r\n\ntruth  because they  did not  get together  to concoct  a totally\r\n\nconsistent story;  the  fact that  their  story was  not  totally\r\n\nconsistent, the prosecution argued,  reveals that \"the only other\r\n\nalternative is  that . . .  they were telling the  truth and that\r\n\nthe  impeachment that they  have been able  to make to  you is, I\r\n\nsubmit,  as  to details.\"    Tr.  at 2591.    We  agree with  the\r\n\ngovernment that these remarks  amount to asking the jury  to make\r\n\ncommon sense conclusions from the evidence.  \r\n\n            The line between the  legitimate argument\r\n            that  a  witness's testimony  is credible\r\n            and improper \"vouching\"  is often a  hazy\r\n            one, to be policed  by the trial court in\r\n            the first instance. .  . . Here, at worst\r\n            the challenged remarks .  . . fell in the\r\n            grey area.  [Defendant] did not object to\r\n            the  remarks  at  trial  when  a curative\r\n            instruction might have been given, and we\r\n            think that is the end of the matter.\r\n\nInnamorati, 996 F.2d at  483 (dismissing challenge to prosecution\r                    \r\n\nstatements that  the testimony  was well corroborated  and \"as  a\r\n\nresult, you know that the witness's testimony is true\").\r\n\n          (9)     There,  is,  however,  no   question  that  the\r\n\nprosecutor improperly  injected himself into the  argument in the\r\n\nnext statement Fern ndez challenges:\r\n\n            And who wrote the statement of facts?  We\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\n            wrote the  statements of facts.   So, the\r\n            big mistake  about Panama.   You know who\r\n            made it?  I made it.  Does that mean that\r\n            they're  not guilty?  Does that mean that\r\n            it  wasn't from  Venezuela  that the  SEA\r\n            SEARCH  came[?]    No, it's  a  mistake I\r\n            made.  So, I should carry it.\r\n\nTr.  at 2576.  The  prosecutor apparently made  this statement in\r\n\ndirect rebuttal  to co-defendant's  counsel,  who highlighted  --\r\n\nliterally  --  a  statement in  De  Jes s'  plea agreement  which\r\n\nindicated that  the  shipload  of  cocaine  with  which  the  co-\r\n\ndefendant  was allegedly  involved  came from  Panama, while  the\r\n\nindictment   maintained  it  was  Venezuela,  without  mentioning\r\n\nPanama.    Given this  context,  the  relative isolation  of  the\r\n\nstatement, and  the judge's instructions  to the jury  that their\r\n\nmemory  of the  testimony  controlled, this  misconduct does  not\r\n\nrequire  a  new trial,  especially in  light  of our  standard of\r\n\nreview.   See Young, 470  U.S. at 11-14  (discussing the \"invited\r                             \r\n\nresponse\" rule).\r\n\n          (10)   We also dismiss Fern ndez'  contention that four\r\n\nstatements made  by the prosecution were  generalizing about drug\r\n\ntraffickers  without   evidentiary  support.     Each  of   these\r\n\nstatements  was to  the effect  of \"that's  the way  drug dealers\r\n\nthink.\"  The  statements were argument, and did not rise to plain\r\n\nerror.  \r\n\n          (11)    Fern ndez  next  challenges   the  prosecutor's\r\n\nreference to  Fern ndez' purported motive  -- greed and  need for\r\n\nmoney -- and  argues that there  was no evidence  in the case  on\r\n\nthis  point.  Nonetheless, the  statement is clearly  proper:  as\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nthe government  notes, it is essentially  a viable interpretation\r\n\nof the evidence.  Indeed,  the prosecutor followed the statements\r\n\nFern ndez now  challenges by pointing  to the testimony  that, at\r\n\nleast initially, Fern ndez received  two hundred dollars for each\r\n\nkilogram of  cocaine transported -- a  clear financial incentive.\r\n\nCf.  United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1285-86 (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1993) (finding  that, where  the prosecutor did  not deliberately\r\n\nmisrepresent defendant's  financial situation, where there  was a\r\n\nfinancial incentive, and where defendant did not object at trial,\r\n\nprosecution  statement that  crime was  motivated by  payment was\r\n\nproper).\r\n\n          (12)   Fern ndez points to two  references to the lease\r\n\napplication  discussed  in section  (2),  above, as  error.   The\r\n\nfirst,  when read  in  context, appears  to  be citing  to  other\r\n\nevidence  to  support the  conclusion  that  Fern ndez sought  to\r\n\nconceal the earlier existence of Carrier:\r\n\n            I  submit  to   [sic]  as  a  fact   that\r\n            [Sanjurjo]  should  have  known  [whether\r\n            Loredo started working after  she started\r\n            working] and  the fact  that she  did not\r\n            want  to answer  to  you should  be proof\r\n            that  Mr.  Loredo  was  in  fact  working\r\n            before   that,  as  he   claimed  on  his\r\n            application.\r\n\nTr.  at 2475.  The prosecutor is offering Sanjurjo's testimony as\r\n\nproof, not the application.  \r\n\n          The prosecution also referred to the application in its\r\n\nrebuttal.\r\n\n            [Defense  Counsel]  tells you  that Jorge\r\n            Loredo was  looking for a  part time  job\r\n            with  Carrier  Transportation   Services.\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\n            Well, look at the  lease agreement.  Look\r\n            at the  cars he list[s]  as his property.\r\n            In 1991  red Ferrari .  . . [and]  a 1990\r\n            Range Rover.  Black  one.

He had  a full\r\n            time job and that was  trafficking drugs,\r\n            trafficking cocaine.  With who?  With his\r\n            partner Juan Fern ndez.\r\n\nTr.  at 2575.    On  balance,  we  do not  find  that  the  lease\r\n\napplication  was  submitted  for  the  proposition  that  Carrier\r\n\nexisted prior to when the defense asserted it began.  Rather, the\r\n\ncited  passage suggests that Loredo  had no need  for a part-time\r\n\njob, but that  he already  had one  with Carrier.   The  evidence\r\n\nindicated  that  in  November,  1991,  the  date  of   the  lease\r\n\nagreement, Carrier had already been incorporated and had leased a\r\n\nwarehouse in New Jersey.  The reference to  Carrier seems to have\r\n\nbeen to the November 1991 status, not Loredo's claim to have held\r\n\na  position  there  for  6  years.7   Even  if  this  reading  is\r\n\nincorrect,  however,  and this  was  an  improper reference,  its\r\n\nadmission was simply not plain error. \r\n\n          (13)   Fern ndez contends  that on three  occasions the\r\n\ngovernment  improperly  alluded  to  the fact  that  he  did  not\r\n\ntestify.   \"A prosecutor's comment  is improper where,  under the\r\n\ncircumstances  of the  case,  'the language  used was  manifestly\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  Indeed, the lease application may have been cited for a reason\r\nwholly  unrelated to the Carrier employment claim:  in it, Loredo\r\nreported that he owned a home in Puerto Rico, which would support\r\nthe prosecution's contention that Loredo's material possessions -\r\n- a house, two expensive cars  -- did not indicate that he needed\r\na second job to make  ends meet.  The prosecution made  no direct\r\nreference to that claim, however.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nintended or was of  such character that the jury  would naturally\r\n\nand  necessarily take it  to be a  comment on the  failure of the\r\n\naccused  to testify.'\"   Hardy,  37 F.3d  at 757  (quoting United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

None of  the statements Fern ndez points to in\r\n\nthis context meet this test.\r\n\n          First, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor referred to Gulf\r\n\nas the  \"other company that we didn't know they had, which at the\r\n\nbeginning they  didn't tell  us about.\"   Tr. at  2580.   Read in\r\n\ncontext,  it  is clear  that the  jury  would not  \"naturally and\r\n\nnecessarily\"  take this  as a  comment on  Fern ndez' failure  to\r\n\ntestify,  because the  prosecutor  is in  fact  referring to  the\r\n\npremise that the evidence introduced about Carrier does not prove\r\n\nanything  about  Gulf.   We  note  that  the  statement does  not\r\n\nindicate that Fern ndez did  not tell the government about  Gulf,\r\n\nrather, that  \"they\" -- the  witnesses --  did not tell  it about\r                             \r\n\nGulf.  Second,  the prosecutor  argued that there  was \"no  other\r\n\nexplanation\"  for the  fact that  three witnesses  had Fern ndez'\r\n\nphone number \"except  that they were involved with him.\"   Tr. at\r\n\n2472.  Third, the prosecution argued against the defense position\r\n\nthat Fern ndez' association with Loredo and Frame was an innocent\r\n\none, positing that knowing three drug traffickers could hardly be\r\n\na coincidence,  and that \"the only  explanation\" presented before\r\n\nthe jury was a criminal association between the men.  \r\n\n          We find that neither statement meets the \"naturally and\r\n\nnecessarily\" criteria.  Although Fern ndez would presumably  have\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nbeen  able to  testify as  to  these things,  so would  the other\r\n\nwitnesses.   \"Where  arguably favorable  evidence other  than the\r\n\ndefendant's  own testimony is available to  him, comment upon his\r\n\nfailure  to produce  it  may be  justified.\"   United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSardelli, 813 F.2d  654, 657  (5th Cir. 1987).   Indeed,  defense\r                  \r\n\ncounsel  argued   in  his  closing  that   the  dissemination  of\r\n\nFern ndez' phone  numbers and his associations with co-defendants\r\n\nwere innocent.   We find no plain error in  the court's allowance\r\n\nof these statements.  See Procopio, slip. op. at 23-25. \r                                            \r\n\n          (14)    Fern ndez  also  contends that  the  government\r\n\nimproperly tried to  shift the  burden of proof  to the  defense.\r\n\nThe  first  cited statement  asked:   \"Why  would the  defense be\r\n\nhiding the fact or they to portray [sic] the fact that Mr. Loredo\r\n\nstarted working for Carrier after 1992, if  he started before[?]\"\r\n\nTr. at 2580.   From the statement's context, it  is apparent that\r\n\nthis  is  a rebuttal  to  defense counsel's  claim  that Loredo's\r\n\nbusiness  card from  Carrier dated  from  1992:   the prosecution\r\n\ncounters  that the  business  card  had  no  date.    The  second\r\n\nstatement cited  pointed out that on  direct examination Sanjurjo\r\n\ntestified that Carrier started in 1992, adding:\r\n\n            But  then   we  had  to  wait  for  cross\r\n            examination by Mr. Pagel to find out that\r\n            there was a previous company before 1992,\r\n            in fact  from 1986 it  had started, which\r\n            did  the exact same type of job . . . and\r\n            Mr.  Juan Fern ndez  was also one  of the\r\n            owners or partners in the corporation.\r\n\n               [Sanjurjo] denied at  that point  that\r\n            the corporation was named Gulf Carrier or\r\n            had Carrier  in its name.   We found that\r\n            out  through another  witness at  a later\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\n            time.\r\n\nTr.  at 2474-75.  These comments are  in keeping with the general\r\n\nstructure  of   the  prosecution's  argument,   discussed  above,\r\n\npointing out who testified what about Carrier and Gulf.  \r\n\n          We find that these statements did not  shift the burden\r\n\nof proof onto the defendant.   On balance, any subtle implication\r\n\nthat the burden of proof had shifted would have been mitigated by\r\n\nthe court's instructions --  as well as those of  the prosecution\r\n\nand  defense --  regarding  the  burden  of  proof.    While  not\r\n\nnecessarily  ideal,  the  cited  statements  did  not  amount  to\r\n\nreversible error under our standard of review.  \r\n\n          (15)   Fern ndez points to four  statements made in the\r\n\ngovernment's rebuttal which are more troubling:\r\n\n            The  second  reason [why  the prosecution\r\n            has an opportunity  for rebuttal] is,  to\r\n            help  you see  through this  smoke screen\r\n            that the defense always tries to raise to\r\n            confuse you.\r\n\nTr. at 2574.\r\n\n            look how desperate [the defense is], look\r\n            at the argument they're  making to try to\r\n            escape what is obvious to everybody.\r\n\nTr. at 2577.\r\n\n            The fact  is, we do have enough evidence.\r\n            The evidence beyond  a reasonable  doubt.\r\n            They're  just  trying  to   confuse  you.\r\n            Don't allow them to be confusing.\r\n\nTr. at 2585.   Finally:\r\n\n               Their  argument,  really  is  that  we\r\n            cannot  use  these drug  traffickers, the\r\n            witnesses  who  were  their  friends  and\r\n            their  associates,  to  convict.   That's\r\n            what  they're saying.   Well,  ladies and\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\n            gentlemen, that is  an important  weapon,\r\n            an important tool  in law enforcement, to\r\n            deprive of  us the ability to  do that is\r\n            [sic]  to  deal   a  hard  blow   to  law\r\n            enforcement. . . .\r\n               . . .\r\n               Now, these criminals, drug traffickers\r\n            in  general, think  that they  commit the\r\n            crime and  nobody  catches them  at  that\r\n            time,  or the  people who  saw them  were\r\n            other drug traffickers that  then they're\r\n            home  free.   But unfortunately,  for all\r\n            these    drug    traffickers,   including\r\n            Mr. Contreras  and  Mr.  Juan  Fern ndez,\r\n            that's not the way  it works.  Because we\r\n            in  the  law  enforcement community,  the\r\n            people  who  you  see sitting  [at]  this\r\n            table, the agents that you saw testifying\r\n            before you, they  didn't give  up.   They\r\n            kept  on  investigating  and they  didn't\r\n            catch them  when  it happened,  but  they\r\n            kept investigating and they kept catching\r\n            other  criminals and  they  were able  to\r\n            build  a case  around them.   Because  we\r\n            have  other means, other methods in which\r\n            to  investigate and  to present  cases to\r\n            you.\r\n\n               And  I  submit  to you  that  this  is\r\n            another way to present  the case.  And it\r\n            also shows beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\n            these  defendants are  guilty.   So, they\r\n            thought  they had gotten  away with their\r\n            crimes  when  they committed  them.   The\r\n            agents  kept, they  didn't give  up, they\r\n            kept investigating.\r\n\n               I ask you now  don't give you up [sic]\r\n            on us now.   They thought they had gotten\r\n            away  with  their crime.   Don't  you let\r\n            them get away with their crime today.\r\n\nTr. at 2590-92.  \r\n\n          We  do  not  doubt that  these  statements  constituted\r\n\nimproper argument.  See, e.g., Boldt, 929 F.2d at 40 (improper to\r                                              \r\n\ncomment  on  \"favorite defense  tactic\"); Hardy,  37 F.3d  at 757\r                                                         \r\n\n(finding  prosecution  argument  that  defendants,  who  did  not\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\ntestify, were \"still running and hiding\" improper).  Thus we turn\r\n\nto  our  four factors.    First,  regarding severity,  while  the\r\n\nmisconduct is  real, it is  not as severe  as some which  we have\r\n\npreviously found  improper.  See, e.g.,  Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n\nat  527  (holding it  improper to  argue,  inter alia,  that \"the\r                                                               \r\n\ndefendants  are not  soldiers  in the  army  of good.   They  are\r\n\nsoldiers in  the army  of evil,  in the army  which only  purpose\r\n\n[sic] is  to poison, to disrupt,  to corrupt\").  In  terms of the\r\n\ncontext, the government argues that these were isolated comments.\r\n\nHowever,  the  fact that  the  prosecutor  made multiple,  albeit\r\n\nbrief, statements  disparaging the role of  the defense convinces\r\n\nus  that they were not isolated comments.  Indeed, the prosecutor\r\n\nended his  rebuttal shortly  after finishing the  last statement,\r\n\nenhancing  its impression  on the  jury.   As for  any corrective\r\n\ninstructions, Fern ndez  did not object to any of the statements.\r\n\nFinally,  we  note  that   the  evidence  against  Fern ndez  was\r\n\nadequate, but not overwhelming.\r\n\n          In the end, although it is a close call, Fern ndez does\r\n\nnot  prevail on  this point.   Because  he made  no objection  at\r\n\ntrial,  Fern ndez \"must  show  that the  improper remarks  likely\r\n\ninfected  the jury  (affected  'substantial  rights'  in  Olano's\r                                                                         \r\n\nwords) and mere  possibilities are not  enough.\"  Procopio,  slip\r                                                                    \r\n\nop.  at 26.   Simply  put, there  was not  much substance  to the\r\n\nstatements:  while they  were improper disparagement of the  role\r\n\nof defense  counsel,  we do  not see  how they  alone could  have\r\n\ncreated \"'circumstances  in which a miscarriage  of justice would\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\notherwise  result.'\"  Young, 470  U.S. at 15  (quoting Frady, 456\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 163 n.14);  see Procopio, slip op. at 28-29 (stating that\r                                          \r\n\nit was \"unrealistic to suggest that . . . empty cliches\" that the\r\n\ndefense arguments were \"illusions\" and \"smoke screens\" would have\r\n\naffected the jury's verdict).\r\n\n                    4.

However, there  is a cost  to that  strategy:\r\n\nmost of  the statements Fern ndez now proffers  as misconduct are\r\n\nreviewed under  the deferential  plain error  standard.   We have\r\n\nfound,  under  that  standard,   that  although  various  of  the\r\n\nstatements  were indeed improper, they did not so poison the well\r\n\nthat a new trial is mandated.  Having reviewed the record and the\r\n\nclosing  arguments, we  find  the  same  is  true  as  for  their\r\n\ncumulative effect.  Only the statements impugning the role of the\r\n\ndefense give us real pause; nonetheless, even considering all the\r\n\npoints where the  prosecution's argument fell below  the mark, we\r\n\ndo not feel that a jury would have been improperly  swayed by the\r\n\nargument.  Nonetheless, we add that we are concerned by the sheer\r\n\nquantity of errors, however minor, in this case.  The prosecution\r\n\nshould  weigh carefully  its words  when it  next  approaches the\r\n\nfloor for  argument. See  id. at 29  (noting that  \"a pattern  of\r                                       \r\n\nfaults does suggest a failure in supervision\").\r\n\n                     E.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b).   The government now  argues on cross-appeal\r\n\nthat the  facts of the case  do not support that  adjustment.  We\r\n\nreview the  district  court's factual  determinations  for  clear\r\n\nerror, granting due deference to the trial court's application of\r\n\nthe guideline  to the facts.   See United States  v. Graciani, 61\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.  1995); United States v. Thompson,  32 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Section 3B1.2(b) offers a reduction to \"any participant\r\n\nwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role\r\n\ncould not be  described as minimal.\"   U.S.S.G.   3B1.2 (comment.\r\n\nn.3).   Of  course, the  mere  fact that  Fern ndez  may be  less\r\n\nculpable  than  others  involved   in  the  conspiracy  does  not\r\n\nautomatically entitle him to  a reduction.  See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDaniel, 962  F.2d 100, 103 (1st Cir. 1992).  \"Role-in-the-offense\r                \r\n\nadjustments depend .  . . not only on the  comparative conduct of\r\n\npersons  jointly  engaged  in  criminal  activity,  but  also  on\r\n\ncomparing  each offender's actions  and relative culpability with\r\n\nthe elements of the offense.\"   United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n330, 333 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          The district court granted  the adjustment on the basis\r\n\nthat Fern ndez' role was \"limited in essence to looking the other\r\n\nway . . . while his company was used to transport the narcotics,\"\r\n\nand  that he \"played a part in  the overall conspiracy that makes\r\n\nhim  less  culpable  than   that  of  the  average  participant.\"\r\n\nSentencing Hearing at  29-30.   The court made  no more  detailed\r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\nfindings.\r\n\n          The  government contends  that  the  evidence does  not\r\n\nsupport  the district court's findings.   It points  out that the\r\n\nevidence indicated that Fern ndez joined the  conspiracy, secured\r\n\na  large  payment from  Sardinas and  Loredo  at the  outset, and\r\n\nreceived   additional  payment  for  the  transportation  of  the\r\n\ncocaine, albeit a payment  smaller than Sardinas'.   According to\r\n\nthe witnesses, he attended meetings, made his employees available\r\n\nto help,  bribed a gatekeeper, and  personally handled shipments.\r\n\nAdditionally,  Frame's  testimony  was  that Fern ndez  acted  as\r\n\nliaison  to  Sardinas  with  respect  to  marijuana  and  cocaine\r\n\nshipments.  All this, topped with the district court's failure to\r\n\nmake   specific  factual   findings,  the   government  contends,\r\n\ndemonstrates  that  the  court  clearly  erred  in  finding  that\r\n\nFern ndez was  entitled to the  minor role adjustment.   Finally,\r\n\nthe  argument concludes, the fact that the court made no specific\r\n\nfindings as  to witness credibility or  Fern ndez' role precludes\r\n\nreliance  on  cases  upholding  a  district  court's  credibility\r\n\ndetermination at sentencing, see, e.g., United States v. Webster,\r                                                                          \r\n\n54 F.3d  1, 5  (1st  Cir. 1995),  or Fern ndez'  argument that  a\r\n\nplausible  view of  the  evidence supports  the district  court's\r\n\nminor role determination.\r\n\n          The  district court's  failure  to find  more than  the\r\n\nbasic  facts at  sentencing lends  a certain awkwardness  to this\r\n\ncase.   Nonetheless, we  disagree with the  government's argument\r\n\nthat  the  evidence presented  at  trial  precludes granting  the\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\nadjustment.  Fern ndez went to meetings, accepted money, and,  if\r\n\nthe witnesses'  testimony is  credible, knew  what was  going on.\r\n\nHowever,  there was no  evidence that he was  in contact with the\r\n\nsuppliers  and  receivers  of   the  cocaine  that  the  Sardinas\r\n\norganization transported,  either  in the  New  York area  or  in\r\n\nMemphis, or  that he  negotiated those  deals  or instructed  the\r\n\nworkers.  Bruno  testified that  Fern ndez attended  a series  of\r\n\nmeetings,  but did not testify that Fern ndez ran those meetings,\r\n\ntold Bruno what  to do, or  otherwise served as the  organizer of\r\n\nthe  conspiracy.     While  we  do  not   think  that  Fern ndez'\r\n\nentitlement to the downward adjustment was a foregone conclusion,\r\n\nwe cannot, on  this record, find that it was  plain error for the\r\n\nlower court to apply it.  The district court found that Fern ndez\r\n\nestablished   that  he   was  less   culpable  than   most  other\r\n\nparticipants  in  the  conspiracy, and  so  was  entitled  to the\r\n\nadjustment.   \"In this instance, it would be foolhardy to second-\r\n\nguess the sentencing judge, given his superior coign of vantage.\"\r\n\nOcasio, 914 F.2d at 333.\r                \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.\r                                                      affirm\r                                                            \r\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n",

Fernandez now raises a series of challenges to his conviction, and the government cross-appeals his sentence.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a basic outline of the case, and address the particulars in more detail as they arise, as the specific issues Fernandez raises require that we examine the facts from differing perspectives.  Fernandez was one of 20 co-defendants charged in Count One of a September 1993 superseding indictment of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine and more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846.  Count One alleged 56 overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy (the \"Sardinas operation\"), beginning in 1981 and continuing over twelve years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central allegation regarding Fernandez was that in or about the month of April 1991, he entered into an association with co-defendants Jorge Loredo-Alonso (\"Loredo\") and Horacio Sardinas-Albo (\"Sardinas\") to use Carrier Transportation Company (\"Carrier\"), a transportation company which Fernandez owned, to ship loads of cocaine from Puerto Rico to the continental United States.  The indictment alleged that some nine loads of cocaine had been shipped through Carrier by early 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez was tried with co-defendant Antonio Contreras.  The evidence against Fernandez at the jury trial was primarily made up of the testimony of four alleged co-conspirators:  Jose Bruno (\"Bruno\"), Elmo De Jesus (\"De Jesus\"), Michael Frame (\"Frame\"), and Lambert Aloisi (\"Aloisi\").  Bruno testified that nine loads of cocaine were shipped through Carrier, the first seven between April and August of 1991, and that he visited Carrier's warehouse in New Jersey several times in connection with those loads.  Fernandez' counsel offered evidence indicating that Carrier did not in fact exist in April 1991, but rather was incorporated in August 1991, and began its occupation of the warehouse Bruno identified in October of that year.  The prosecution in turn questioned defense witnesses about Gulf Transportation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (\"Gulf\");  according to the testimony, Gulf was a shipping company at which Fernandez had worked before he owned Carrier.  In its closing argument, the government argued that Fernandez had used Gulf to transport cocaine prior to using Carrier.  Fernandez was found guilty and was sentenced to 151 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez argues on appeal that there was a material variance between the superseding indictment and the evidence on which the government relied at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We find a variance \"when the proof differs from the allegations in the indictment.\"   United States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.1993).  Not every variance mandates a new trial:  reversal is only required if the variance proves both material and prejudicial.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a);   United States v. Arcadipane, 41 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, where, as here, \"the government charges a defendant with a crime ... but the facts proven at trial vary somewhat from those charged in the indictment ... it is settled law that a conviction for the crime charged will be affirmed unless the variance as to the facts is shown to have prejudiced the defendant.\"   United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1304 (1st Cir.1993).  Our review of whether a retrial is required is plenary.   Arcadipane, 41 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The superseding indictment specifically stated that Fernandez used Carrier to transport cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government's case was consistent with this theory.  Thus, Fernandez maintains, while Carrier was neither a defendant nor an object of the indictment, it was nonetheless a key part of the government's case.  However, Fernandez continues, when he offered evidence in his defense which refuted the charges concerning Carrier by proving that it could not have been used as alleged in the superseding indictment, the government abruptly switched gears and argued that Fernandez used Gulf.  The prejudice against him, Fernandez contends, was obvious:  his trial preparations, which had centered around Carrier, were no longer adequate, since Gulf became the focus of the trial and the jury's deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find such \"obvious\" prejudice;  nor do we agree that Gulf became the focus of the trial and deliberations.  We recognize that there was a variance, but do not believe it \"work[ed] a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep.\"   Arcadipane, 41 F.3d at 6. Simply put, although Carrier was repeatedly mentioned in the indictment, the charge was against Fernandez, not his company.  Regardless of whether Carrier or Gulf is discussed, the charge is the same:  that Fernandez associated with Sardinas and Loredo to transport cocaine.  Fernandez cannot now claim that he was misinformed of the charges against him, or that his substantial rights were somehow affected.  See id. at 7.  A new trial is not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Admission of the Evidence</p>\n    <p>1. Gulf</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez contends that the district court erred in allowing evidence and argument regarding Gulf.  We review a lower court's admission of evidence for abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., United States v. Disanto, 1996 WL 312368, * 11 (1st Cir.1996);   United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 997 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Testimony regarding Gulf was elicited by the government, over Fernandez' objection, during its cross-examination of defense witness Rosa Sanjurjo, an employee in Carrier's collection department.  She stated that she began working for Carrier in January of 1992, prior to which she worked for Gulf until 1990.  She acknowledged that Fernandez had also worked for Gulf, that it did the same type of business as Carrier, and that it closed before Carrier was created.  She also stated that Gulf did not become Carrier.  On redirect, Fernandez' counsel elicited her testimony that Gulf was a corporation controlled by Fernandez and two other individuals, including Sanjurjo's stepson.  She stated on recross that Carrier and Gulf had different offices and used different warehouses.  George Wyle, a salesman for Carrier for part of 1992, testified on cross that he knew Fernandez through the shipping business prior to 1992, that Fernandez was involved with Gulf, that Gulf did essentially the same kind of business that Carrier did, and that Gulf's full name was Gulf Carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first few questions to Sanjurjo about Gulf, defense counsel objected to the cross-examination on Gulf as being outside the scope of examination;  the court allowed the prosecution to continue, but asking questions on direct, instead of on cross.  After a few more questions, defense counsel asked for a sidebar, and objected that the questioning was outside the scope of the testimony and the entire case.  The prosecutor argued that the evidence was being used for impeachment, pointing out that since Fernandez was arguing that it was impossible that Carrier could have been used, the evidence on Gulf would show that even before Carrier started Fernandez was in the same line of business, at a company which operated in essentially the same fashion, offering Fernandez access to shipping services, albeit under a different name.  The court denied Fernandez' objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before closing arguments, Fernandez' counsel raised the issue of whether the government should be allowed to make reference to Gulf in its closing argument.  Defense counsel protested that the government was trying to make an inference not based on the evidence, since there was no evidence regarding whether Gulf and Carrier had a similar identity, or when Fernandez was involved with Gulf.  Indeed, counsel noted, the testimony indicated no continuity of ownership between the companies, and that they used different facilities.  The court, however, rejected the defense's argument and allowed the government to discuss Gulf in its closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez now argues that the district court erred in allowing evidence and argument regarding Gulf.  He does not specify his reasons, however.  Rather, he simply refers us to the reasons stated in his additional arguments, leaving us to speculate as to which reasons would apply in this context, and running the risk of waiver.  As we address those contentions where they are made, we add only a few comments here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Briefly stated, while it could have decided the issue several different ways, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in choosing to allow the government to elicit and use the evidence regarding Gulf.  While not detailed, the evidence was certainly relevant, for the very reasons the government outlined.  See Fed.R.Evid. 401;   United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 101-02 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844 (1987) (noting the broad discretion district courts enjoy in determining relevance).  Allowing the line of questioning and argument was neither unfairly prejudicial, see Fed.R.Evid. 403, nor constituted an unfair surprise:  Fernandez' defense was that it was impossible for him to have used Carrier to ship cocaine because Carrier was not in operation--a line of reasoning fairly inviting the question of what other companies Fernandez had access to during the relevant time period, and whether he could have used them in a similar manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Sixth Amendment Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez contends that his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation has been violated, in that he did not have a full and effective opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.   See Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 231 (1988) (per curiam) (noting that the right of confrontation \"includes the right to conduct reasonable cross-examination\").  As we find no error on the part of the district court, we need not enter into a harmless error analysis.  See id. at 232;   Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680-81 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Bruno and two other witnesses testified that a Puerto Rico senator was implicated in the conspiracy:  they alleged that in 1990, when other members of the conspiracy were arrested in Tortola, the senator attempted to gain their release.  Bruno testified that the senator received close to two hundred fifty thousand dollars in order to bribe the magistrate handling the case in the British Virgin Islands, as well as other individuals.  Another witness testified that he believed the senator had met with representatives of the Sardinas operation in the Puerto Rico Senate--the witness claimed that he waited in the car outside while they met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court ruled in limine that counsel could not mention the senator's name.  Fernandez argues that this constituted error requiring a new trial.  First, he contends that identification of the senator's name could have \"tipped the balance\" in the impeachment of Bruno by showing that he would go to any lengths to obstruct justice, and thus should not be believed in his testimony at trial.  Second, he posits that identification could have led the jury to believe that the account of the senator's involvement in the Tortola events was fabricated by witnesses in order to gain leniency from the government, because of the prominence and importance of the particular senator.  Thus, the argument goes, the identification would have added to the evidence that the witnesses were fabricating stories in a desperate attempt to obtain leniency.  Finally, Fernandez maintains that members of the jury could have felt that the failure to prosecute the senator was unfair selective prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find any of these arguments convincing.  There can be no question that the Sixth Amendment entails a right to cross examine a witness;  nonetheless, \"trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination [regarding potential bias] based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\"   Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679;   see Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20 (1985) (per curiam) (\"Generally speaking, the Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\").  The court informed the jury that it had ruled that the name of the senator \"would not be mentioned in order to protect an ongoing investigation with respect to activities that he may have been engaged in.\"   Tr. at 515.  The jury was also informed that the parties stipulated that the senator was \"prominent.\"   Further, as noted above, the scope of the senator's alleged actions was explored through testimony from several witnesses:  the sole element the court ordered be left out was the senator's name.  Certainly the jury had enough information in front of it to be able to weigh the impeachment value of the alleged plot:  it had \"the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\"   Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318 (1974).  As for the selective prosecution claim, we note that the court told the jury there was an ongoing investigation:  the implication that the senator had not been charged is clear.  We do not find any error in the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second claim focuses on the De Jesus cross-examination.  He testified that he assisted in the transportation of more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, yet his plea agreement stated that he was responsible for only 3.5 to 5 kilograms.  The prosecution objected to defense's questioning on this discrepancy, and the court sustained the objection.  The court ruled that the defense could not cross-examine De Jesus regarding the quantity of cocaine for which he was held accountable in his plea agreement, but could question him on the difference the agreement made in his sentence.  De Jesus duly testified that without the plea he faced from thirty years to life, and that with it, he was facing seven years.  He agreed that by testifying in this case, he was hoping to have the sentence further reduced so as to not have to spend any time in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez argues that the court erred, since any proof of false, self-serving statements by a government witness--such as the plea agreement figure--would aid the defense in showing the witnesses' untrustworthiness.  Thus, Fernandez contends, his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated.   See Olden, 488 U.S. at 231.   We disagree.  First, defense counsel was able to impeach De Jesus through eliciting his testimony on the impact the plea agreement had on his sentence and his hopes for a reduced sentence based on his participation in this trial.  Second, the court's ruling seems to have been based on the concern that the jury understand that De Jesus was not actually lying in his plea agreement, but rather that the figure used was a mechanism of convenience in order to get to a specific sentence:  \"I think the whole concept is to show ... [that it was a] deal, a wow deal, but not to show that he's a liar because that's not the real facts.\"   Tr. at 1879.  We do not find that the district court erred in striking a balance between this concern and the importance of impeachment through limiting the testimony to the sentence obtained.  Indeed, we agree with the court's comment to the effect that to do otherwise would run the risk of having defense counsel impeach the government, not De Jesus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez' reliance on  United States v. Lynn, 856 F.2d 430 (1st Cir.1988), is misplaced.  There, we found that the trial court erred in restricting cross-examination into the circumstances underlying a witness' plea bargain.  The witness' agreement with the government required that he take and \"successfully complete\" a polygraph examination.  He took the test, twice, and the examiner labeled some of his answers as \"inconclusive.\"   The defense sought to impeach the witness by implying that the witness had not \"successfully completed\" the test, and so had motive to lie on the stand to please the government.  The court cut off all questioning about the test, and informed the jury that such tests yielded inherently unreliable results.   Id. at 432.  We held that the district court abused its discretion by cutting off all cross-examination into a \"relevant and not fully explored area.\"   Id. at 434.  The same is not true here.  The district court did not cut off all examination in the area of De Jesus' credibility:  rather, it set limits on the examination so as to permit the introduction of the information in a manner which would not mislead the jury yet provide it \"with 'sufficient information concerning formative events to make a \"discriminating appraisal\" of [De Jesus'] motives and bias.' \"   Id. at 433 ( quoting United States v. Twomey, 806 F.2d 1136, 1140 (1st Cir.1986) ( quoting United States v. Campbell, 426 F.2d 547, 550 (2d Cir.1970))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>C. The Sufficiency and Weight of the Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the presentation of evidence, Fernandez moved for a judgment of acquittal, which motion the trial court denied.  Fernandez now argues anew that the evidence was insufficient to support his conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are cognizant of the government's burden in this case:  \"In order to win a conspiracy conviction the government was required to establish, by direct or circumstantial evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant and one or more coconspirators 'intended to agree and ... to commit the substantive criminal offense which was the object of their unlawful agreement.' \"   United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 39 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 977 (1991)).  In our review, we evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole, and \"resolve credibility issues and draw inferences in the government's favor, since the issue is whether a jury could reasonably have arrived at the verdict.\"   United States v. Morrow, 39 F.3d 1228, 1233 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1421 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez contends that the evidence in this case was insufficient to prove his guilt, since there was no direct testimony of any agreement.  However, the government need not prove a formal agreement existed:  as it points out, \"the illegal agreement may be either 'express or tacit.' \"   United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.1990).  Indeed, \" '[t]he evidence may be entirely circumstantial and need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence;  that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.' \"   Lopez, 944 F.2d at 39 (quoting  United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that, under our standard of review, Bruno's testimony, and that of other government witnesses, suffices to show that a tacit agreement existed.  Bruno testified that Sardinas and Loredo each paid $80,000 to buy into Carrier in order to ship cocaine;  he stated that he saw them collect the money to make a payment to Fernandez, and heard them discussing the use of Carrier.  Bruno testified about sending the nine shipments of cocaine, and about Fernandez' personal participation in the operation, including telephone calls and meetings.  He stated that he went to the Carrier warehouse in New Jersey, his first visit being in July 1991, and that Fernandez was there on at least one occasion.  Aloisi's testimony generally corroborated Bruno's statements.  De Jesus testified that he participated in at least four shipments of cocaine, including deliveries of cocaine to Fernandez at a warehouse in Carolina, Puerto Rico, and retrieval from the New Jersey warehouse.  His testimony contradicted Bruno's on several points, regarding the amount of cocaine in particular loads and who participated in specific meetings and loads.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Our review of this record leads us to conclude that, \"having heard the evidence, including nuances and intimations that a cold record cannot capture, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that [Fernandez] was guilty of conspiracy.\"   Moran, 984 F.2d at 1301-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez also argues that this court must reverse the verdict below because it was physically impossible that Carrier was the company used to transport cocaine in 1991:  he presented evidence that Carrier did not exist until after April 1991, and that it did not occupy the New Jersey warehouse until October of that year.  Since the chief government witnesses testified that Carrier was used, the argument continues, there is no reason to credit the witnesses' testimony as to this point, or any other.  Thus, Fernandez concludes that the trial court erred in not granting his motion for acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there were inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony, and while they all had an incentive to please the government, these aspects of the evidence were pointed out to the jury by defense counsel.  As the government notes, Bruno and De Jesus did not go to any warehouse for the first loads--indeed, Bruno testified that Carrier had previously had a different address--and the evidence regarding Gulf suggests that Fernandez had knowledge of and access to shipping facilities during the relevant time frame.  It was within the province of the jury to disregard some of the inconsistencies and to accept aspects of the witnesses' testimony as credible.  \"The force of the evidence as a whole, including all reasonable inferences favorable to the verdict, was sufficient to support a rational jury finding:  that defendant was guilty.\"   Lopez, 944 F.2d at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Weight of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez also contends that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.  Fernandez argues that the government's case here was wholly circumstantial and rested solely on the testimony of blatantly untrustworthy witnesses, as demonstrated by the many contradictions between their stories and Fernandez' evidence that Carrier had not occupied a warehouse until October 1991.  The evidence regarding Gulf, he continues, is insufficient to support the eleventh-hour claim that Fernandez used it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review for abuse of discretion,  see, e.g., United States v. Rogers, 41 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2287 (1995), and reject Fernandez' argument.  The evidence against Fernandez, briefly outlined above, was neither unbelievable nor implausible, as he contends.  Simply put, the witnesses' testimony was not \"so inherently implausible that it could not be believed by a reasonable juror.\"   United States v. Garcia, 978 F.2d 746, 748 (1st Cir.1992) (per curiam ).  We accordingly find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fernandez' motion for a new trial, and refuse to take the issue of the witnesses' credibility out of the jury's hands.  The jurors were entitled to weigh the witnesses' contradictions and incentives and still accept the substance of their testimony.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <p>1. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez' primary argument is that the prosecutor violated his due process rights by making improper statements to the jury during the government's closing argument and rebuttal.   See Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88-89 (1935).  He contends that any one of the statements he now points to as improper could have prejudiced the jury so as to have prevented a fair trial, and that the cumulative effect of the statements was to deny him a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment.

Statements Objected to at Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) During trial, a lease application filled out by Loredo in November, 1991, which stated that he had worked for Carrier for six years--well before the time the defense argued Carrier began to exist--was admitted for the limited purpose of showing that Loredo claimed he worked for Carrier, not for the truth of the matters in the document.  Fernandez now contends that the prosecutor went beyond that limited purpose in his closing argument.  Referring to the application, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>You remember, as you look at it here, there is a part ... where he's supposed to or he has to list his employer.

Six years.  The phone numbers are right.  The address is right.  Working for the company, he says, for six years.

Thus, we turn to our four-factor test.  We note that the misconduct, though disingenuous, was not severe, and occurred only once, in relative isolation.  More importantly, the court gave immediate curative instructions, admonishing the jury that the lease did not come in as anything more than a claim by Loredo to have worked for Carrier, and reminding them of its earlier instruction, made when the lease application was entered.  Indeed, in its closing, the defense also reminded the jury of the limited use of the lease.  On balance, we find that \"the curative instruction sufficed to dispel any prejudice from the improper comment.\"   United States v. Boldt, 929 F.2d 35, 41 (1st Cir.1991);   see United States v.

It had--it was a shipping company that did transportation in the same manner, through the containers and Mr. Juan Fernandez was also one of the owners or partners in the operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2475.  Like Fernandez, we can find no evidence in the record stating that Gulf began in 1986.  The offer of this fact is harmless, however, since the pertinent time period is 1991, and Sanjurjo testified that Gulf was in operation in 1990.  The reference leaves open the crucial question, which is, when Gulf ceased operation.  As for the form in which the prosecutor made his statement, it is consistent with the framework the government used for its argument, discussed in (1), above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez objects to the cited passage and four others for asserting that Carrier and Gulf were essentially the same thing, doing the exact same job:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>[O]ur argument is that before, when the company was operating as Gulf Carrier Transportation he used another warehouse in New Jersey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

These statements, he contends, urged the jury to speculate in a manner unsupported and contradicted by the actual evidence regarding Gulf.  There was evidence that they were both transportation companies, but not that they did the exact same job.  Indeed, the owners were not the same:  Fernandez was part owner of Gulf, and the sole owner of Carrier.  Finally, there was no evidence that Gulf was actually in business in 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, we cannot find that this line of argument so poisoned the trial well that a new trial is required.   See Manning, 23 F.3d at 574.   The government made an argument based on the limited evidence regarding Gulf.  The defense was able to argue the counter position, pointing out the lack of evidence, and did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Statements Not Objected to at Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine the statements which Fernandez did not object to at trial in the order in which he raised them.  We find that most are not improper;  of the few that are, none of them prove so serious that the district court plainly erred in allowing them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Fernandez first argues that the prosecutor erred by trying to \"secure the empathy of the jury\" through asking it to step into the government's shoes and align itself with the prosecution team through statements like the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>Now, the way I would like to discuss the evidence with you is in the order that we received it.  Okay. The way we were interviewing these witnesses, in that order, to give you a feel for what we went through as you determine whether we have proven, as we submit to you we have, beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the conspiracy and their participation....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2443.  The prosecutor made a series of comments such as \"[w]e seek [co-conspirators or drug traffickers] out and we go out and corroborate them.\"   Tr. at 2442.  We agree with the government, however, that, read in context, the statements Fernandez points to were simply establishing a framework for the presentation of the government's argument.  They also served to point out that even though the government's witnesses were drug traffickers with a motive to fabricate evidence--as defense counsel had emphasized in opening argument--their testimony was corroborated.  Indeed, in the first passage quoted above, the prosecution reminded the jury that it carried the duty of determining whether the government proved its case.  While we do not necessarily recommend this framework for argument as an ideal one, we do not find that the statements were improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Fernandez' second argument is that the prosecutor misstated the law on proof of conspiracy in making the following statements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>the only way we can prove a conspiracy is through the testimony of the very co-conspirators who were members of that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>you're always going to need the testimony of the co-conspirator to prove a conspiracy because of the secrecy of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2442.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You're never going to find a decent person testifying to a drug deal.

Contrary to appellant's assertion, these are arguments, not statements of fact, and are thus permissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if they were improper, they would not require a new trial.  For, viewed in context, it is clear that they did not poison the trial proceeding.  In his opening statement, Fernandez' counsel had emphasized the fact that no actual drugs were offered in evidence:  the challenged comments were apparently designed to counter those statements with an explanation of why the government relied so heavily on witness testimony.  The first two statements are addressed to the practical difficulties of proving a conspiracy.  The prosecutor followed the first with an explanation of why the government did not introduce any actual drugs.  Further, the prosecutor followed up these comments with a discussion of the importance of documentary evidence in corroborating witnesses' testimony, belying his own comments.  As for the \"decent person\" comment, its logical flaws are obvious.  Moreover, defense counsel had emphasized the witnesses' dishonesty in his opening,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to which this is apparently a response.  These statements do not warrant a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The prosecutor made two statements to the jury to the effect that \"[t]o acquit, you would have to find that everybody was lying in this case.\"   Tr. at 2590-91.  Fernandez argues, and the government seems to agree, that these were improper.  To the contrary, we feel they amounted to nothing more than argument, and were not improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Fernandez' fourth contention is that the prosecutor made statements without evidentiary support.   See Santana-Camacho, 833 F.2d at 373 (reversing conviction on basis of major and prejudicial misstatement of evidence in closing argument).  The prosecutor erroneously stated that the testifying drug traffickers were \"either in jail or go to [sic] jail,\" Tr. at 2442, and that Bruno specifically would be going to jail when, in fact, Aloisi had a non-prosecution agreement, and Bruno was not incarcerated at the time of trial.  Again, the government acknowledges that the statements were not factually true.  We agree with the government, however, that any error in admitting these statements does not rise to the level of plain error.  The agreements between the government and the witnesses were in evidence, each of the four witnesses against Fernandez testified about his agreement with the government, defense counsel reminded the jury of their agreements in his closing argument, and the judge instructed the jurors that counsel's argument did not constitute evidence, but that their recollection of the facts controlled.   Cf. United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 482 (1st Cir.)  (finding no clear error where prosecution stated \"that the trial judge alone would determine the sentences for each of the cooperating witnesses, and that the jury therefore should not think that the witnesses were getting 'a walk' \" where, in fact, the government had dismissed charges against many of the witnesses and had promised to make motions for downward departures),  cert. denied sub nom.  DeMarco v. United States, 510 U.S. 955 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Fernandez points out that the government made a second misstatement of the evidence by arguing that the payment which the two lead conspirators were alleged to have given Fernandez in order to buy into Carrier was \"not an over the counter deal\" but rather \"a criminal association.  It [was] a paper bag with eighty thousand dollars.\"   Tr. at 2575.  The government acknowledges that the paper bag details pertain to a different transaction, not involving Fernandez.  The misstatement is troublesome in its characterization of the transaction, the details of which were not in evidence.  However, between the brevity and isolation of the misstatement, the court's later instruction to the jury that their memory controlled, and defense counsel's failure to make a timely objection, Fernandez cannot clear the plain error hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) Next, Fernandez alleges that in his rebuttal argument the prosecutor provided information to contradict the testimony of a witness at trial.  Without specifying what that information is, he cites the following passage discussing the testimony of Enrique Nieves (\"Nieves\"), Special Agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the other thing with Mr. Nieves.  He said that there was a search warrant served on or about the time Mr. Fernandez was indicted.  And that's false.  You recall the testimony, that was the search warrant was at an unrelated warehouse of Mr. Velasco before we had any knowledge of the fact that they were using Carrier Transportation at the time of the first indictment.  That's when that search warrant was served and that's when we were going after Mr. Velasco who was in the first indictment.  So the fact that that search warrant was served and nothing was found, we were not after Mr. Juan Fernandez's business at the time because we didn't know about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2578.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Examination of the record sheds some light on the passage.  First, the depiction of Nieves' testimony is correct:  the warrant was for an unrelated warehouse, prior to any suspicion that the warehouse Carrier used was involved, and was served following the first indictment, which did not name Fernandez.  Second, the \"he\" of \"he said that there was a search warrant served\" seems to refer not to Nieves, but to Fernandez' counsel.  The latter had stated in his closing that Nieves testified that in September 1993--the time of the first indictment--he had testified at a bond hearing that a specific warehouse used by Carrier was not involved with the Sardinas operation.  Defense counsel also referred to the search warrant for a different warehouse.  It would seem that the prosecution blurred the line between the reference to the bond hearing and the search warrant and attributed the date given for the first to the second.  While perhaps an error, it does not constitute the presentation of information to contradict the testimony of a witness at trial.  Since Fernandez did not see fit to actually specify what element of the passage presented new information, and we see none ourselves, we find no plain error on the part of the district court in allowing the statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) The prosecutor's statement that \"[t]hey could be doing additional loads besides the ones that Mr. Bruno was aware,\" Tr. at 2465-66, was not improper speculation, since it was made in the context of the prosecutor noting that De Jesus' testimony was that Bruno was not always involved in the transportation of loads of cocaine, and so the government was not always sure what number a load was:  \"they probably skipped the fifth and this is the sixth load, or it could be a totally different load.  We don't know.\"   Tr. at 2465.  Even if the statement could be construed as improper speculation, Fernandez again fails to clear the hurdle of the four factors and prove that there was plain error on the part of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(8) Similarly, Fernandez contends that the prosecutor improperly generalized about his experiences in stating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>even on some minor details there is a lot of corroboration in this case, which is unusual.  You will usually have little corroboration in that aspect, but even on details, as I go through the evidence I'll mention them, there is corroboration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2444.   See United States v. Rosa, 705 F.2d 1375, 1379 (1st Cir.1983) (\"It is settled law in this circuit that a prosecutor may not inject into his jury argument his personal opinions about conclusions to be drawn from the evidence.\").  The prosecutor made this statement in the context of encouraging the jury to recognize that the presence of some inconsistencies in witness testimony does not preclude granting them credence.  This statement falls somewhere on the spectrum between proper and improper argument.  However, even assuming it was improper, we cannot find that it is so severe as to warrant a mistrial.  In truth, the prosecutor was telling the jury what it probably already knows:  that there will likely be differences in the stories told by two people recounting an event that occurred years earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez makes the similar contention that the prosecution twice vouched for the credibility of prosecution witnesses by telling the jury that the witnesses were telling the truth because they did not get together to concoct a totally consistent story;  the fact that their story was not totally consistent, the prosecution argued, reveals that \"the only other alternative is that ... they were telling the truth and that the impeachment that they have been able to make to you is, I submit, as to details.\"   Tr. at 2591.  We agree with the government that these remarks amount to asking the jury to make common sense conclusions from the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>The line between the legitimate argument that a witness's testimony is credible and improper \"vouching\" is often a hazy one, to be policed by the trial court in the first instance....

The prosecutor apparently made this statement in direct rebuttal to co-defendant's counsel, who highlighted--literally--a statement in De Jesus' plea agreement which indicated that the shipload of cocaine with which the co-defendant was allegedly involved came from Panama, while the indictment maintained it was Venezuela, without mentioning Panama.  Given this context, the relative isolation of the statement, and the judge's instructions to the jury that their memory of the testimony controlled, this misconduct does not require a new trial, especially in light of our standard of review.   See Young, 470 U.S. at 11-14 (discussing the \"invited response\" rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(10) We also dismiss Fernandez' contention that four statements made by the prosecution were generalizing about drug traffickers without evidentiary support.

Nonetheless, the statement is clearly proper:  as the government notes, it is essentially a viable interpretation of the evidence.  Indeed, the prosecutor followed the statements Fernandez now challenges by pointing to the testimony that, at least initially, Fernandez received two hundred dollars for each kilogram of cocaine transported--a clear financial incentive.   Cf. United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1285-86 (1st Cir.1993) (finding that, where the prosecutor did not deliberately misrepresent defendant's financial situation, where there was a financial incentive, and where defendant did not object at trial, prosecution statement that crime was motivated by payment was proper).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(12) Fernandez points to two references to the lease application discussed in section (2), above, as error.

The prosecutor is offering Sanjurjo's testimony as proof, not the application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution also referred to the application in its rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>[Defense Counsel] tells you that Jorge Loredo was looking for a part time job with Carrier Transportation Services.  Well, look at the lease agreement.  Look at the cars he list[s] as his property.  In 1991 red Ferrari ... [and] a 1990 Range Rover.  Black one.  Is that a car of somebody who needs a second job to make ends meet [?] No, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, he wasn't looking for any part time job.  He had a full time job and that was trafficking drugs, trafficking cocaine.  With who?   With his partner Juan Fernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2575.  On balance, we do not find that the lease application was submitted for the proposition that Carrier existed prior to when the defense asserted it began.  Rather, the cited passage suggests that Loredo had no need for a part-time job, but that he already had one with Carrier.  The evidence indicated that in November, 1991, the date of the lease agreement, Carrier had already been incorporated and had leased a warehouse in New Jersey.  The reference to Carrier seems to have been to the November 1991 status, not Loredo's claim to have held a position there for 6 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Even if this reading is incorrect, however, and this was an improper reference, its admission was simply not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(13) Fernandez contends that on three occasions the government improperly alluded to the fact that he did not testify.  \"A prosecutor's comment is improper where, under the circumstances of the case, 'the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.' \"   Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757 (quoting  United States v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 929 (1987)).  None of the statements Fernandez points to in this context meet this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor referred to Gulf as the \"other company that we didn't know they had, which at the beginning they didn't tell us about.\"   Tr. at 2580.  Read in context, it is clear that the jury would not \"naturally and necessarily\" take this as a comment on Fernandez' failure to testify, because the prosecutor is in fact referring to the premise that the evidence introduced about Carrier does not prove anything about Gulf.  We note that the statement does not indicate that Fernandez did not tell the government about Gulf, rather, that \"they \"--the witnesses--did not tell it about Gulf.  Second, the prosecutor argued that there was \"no other explanation\" for the fact that three witnesses had Fernandez' phone number \"except that they were involved with him.\"   Tr. at 2472.  Third, the prosecution argued against the defense position that Fernandez' association with Loredo and Frame was an innocent one, positing that knowing three drug traffickers could hardly be a coincidence, and that \"the only explanation\" presented before the jury was a criminal association between the men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that neither statement meets the \"naturally and necessarily\" criteria.  Although Fernandez would presumably have been able to testify as to these things, so would the other witnesses.  \"Where arguably favorable evidence other than the defendant's own testimony is available to him, comment upon his failure to produce it may be justified.\"   United States v. Sardelli, 813 F.2d 654, 657 (5th Cir.1987).  Indeed, defense counsel argued in his closing that the dissemination of Fernandez' phone numbers and his associations with co-defendants were innocent.  We find no plain error in the court's allowance of these statements.  See Procopio, slip. op. at 23-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(14) Fernandez also contends that the government improperly tried to shift the burden of proof to the defense.  The first cited statement asked:  \"Why would the defense be hiding the fact or they to portray [sic] the fact that Mr. Loredo started working for Carrier after 1992, if he started before[?]\"  Tr. at 2580.  From the statement's context, it is apparent that this is a rebuttal to defense counsel's claim that Loredo's business card from Carrier dated from 1992:  the prosecution counters that the business card had no date.  The second statement cited pointed out that on direct examination Sanjurjo testified that Carrier started in 1992, adding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>But then we had to wait for cross examination by Mr. Pagel to find out that there was a previous company before 1992, in fact from 1986 it had started, which did the exact same type of job ... and Mr. Juan Fernandez was also one of the owners or partners in the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Sanjurjo] denied at that point that the corporation was named Gulf Carrier or had Carrier in its name.  We found that out through another witness at a later time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2474-75.  These comments are in keeping with the general structure of the prosecution's argument, discussed above, pointing out who testified what about Carrier and Gulf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that these statements did not shift the burden of proof onto the defendant.  On balance, any subtle implication that the burden of proof had shifted would have been mitigated by the court's instructions--as well as those of the prosecution and defense--regarding the burden of proof.  While not necessarily ideal, the cited statements did not amount to reversible error under our standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(15) Fernandez points to four statements made in the government's rebuttal which are more troubling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p>The second reason [why the prosecution has an opportunity for rebuttal] is, to help you see through this smoke screen that the defense always tries to raise to confuse you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2574.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>look how desperate [the defense is], look at the argument they're making to try to escape what is obvious to everybody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>The fact is, we do have enough evidence.  The evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  They're just trying to confuse you.  Don't allow them to be confusing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2585.  Finally:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their argument, really is that we cannot use these drug traffickers, the witnesses who were their friends and their associates, to convict.  That's what they're saying.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is an important weapon, an important tool in law enforcement, to deprive of us the ability to do that is [sic] to deal a hard blow to law enforcement....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, these criminals, drug traffickers in general, think that they commit the crime and nobody catches them at that time, or the people who saw them were other drug traffickers that then they're home free.  But unfortunately, for all these drug traffickers, including Mr. Contreras and Mr. Juan Fernandez, that's not the way it works.  Because we in the law enforcement community, the people who you see sitting [at] this table, the agents that you saw testifying before you, they didn't give up.  They kept on investigating and they didn't catch them when it happened, but they kept investigating and they kept catching other criminals and they were able to build a case around them.  Because we have other means, other methods in which to investigate and to present cases to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I submit to you that this is another way to present the case.  And it also shows beyond a reasonable doubt that these defendants are guilty.  So, they thought they had gotten away with their crimes when they committed them.  The agents kept, they didn't give up, they kept investigating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I ask you now don't give you up [sic] on us now.  They thought they had gotten away with their crime.  Don't you let them get away with their crime today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2590-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not doubt that these statements constituted improper argument.   See, e.g., Boldt, 929 F.2d at 40 (improper to comment on \"favorite defense tactic\");   Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757 (finding prosecution argument that defendants, who did not testify, were \"still running and hiding\" improper).  Thus we turn to our four factors.  First, regarding severity, while the misconduct is real, it is not as severe as some which we have previously found improper.   See, e.g., Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 527 (holding it improper to argue, inter alia, that \"the defendants are not soldiers in the army of good.  They are soldiers in the army of evil, in the army which only purpose [sic] is to poison, to disrupt, to corrupt\").  In terms of the context, the government argues that these were isolated comments.  However, the fact that the prosecutor made multiple, albeit brief, statements disparaging the role of the defense convinces us that they were not isolated comments.  Indeed, the prosecutor ended his rebuttal shortly after finishing the last statement, enhancing its impression on the jury.  As for any corrective instructions, Fernandez did not object to any of the statements.  Finally, we note that the evidence against Fernandez was adequate, but not overwhelming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, although it is a close call, Fernandez does not prevail on this point.  Because he made no objection at trial, Fernandez \"must show that the improper remarks likely infected the jury (affected 'substantial rights' in Olano 's words) and mere possibilities are not enough.\"   Procopio, slip op. at 26.  Simply put, there was not much substance to the statements:  while they were improper disparagement of the role of defense counsel, we do not see how they alone could have created \" 'circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.' \"   Young, 470 U.S. at 15 (quoting  Frady, 456 U.S. at 163 n. 14);  see Procopio, slip op. at 28-29 (stating that it was \"unrealistic to suggest that ... empty cliches\" that the defense arguments were \"illusions\" and \"smoke screens\" would have affected the jury's verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. The Cumulative Effect</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are many reasons why defense counsel would choose not to make every possible objection during the government's closing argument.  However, there is a cost to that strategy:  most of the statements Fernandez now proffers as misconduct are reviewed under the deferential plain error standard.  We have found, under that standard, that although various of the statements were indeed improper, they did not so poison the well that a new trial is mandated.  Having reviewed the record and the closing arguments, we find the same is true as for their cumulative effect.  Only the statements impugning the role of the defense give us real pause;  nonetheless, even considering all the points where the prosecution's argument fell below the mark, we do not feel that a jury would have been improperly swayed by the argument.  Nonetheless, we add that we are concerned by the sheer quantity of errors, however minor, in this case.  The prosecution should weigh carefully its words when it next approaches the floor for argument.  See id. at 29 (noting that \"a pattern of faults does suggest a failure in supervision\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Fernandez' Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the court granted Fernandez a downward adjustment for being a minor participant in the conspiracy.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b).  The government now argues on cross-appeal that the facts of the case do not support that adjustment.  We review the district court's factual determinations for clear error, granting due deference to the trial court's application of the guideline to the facts.   See United States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir.1995);   United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3B1.2(b) offers a reduction to \"any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2 (comment. n. 3).  Of course, the mere fact that Fernandez may be less culpable than others involved in the conspiracy does not automatically entitle him to a reduction.   See United States v. Daniel, 962 F.2d 100, 103 (1st Cir.1992).  \"Role-in-the-offense adjustments depend ... not only on the comparative conduct of persons jointly engaged in criminal activity, but also on comparing each offender's actions and relative culpability with the elements of the offense.\"   United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the adjustment on the basis that Fernandez' role was \"limited in essence to looking the other way ... while his company was used to transport the narcotics,\" and that he \"played a part in the overall conspiracy that makes him less culpable than that of the average participant.\"   Sentencing Hearing at 29-30.  The court made no more detailed findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the evidence does not support the district court's findings.  It points out that the evidence indicated that Fernandez joined the conspiracy, secured a large payment from Sardinas and Loredo at the outset, and received additional payment for the transportation of the cocaine, albeit a payment smaller than Sardinas'.  According to the witnesses, he attended meetings, made his employees available to help, bribed a gatekeeper, and personally handled shipments.  Additionally, Frame's testimony was that Fernandez acted as liaison to Sardinas with respect to marijuana and cocaine shipments.  All this, topped with the district court's failure to make specific factual findings, the government contends, demonstrates that the court clearly erred in finding that Fernandez was entitled to the minor role adjustment.  Finally, the argument concludes, the fact that the court made no specific findings as to witness credibility or Fernandez' role precludes reliance on cases upholding a district court's credibility determination at sentencing,  see, e.g., United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995), or Fernandez' argument that a plausible view of the evidence supports the district court's minor role determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's failure to find more than the basic facts at sentencing lends a certain awkwardness to this case.  Nonetheless, we disagree with the government's argument that the evidence presented at trial precludes granting the adjustment.  Fernandez went to meetings, accepted money, and, if the witnesses' testimony is credible, knew what was going on.  However, there was no evidence that he was in contact with the suppliers and receivers of the cocaine that the Sardinas organization transported, either in the New York area or in Memphis, or that he negotiated those deals or instructed the workers.  Bruno testified that Fernandez attended a series of meetings, but did not testify that Fernandez ran those meetings, told Bruno what to do, or otherwise served as the organizer of the conspiracy.  While we do not think that Fernandez' entitlement to the downward adjustment was a foregone conclusion, we cannot, on this record, find that it was plain error for the lower court to apply it.  The district court found that Fernandez established that he was less culpable than most other participants in the conspiracy, and so was entitled to the adjustment.  \"In this instance, it would be foolhardy to second-guess the sentencing judge, given his superior coign of vantage.\"   Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendant refers to Gulf as \"Gulf Transportation,\" while the government uses \"Gulf Carrier Transportation.\"   We express no opinion as to which name is more accurate, and use \"Gulf\" for convenience</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fernandez' motion for a bill of particulars, which included a request for discovery of other transportation companies utilized by Sardinas, was denied by the court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Paragraph 28 of the superseding indictment charged that \"[o]n or about the month of April, 1991, HORACIO SARDINAS-ALBO, a/k/a/ HIPPIE, and JORGE ALONSO-LOREDO [sic] associated with JUAN FERNANDEZ to use the services of Carrier Transportation Company, a transportation company owned by JUAN FERNANDEZ, to transport large amounts of cocaine from Puerto Rico to the continental United States using containers.\"   The following paragraphs detailed the nine alleged shipments of cocaine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Frame testified that Fernandez was already active in the operation in 1989 or 1990 and that he was instructed to communicate with Fernandez whenever he needed to contact Sardinas, which he did several times.

Fernandez now raises a series of challenges to his conviction, and the government cross-appeals his sentence.  For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with a basic outline of the case, and address the particulars in more detail as they arise, as the specific issues Fernandez raises require that we examine the facts from differing perspectives.  Fernandez was one of 20 co-defendants charged in Count One of a September 1993 superseding indictment of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine and more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846.

The indictment alleged that some nine loads of cocaine had been shipped through Carrier by early 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez was tried with co-defendant Antonio Contreras.  The evidence against Fernandez at the jury trial was primarily made up of the testimony of four alleged co-conspirators:  Jose Bruno (\"Bruno\"), Elmo De Jesus (\"De Jesus\"), Michael Frame (\"Frame\"), and Lambert Aloisi (\"Aloisi\").  Bruno testified that nine loads of cocaine were shipped through Carrier, the first seven between April and August of 1991, and that he visited Carrier's warehouse in New Jersey several times in connection with those loads.  Fernandez' counsel offered evidence indicating that Carrier did not in fact exist in April 1991, but rather was incorporated in August 1991, and began its occupation of the warehouse Bruno identified in October of that year.  The prosecution in turn questioned defense witnesses about Gulf Transportation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (\"Gulf\");  according to the testimony, Gulf was a shipping company at which Fernandez had worked before he owned Carrier.  In its closing argument, the government argued that Fernandez had used Gulf to transport cocaine prior to using Carrier.  Fernandez was found guilty and was sentenced to 151 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez argues on appeal that there was a material variance between the superseding indictment and the evidence on which the government relied at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We find a variance \"when the proof differs from the allegations in the indictment.\"   United States v. Vavlitis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195045\"><a href=\"/opinion/195045/united-states-v-vavlitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 210 (1st Cir.1993).  Not every variance mandates a new trial:  reversal is only required if the variance proves both material and prejudicial.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a);   United States v. Arcadipane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195748\"><a href=\"/opinion/195748/united-states-v-arcadipane/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, where, as here, \"the government charges a defendant with a crime ... but the facts proven at trial vary somewhat from those charged in the indictment ... it is settled law that a conviction for the crime charged will be affirmed unless the variance as to the facts is shown to have prejudiced the defendant.\"   United States v. Moran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599257\"><a href=\"/opinion/599257/united-states-v-george-a-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1304 (1st Cir.1993).  Our review of whether a retrial is required is plenary.   Arcadipane, 41 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The superseding indictment specifically stated that Fernandez used Carrier to transport cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government's case was consistent with this theory.  Thus, Fernandez maintains, while Carrier was neither a defendant nor an object of the indictment, it was nonetheless a key part of the government's case.  However, Fernandez continues, when he offered evidence in his defense which refuted the charges concerning Carrier by proving that it could not have been used as alleged in the superseding indictment, the government abruptly switched gears and argued that Fernandez used Gulf.  The prejudice against him, Fernandez contends, was obvious:  his trial preparations, which had centered around Carrier, were no longer adequate, since Gulf became the focus of the trial and the jury's deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find such \"obvious\" prejudice;  nor do we agree that Gulf became the focus of the trial and deliberations.  We recognize that there was a variance, but do not believe it \"work[ed] a substantial interference with the defendant's right to be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep.\"   Arcadipane, 41 F.3d at 6. Simply put, although Carrier was repeatedly mentioned in the indictment, the charge was against Fernandez, not his company.  Regardless of whether Carrier or Gulf is discussed, the charge is the same:  that Fernandez associated with Sardinas and Loredo to transport cocaine.  Fernandez cannot now claim that he was misinformed of the charges against him, or that his substantial rights were somehow affected.  See id. at 7.  A new trial is not required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Admission of the Evidence</p>\n    <p>1. Gulf</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez contends that the district court erred in allowing evidence and argument regarding Gulf.  We review a lower court's admission of evidence for abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., United States v. Disanto, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">312368</span></span>, * 11 (1st Cir.1996);   United States v.

She stated that she began working for Carrier in January of 1992, prior to which she worked for Gulf until 1990.  She acknowledged that Fernandez had also worked for Gulf, that it did the same type of business as Carrier, and that it closed before Carrier was created.  She also stated that Gulf did not become Carrier.  On redirect, Fernandez' counsel elicited her testimony that Gulf was a corporation controlled by Fernandez and two other individuals, including Sanjurjo's stepson.  She stated on recross that Carrier and Gulf had different offices and used different warehouses.  George Wyle, a salesman for Carrier for part of 1992, testified on cross that he knew Fernandez through the shipping business prior to 1992, that Fernandez was involved with Gulf, that Gulf did essentially the same kind of business that Carrier did, and that Gulf's full name was Gulf Carrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first few questions to Sanjurjo about Gulf, defense counsel objected to the cross-examination on Gulf as being outside the scope of examination;  the court allowed the prosecution to continue, but asking questions on direct, instead of on cross.  After a few more questions, defense counsel asked for a sidebar, and objected that the questioning was outside the scope of the testimony and the entire case.  The prosecutor argued that the evidence was being used for impeachment, pointing out that since Fernandez was arguing that it was impossible that Carrier could have been used, the evidence on Gulf would show that even before Carrier started Fernandez was in the same line of business, at a company which operated in essentially the same fashion, offering Fernandez access to shipping services, albeit under a different name.  The court denied Fernandez' objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before closing arguments, Fernandez' counsel raised the issue of whether the government should be allowed to make reference to Gulf in its closing argument.  Defense counsel protested that the government was trying to make an inference not based on the evidence, since there was no evidence regarding whether Gulf and Carrier had a similar identity, or when Fernandez was involved with Gulf.  Indeed, counsel noted, the testimony indicated no continuity of ownership between the companies, and that they used different facilities.  The court, however, rejected the defense's argument and allowed the government to discuss Gulf in its closing argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez now argues that the district court erred in allowing evidence and argument regarding Gulf.  He does not specify his reasons, however.  Rather, he simply refers us to the reasons stated in his additional arguments, leaving us to speculate as to which reasons would apply in this context, and running the risk of waiver.  As we address those contentions where they are made, we add only a few comments here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Briefly stated, while it could have decided the issue several different ways, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in choosing to allow the government to elicit and use the evidence regarding Gulf.  While not detailed, the evidence was certainly relevant, for the very reasons the government outlined.  See Fed.R.Evid. 401;   United States v. Griffin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488020\"><a href=\"/opinion/488020/united-states-v-barry-j-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 101-02 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></span> (1987) (noting the broad discretion district courts enjoy in determining relevance).  Allowing the line of questioning and argument was neither unfairly prejudicial, see Fed.R.Evid. 403, nor constituted an unfair surprise:  Fernandez' defense was that it was impossible for him to have used Carrier to ship cocaine because Carrier was not in operation--a line of reasoning fairly inviting the question of what other companies Fernandez had access to during the relevant time period, and whether he could have used them in a similar manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Sixth Amendment Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez contends that his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation has been violated, in that he did not have a full and effective opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.   See Olden v. Kentucky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112165\"><a href=\"/opinion/112165/olden-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 231 (1988) (per curiam) (noting that the right of confrontation \"includes the right to conduct reasonable cross-examination\").  As we find no error on the part of the district court, we need not enter into a harmless error analysis.  See id. at 232;   Delaware v. Van Arsdall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, 680-81 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Bruno and two other witnesses testified that a Puerto Rico senator was implicated in the conspiracy:  they alleged that in 1990, when other members of the conspiracy were arrested in Tortola, the senator attempted to gain their release.  Bruno testified that the senator received close to two hundred fifty thousand dollars in order to bribe the magistrate handling the case in the British Virgin Islands, as well as other individuals.  Another witness testified that he believed the senator had met with representatives of the Sardinas operation in the Puerto Rico Senate--the witness claimed that he waited in the car outside while they met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court ruled in limine that counsel could not mention the senator's name.  Fernandez argues that this constituted error requiring a new trial.  First, he contends that identification of the senator's name could have \"tipped the balance\" in the impeachment of Bruno by showing that he would go to any lengths to obstruct justice, and thus should not be believed in his testimony at trial.  Second, he posits that identification could have led the jury to believe that the account of the senator's involvement in the Tortola events was fabricated by witnesses in order to gain leniency from the government, because of the prominence and importance of the particular senator.  Thus, the argument goes, the identification would have added to the evidence that the witnesses were fabricating stories in a desperate attempt to obtain leniency.  Finally, Fernandez maintains that members of the jury could have felt that the failure to prosecute the senator was unfair selective prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find any of these arguments convincing.  There can be no question that the Sixth Amendment entails a right to cross examine a witness;  nonetheless, \"trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination [regarding potential bias] based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\"   Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679;   see Delaware v. Fensterer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111535\"><a href=\"/opinion/111535/delaware-v-fensterer/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 20 (1985) (per curiam) (\"Generally speaking, the Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\").  The court informed the jury that it had ruled that the name of the senator \"would not be mentioned in order to protect an ongoing investigation with respect to activities that he may have been engaged in.\"   Tr. at 515.  The jury was also informed that the parties stipulated that the senator was \"prominent.\"   Further, as noted above, the scope of the senator's alleged actions was explored through testimony from several witnesses:  the sole element the court ordered be left out was the senator's name.  Certainly the jury had enough information in front of it to be able to weigh the impeachment value of the alleged plot:  it had \"the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\"   Davis v. Alaska, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 318 (1974).  As for the selective prosecution claim, we note that the court told the jury there was an ongoing investigation:  the implication that the senator had not been charged is clear.  We do not find any error in the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second claim focuses on the De Jesus cross-examination.  He testified that he assisted in the transportation of more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, yet his plea agreement stated that he was responsible for only 3.5 to 5 kilograms.  The prosecution objected to defense's questioning on this discrepancy, and the court sustained the objection.  The court ruled that the defense could not cross-examine De Jesus regarding the quantity of cocaine for which he was held accountable in his plea agreement, but could question him on the difference the agreement made in his sentence.  De Jesus duly testified that without the plea he faced from thirty years to life, and that with it, he was facing seven years.  He agreed that by testifying in this case, he was hoping to have the sentence further reduced so as to not have to spend any time in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez argues that the court erred, since any proof of false, self-serving statements by a government witness--such as the plea agreement figure--would aid the defense in showing the witnesses' untrustworthiness.  Thus, Fernandez contends, his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated.   See Olden, 488 U.S. at 231.   We disagree.  First, defense counsel was able to impeach De Jesus through eliciting his testimony on the impact the plea agreement had on his sentence and his hopes for a reduced sentence based on his participation in this trial.  Second, the court's ruling seems to have been based on the concern that the jury understand that De Jesus was not actually lying in his plea agreement, but rather that the figure used was a mechanism of convenience in order to get to a specific sentence:  \"I think the whole concept is to show ... [that it was a] deal, a wow deal, but not to show that he's a liar because that's not the real facts.\"   Tr. at 1879.  We do not find that the district court erred in striking a balance between this concern and the importance of impeachment through limiting the testimony to the sentence obtained.  Indeed, we agree with the court's comment to the effect that to do otherwise would run the risk of having defense counsel impeach the government, not De Jesus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez' reliance on  United States v.

There, we found that the trial court erred in restricting cross-examination into the circumstances underlying a witness' plea bargain.  The witness' agreement with the government required that he take and \"successfully complete\" a polygraph examination.  He took the test, twice, and the examiner labeled some of his answers as \"inconclusive.\"   The defense sought to impeach the witness by implying that the witness had not \"successfully completed\" the test, and so had motive to lie on the stand to please the government.  The court cut off all questioning about the test, and informed the jury that such tests yielded inherently unreliable results.   Id. at 432.  We held that the district court abused its discretion by cutting off all cross-examination into a \"relevant and not fully explored area.\"   Id. at 434.  The same is not true here.  The district court did not cut off all examination in the area of De Jesus' credibility:  rather, it set limits on the examination so as to permit the introduction of the information in a manner which would not mislead the jury yet provide it \"with 'sufficient information concerning formative events to make a \"discriminating appraisal\" of [De Jesus'] motives and bias.' \"   Id. at 433 ( quoting United States v.

Bruno testified that Sardinas and Loredo each paid $80,000 to buy into Carrier in order to ship cocaine;  he stated that he saw them collect the money to make a payment to Fernandez, and heard them discussing the use of Carrier.  Bruno testified about sending the nine shipments of cocaine, and about Fernandez' personal participation in the operation, including telephone calls and meetings.  He stated that he went to the Carrier warehouse in New Jersey, his first visit being in July 1991, and that Fernandez was there on at least one occasion.  Aloisi's testimony generally corroborated Bruno's statements.  De Jesus testified that he participated in at least four shipments of cocaine, including deliveries of cocaine to Fernandez at a warehouse in Carolina, Puerto Rico, and retrieval from the New Jersey warehouse.  His testimony contradicted Bruno's on several points, regarding the amount of cocaine in particular loads and who participated in specific meetings and loads.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Our review of this record leads us to conclude that, \"having heard the evidence, including nuances and intimations that a cold record cannot capture, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that [Fernandez] was guilty of conspiracy.\"   Moran, 984 F.2d at 1301-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez also argues that this court must reverse the verdict below because it was physically impossible that Carrier was the company used to transport cocaine in 1991:  he presented evidence that Carrier did not exist until after April 1991, and that it did not occupy the New Jersey warehouse until October of that year.  Since the chief government witnesses testified that Carrier was used, the argument continues, there is no reason to credit the witnesses' testimony as to this point, or any other.  Thus, Fernandez concludes that the trial court erred in not granting his motion for acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there were inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony, and while they all had an incentive to please the government, these aspects of the evidence were pointed out to the jury by defense counsel.  As the government notes, Bruno and De Jesus did not go to any warehouse for the first loads--indeed, Bruno testified that Carrier had previously had a different address--and the evidence regarding Gulf suggests that Fernandez had knowledge of and access to shipping facilities during the relevant time frame.  It was within the province of the jury to disregard some of the inconsistencies and to accept aspects of the witnesses' testimony as credible.  \"The force of the evidence as a whole, including all reasonable inferences favorable to the verdict, was sufficient to support a rational jury finding:  that defendant was guilty.\"   Lopez, 944 F.2d at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.

Fernandez argues that the government's case here was wholly circumstantial and rested solely on the testimony of blatantly untrustworthy witnesses, as demonstrated by the many contradictions between their stories and Fernandez' evidence that Carrier had not occupied a warehouse until October 1991.

Statements Objected to at Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) During trial, a lease application filled out by Loredo in November, 1991, which stated that he had worked for Carrier for six years--well before the time the defense argued Carrier began to exist--was admitted for the limited purpose of showing that Loredo claimed he worked for Carrier, not for the truth of the matters in the document.  Fernandez now contends that the prosecutor went beyond that limited purpose in his closing argument.  Referring to the application, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>You remember, as you look at it here, there is a part ... where he's supposed to or he has to list his employer.

Thus, we turn to our four-factor test.  We note that the misconduct, though disingenuous, was not severe, and occurred only once, in relative isolation.  More importantly, the court gave immediate curative instructions, admonishing the jury that the lease did not come in as anything more than a claim by Loredo to have worked for Carrier, and reminding them of its earlier instruction, made when the lease application was entered.  Indeed, in its closing, the defense also reminded the jury of the limited use of the lease.

Like Fernandez, we can find no evidence in the record stating that Gulf began in 1986.  The offer of this fact is harmless, however, since the pertinent time period is 1991, and Sanjurjo testified that Gulf was in operation in 1990.  The reference leaves open the crucial question, which is, when Gulf ceased operation.  As for the form in which the prosecutor made his statement, it is consistent with the framework the government used for its argument, discussed in (1), above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez objects to the cited passage and four others for asserting that Carrier and Gulf were essentially the same thing, doing the exact same job:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>[O]ur argument is that before, when the company was operating as Gulf Carrier Transportation he used another warehouse in New Jersey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

These statements, he contends, urged the jury to speculate in a manner unsupported and contradicted by the actual evidence regarding Gulf.  There was evidence that they were both transportation companies, but not that they did the exact same job.  Indeed, the owners were not the same:  Fernandez was part owner of Gulf, and the sole owner of Carrier.  Finally, there was no evidence that Gulf was actually in business in 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, we cannot find that this line of argument so poisoned the trial well that a new trial is required.   See Manning, 23 F.3d at 574.   The government made an argument based on the limited evidence regarding Gulf.

The prosecutor made a series of comments such as \"[w]e seek [co-conspirators or drug traffickers] out and we go out and corroborate them.\"   Tr. at 2442.  We agree with the government, however, that, read in context, the statements Fernandez points to were simply establishing a framework for the presentation of the government's argument.  They also served to point out that even though the government's witnesses were drug traffickers with a motive to fabricate evidence--as defense counsel had emphasized in opening argument--their testimony was corroborated.  Indeed, in the first passage quoted above, the prosecution reminded the jury that it carried the duty of determining whether the government proved its case.  While we do not necessarily recommend this framework for argument as an ideal one, we do not find that the statements were improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Fernandez' second argument is that the prosecutor misstated the law on proof of conspiracy in making the following statements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>the only way we can prove a conspiracy is through the testimony of the very co-conspirators who were members of that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>you're always going to need the testimony of the co-conspirator to prove a conspiracy because of the secrecy of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2442.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You're never going to find a decent person testifying to a drug deal.

For, viewed in context, it is clear that they did not poison the trial proceeding.  In his opening statement, Fernandez' counsel had emphasized the fact that no actual drugs were offered in evidence:  the challenged comments were apparently designed to counter those statements with an explanation of why the government relied so heavily on witness testimony.  The first two statements are addressed to the practical difficulties of proving a conspiracy.  The prosecutor followed the first with an explanation of why the government did not introduce any actual drugs.  Further, the prosecutor followed up these comments with a discussion of the importance of documentary evidence in corroborating witnesses' testimony, belying his own comments.  As for the \"decent person\" comment, its logical flaws are obvious.  Moreover, defense counsel had emphasized the witnesses' dishonesty in his opening,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to which this is apparently a response.  These statements do not warrant a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The prosecutor made two statements to the jury to the effect that \"[t]o acquit, you would have to find that everybody was lying in this case.\"   Tr. at 2590-91.  Fernandez argues, and the government seems to agree, that these were improper.  To the contrary, we feel they amounted to nothing more than argument, and were not improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Fernandez' fourth contention is that the prosecutor made statements without evidentiary support.   See Santana-Camacho, 833 F.2d at 373 (reversing conviction on basis of major and prejudicial misstatement of evidence in closing argument).  The prosecutor erroneously stated that the testifying drug traffickers were \"either in jail or go to [sic] jail,\" Tr. at 2442, and that Bruno specifically would be going to jail when, in fact, Aloisi had a non-prosecution agreement, and Bruno was not incarcerated at the time of trial.  Again, the government acknowledges that the statements were not factually true.  We agree with the government, however, that any error in admitting these statements does not rise to the level of plain error.  The agreements between the government and the witnesses were in evidence, each of the four witnesses against Fernandez testified about his agreement with the government, defense counsel reminded the jury of their agreements in his closing argument, and the judge instructed the jurors that counsel's argument did not constitute evidence, but that their recollection of the facts controlled.   Cf. United States v. Innamorati, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 482 (1st Cir.)  (finding no clear error where prosecution stated \"that the trial judge alone would determine the sentences for each of the cooperating witnesses, and that the jury therefore should not think that the witnesses were getting 'a walk' \" where, in fact, the government had dismissed charges against many of the witnesses and had promised to make motions for downward departures),  cert. denied sub nom.  DeMarco v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></span> (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Fernandez points out that the government made a second misstatement of the evidence by arguing that the payment which the two lead conspirators were alleged to have given Fernandez in order to buy into Carrier was \"not an over the counter deal\" but rather \"a criminal association.  It [was] a paper bag with eighty thousand dollars.\"   Tr. at 2575.  The government acknowledges that the paper bag details pertain to a different transaction, not involving Fernandez.  The misstatement is troublesome in its characterization of the transaction, the details of which were not in evidence.  However, between the brevity and isolation of the misstatement, the court's later instruction to the jury that their memory controlled, and defense counsel's failure to make a timely objection, Fernandez cannot clear the plain error hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) Next, Fernandez alleges that in his rebuttal argument the prosecutor provided information to contradict the testimony of a witness at trial.  Without specifying what that information is, he cites the following passage discussing the testimony of Enrique Nieves (\"Nieves\"), Special Agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the other thing with Mr. Nieves.  He said that there was a search warrant served on or about the time Mr. Fernandez was indicted.  And that's false.  You recall the testimony, that was the search warrant was at an unrelated warehouse of Mr. Velasco before we had any knowledge of the fact that they were using Carrier Transportation at the time of the first indictment.  That's when that search warrant was served and that's when we were going after Mr. Velasco who was in the first indictment.  So the fact that that search warrant was served and nothing was found, we were not after Mr. Juan Fernandez's business at the time because we didn't know about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2578.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Examination of the record sheds some light on the passage.  First, the depiction of Nieves' testimony is correct:  the warrant was for an unrelated warehouse, prior to any suspicion that the warehouse Carrier used was involved, and was served following the first indictment, which did not name Fernandez.  Second, the \"he\" of \"he said that there was a search warrant served\" seems to refer not to Nieves, but to Fernandez' counsel.  The latter had stated in his closing that Nieves testified that in September 1993--the time of the first indictment--he had testified at a bond hearing that a specific warehouse used by Carrier was not involved with the Sardinas operation.  Defense counsel also referred to the search warrant for a different warehouse.  It would seem that the prosecution blurred the line between the reference to the bond hearing and the search warrant and attributed the date given for the first to the second.  While perhaps an error, it does not constitute the presentation of information to contradict the testimony of a witness at trial.  Since Fernandez did not see fit to actually specify what element of the passage presented new information, and we see none ourselves, we find no plain error on the part of the district court in allowing the statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) The prosecutor's statement that \"[t]hey could be doing additional loads besides the ones that Mr. Bruno was aware,\" Tr. at 2465-66, was not improper speculation, since it was made in the context of the prosecutor noting that De Jesus' testimony was that Bruno was not always involved in the transportation of loads of cocaine, and so the government was not always sure what number a load was:  \"they probably skipped the fifth and this is the sixth load, or it could be a totally different load.  We don't know.\"   Tr. at 2465.  Even if the statement could be construed as improper speculation, Fernandez again fails to clear the hurdle of the four factors and prove that there was plain error on the part of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(8) Similarly, Fernandez contends that the prosecutor improperly generalized about his experiences in stating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>even on some minor details there is a lot of corroboration in this case, which is unusual.

The prosecutor made this statement in the context of encouraging the jury to recognize that the presence of some inconsistencies in witness testimony does not preclude granting them credence.  This statement falls somewhere on the spectrum between proper and improper argument.  However, even assuming it was improper, we cannot find that it is so severe as to warrant a mistrial.  In truth, the prosecutor was telling the jury what it probably already knows:  that there will likely be differences in the stories told by two people recounting an event that occurred years earlier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez makes the similar contention that the prosecution twice vouched for the credibility of prosecution witnesses by telling the jury that the witnesses were telling the truth because they did not get together to concoct a totally consistent story;  the fact that their story was not totally consistent, the prosecution argued, reveals that \"the only other alternative is that ... they were telling the truth and that the impeachment that they have been able to make to you is, I submit, as to details.\"   Tr. at 2591.

The prosecutor apparently made this statement in direct rebuttal to co-defendant's counsel, who highlighted--literally--a statement in De Jesus' plea agreement which indicated that the shipload of cocaine with which the co-defendant was allegedly involved came from Panama, while the indictment maintained it was Venezuela, without mentioning Panama.  Given this context, the relative isolation of the statement, and the judge's instructions to the jury that their memory of the testimony controlled, this misconduct does not require a new trial, especially in light of our standard of review.   See Young, 470 U.S. at 11-14 (discussing the \"invited response\" rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(10) We also dismiss Fernandez' contention that four statements made by the prosecution were generalizing about drug traffickers without evidentiary support.

Nonetheless, the statement is clearly proper:  as the government notes, it is essentially a viable interpretation of the evidence.  Indeed, the prosecutor followed the statements Fernandez now challenges by pointing to the testimony that, at least initially, Fernandez received two hundred dollars for each kilogram of cocaine transported--a clear financial incentive.   Cf. United States v. Tajeddini, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610547\"><a href=\"/opinion/610547/united-states-v-hojatollah-tajeddini/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span>, 1285-86 (1st Cir.1993) (finding that, where the prosecutor did not deliberately misrepresent defendant's financial situation, where there was a financial incentive, and where defendant did not object at trial, prosecution statement that crime was motivated by payment was proper).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(12) Fernandez points to two references to the lease application discussed in section (2), above, as error.  The first, when read in context, appears to be citing to other evidence to support the conclusion that Fernandez sought to conceal the earlier existence of Carrier:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>I submit to [sic] as a fact that [Sanjurjo] should have known [whether Loredo started working after she started working] and the fact that she did not want to answer to you should be proof that Mr. Loredo was in fact working before that, as he claimed on his application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2475.  The prosecutor is offering Sanjurjo's testimony as proof, not the application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution also referred to the application in its rebuttal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>[Defense Counsel] tells you that Jorge Loredo was looking for a part time job with Carrier Transportation Services.  Well, look at the lease agreement.  Look at the cars he list[s] as his property.  In 1991 red Ferrari ... [and] a 1990 Range Rover.  Black one.  Is that a car of somebody who needs a second job to make ends meet [?] No, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, he wasn't looking for any part time job.  He had a full time job and that was trafficking drugs, trafficking cocaine.  With who?

On balance, we do not find that the lease application was submitted for the proposition that Carrier existed prior to when the defense asserted it began.  Rather, the cited passage suggests that Loredo had no need for a part-time job, but that he already had one with Carrier.  The evidence indicated that in November, 1991, the date of the lease agreement, Carrier had already been incorporated and had leased a warehouse in New Jersey.  The reference to Carrier seems to have been to the November 1991 status, not Loredo's claim to have held a position there for 6 years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Even if this reading is incorrect, however, and this was an improper reference, its admission was simply not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(13) Fernandez contends that on three occasions the government improperly alluded to the fact that he did not testify.  \"A prosecutor's comment is improper where, under the circumstances of the case, 'the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.' \"   Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757 (quoting  United States v. Glantz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482473\"><a href=\"/opinion/482473/united-states-v-ronald-h-glantz-and-anthony-j-bucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span>, 322 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></span> (1987)).  None of the statements Fernandez points to in this context meet this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in his rebuttal, the prosecutor referred to Gulf as the \"other company that we didn't know they had, which at the beginning they didn't tell us about.\"   Tr. at 2580.  Read in context, it is clear that the jury would not \"naturally and necessarily\" take this as a comment on Fernandez' failure to testify, because the prosecutor is in fact referring to the premise that the evidence introduced about Carrier does not prove anything about Gulf.  We note that the statement does not indicate that Fernandez did not tell the government about Gulf, rather, that \"they \"--the witnesses--did not tell it about Gulf.  Second, the prosecutor argued that there was \"no other explanation\" for the fact that three witnesses had Fernandez' phone number \"except that they were involved with him.\"   Tr. at 2472.  Third, the prosecution argued against the defense position that Fernandez' association with Loredo and Frame was an innocent one, positing that knowing three drug traffickers could hardly be a coincidence, and that \"the only explanation\" presented before the jury was a criminal association between the men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that neither statement meets the \"naturally and necessarily\" criteria.  Although Fernandez would presumably have been able to testify as to these things, so would the other witnesses.  \"Where arguably favorable evidence other than the defendant's own testimony is available to him, comment upon his failure to produce it may be justified.\"   United States v. Sardelli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484661\"><a href=\"/opinion/484661/united-states-v-andrea-sardelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span>, 657 (5th Cir.1987).  Indeed, defense counsel argued in his closing that the dissemination of Fernandez' phone numbers and his associations with co-defendants were innocent.  We find no plain error in the court's allowance of these statements.  See Procopio, slip. op. at 23-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(14) Fernandez also contends that the government improperly tried to shift the burden of proof to the defense.  The first cited statement asked:  \"Why would the defense be hiding the fact or they to portray [sic] the fact that Mr. Loredo started working for Carrier after 1992, if he started before[?]\"  Tr. at 2580.  From the statement's context, it is apparent that this is a rebuttal to defense counsel's claim that Loredo's business card from Carrier dated from 1992:  the prosecution counters that the business card had no date.  The second statement cited pointed out that on direct examination Sanjurjo testified that Carrier started in 1992, adding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>But then we had to wait for cross examination by Mr. Pagel to find out that there was a previous company before 1992, in fact from 1986 it had started, which did the exact same type of job ... and Mr. Juan Fernandez was also one of the owners or partners in the corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Sanjurjo] denied at that point that the corporation was named Gulf Carrier or had Carrier in its name.  We found that out through another witness at a later time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2474-75.  These comments are in keeping with the general structure of the prosecution's argument, discussed above, pointing out who testified what about Carrier and Gulf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that these statements did not shift the burden of proof onto the defendant.  On balance, any subtle implication that the burden of proof had shifted would have been mitigated by the court's instructions--as well as those of the prosecution and defense--regarding the burden of proof.  While not necessarily ideal, the cited statements did not amount to reversible error under our standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(15) Fernandez points to four statements made in the government's rebuttal which are more troubling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p>The second reason [why the prosecution has an opportunity for rebuttal] is, to help you see through this smoke screen that the defense always tries to raise to confuse you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2574.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>look how desperate [the defense is], look at the argument they're making to try to escape what is obvious to everybody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>The fact is, we do have enough evidence.  The evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  They're just trying to confuse you.  Don't allow them to be confusing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2585.  Finally:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their argument, really is that we cannot use these drug traffickers, the witnesses who were their friends and their associates, to convict.  That's what they're saying.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is an important weapon, an important tool in law enforcement, to deprive of us the ability to do that is [sic] to deal a hard blow to law enforcement....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, these criminals, drug traffickers in general, think that they commit the crime and nobody catches them at that time, or the people who saw them were other drug traffickers that then they're home free.  But unfortunately, for all these drug traffickers, including Mr. Contreras and Mr. Juan Fernandez, that's not the way it works.  Because we in the law enforcement community, the people who you see sitting [at] this table, the agents that you saw testifying before you, they didn't give up.  They kept on investigating and they didn't catch them when it happened, but they kept investigating and they kept catching other criminals and they were able to build a case around them.  Because we have other means, other methods in which to investigate and to present cases to you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I submit to you that this is another way to present the case.  And it also shows beyond a reasonable doubt that these defendants are guilty.  So, they thought they had gotten away with their crimes when they committed them.  The agents kept, they didn't give up, they kept investigating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I ask you now don't give you up [sic] on us now.  They thought they had gotten away with their crime.  Don't you let them get away with their crime today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 2590-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not doubt that these statements constituted improper argument.   See, e.g., Boldt, 929 F.2d at 40 (improper to comment on \"favorite defense tactic\");   Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757 (finding prosecution argument that defendants, who did not testify, were \"still running and hiding\" improper).  Thus we turn to our four factors.  First, regarding severity, while the misconduct is real, it is not as severe as some which we have previously found improper.   See, e.g., Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 527 (holding it improper to argue, inter alia, that \"the defendants are not soldiers in the army of good.  They are soldiers in the army of evil, in the army which only purpose [sic] is to poison, to disrupt, to corrupt\").  In terms of the context, the government argues that these were isolated comments.  However, the fact that the prosecutor made multiple, albeit brief, statements disparaging the role of the defense convinces us that they were not isolated comments.  Indeed, the prosecutor ended his rebuttal shortly after finishing the last statement, enhancing its impression on the jury.  As for any corrective instructions, Fernandez did not object to any of the statements.  Finally, we note that the evidence against Fernandez was adequate, but not overwhelming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, although it is a close call, Fernandez does not prevail on this point.  Because he made no objection at trial, Fernandez \"must show that the improper remarks likely infected the jury (affected 'substantial rights' in Olano 's words) and mere possibilities are not enough.\"   Procopio, slip op. at 26.  Simply put, there was not much substance to the statements:  while they were improper disparagement of the role of defense counsel, we do not see how they alone could have created \" 'circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.' \"   Young, 470 U.S. at 15 (quoting  Frady, 456 U.S. at 163 n. 14);  see Procopio, slip op. at 28-29 (stating that it was \"unrealistic to suggest that ... empty cliches\" that the defense arguments were \"illusions\" and \"smoke screens\" would have affected the jury's verdict).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4. The Cumulative Effect</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are many reasons why defense counsel would choose not to make every possible objection during the government's closing argument.  However, there is a cost to that strategy:  most of the statements Fernandez now proffers as misconduct are reviewed under the deferential plain error standard.  We have found, under that standard, that although various of the statements were indeed improper, they did not so poison the well that a new trial is mandated.  Having reviewed the record and the closing arguments, we find the same is true as for their cumulative effect.  Only the statements impugning the role of the defense give us real pause;  nonetheless, even considering all the points where the prosecution's argument fell below the mark, we do not feel that a jury would have been improperly swayed by the argument.  Nonetheless, we add that we are concerned by the sheer quantity of errors, however minor, in this case.  The prosecution should weigh carefully its words when it next approaches the floor for argument.  See id. at 29 (noting that \"a pattern of faults does suggest a failure in supervision\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Fernandez' Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the court granted Fernandez a downward adjustment for being a minor participant in the conspiracy.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b).  The government now argues on cross-appeal that the facts of the case do not support that adjustment.  We review the district court's factual determinations for clear error, granting due deference to the trial court's application of the guideline to the facts.   See United States v. Graciani, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.1995);   United States v.

Of course, the mere fact that Fernandez may be less culpable than others involved in the conspiracy does not automatically entitle him to a reduction.   See United States v. Daniel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582532\"><a href=\"/opinion/582532/united-states-v-jose-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.1992).  \"Role-in-the-offense adjustments depend ... not only on the comparative conduct of persons jointly engaged in criminal activity, but also on comparing each offender's actions and relative culpability with the elements of the offense.\"   United States v.

The court made no more detailed findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the evidence does not support the district court's findings.  It points out that the evidence indicated that Fernandez joined the conspiracy, secured a large payment from Sardinas and Loredo at the outset, and received additional payment for the transportation of the cocaine, albeit a payment smaller than Sardinas'.  According to the witnesses, he attended meetings, made his employees available to help, bribed a gatekeeper, and personally handled shipments.  Additionally, Frame's testimony was that Fernandez acted as liaison to Sardinas with respect to marijuana and cocaine shipments.  All this, topped with the district court's failure to make specific factual findings, the government contends, demonstrates that the court clearly erred in finding that Fernandez was entitled to the minor role adjustment.  Finally, the argument concludes, the fact that the court made no specific findings as to witness credibility or Fernandez' role precludes reliance on cases upholding a district court's credibility determination at sentencing,  see, e.g., United States v. Webster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196037\"><a href=\"/opinion/196037/united-states-v-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1995), or Fernandez' argument that a plausible view of the evidence supports the district court's minor role determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's failure to find more than the basic facts at sentencing lends a certain awkwardness to this case.  Nonetheless, we disagree with the government's argument that the evidence presented at trial precludes granting the adjustment.  Fernandez went to meetings, accepted money, and, if the witnesses' testimony is credible, knew what was going on.  However, there was no evidence that he was in contact with the suppliers and receivers of the cocaine that the Sardinas organization transported, either in the New York area or in Memphis, or that he negotiated those deals or instructed the workers.  Bruno testified that Fernandez attended a series of meetings, but did not testify that Fernandez ran those meetings, told Bruno what to do, or otherwise served as the organizer of the conspiracy.  While we do not think that Fernandez' entitlement to the downward adjustment was a foregone conclusion, we cannot, on this record, find that it was plain error for the lower court to apply it.  The district court found that Fernandez established that he was less culpable than most other participants in the conspiracy, and so was entitled to the adjustment.  \"In this instance, it would be foolhardy to second-guess the sentencing judge, given his superior coign of vantage.\"   Ocasio, 914 F.2d at 333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendant refers to Gulf as \"Gulf Transportation,\" while the government uses \"Gulf Carrier Transportation.\"   We express no opinion as to which name is more accurate, and use \"Gulf\" for convenience</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fernandez' motion for a bill of particulars, which included a request for discovery of other transportation companies utilized by Sardinas, was denied by the court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Paragraph 28 of the superseding indictment charged that \"[o]n or about the month of April, 1991, HORACIO SARDINAS-ALBO, a/k/a/ HIPPIE, and JORGE ALONSO-LOREDO [sic] associated with JUAN FERNANDEZ to use the services of Carrier Transportation Company, a transportation company owned by JUAN FERNANDEZ, to transport large amounts of cocaine from Puerto Rico to the continental United States using containers.\"   The following paragraphs detailed the nine alleged shipments of cocaine</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Frame testified that Fernandez was already active in the operation in 1989 or 1990 and that he was instructed to communicate with Fernandez whenever he needed to contact Sardinas, which he did several times.

However, his counsel did not object when the court held that the prosecution could \"tell it to the jury.\"   Tr. at 2438.  The government points out that Fernandez did not make specific objections to these references to Gulf during closing argument, presumably asking us to review them under the more lenient plain error standard.  As we find no error under either standard, we need not determine here whether the objection was preserved</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> For example, in his opening statement, Fernandez' counsel stated:</p>\n        <p>And the evidence is that these drug pushers have consistently taken the easy way out of everything that is meaningful in life....</p>\n        <p>... [T]he evidence will show that they have no conscious [sic] that will prevent them--the kind of consciousness that would prevent most people from accusing an innocent man.

The prosecution made no direct reference to that claim, however</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
