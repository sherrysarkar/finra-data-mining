(\"CFI\"), filed proofs of claim against\r\n\nCFI   in   the  bankruptcy   court   for   the  District   of\r\n\nMassachusetts.    The claims  stemmed  from  a pending  civil\r\n\naction  in which Adams alleged that  various CFI officers and\r\n\nsupervisors  had  conspired  to  recoup  inventory losses  by\r\n\nfalsely accusing  Adams and other low-level  CFI employees of\r\n\nstealing  money  and  merchandise  from CFI  stores.    Adams\r\n\nfurther alleged  that these same CFI  officials had knowingly\r\n\ncoerced  Adams and  other  employees into  confessing to  the\r\n\nalleged  thefts  notwithstanding  that Adams  and  the  other\r\n\nemployees  had not committed them.  The complaint in the case\r\n\nasserted claims of false imprisonment,  wrongful termination,\r\n\nmalicious   prosecution,   abuse   of  process,   defamation,\r\n\nintentional infliction of  emotional distress, and  violation\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nof Massachusetts civil  rights laws  (collectively the  \"loss\r\n\nprevention claims\").\r\n\n          In 1993,  CFI reached  a tentative settlement  in a\r\n\nseparate  class action suit involving similar loss prevention\r\n\nclaims (the \"Curley suit\").  The Curley suit had been brought\r\n\nin  New Jersey federal district court by a different group of\r\n\nformer CFI employees that did not include Adams.  As part  of\r\n\nthe proposed Curley settlement, the parties to that agreement\r\n\nfiled a  joint motion  in the Massachusetts  bankruptcy court\r\n\nrequesting  the  creation of  a  mandatory  class that  would\r\n\ninclude all loss prevention claimants who had filed proofs of\r\n\nclaim  in  the  Massachusetts  bankruptcy  proceeding  (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nAdams).   Moreover,  the parties  further requested  that the\r\n\nMassachusetts  bankruptcy  court  use  the  Curley settlement\r\n\nagreement as a vehicle for estimating and discharging  all of\r\n\nthe  loss prevention  claims alleged  by individuals  in this\r\n\nnewly  created class.   Adams  objected to  this motion.   On\r\n\nAugust  30, 1993,  the bankruptcy  court granted  the motion.\r\n\nAdams appealed to the  Massachusetts federal district  court,\r\n\nand  the  district court  affirmed.    Additionally, the  New\r\n\nJersey  district court  ultimately  approved,  and the  Third\r\n\nCircuit affirmed, the  proposed settlement  agreement in  the\r\n\nCurley suit.  See  Curley v. Cumberland Farms, Inc.,  27 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n556 (3d Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          On   appeal  to   this  court,   Adams's  principal\r\n\ncomplaint is  that the bankruptcy court  lacked the authority\r\n\nto  enter a final order  discharging her claims.   Adams also\r\n\nraises several  additional arguments  including an attack  on\r\n\nthe  bankruptcy  court's  estimation  of her  claims  and  an\r\n\nassertion  that the  bankruptcy  court's  order violated  her\r\n\nSeventh Amendment right  to a  jury trial.   We begin with  a\r\n\nbrief overview of the  statutory framework and follow with  a\r\n\ndiscussion of Adams's assignments of error.\r\n\nA.  Statutory Overview\r                                  \r\n\n          Title 28 U.S.C.   1334  vests in the district court\r\n\na  broad  grant  of   subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  all\r\n\nbankruptcy-related  matters,  expressly  providing  that  the\r\n\n\"district   court   shall   have   original   and   exclusive\r\n\njurisdiction  of all cases under  title 11\" and \"original but\r\n\nnot exclusive  jurisdiction of all  civil proceedings arising\r\n\nunder title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title\r\n\n11.\"  28  U.S.C.    1334(a), (b); see  also Celotex Corp.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nEdwards,  115   S.  Ct.  1493,  1498-99   (1995)  (discussing\r                   \r\n\ncomprehensive  scope of    1334  jurisdictional grant).   The\r\n\nbankruptcy court, in turn, is authorized to hear matters, not\r\n\nas  an independent  entity, but  as \"a  unit of  the district\r\n\ncourt.\"    28  U.S.C.    151.    Subject-matter  jurisdiction\r\n\nremains  in  the  district  court, which  is  authorized,  in\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nappropriate   circumstances,   to  refer   matters   \"to  the\r\n\nbankruptcy  judges  of th[at]  district.\"    Id.    157;  cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nNorthern Pipeline Const.

The district  court's\r\n\npower of referral extends to any case or proceeding for which\r\n\nit has  subject-matter jurisdiction  under    1334.   See  28\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.C.    157.  The district court, however, may withdraw any\r\n\nmatter referred under  this provision for cause shown  on its\r\n\nown motion or by the request of either party.  Id.   157(d).\r                                                              \r\n\n          While the district court  may refer all matters for\r\n\nwhich  it has  jurisdiction under    1334,  the power  of the\r\n\nbankruptcy  judge  to  enter   final  orders  in  a  referred\r\n\nproceeding  is limited.  See 28 U.S.C.    157.  In general, a\r                                        \r\n\nbankruptcy  judge may  hear and  finally determine  only core\r\n\nbankruptcy proceedings.  Id.    157(a).  Core proceedings are\r                                        \r\n\nthose that involve rights that are created by, and depend on,\r\n\nthe bankruptcy laws for their existence.  In re G.S.F.

The bankruptcy court is\r\n\nauthorized, on its  own motion or on the  \"timely motion of a\r\n\nparty,\" to  determine whether  a proceeding comes  within the\r\n\ncourt's  core  or  non-core  authority.

This  special status\r                                    \r\n\napparently   stems  from  Congress's  recognition  that  most\r\n\npersonal  injury tort and  wrongful death victims  stand in a\r\n\nsomewhat  different relationship  with the  bankruptcy debtor\r\n\nbecause they did not voluntarily enter into dealings with the\r\n\ndebtor (and  accept the risk  of loss)  in the same  sense as\r\n\ntraditional  bankruptcy  claimants.    See  Matter  of  Poole\r                                                                         \r\n\nFuneral Chapel,  Inc., 63  B.R.  527, 530  (Bankr. N.D.

Personal Injury Torts\r                                     \r\n\n          Adams challenges the  bankruptcy court's  authority\r\n\nto  enter  a  final  order   with  respect  to  her   claims.\r\n\nEssentially,  she contests  the  bankruptcy court's  implicit\r\n\ndetermination that her  claims constituted core  proceedings.\r\n\nAdams argues that  her claims are non-core because  they fall\r\n\nwithin at  least one of several  specific exceptions provided\r\n\nfor \"personal  injury tort\" claims.   Therefore, she contends\r\n\nthat, because  the  proceeding was  non-core, the  bankruptcy\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncourt lacked the authority to enter a final order effectively\r\n\nestimating and discharging her claims.2\r\n\n          Whether or  not Adams's claims  constitute personal\r\n\ninjury tort claims is a close question.  Compare In  re Atron\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. of  Michigan, 172  B.R. 541,  542-45 (Bankr.  W.D. Mich.\r                             \r\n\n1994)  (\"personal injury  tort\"  should be  read narrowly  to\r\n\nexclude  emotional distress and other nontraditional personal\r\n\ninjury  claims), with  Poole,  63 B.R.  at 529-30  (\"personal\r                                        \r\n\ninjury  tort\" should  be read  broadly to include  claims for\r\n\nemotional  and mental  distress).   We  decline, however,  to\r\n\nreach the issue in this case.  Adams failed to argue that her\r\n\nclaims  constituted   personal  injury  tort  claims  in  her\r\n\nobjection  to the  joint motion  before the  bankruptcy court\r\n\nand, again, in  her opening brief before  the district court.\r\n\nAccordingly,  she has  waived consideration  of the  issue on\r\n\nappeal to this court.   See, e.g., Fish Market  Nominee Corp.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Adams does not contend that her claims against the estate\r\nwere  outside the  district court's  broad grant  of subject-\r\nmatter  jurisdiction under  28 U.S.C.    1334.   This  is not\r\nsurprising.  The  district court's \"related  to\" jurisdiction\r\nunder    1334(b) is expansive.  See Celotex Corp. v. Edwards,\r                                                                        \r\n115 S.

We have little doubt that proceedings, such\r\nas this one, involving the estimation and discharge of proofs\r\nof  claim filed against  the estate by  a bankruptcy creditor\r\ncome within this broad range.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nv.

That  right, which  derives\r\n\nfrom the language of  Article III,    1, is a personal  right\r\n\nand is subject to waiver upon a party's failure to assert it.\r\n\nSee Commodity Future Trading  Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S.  833,\r                                                         \r\n\n848-50 (1986).  Schor, however, makes clear that Article III,\r                                 \r\n\n  1, protects  other non-waivable institutional  interests by\r\n\nbarring \"congressional attempts  to transfer jurisdiction [to\r\n\nnon-Article III  tribunals] for  the purpose  of emasculating\r\n\nconstitutional courts.\"  Id.  at 850 (citations and quotation\r                                        \r\n\nmarks omitted).  No such concerns are at issue in  this case.\r\n\nThe present appeal does not involve a challenge to Congress's\r\n\nallocation of authority to a non-Article III bankruptcy judge\r\n\nto   resolve  personal  injury  and  wrongful  death  claims.\r\n\nIndeed, the specific provisions in question, viz 28 U.S.C.   \r                                                            \r\n\n157(b)(2)(B) and  157(b)(5), strictly limit the  authority of\r\n\nbankruptcy  judges  with  respect   to  personal  injury  and\r\n\nwrongful death claims.\r\n\n          Though, in  extraordinary  cases, we  may  make  an\r\n\nexception to the raise-or-waive rule where our failure  to do\r\n\nso  would  result in  a gross  miscarriage  of justice,   see\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nCredit Francais Int'l  v.

The effect  of the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's order did  not completely deprive Adams of\r\n\na  remedy for  her  alleged injuries.    Instead, the  ruling\r\n\nsimply  had  the  effect of    estimating  the  value of  her\r\n\nunliquidated tort  claims by  ordering her to  participate in\r\n\nthe  Curley settlement  agreement.   Because,  as we  explain\r\n\ninfra,  Adams  has  failed to  persuade  us  that  the Curley\r                 \r\n\nsettlement will  provide an unreasonable  estimation, we  are\r\n\nlikewise unpersuaded  that giving  effect  to the  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt's  order will  result in  a substantial  miscarriage of\r\n\njustice.\r\n\nC.  Other Matters \r                             \r\n\n          In  her  reply brief,  Adams  directly  attacks the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's use  of the class  action settlement as  a\r\n\nvehicle for estimating her claims.  While title 11 authorizes\r\n\nthe  bankruptcy court to estimate unliquidated and contingent\r\n\nclaims when  necessary for  the prompt administration  of the\r\n\nbankruptcy  estate,  see  11  U.S.C.   502(c),  it  does  not\r                                    \r\n\nprovide methods for conducting  such estimations.  Therefore,\r\n\nin estimating claims, \"bankruptcy courts  should use whatever\r\n\nmethod  is  best  suited  to  the particular  circumstances.\"\r\n\nLawrence P.

Moreover, in this case, because Adams did not attack\r\n\nthe  actual estimates in her opening brief, she has, in fact,\r\n\nwaived consideration of this issue absent a  showing that the\r\n\nestimates  would result  in a  clear miscarriage  of justice.\r\n\nSee  Indian Motocycle  Assocs.  v. Massachusetts  Hous.  Fin.\r                                                                         \r\n\nAgency, 66 F.3d 1246, 1253 n.12 (1st Cir. 1995).  \r                  \r\n\n          On the  particulars of this case,  Adams has failed\r\n\nto convince us that the bankruptcy court's decision to  order\r\n\nher  participation in  the Curley  settlement constituted  an\r\n\nabuse  of  discretion,  much  less  a  clear  miscarriage  of\r\n\njustice.    The claims  asserted  in the  Curley  action were\r\n\nbrought by  employees similarly situated to  Adams, and arose\r\n\nfrom essentially  the same  scheme that  Adams  alleges.   In\r\n\ngeneral, we find  no reason  to think  that a  court-approved\r\n\nsettlement in such a strikingly parallel proceeding would not\r\n\nprovide a  reasonable benchmark  for estimating the  value of\r\n\nAdams's  claims.   Though there  may be  reasons that  such a\r\n\nmethod  for  estimation would  not  be  appropriate in  other\r\n\ncases,  Adams has not provided us  with any compelling reason\r\n\nfor finding it inappropriate here.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          Adams raises several additional issues, including a\r\n\nclaim that the  bankruptcy court's order deprived her  of her\r\n\nSeventh  Amendment  right to  a jury  trial.   We  find these\r\n\nadditional claims either waived, substantially without merit,\r\n\nor  both.   Specifically,  with  respect  to Adams's  Seventh\r\n\nAmendment  argument, filing a proof of  claim in a bankruptcy\r\n\nproceeding, as Adams  has done, generally waives any right to\r\n\na jury trial.   See  Langenkamp v. Culp,  490 U.S. 42,  44-45\r                                                   \r\n\n(1990) (filing  proof  of claim  invokes  bankruptcy  court's\r\n\nequitable   jurisdiction  and  generally  waives  jury  trial\r\n\nright).  We  do note, however, that 28 U.S.C.    1411(a), may\r\n\nrestrict this  general rule  with respect to  personal injury\r\n\nand  wrongful   death  claims.3     Nonetheless,   Adams  has\r\n\nforfeited  the application  of this  provision by  failing to\r\n\nargue that her claims constituted personal injury tort claims\r\n\nto the courts below.  See, e.g., In re Mark Bell, 992 F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n9.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons, we affirm  the decision\r\n\nof the district court.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  28 U.S.C.   1411(a) provides in relevant part that \r\n\n          this chapter and title  11 do not  affect\r\n          any  right  to  trial  by  jury  that  an\r\n          individual  has   under  applicable  non-\r\n          bankruptcy law with regard to  a personal\r\n          injury or wrongful death tort claim.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n",

The appellants, Cheryl Adams and ten other former employees of the debtor (collectively \"Adams\"), claim that the bankruptcy court lacked authority to enter the order because the claims constituted \"personal injury tort claims.\"   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cheryl Adams and ten other former employees of Cumberland Farms, Inc.  (\"CFI\"), filed proofs of claim against CFI in the bankruptcy court for the District of Massachusetts.   The claims stemmed from a pending civil action in which Adams alleged that various CFI officers and supervisors had conspired to recoup inventory losses by falsely accusing Adams and other low-level CFI employees of stealing money and merchandise from CFI stores.   Adams further alleged that these same CFI officials had knowingly coerced Adams and other employees into confessing to the alleged thefts notwithstanding that Adams and the other employees had not committed them.   The complaint in the case asserted claims of false imprisonment, wrongful termination, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of Massachusetts civil rights laws (collectively the \"loss prevention claims\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, CFI reached a tentative settlement in a separate class action suit involving similar loss prevention claims (the \"Curley suit\").   The Curley suit had been brought in New Jersey federal district court by a different group of former CFI employees that did not include Adams.   As part of the proposed Curley settlement, the parties to that agreement filed a joint motion in the Massachusetts bankruptcy court requesting the creation of a mandatory class that would include all loss prevention claimants who had filed proofs of claim in the Massachusetts bankruptcy proceeding (e.g., Adams).   Moreover, the parties further requested that the Massachusetts bankruptcy court use the Curley settlement agreement as a vehicle for estimating and discharging all of the loss prevention claims alleged by individuals in this newly created class.   Adams objected to this motion.   On August 30, 1993, the bankruptcy court granted the motion.   Adams appealed to the Massachusetts federal district court, and the district court affirmed.   Additionally, the New Jersey district court ultimately approved, and the Third Circuit affirmed, the proposed settlement agreement in the Curley suit.   See Curley v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 27 F.3d 556 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to this court, Adams's principal complaint is that the bankruptcy court lacked the authority to enter a final order discharging her claims.   Adams also raises several additional arguments including an attack on the bankruptcy court's estimation of her claims and an assertion that the bankruptcy court's order violated her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.   We begin with a brief overview of the statutory framework and follow with a discussion of Adams's assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Statutory Overview</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1334 vests in the district court a broad grant of subject-matter jurisdiction over all bankruptcy-related matters, expressly providing that the \"district court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11\" and \"original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1334(a), (b);  see also Celotex Corp. v. Edwards, 115 S.Ct. 1493, 1498-99 (1995) (discussing comprehensive scope of &#167; 1334 jurisdictional grant).   The bankruptcy court, in turn, is authorized to hear matters, not as an independent entity, but as \"a unit of the district court.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 151.   Subject-matter jurisdiction remains in the district court, which is authorized, in appropriate circumstances, to refer matters \"to the bankruptcy judges of th[at] district.\"   Id. &#167; 157;  cf.   Northern Pipeline Const.   Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982) (holding unconstitutional previous statutory scheme that authorized bankruptcy courts to exercise independently all jurisdiction conferred to the district courts under the bankruptcy laws).   The district court's power of referral extends to any case or proceeding for which it has subject-matter jurisdiction under &#167; 1334.   See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157.   The district court, however, may withdraw any matter referred under this provision for cause shown on its own motion or by the request of either party.   Id. &#167; 157(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court may refer all matters for which it has jurisdiction under &#167; 1334, the power of the bankruptcy judge to enter final orders in a referred proceeding is limited.   See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157.   In general, a bankruptcy judge may hear and finally determine only core bankruptcy proceedings.   Id. &#167; 157(a).   Core proceedings are those that involve rights that are created by, and depend on, the bankruptcy laws for their existence.   In re G.S.F. Corp., 938 F.2d 1467, 1475 (1st Cir.1991);  see also In re Arnold Print Works, Inc., 815 F.2d 165, 166-67 (1st Cir.1987) (reading the legislative history as indicating that a bankruptcy court's core authority should be interpreted broadly).   Section 157 sets forth a nonexhaustive list of \"core proceedings\" that includes such obvious matters as \"allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(b)(2)(B), as well as a final broadly-phrased catchall covering most \"other proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the estate,\" id. &#167; 157(b)(2)(O).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bankruptcy judge may also hear a properly referred non-core proceeding otherwise falling within the district court's bankruptcy jurisdiction, but, in general, may only issue proposed findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law subject to the district court's de novo review.   Id. &#167; 157(c)(1).   This non-core authority extends to those matters that, while not directly dependent on the bankruptcy laws for their existence, are nonetheless sufficiently connected to the restructuring of the debtor/creditor relationship to come within the district court's broad jurisdictional grant.   The bankruptcy court is authorized, on its own motion or on the \"timely motion of a party,\" to determine whether a proceeding comes within the court's core or non-core authority.   Id. &#167; 157(b)(3).   Finally, with the consent of the parties, a bankruptcy court may hear and finally determine non-core proceedings within the district court's bankruptcy jurisdiction.

Several express exceptions address and limit the authority of the bankruptcy court over such claims.   See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(b)(2)(B), (O), and &#167; 157(b)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For example, the estimation of unliquidated or contingent personal injury tort claims for the purposes of distribution is explicitly excluded from &#167; 157's list of core proceedings.

Moreover, the district court is instructed to order that personal injury tort and wrongful death claims shall be tried in the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending or in the district in which the claims arose.   Id. &#167; 157(b)(5).   This special status apparently stems from Congress's recognition that most personal injury tort and wrongful death victims stand in a somewhat different relationship with the bankruptcy debtor because they did not voluntarily enter into dealings with the debtor (and accept the risk of loss) in the same sense as traditional bankruptcy claimants.

Essentially, she contests the bankruptcy court's implicit determination that her claims constituted core proceedings.   Adams argues that her claims are non-core because they fall within at least one of several specific exceptions provided for \"personal injury tort\" claims.   Therefore, she contends that, because the proceeding was non-core, the bankruptcy court lacked the authority to enter a final order effectively estimating and discharging her claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not Adams's claims constitute personal injury tort claims is a close question.  Compare In re Atron Inc. of Michigan, 172 B.R. 541, 542-45 (Bankr.W.D.Mich.1994) (\"personal injury tort\" should be read narrowly to exclude emotional distress and other nontraditional personal injury claims), with Poole, 63 B.R. at 529-30 (\"personal injury tort\" should be read broadly to include claims for emotional and mental distress).   We decline, however, to reach the issue in this case.   Adams failed to argue that her claims constituted personal injury tort claims in her objection to the joint motion before the bankruptcy court and, again, in her opening brief before the district court.   Accordingly, she has waived consideration of the issue on appeal to this court.  See, e.g., Fish Market Nominee Corp. v. Pelofsky, 72 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1995) (arguments not raised in bankruptcy court are waived on appeal);  In re Mark Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc., 992 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1993) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, Adams's claim is that she was denied her right to an Article III judge.   That right, which derives from the language of Article III, &#167; 1, is a personal right and is subject to waiver upon a party's failure to assert it.  See Commodity Future Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 848-50 (1986).  Schor, however, makes clear that Article III, &#167; 1, protects other non-waivable institutional interests by barring \"congressional attempts to transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the purpose of emasculating constitutional courts.\"  Id. at 850 (citations and quotation marks omitted).   No such concerns are at issue in this case.   The present appeal does not involve a challenge to Congress's allocation of authority to a non-Article III bankruptcy judge to resolve personal injury and wrongful death claims.   Indeed, the specific provisions in question, viz 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 157(b)(2)(B) and 157(b)(5), strictly limit the authority of bankruptcy judges with respect to personal injury and wrongful death claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though, in extraordinary cases, we may make an exception to the raise-or-waive rule where our failure to do so would result in a gross miscarriage of justice, see Credit Francais Int'l v. Bio-Vita, Ltd., 78 F.3d 698, 709 (1st Cir.1996), Adams has not persuaded us that such an exception is warranted in this case.   The effect of the bankruptcy court's order did not completely deprive Adams of a remedy for her alleged injuries.   Instead, the ruling simply had the effect of estimating the value of her unliquidated tort claims by ordering her to participate in the Curley settlement agreement.   Because, as we explain infra, Adams has failed to persuade us that the Curley settlement will provide an unreasonable estimation, we are likewise unpersuaded that giving effect to the bankruptcy court's order will result in a substantial miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Matters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her reply brief, Adams directly attacks the bankruptcy court's use of the class action settlement as a vehicle for estimating her claims.   While title 11 authorizes the bankruptcy court to estimate unliquidated and contingent claims when necessary for the prompt administration of the bankruptcy estate, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 502(c), it does not provide methods for conducting such estimations.   Therefore, in estimating claims, \"bankruptcy courts should use whatever method is best suited to the particular circumstances.\"   Lawrence P. King, 3 Collier on Bankruptcy p 502.03, at 502-76 (15th ed.1995).   The bankruptcy courts are afforded substantial deference in this area, and errors assigned both to its estimates and its methods for achieving such estimates generally will be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.  Matter of Continental Airlines, 981 F.2d 1450, 1461 (5th Cir.1993);  Bittner v. Borne Chem.  Co., 691 F.2d 134, 136 (3d Cir.1982).   Moreover, in this case, because Adams did not attack the actual estimates in her opening brief, she has, in fact, waived consideration of this issue absent a showing that the estimates would result in a clear miscarriage of justice.  See Indian Motocycle Assocs. v. Massachusetts Hous.  Fin. Agency, 66 F.3d 1246, 1253 n. 12 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the particulars of this case, Adams has failed to convince us that the bankruptcy court's decision to order her participation in the Curley settlement constituted an abuse of discretion, much less a clear miscarriage of justice.   The claims asserted in the Curley action were brought by employees similarly situated to Adams, and arose from essentially the same scheme that Adams alleges.   In general, we find no reason to think that a court-approved settlement in such a strikingly parallel proceeding would not provide a reasonable benchmark for estimating the value of Adams's claims.   Though there may be reasons that such a method for estimation would not be appropriate in other cases, Adams has not provided us with any compelling reason for finding it inappropriate here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adams raises several additional issues, including a claim that the bankruptcy court's order deprived her of her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.   We find these additional claims either waived, substantially without merit, or both.   Specifically, with respect to Adams's Seventh Amendment argument, filing a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding, as Adams has done, generally waives any right to a jury trial.   See Langenkamp v. Culp, 490 U.S. 42, 44-45 (1990) (filing proof of claim invokes bankruptcy court's equitable jurisdiction and generally waives jury trial right).   We do note, however, that 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1411(a), may restrict this general rule with respect to personal injury and wrongful death claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Nonetheless, Adams has forfeited the application of this provision by failing to argue that her claims constituted personal injury tort claims to the courts below.

This is not surprising.   The district court's \"related to\" jurisdiction under &#167; 1334(b) is expansive.  See Celotex Corp. v. Edwards, 115 S.Ct. 1493, 1499 (1995) (\"Congress did not delineate the scope of 'related to' jurisdiction, but its choice of words suggests a grant of some breadth.\").  \" 'The usual articulation of the test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related to bankruptcy is whether the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.' \"   In re G.S.F., 938 at 1475 (quoting Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, 743 F.2d 984, 994 (3d Cir.1984)).

(\"CFI\"), filed proofs of claim against CFI in the bankruptcy court for the District of Massachusetts.   The claims stemmed from a pending civil action in which Adams alleged that various CFI officers and supervisors had conspired to recoup inventory losses by falsely accusing Adams and other low-level CFI employees of stealing money and merchandise from CFI stores.   Adams further alleged that these same CFI officials had knowingly coerced Adams and other employees into confessing to the alleged thefts notwithstanding that Adams and the other employees had not committed them.   The complaint in the case asserted claims of false imprisonment, wrongful termination, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of Massachusetts civil rights laws (collectively the \"loss prevention claims\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, CFI reached a tentative settlement in a separate class action suit involving similar loss prevention claims (the \"Curley suit\").   The Curley suit had been brought in New Jersey federal district court by a different group of former CFI employees that did not include Adams.   As part of the proposed Curley settlement, the parties to that agreement filed a joint motion in the Massachusetts bankruptcy court requesting the creation of a mandatory class that would include all loss prevention claimants who had filed proofs of claim in the Massachusetts bankruptcy proceeding (e.g., Adams).   Moreover, the parties further requested that the Massachusetts bankruptcy court use the Curley settlement agreement as a vehicle for estimating and discharging all of the loss prevention claims alleged by individuals in this newly created class.   Adams objected to this motion.   On August 30, 1993, the bankruptcy court granted the motion.   Adams appealed to the Massachusetts federal district court, and the district court affirmed.   Additionally, the New Jersey district court ultimately approved, and the Third Circuit affirmed, the proposed settlement agreement in the Curley suit.   See Curley v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></span> (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to this court, Adams's principal complaint is that the bankruptcy court lacked the authority to enter a final order discharging her claims.   Adams also raises several additional arguments including an attack on the bankruptcy court's estimation of her claims and an assertion that the bankruptcy court's order violated her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.   We begin with a brief overview of the statutory framework and follow with a discussion of Adams's assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

The district court's power of referral extends to any case or proceeding for which it has subject-matter jurisdiction under &#167; 1334.   See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157.

Pelofsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196487\"><a href=\"/opinion/196487/fish-market-v-childress/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1995) (arguments not raised in bankruptcy court are waived on appeal);  In re Mark Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605603\"><a href=\"/opinion/605603/bankr-l-rep-p-75253-in-re-mark-bell-furniture-warehouse-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1993) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, Adams's claim is that she was denied her right to an Article III judge.   That right, which derives from the language of Article III, &#167; 1, is a personal right and is subject to waiver upon a party's failure to assert it.  See Commodity Future Trading Comm'n v. Schor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111759\"><a href=\"/opinion/111759/commodity-futures-trading-commn-v-schor/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 848-50 (1986).  Schor, however, makes clear that Article III, &#167; 1, protects other non-waivable institutional interests by barring \"congressional attempts to transfer jurisdiction [to non-Article III tribunals] for the purpose of emasculating constitutional courts.\"  Id. at 850 (citations and quotation marks omitted).   No such concerns are at issue in this case.   The present appeal does not involve a challenge to Congress's allocation of authority to a non-Article III bankruptcy judge to resolve personal injury and wrongful death claims.   Indeed, the specific provisions in question, viz 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 157(b)(2)(B) and 157(b)(5), strictly limit the authority of bankruptcy judges with respect to personal injury and wrongful death claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though, in extraordinary cases, we may make an exception to the raise-or-waive rule where our failure to do so would result in a gross miscarriage of justice, see Credit Francais Int'l v. Bio-Vita, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196607\"><a href=\"/opinion/196607/credit-francais-v-bio-vita-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 709 (1st Cir.1996), Adams has not persuaded us that such an exception is warranted in this case.   The effect of the bankruptcy court's order did not completely deprive Adams of a remedy for her alleged injuries.   Instead, the ruling simply had the effect of estimating the value of her unliquidated tort claims by ordering her to participate in the Curley settlement agreement.   Because, as we explain infra, Adams has failed to persuade us that the Curley settlement will provide an unreasonable estimation, we are likewise unpersuaded that giving effect to the bankruptcy court's order will result in a substantial miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Other Matters</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her reply brief, Adams directly attacks the bankruptcy court's use of the class action settlement as a vehicle for estimating her claims.   While title 11 authorizes the bankruptcy court to estimate unliquidated and contingent claims when necessary for the prompt administration of the bankruptcy estate, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 502(c), it does not provide methods for conducting such estimations.   Therefore, in estimating claims, \"bankruptcy courts should use whatever method is best suited to the particular circumstances.\"   Lawrence P. King, 3 Collier on Bankruptcy p 502.03, at 502-76 (15th ed.1995).   The bankruptcy courts are afforded substantial deference in this area, and errors assigned both to its estimates and its methods for achieving such estimates generally will be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.  Matter of Continental Airlines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597118\"><a href=\"/opinion/597118/in-the-matter-of-continental-airlines-debtors-joseph-e-oneill-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span>, 1461 (5th Cir.1993);  Bittner v. Borne Chem.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409652\"><a href=\"/opinion/409652/john-w-bittner-isa-r-coble-william-t-galey-walter-b-levering-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 136 (3d Cir.1982).   Moreover, in this case, because Adams did not attack the actual estimates in her opening brief, she has, in fact, waived consideration of this issue absent a showing that the estimates would result in a clear miscarriage of justice.  See Indian Motocycle Assocs. v. Massachusetts Hous.  Fin. Agency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196328\"><a href=\"/opinion/196328/mhfa-v-indian-motocycle/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1246</span></a></span>, 1253 n. 12 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the particulars of this case, Adams has failed to convince us that the bankruptcy court's decision to order her participation in the Curley settlement constituted an abuse of discretion, much less a clear miscarriage of justice.   The claims asserted in the Curley action were brought by employees similarly situated to Adams, and arose from essentially the same scheme that Adams alleges.   In general, we find no reason to think that a court-approved settlement in such a strikingly parallel proceeding would not provide a reasonable benchmark for estimating the value of Adams's claims.   Though there may be reasons that such a method for estimation would not be appropriate in other cases, Adams has not provided us with any compelling reason for finding it inappropriate here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adams raises several additional issues, including a claim that the bankruptcy court's order deprived her of her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.   We find these additional claims either waived, substantially without merit, or both.   Specifically, with respect to Adams's Seventh Amendment argument, filing a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding, as Adams has done, generally waives any right to a jury trial.   See Langenkamp v. Culp, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span>, 44-45 (1990) (filing proof of claim invokes bankruptcy court's equitable jurisdiction and generally waives jury trial right).   We do note, however, that 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1411(a), may restrict this general rule with respect to personal injury and wrongful death claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Nonetheless, Adams has forfeited the application of this provision by failing to argue that her claims constituted personal injury tort claims to the courts below.  See, e.g., In re Mark Bell, 992 F.2d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Subsection 157(b)(2) provides, in relevant part, that core proceedings include:</p>\n        <p>(B) allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate or exemptions from property of the estate, and estimation of claims or interest for the purposes of confirming a plan under chapter 11, 12 or 13 of title 11 but not the liquidation or estimation of contingent or unliquidated personal injury tort or wrongful death claims against the estate for purposes of distribution in a case under title 11</p>\n        <p>(O) other proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the estate or the adjustment of the debtor-creditor or the equity security holder relationship, except personal injury tort or wrongful death claims.</p>\n        <p>28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(b)(2) (emphasis added).   Subsection 157(b)(5) provides that:</p>\n        <p>The district court shall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death claims shall be tried in the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending, or in the district court in the district in which the claim arose, as determined by the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending.</p>\n        <p>28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(b)(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Adams does not contend that her claims against the estate were outside the district court's broad grant of subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1334.   This is not surprising.   The district court's \"related to\" jurisdiction under &#167; 1334(b) is expansive.  See Celotex Corp. v. Edwards, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117920\"><a href=\"/opinion/117920/celotex-corp-v-edwards/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1493</span></a></span>, 1499 (1995) (\"Congress did not delineate the scope of 'related to' jurisdiction, but its choice of words suggests a grant of some breadth.\").  \" 'The usual articulation of the test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related to bankruptcy is whether the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.' \"   In re G.S.F., 938 at 1475 (quoting Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"441761\"><a href=\"/opinion/441761/in-re-pacor-inc-v-john-higgins-jr-and-louise-higgins/\"><span class=\"volume\">743</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 994 (3d Cir.1984)).   We have little doubt that proceedings, such as this one, involving the estimation and discharge of proofs of claim filed against the estate by a bankruptcy creditor come within this broad range</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1411(a) provides in relevant part that</p>\n        <p>this chapter and title 11 do not affect any right to trial by jury that an individual has under applicable non-bankruptcy law with regard to a personal injury or wrongful death tort claim.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
