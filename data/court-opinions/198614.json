Plaintiff-appellant Nautilus\r\nInsurance Company (\"Nautilus\") appeals from the district court's\r\nentry of summary judgment in favor of its insured, defendant-\r\nappellee Michael G. Jabar, d/b/a Mike's Roofing Company (\"Jabar\"). \r\nIn the underlying action, Nautilus sought a declaratory judgment\r\nfrom the district court that it was not obligated to defend and/or\r\nindemnify Jabar in connection with a civil action filed against\r\nJabar by Lisa and Stephen Varano (\"the Varanos\").  The district\r\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of Jabar on the ground that\r\nthe total pollution exclusion clause relied upon by Nautilus to\r\ndeny coverage was ambiguous as a matter of law. \r\n                   BACKGROUND\r\nOn or about June 3, 1997, the Varanos commenced a civil\r\naction against Jabar in the United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Maine alleging that in February and March of 1995 Lisa\r\nVarano was exposed to hazardous fumes discharged by roofing\r\nproducts used by Jabar to repair the roof at Lisa Varano's place of\r\nemployment.  The complaint alleges that due to the inhalation of\r\nthese fumes, Lisa Varano now suffers from occupational asthma.  In\r\ntheir complaint, the Varanos sought damages to compensate them for\r\nLisa's personal injuries and for Stephen's loss of consortium.  The\r\ncomplaint does not allege, nor has Nautilus ever suggested, that\r\nJabar in any way misused the roofing products that are alleged to\r\nhave caused Lisa Varano's injuries.\r\nAt the time of Lisa's exposure to the fumes, Jabar was\r\ninsured under a commercial lines insurance policy issued by\r\nNautilus.  Jabar notified Nautilus of the suit against him, and\r\nNautilus undertook his defense, under a reservation of rights.  \r\nEventually, Nautilus concluded that it was not obligated\r\nto defend or indemnify Jabar in connection with the Varanos' claims\r\ndue to the existence of a total pollution exclusion clause in\r\nJabar's policy.  This clause excludes coverage for:\r\n         (1)  'Bodily injury' or 'property damage'\r\nwhich would not have occurred in whole or in\r\npart but for the actual, alleged or threatened\r\ndischarge, dispersal, seepage, migration,\r\nrelease or escape of pollutants at any time.\r\n\n                              . . . .\r\n\n         Pollutants means any solid, liquid, gaseous,\r\nor thermal irritant or contaminant including\r\nsmoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acid, alkalis,\r\nchemicals and waste . . . .\r\n\nOn September 9, 1997, Nautilus instituted the underlying\r\ndeclaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the claims\r\nasserted against Jabar fell unambiguously within the scope of the\r\ntotal pollution exclusion clause.  On February 4, 1998, Nautilus\r\nmoved for summary judgment, asking the district court to rule, as\r\na matter of law, that Nautilus was not obligated to defend or\r\nindemnify Jabar in connection with the Varanos' claims.  Jabar\r\nopposed the motion, and at the same time requested that summary\r\njudgment be entered in his favor.  By order dated April 29, 1998,\r\nthe district court granted Nautilus's motion only as to any claims\r\nfor indemnification for any award of punitive damages, and denied\r\nit as to any claims for indemnification for any award of\r\ncompensatory damages.  On October 1, 1998, the district court\r\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Jabar \"on the same basis and\r\nreasoning as the decision granting in part and denying in part\r\n[Nautilus's] motion.\"  This appeal followed.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\nde novo.  See Dominique v. Weld, 73 F.3d 1156, 1158 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  The sole issue on appeal is whether the Varanos' claims\r\nfall unambiguously within the scope of the total pollution\r\nexclusion clause contained in the Nautilus policy.  Nautilus argues\r\nthat the district court erred in concluding that the Varanos'\r\nclaims did not fall clearly within the scope of the exclusion\r\nclause.  Nautilus contends that there clearly was a \"discharge,\"\r\n\"dispersal,\" \"release\" or \"escape\" of toluene disocyanate (\"TDI\"),\r\na \"pollutant,\" which caused \"bodily injury\" in the form of\r\noccupational asthma to Lisa Varano.  Jabar, on the other hand,\r\ncontends that the district court correctly concluded that the\r\nexclusion clause is ambiguous because the clause could reasonably\r\nbe interpreted to exclude coverage only for environmental\r\npollution, and not damages due to routine commercial hazards.\r\nUnder Maine law, whether the language of an insurance\r\ncontract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.  See\r\nGeyerhahn v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., 724 A.2d\r\n1258, 1261 (Me. 1999).  Insurance contract language is ambiguous\r\n\"if it is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.\" \r\nCambridge Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Vallee, 687 A.2d 956, 957 (Me.\r\n1996).  Maine courts have also found policy language ambiguous \"if\r\nan ordinary person in the shoes of an insured would not understand\r\nthat the policy did not cover claims such as those brought.\" \r\nPeerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon, 564 A.2d 383 (Me. 1989).  In applying\r\nthese rules of construction, the court should view the policy\r\nlanguage \"from the perspective of an average person, untrained in\r\nthe law or the insurance field, in light of what a more than casual\r\nreading of the policy would reveal to an ordinarily intelligent\r\ninsured.\"  Peerless Ins. Co. v. Wood, 685 A.2d 1173, 1174 (Me.\r\n1996).\r\nWe agree with the district court that the total pollution\r\nexclusion clause is ambiguous as applied to the Varanos' claims\r\nbecause an ordinarily intelligent insured could reasonably\r\ninterpret the pollution exclusion clause as applying only to\r\nenvironmental pollution.  Put another way, we agree that an\r\nordinary person in Jabar's shoes would not understand that the\r\npolicy did not cover personal injury claims like those asserted by\r\nthe Varanos.\r\nFirst, the terms used in the exclusion clause, such as\r\n\"discharge,\" \"dispersal,\" \"release\" and \"escape,\" are terms of art\r\nin environmental law and are generally used to refer to damage or\r\ninjury resulting from environmental pollution.  See Atlantic Mut.\r\nIns. Co. v. McFadden, 595 N.E.2d 762, 764 (Mass. 1992) (\"[T]he\r\nterms used in the pollution exclusion 'discharge,' 'dispersal,'\r\n'release,' and 'escape' are terms of art in environmental law which\r\ngenerally are used with reference to damage or injury caused by\r\nimproper disposal or containment of hazardous waste.\"); West\r\nAmerican Ins. Co. v. Tufco Flooring East, Inc., 409 S.E.2D 692, 699\r\n(N.C. Ct. App. 1991) (noting that the terms 'discharge' and\r\n'release' are terms of art in environmental law).  Given this\r\nlanguage, it is entirely reasonable that an ordinarily intelligent\r\ninsured would understand this provision to exclude coverage only\r\nfor injuries caused by traditional environmental pollution.  As the\r\nmagistrate judge observed, an individual, like Jabar, engaged in a\r\nbusiness not known to present the risk of environmental pollution\r\n\"would not understand that the Nautilus policy exclude[d] coverage\r\nfor injuries arising from the use of products associated with that\r\nbusiness for the purpose for which those products [were] intended.\" \r\nIndeed, such an interpretation would render the Nautilus policy\r\nvirtually meaningless to Jabar.  See Tufco, 409 S.E.2d at 697 (\"To\r\nallow West American to deny coverage for claims arising out of\r\nTufco's central business activity would render the policy virtually\r\nuseless to Tufco.\").\r\nWe also find ambiguity in the exclusion's definition of\r\n\"pollutant.\"  The Nautilus policy defines \"pollutant\" as \"any\r\nsolid, liquid, gaseous, or thermal irritant or contaminant.\"  As\r\nother courts have observed, the terms \"irritant\" and \"contaminant\"\r\nare virtually boundless, for \"there is no substance or chemical in\r\nexistence that would not irritate or damage some person or\r\nproperty.\"  Pipefitters Welfare Educational Fund v. Westchester\r\nFire Ins. Co., 976 F.2d 1037, 1043 (7th Cir. 1992) (quoting\r\nWestchester Fire Ins. Co. v. City of Pittsburgh, 768 F. Supp. 1463,\r\n1470 (D. Kan. 1991)).  A purely literal interpretation of this\r\nlanguage, without regard to the fact pattern alleged in the\r\nunderlying complaint, would surely stretch the intended meaning of\r\nthe policy exclusion.  As one court has observed, \"[w]ithout some\r\nlimiting principle, the pollution exclusion clause would extend far\r\nbeyond its intended scope, and lead to some absurd results.\"  See\r\nPipefitters, 976 F.2d at 1043.  Accordingly, we agree with those\r\ncourts which have restricted the exclusion's scope to only those\r\nhazards traditionally associated with environmental pollution. \r\nSee, e.g., Stoney Run Co. v. Prudential-LMI Commercial Ins. Co., 47\r\nF.3d 34, 38 (2d Cir. 1995) (the pollution exclusion clause can be\r\nreasonably interpreted as applying only to environmental\r\npollution); Regional Bank of Colorado, N.A. v. St. Paul Fire &amp;\r\nMarine Ins. Co., 35 F.3d 494, 498 (10th Cir. 1994) (\"It seems far\r\nmore reasonable that a policyholder would understand the exclusion\r\nas being limited to irritants and contaminants commonly thought of\r\nas [environmental] pollutants and not as applying to every possible\r\nirritant or contaminant imaginable.\"); American Ins. Co. v. Koloms,\r\n687 N.E.2d 72, 82 (Ill. 1997) (\"we hold that the exclusion applies\r\nonly to those injuries caused by traditional environmental\r\npollution\"); McFadden, 595 N.E.2d at 764 (\"We conclude that an\r\ninsured could reasonably have understood the provision at issue to\r\nexclude coverage for injury caused by certain forms of industrial\r\npollution, but not for coverage for injury allegedly caused by the\r\npresence of lead materials in a private residence.\"); Tufco, 409\r\nS.E.2d at 699 (\"The historical purpose of the pollution exclusion\r\nlimits the scope of the exclusion to environmental damage.\").\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the total\r\npollution exclusion clause in the Nautilus policy is ambiguous as\r\na matter of law as applied to the Varanos' claims.  See Stoney Run,\r\n47 F.3d at 37 (noting that an exclusionary clause can be ambiguous\r\nin one context but not in another).  It is a well-settled principle\r\nof Maine law that if the language of an insurance policy is\r\nambiguous, it will be construed \"against the insurer in favor of\r\ncoverage.\"  Geyerhahn v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 724\r\nA.2d 1258, 1261 (Me. 1999) (quoting Genthner v. Progressive Cas.\r\nIns. Co., 681 A.2d 479, 482 (Me. 1996)).  We therefore construe the\r\ntotal pollution exclusion clause against Nautilus, and in favor of\r\ncoverage.  See id.                            CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee. \r\n",

See Tufco, 409 S.E.2d at 697 (\"To\r\nallow West American to deny coverage for claims arising out of\r\nTufco's central business activity would render the policy virtually\r\nuseless to Tufco.\").\r\nWe also find ambiguity in the exclusion's definition of\r\n\"pollutant.\"  The Nautilus policy defines \"pollutant\" as \"any\r\nsolid, liquid, gaseous, or thermal irritant or contaminant.\"  As\r\nother courts have observed, the terms \"irritant\" and \"contaminant\"\r\nare virtually boundless, for \"there is no substance or chemical in\r\nexistence that would not irritate or damage some person or\r\nproperty.\"  Pipefitters Welfare Educational Fund v.

A purely literal interpretation of this\r\nlanguage, without regard to the fact pattern alleged in the\r\nunderlying complaint, would surely stretch the intended meaning of\r\nthe policy exclusion.  As one court has observed, \"[w]ithout some\r\nlimiting principle, the pollution exclusion clause would extend far\r\nbeyond its intended scope, and lead to some absurd results.\"  See\r\nPipefitters, 976 F.2d at 1043.  Accordingly, we agree with those\r\ncourts which have restricted the exclusion's scope to only those\r\nhazards traditionally associated with environmental pollution. \r\nSee, e.g., Stoney Run Co. v. Prudential-LMI Commercial Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"688717\"><a href=\"/opinion/688717/stoney-run-company-and-larrymore-organization-v-prudential-lmi-commercial/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (2d Cir. 1995) (the pollution exclusion clause can be\r\nreasonably interpreted as applying only to environmental\r\npollution); Regional Bank of Colorado, N.A. v.

See Stoney Run,\r\n47 F.3d at 37 (noting that an exclusionary clause can be ambiguous\r\nin one context but not in another).  It is a well-settled principle\r\nof Maine law that if the language of an insurance policy is\r\nambiguous, it will be construed \"against the insurer in favor of\r\ncoverage.\"  Geyerhahn v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1261 (Me. 1999) (quoting Genthner v.

We therefore construe the\r\ntotal pollution exclusion clause against Nautilus, and in favor of\r\ncoverage.  See id.                            CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee. \r\n</pre>",
