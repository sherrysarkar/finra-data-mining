Vazquez-Berrios,  Deputy  Chief,\r                                                             \r\nCriminal Division, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   Upon  careful  review of  the  briefs and\r                            \r\n\nrecord, it  clearly appears  that no substantial  question is\r\n\npresented and that summary disposition is appropriate.  \r\n\n     Defendant's drug sentence  was within the  legislatively\r\n\nauthorized  sentencing range  for  that offense,  and so  the\r\n\nsubsequent sentence for failure  to appear did not constitute\r\n\ndouble jeopardy,  even though  the drug sentence  included an\r\n\nenhancement for obstruction  of justice based on  defendant's\r\n\nfailure  to appear.  See  United States v.  Jernigan, 60 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n562, 564-65 (9th Cir. 1995).  \r\n\n     Further,  the total of the two sentences imposed for the\r\n\ndrug offense and  the failure to appear  offense (113 months)\r\n\nwas within  the applicable  sentencing guideline  range which\r\n\nwould have applied if the two sentences had been imposed in a\r\n\nsingle  proceeding (97 to 121 months).   Therefore, the total\r\n\nsentence  was  consistent  with  the  sentencing  guidelines,\r\n\nincluding  U.S.S.G.     2J1.6  Application Note  3 and  3C1.1\r\n\nApplication Note  6, and there was no double counting problem\r\n\nhere.
