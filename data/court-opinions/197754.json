This case is  another in a\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.   \r                                           \r\n\nseries of cases  arising out of the elections  in Puerto Rico\r\n\nin 1992, in  which the New Progressive Party  (NPP) won power\r\n\nfrom its rival,  the Popular Democratic Party  (PDP).  During\r\n\nthe  current decade, plaintiffs  in these cases  usually have\r\n\nbeen members  of the PDP  who complain that the  incoming NPP\r\n\nadministration  has deprived them of their government jobs in\r\n\nviolation  of their  rights under  the First Amendment.1   In\r\n\nthis  case, plaintiff  Waldo G.  Vazquez,  an NPP  supporter,\r\n\nclaims his job  at a government contractor was  eliminated as\r\n\npart of an  internal party feud.   He sues his employer,  its\r\n\nmajor client  (a public  corporation),  and a  member of  the\r\n\nclient's board under 42 U.S.C.   1983 (1994).\r\n\n          The   district  court   concluded  that   Vazquez's\r\n\nevidence,  principally his own testimony, amounted to no more\r\n\nthan \"hearsay upon hearsay\" and \"rumors, hearsay, gossip, his\r\n\npersonal  feelings, his intuition  and his  conclusions,\" and\r\n\ngranted summary judgment for defendants.  Vazquez argues that\r\n\nthe district court  committed error in excluding  evidence as\r\n\nhearsay  when   the  statements  were  admissions  by  party-\r\n\nopponents.  Thus, we explore in some detail the  requirements\r\n\nof Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) as to party-opponent admissions, a\r\n\nrecurring issue in employment cases.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  See, e.g., Acosta-Orozco v.  Rodriguez-de-Rivera, No. 97-\r                                                                \r\n1489,  1997 WL  775350, at  *8 n.1  (1st Cir. Dec.  22, 1997)\r\n(citing cases).\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          We   agree   with   Vazquez  that   some   of   the\r\n\nconversations which the  district court  excluded on  hearsay\r\n\ngrounds  are admissions of  a party-opponent and  should have\r\n\nbeen considered as  part of his case.   To win the  battle is\r\n\nnot necessarily to win the war.  Because the evidence Vazquez\r\n\npresents  is  insufficient  to  create  a  genuine  issue  of\r\n\nmaterial fact in any event, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          We state the facts  in the light most  favorable to\r\n\nthe  party   opposing  summary  judgment,   Acosta-Orozco  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nRodriguez-de-Rivera,  No. 97-1489, 1997 WL 775350, at *1 (1st\r                               \r\n\nCir. Dec. 22 1997), and describe the evidence in some detail.\r\n\n          Waldo Vazquez was employed for many years by Puerto\r\n\nRico Maritime Management, Inc. (PRMMI), a private corporation\r\n\nthat provides management  services to the Puerto  Rico Marine\r\n\nShipping  Authority (PRMSA), a  public corporation created by\r\n\nthe Puerto  Rico legislature.   PRMSA's  Governing Board  has\r\n\nseven  members  appointed  by the  Governor  of  Puerto Rico,\r\n\nsubject to confirmation by the Commonwealth's Senate.  See 23\r                                                                      \r\n\nL.P.R.A.    3054  (1994).     PRMSA  acknowledges  it   is  a\r\n\ngovernment  agency,  and we  have  held  it is  a  \"political\r\n\nsubdivision\" of  the Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico under  the\r\n\nNational   Labor  Relations  Act.     See  Chaparro-Febus  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nInternational Longshoremen  Ass'n, Local 1575,  983 F.2d  325\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).  At the time of his dismissal from  PRMMI in\r\n\n1993,  Vazquez held the  title Vice President  of Operations,\r\n\nCaribbean Division.\r\n\n          In 1992, a new contract between PRMSA and PRMMI was\r\n\nsigned,  giving  authority  to  the  PRMSA  Board  over  \"key\r\n\npersonnel\" within  PRMMI.    PRMSA was  given  the  right  to\r\n\ndismiss high-level  PRMMI employees \"for any  material breach\r\n\nof its contract by such [PRMMI] key personnel and/or for just\r\n\ncause.\"  Vazquez's  position was among those  designated \"key\r\n\npersonnel.\" \r\n\n          In  1993, PRMSA had accumulated losses in excess of\r\n\n$300 million.   Vazquez does  not dispute this.   On February\r\n\n24,  1993, the  PRMSA Board  voted,  in light  of these  high\r\n\nlosses, to authorize a reduction-in-force (RIF) of twenty-six\r\n\nemployees at PRMMI; eventually  at least forty-one employees'\r\n\njobs were  eliminated.   Vazquez's position  was among  those\r\n\nselected for  elimination, either  directly by  the Board  or\r\n\npursuant  to its  RIF directive.    The record  is not  clear\r\n\nwhether  Vazquez's   position  was  among   those  originally\r\n\nselected  for elimination  by the  Board.   However, as  some\r\n\nevidence  supports the  conclusion  that  the Board  directly\r\n\nauthorized Vazquez's dismissal, we will assume that it did.\r\n\n          In late March  1993, Steve  Schulein, a  high-level\r\n\nPRMMI  official,  informed  Vazquez  over  breakfast  at  the\r\n\nAmbassador Plaza Hotel in Puerto  Rico that his position  was\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ngoing to be eliminated at  the beginning of April.  According\r\n\nto Vazquez's testimony, Schulein told Vazquez that he did not\r\n\nunderstand why  Vazquez was  to  be dismissed,  and that  the\r\n\nelimination of his position had not been part of the original\r\n\nreorganization plan submitted  to the PRMSA Board.   Schulein\r\n\nsaid that he understood that  the decision came from a member\r\n\nof  the PRMSA  Board.   This conversation  took place  in the\r\n\nperiod when the other PRMMI employees were also being let go.\r\n\n          The next day, Vazquez called Manuel Luis del Valle,\r\n\nChairman of  the  Governing  Board  of  PRMSA,  in  order  to\r\n\nascertain  why his position had been selected for elimination\r\n\nin the Board's new plans for PRMMI's reorganization.  Vazquez\r\n\ntold Del  Valle that  his dismissal \"was  an injustice  and a\r\n\npersecution.\"   Vazquez argued that similar employees had not\r\n\nbeen eliminated, and that he had rejected the company's early\r\n\nretirement program  two years  before because  he needed  the\r\n\nsalary and felt  he still had much to offer the company.  Del\r\n\nValle  promised  he  would help  Vazquez  fight  his proposed\r\n\ndismissal, because,  according to  Vazquez,  Del Valle  \"also\r\n\nunderstood that it was an injustice.\"\r\n\n          On  April  2,  1993,   Vazquez  received  a  letter\r\n\ninforming  him  that  \"due  to  [PRMMI's]  current  financial\r\n\ncondition you will be laid off . . . .\"  \r\n\n          Vazquez continued his inquiries  and protests about\r\n\nhis dismissal.  At some later time, Del Valle told Vazquez of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\na conversation  Del Valle  had with  Carlos Lopez-Rosario,  a\r\n\nmember of the  PRMSA Board.  According to  Vazquez, Del Valle\r\n\ntold him that Lopez had told Del Valle that \"the problem\" was\r\n\nthat Vazquez  had \"political  differences\" with  Lopez.   The\r\n\nrecord is unclear when the conversation between Lopez and Del\r\n\nValle supposedly took place or  whether it had anything to do\r\n\nwith  Vazquez's   dismissal.    Del  Valle's   comments  also\r\n\nconfirmed  what Vazquez  calls  \"hallway  gossip\" that  Lopez\r\n\ndisliked Vazquez.\r\n\n          Vazquez    suspected    that    these    \"political\r\n\ndifferences\" stemmed from the NPP's gubernatorial primary  in\r\n\n1992.   Vazquez had  supported the  losing candidate,  Carlos\r\n\nRomero-Barcelo  (\"Romero\"), now  the Commonwealth's  Resident\r\n\nCommissioner  in Washington,  while Lopez  had supported  the\r\n\nwinner, Pedro Rosello, now the Governor of Puerto Rico.  \r\n\n          Vazquez speculated that this disagreement must have\r\n\nmotivated his dismissal.   He remembered a  conversation with\r\n\nLopez a few years earlier at an NPP activity in the home of a\r\n\nprominent  supporter.   Vazquez had expressed  his preference\r\n\nfor  Romero  as  a  gubernatorial  candidate  and  Lopez  had\r\n\ndisagreed, arguing for Rosello.  Vazquez also speculated that\r\n\nLopez  might  be retaliating  against  him  for the  work  of\r\n\nVazquez's  wife  in  organizing a  women's  group  to support\r\n\nRomero in a political campaign almost two decades earlier.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          According   to  Vazquez,   Miguel  Rossy,   PRMMI's\r\n\nPresident,  confirmed in a conversation at a local restaurant\r\n\nthat  Vazquez's position  was not  included  in the  original\r\n\nreorganization  plan and  that  the  decision  came  from  an\r\n\nunnamed PRMSA  Board member,  \"[s]omebody  who doesn't  . . .\r\n\nlike  you, who  is  opposed  to  Carlos  [Romero's]  people.\"\r\n\nVazquez took this unnamed person to be Lopez.\r\n\n          On  several  occasions,  Vazquez  also  asked  both\r\n\nCommissioner  Romero  and  Governor   Rosello  personally  to\r\n\nintervene and reverse the decision, citing his long record of\r\n\nservice with PRMMI.  The  Governor told Vazquez that he would\r\n\nhave  to handle  the  issue  with  the PRMSA  Board  himself.\r\n\nAccording to Vazquez, at some point Ricardo Gonzalez, a PRMSA\r\n\nBoard  member, told  Vazquez that  he  had tried  to get  the\r\n\ndecision  reversed, but that  \"the pressure was  too strong.\"\r\n\nGonzalez did not explain what  he meant by \"pressure,\" or who\r\n\nwas applying pressure.\r\n\n          Finally,  in  May  1993,  Vazquez  met  with  Lopez\r\n\npersonally in Lopez's  office at PRMSA.  Vazquez  asked Lopez\r\n\nwhether   what  Del  Valle  had  told  him  about  \"political\r\n\ndifferences\"  was true.  Lopez replied, according to Vazquez,\r\n\n\"I made some remarks . . .  those remarks to Manuel Luis [del\r\n\nValle] over a  Coca-Cola or a cup of  coffee, but Manuel Luis\r\n\nshouldn't have told  you.\"  There is no  indication when such\r\n\nremarks were made.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Vazquez filed suit against PRMSA,  PRMMI and Lopez,\r\n\nalleging that his dimissal was retaliation for his support of\r\n\nRomero,  in violation  of  his  First  Amendment2  rights  of\r\n\npolitical  association under  Elrod v.  Burns,  427 U.S.  347\r                                                         \r\n\n(1976) and Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980).3  Following\r                                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We  note that, under plaintiff's theory, the state action\r\ndoctrine poses no  bar to his assertion of  a First Amendment\r\nclaim against PRMSA and Lopez,  although he was employed at a\r\nprivate company.  Cf. Yeo  v. Town of Lexington, No. 96-1623,\r                                                           \r\n1997 WL 748667, at *8 (1st Cir.  Dec. 9, 1997) (en banc) (\"If\r\nthere  is no  state action,  then  the court  may not  impose\r\nconstitutional obligations  on (and thus restrict the freedom\r\nof) private  actors.\").   For summary  judgment purposes,  we\r\ntake it  that Vazquez's dismissal  came at the  insistence of\r\nthe Board of Governors of a state agency, an agency which had\r\nretained the power in its contract to demand the dismissal of\r\n\"key personnel.\"   Furthermore, although plaintiff was  not a\r\ngovernment employee, he  was dismissed,  at the  government's\r\ninsistence, from his job  with a government contractor.   The\r\nFirst   Amendment  forbids  the   government  not  only  from\r\ninterfering with  the associational rights of  its employees,\r\nbut also from using its  power over contractors to punish its\r\npolitical opponents.  See Board  of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr,\r                                                                        \r\n116 S. Ct. 2342 (1996);  O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v.

Evid. 801(c) defines hearsay  generally as\r\n\n\"a statement,  other than  one made  by  the declarant  while\r\n\ntestifying at the  trial or hearing,  offered in evidence  to\r\n\nprove  the  truth  of  the  matter asserted.\"    All  of  the\r\n\nconversations  which   Vazquez  relates   fit  this   general\r\n\ndefinition, as they are offered to show that Lopez was behind\r\n\nVazquez's dismissal, and that his motive was to retaliate for\r\n\nVazquez's  support   of  Romero.     Indeed,   most  of   the\r\n\nconversations are hearsay within hearsay.\r\n\n          Vazquez argues,  however, that  these conversations\r\n\nare  nonetheless  admissible  because  the  Federal Rules  of\r\n\nEvidence  define  admissions  by  a  party-opponent  as  \"not\r\n\nhearsay.\"  See Fed. R.  Evid. 801(d)(2).  Vazquez argues that\r                          \r\n\nthe comments by high PRMSA and PRMMI officials, acting within\r\n\nthe scope of their agency or employment, are admissible under\r\n\nthis rule.  In addition,  Vazquez properly notes, there is no\r\n\nobjection to  \"hearsay within hearsay\"  if each  link in  the\r\n\nchain  is admissible under an  exception to the hearsay rules\r\n\nor is  not  defined as  hearsay.

See, e.g., Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1087, 1093-94 (1st Cir. 1995);  Union Mutual Life Ins.

This breaks the link in the hearsay chain.\r\n\nThere is no  evidence that Rossy was authorized  to speak for\r\n\nPRMSA's  Board, and thus  his statement cannot  be considered\r\n\nwithin  the scope  of  his  agency as  an  officer of  PRMMI.\r\n\nSee Skillsky  v.

Del\r\n\nValle's  conversation with Vazquez  relating the \"problem\" of\r\n\nLopez's \"political differences\" with Vazquez fits within  the\r\n\nRule 801(d)(2) exception.  The statement concerning political\r\n\ndifferences was  made by a  party (Lopez) and related  by Del\r\n\nValle, who was Chairman of the PRMSA Board and thus the agent\r\n\nof PRMSA, a party.   The district court abused its discretion\r\n\nby  excluding  this  conversation as  \"hearsay,\"  if  that is\r\n\nindeed what it did.  \r\n\n          Similarly, the statement of Gonzalez, a PRMSA Board\r\n\nmember,  that \"the  pressure was too  strong\" to  reverse the\r\n\ndecision is not hearsay, as  Gonzalez was clearly an agent of\r\n\nPRMSA.   Thus, Gonzalez's statement  can properly be  used to\r\n\nprove the  truth of the  matter asserted, i.e., that  he felt\r\n\nunder \"pressure\" not to reverse the PRMSA decision.  However,\r\n\nGonzalez's  statement  cannot  be  used  as  \"hearsay  within\r\n\nhearsay\" to  prove that Lopez had urged the Board to stand by\r\n\na  decision to dismiss  Vazquez.  Gonzalez  does not identify\r\n\nthe  person  applying  \"pressure,\" and  the  statement  of an\r\n\nunidentified declarant is hearsay.\r\n\n          Finally, Vazquez's description of his confrontation\r\n\nwith Lopez is plainly not hearsay.  Lopez is a party, and his\r\n\ndirect  admission that he had  made some informal comments to\r\n\nDel Valle  that  he did  not  want  Vazquez to  hear  is  not\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nhearsay.  Again,  Lopez's statement can be used  to prove the\r\n\ntruth of the matter asserted,  i.e., that he made comments to\r\n\nDel Valle that he did not want repeated to Vazquez.\r\n\n          The  Lopez statement,  however, is  insufficient to\r\n\nestablish  an \"adoptive  admission\"  that Lopez  acknowledged\r\n\nthat he had been responsible for Vazquez's dismissal and that\r\n\nit  was in retaliation  for Vazquez's  support of  Romero, as\r\n\nVazquez argues.   See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B) (defining as\r                                 \r\n\n\"not hearsay\" \"a statement of which  the party has manifested\r\n\nan adoption  or belief  in its  truth\").   The  burden is  on\r\n\nVazquez  to  show  that  the  circumstances  surrounding  the\r\n\nconversation with Lopez  demonstrate that Lopez  manifested a\r\n\nbelief in  the accusation of  retaliation.

He\r\n\nhad worked  for many years  at PRMMI, climbing  the corporate\r\n\nladder,  had rejected early  retirement two years  before and\r\n\nwas then  dismissed.

However, \"[m]erely  juxtaposing  a\r\n\nprotected  characteristic -- [Lopez's]  politics --  with the\r\n\nfact plaintiff was treated unfairly  is not enough to state a\r\n\nconstitutional  claim.\"  Acosta-Orozco, 1997 WL 775350, at *5\r                                                  \r\n\n(quoting Correa-Martinez v.

Vazquez can point to three conversations to  support\r\n\nthis theory.   First,  he can point  to Del  Valle's comments\r\n\nthat \"the problem\" was Vazquez's \"political differences\" with\r\n\nLopez.  Second,  he can point to Lopez's acknowledgement that\r\n\nhe made  \"some comments\" to  Del Valle  that he did  not want\r\n\nVazquez to hear.   Finally, he can note Gonzalez's  statement\r\n\nthat  Gonzalez  felt  \"pressure\"  not  to  reverse  Vazquez's\r\n\ndismissal.\r\n\n          These comments  are insufficient to  establish that\r\n\nLopez engineered  Vazquez's dismissal  in order  to retaliate\r\n\nfor Vazquez's support  of Romero, and amount to  no more than\r\n\n\"unsupported  and speculative assertions.\"  LaRou, 98 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n661.    Even viewing  these  statements  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable to Vazquez, no reasonable jury could find that such\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nstatements  prove by  a preponderance  of  the evidence  that\r\n\nVazquez's   support   of  Romero   was  a   \"substantial\"  or\r\n\n\"motivating\"  factor in the PRMSA Board's decision to include\r\n\nhis  position  in  the  reorganization.    That  Vazquez  had\r\n\n\"political differences\" with  a single PRMSA Board  member at\r\n\nsome unidentified time does not establish that the Board or a\r\n\nmajority of the  Board acquiesced in a plan  to eliminate his\r\n\nposition in retaliation for  those differences.  Nor does  it\r\n\nestablish that \"the  problem\" referred to the  elimination of\r\n\nVazquez's position.  Similarly, Gonzalez's statement  that he\r\n\nfelt  \"pressure\"  not  to  reverse  Vazquez's  dismissal says\r\n\nnothing about the reason for  the pressure.  Facing a deficit\r\n\nin  excess of $300  million, PRMSA Board  members undoubtedly\r\n\nfelt pressure to stand by the reorganization plan.\r\n\n          Finally,  we find  no abuse  of  discretion in  the\r\n\naction of the district court in entering summary judgment sua\r\n\nsponte for  PRMSA, following  the district  court's grant  of\r\n\nsummary  judgment   to  PRMMI   and  Lopez.

During\r\n\nthe  current decade, plaintiffs  in these cases  usually have\r\n\nbeen members  of the PDP  who complain that the  incoming NPP\r\n\nadministration  has deprived them of their government jobs in\r\n\nviolation  of their  rights under  the First Amendment.1   In\r\n\nthis  case, plaintiff  Waldo G.  Vazquez,  an NPP  supporter,\r\n\nclaims his job  at a government contractor was  eliminated as\r\n\npart of an  internal party feud.   He sues his employer,  its\r\n\nmajor client  (a public  corporation),  and a  member of  the\r\n\nclient's board under 42 U.S.C.   1983 (1994).\r\n\n          The   district  court   concluded  that   Vazquez's\r\n\nevidence,  principally his own testimony, amounted to no more\r\n\nthan \"hearsay upon hearsay\" and \"rumors, hearsay, gossip, his\r\n\npersonal  feelings, his intuition  and his  conclusions,\" and\r\n\ngranted summary judgment for defendants.  Vazquez argues that\r\n\nthe district court  committed error in excluding  evidence as\r\n\nhearsay  when   the  statements  were  admissions  by  party-\r\n\nopponents.  Thus, we explore in some detail the  requirements\r\n\nof Fed. R.

Dec. 22 1997), and describe the evidence in some detail.\r\n\n          Waldo Vazquez was employed for many years by Puerto\r\n\nRico Maritime Management, Inc. (PRMMI), a private corporation\r\n\nthat provides management  services to the Puerto  Rico Marine\r\n\nShipping  Authority (PRMSA), a  public corporation created by\r\n\nthe Puerto  Rico legislature.   PRMSA's  Governing Board  has\r\n\nseven  members  appointed  by the  Governor  of  Puerto Rico,\r\n\nsubject to confirmation by the Commonwealth's Senate.  See 23\r                                                                      \r\n\nL.P.R.A.    3054  (1994).     PRMSA  acknowledges  it   is  a\r\n\ngovernment  agency,  and we  have  held  it is  a  \"political\r\n\nsubdivision\" of  the Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico under  the\r\n\nNational   Labor  Relations  Act.     See  Chaparro-Febus  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nInternational Longshoremen  Ass'n, Local 1575,  </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">325</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).  At the time of his dismissal from  PRMMI in\r\n\n1993,  Vazquez held the  title Vice President  of Operations,\r\n\nCaribbean Division.\r\n\n          In 1992, a new contract between PRMSA and PRMMI was\r\n\nsigned,  giving  authority  to  the  PRMSA  Board  over  \"key\r\n\npersonnel\" within  PRMMI.    PRMSA was  given  the  right  to\r\n\ndismiss high-level  PRMMI employees \"for any  material breach\r\n\nof its contract by such [PRMMI] key personnel and/or for just\r\n\ncause.\"  Vazquez's  position was among those  designated \"key\r\n\npersonnel.\" \r\n\n          In  1993, PRMSA had accumulated losses in excess of\r\n\n$300 million.   Vazquez does  not dispute this.   On February\r\n\n24,  1993, the  PRMSA Board  voted,  in light  of these  high\r\n\nlosses, to authorize a reduction-in-force (RIF) of twenty-six\r\n\nemployees at PRMMI; eventually  at least forty-one employees'\r\n\njobs were  eliminated.   Vazquez's position  was among  those\r\n\nselected for  elimination, either  directly by  the Board  or\r\n\npursuant  to its  RIF directive.    The record  is not  clear\r\n\nwhether  Vazquez's   position  was  among   those  originally\r\n\nselected  for elimination  by the  Board.   However, as  some\r\n\nevidence  supports the  conclusion  that  the Board  directly\r\n\nauthorized Vazquez's dismissal, we will assume that it did.\r\n\n          In late March  1993, Steve  Schulein, a  high-level\r\n\nPRMMI  official,  informed  Vazquez  over  breakfast  at  the\r\n\nAmbassador Plaza Hotel in Puerto  Rico that his position  was\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ngoing to be eliminated at  the beginning of April.  According\r\n\nto Vazquez's testimony, Schulein told Vazquez that he did not\r\n\nunderstand why  Vazquez was  to  be dismissed,  and that  the\r\n\nelimination of his position had not been part of the original\r\n\nreorganization plan submitted  to the PRMSA Board.   Schulein\r\n\nsaid that he understood that  the decision came from a member\r\n\nof  the PRMSA  Board.   This conversation  took place  in the\r\n\nperiod when the other PRMMI employees were also being let go.\r\n\n          The next day, Vazquez called Manuel Luis del Valle,\r\n\nChairman of  the  Governing  Board  of  PRMSA,  in  order  to\r\n\nascertain  why his position had been selected for elimination\r\n\nin the Board's new plans for PRMMI's reorganization.  Vazquez\r\n\ntold Del  Valle that  his dismissal \"was  an injustice  and a\r\n\npersecution.\"   Vazquez argued that similar employees had not\r\n\nbeen eliminated, and that he had rejected the company's early\r\n\nretirement program  two years  before because  he needed  the\r\n\nsalary and felt  he still had much to offer the company.  Del\r\n\nValle  promised  he  would help  Vazquez  fight  his proposed\r\n\ndismissal, because,  according to  Vazquez,  Del Valle  \"also\r\n\nunderstood that it was an injustice.\"\r\n\n          On  April  2,  1993,   Vazquez  received  a  letter\r\n\ninforming  him  that  \"due  to  [PRMMI's]  current  financial\r\n\ncondition you will be laid off . . . .\"  \r\n\n          Vazquez continued his inquiries  and protests about\r\n\nhis dismissal.  At some later time, Del Valle told Vazquez of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\na conversation  Del Valle  had with  Carlos Lopez-Rosario,  a\r\n\nmember of the  PRMSA Board.  According to  Vazquez, Del Valle\r\n\ntold him that Lopez had told Del Valle that \"the problem\" was\r\n\nthat Vazquez  had \"political  differences\" with  Lopez.   The\r\n\nrecord is unclear when the conversation between Lopez and Del\r\n\nValle supposedly took place or  whether it had anything to do\r\n\nwith  Vazquez's   dismissal.    Del  Valle's   comments  also\r\n\nconfirmed  what Vazquez  calls  \"hallway  gossip\" that  Lopez\r\n\ndisliked Vazquez.\r\n\n          Vazquez    suspected    that    these    \"political\r\n\ndifferences\" stemmed from the NPP's gubernatorial primary  in\r\n\n1992.   Vazquez had  supported the  losing candidate,  Carlos\r\n\nRomero-Barcelo  (\"Romero\"), now  the Commonwealth's  Resident\r\n\nCommissioner  in Washington,  while Lopez  had supported  the\r\n\nwinner, Pedro Rosello, now the Governor of Puerto Rico.  \r\n\n          Vazquez speculated that this disagreement must have\r\n\nmotivated his dismissal.   He remembered a  conversation with\r\n\nLopez a few years earlier at an NPP activity in the home of a\r\n\nprominent  supporter.   Vazquez had expressed  his preference\r\n\nfor  Romero  as  a  gubernatorial  candidate  and  Lopez  had\r\n\ndisagreed, arguing for Rosello.  Vazquez also speculated that\r\n\nLopez  might  be retaliating  against  him  for the  work  of\r\n\nVazquez's  wife  in  organizing a  women's  group  to support\r\n\nRomero in a political campaign almost two decades earlier.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          According   to  Vazquez,   Miguel  Rossy,   PRMMI's\r\n\nPresident,  confirmed in a conversation at a local restaurant\r\n\nthat  Vazquez's position  was not  included  in the  original\r\n\nreorganization  plan and  that  the  decision  came  from  an\r\n\nunnamed PRMSA  Board member,  \"[s]omebody  who doesn't  . . .\r\n\nlike  you, who  is  opposed  to  Carlos  [Romero's]  people.\"\r\n\nVazquez took this unnamed person to be Lopez.\r\n\n          On  several  occasions,  Vazquez  also  asked  both\r\n\nCommissioner  Romero  and  Governor   Rosello  personally  to\r\n\nintervene and reverse the decision, citing his long record of\r\n\nservice with PRMMI.  The  Governor told Vazquez that he would\r\n\nhave  to handle  the  issue  with  the PRMSA  Board  himself.\r\n\nAccording to Vazquez, at some point Ricardo Gonzalez, a PRMSA\r\n\nBoard  member, told  Vazquez that  he  had tried  to get  the\r\n\ndecision  reversed, but that  \"the pressure was  too strong.\"\r\n\nGonzalez did not explain what  he meant by \"pressure,\" or who\r\n\nwas applying pressure.\r\n\n          Finally,  in  May  1993,  Vazquez  met  with  Lopez\r\n\npersonally in Lopez's  office at PRMSA.  Vazquez  asked Lopez\r\n\nwhether   what  Del  Valle  had  told  him  about  \"political\r\n\ndifferences\"  was true.  Lopez replied, according to Vazquez,\r\n\n\"I made some remarks . . .  those remarks to Manuel Luis [del\r\n\nValle] over a  Coca-Cola or a cup of  coffee, but Manuel Luis\r\n\nshouldn't have told  you.\"  There is no  indication when such\r\n\nremarks were made.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Vazquez filed suit against PRMSA,  PRMMI and Lopez,\r\n\nalleging that his dimissal was retaliation for his support of\r\n\nRomero,  in violation  of  his  First  Amendment2  rights  of\r\n\npolitical  association under  Elrod v.

For summary  judgment purposes,  we\r\ntake it  that Vazquez's dismissal  came at the  insistence of\r\nthe Board of Governors of a state agency, an agency which had\r\nretained the power in its contract to demand the dismissal of\r\n\"key personnel.\"   Furthermore, although plaintiff was  not a\r\ngovernment employee, he  was dismissed,  at the  government's\r\ninsistence, from his job  with a government contractor.

Indeed,   most  of   the\r\n\nconversations are hearsay within hearsay.\r\n\n          Vazquez argues,  however, that  these conversations\r\n\nare  nonetheless  admissible  because  the  Federal Rules  of\r\n\nEvidence  define  admissions  by  a  party-opponent  as  \"not\r\n\nhearsay.\"  See Fed.

Del\r\n\nValle's  conversation with Vazquez  relating the \"problem\" of\r\n\nLopez's \"political differences\" with Vazquez fits within  the\r\n\nRule 801(d)(2) exception.  The statement concerning political\r\n\ndifferences was  made by a  party (Lopez) and related  by Del\r\n\nValle, who was Chairman of the PRMSA Board and thus the agent\r\n\nof PRMSA, a party.   The district court abused its discretion\r\n\nby  excluding  this  conversation as  \"hearsay,\"  if  that is\r\n\nindeed what it did.  \r\n\n          Similarly, the statement of Gonzalez, a PRMSA Board\r\n\nmember,  that \"the  pressure was too  strong\" to  reverse the\r\n\ndecision is not hearsay, as  Gonzalez was clearly an agent of\r\n\nPRMSA.   Thus, Gonzalez's statement  can properly be  used to\r\n\nprove the  truth of the  matter asserted, i.e., that  he felt\r\n\nunder \"pressure\" not to reverse the PRMSA decision.  However,\r\n\nGonzalez's  statement  cannot  be  used  as  \"hearsay  within\r\n\nhearsay\" to  prove that Lopez had urged the Board to stand by\r\n\na  decision to dismiss  Vazquez.  Gonzalez  does not identify\r\n\nthe  person  applying  \"pressure,\" and  the  statement  of an\r\n\nunidentified declarant is hearsay.\r\n\n          Finally, Vazquez's description of his confrontation\r\n\nwith Lopez is plainly not hearsay.  Lopez is a party, and his\r\n\ndirect  admission that he had  made some informal comments to\r\n\nDel Valle  that  he did  not  want  Vazquez to  hear  is  not\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nhearsay.  Again,  Lopez's statement can be used  to prove the\r\n\ntruth of the matter asserted,  i.e., that he made comments to\r\n\nDel Valle that he did not want repeated to Vazquez.\r\n\n          The  Lopez statement,  however, is  insufficient to\r\n\nestablish  an \"adoptive  admission\"  that Lopez  acknowledged\r\n\nthat he had been responsible for Vazquez's dismissal and that\r\n\nit  was in retaliation  for Vazquez's  support of  Romero, as\r\n\nVazquez argues.   See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B) (defining as\r                                 \r\n\n\"not hearsay\" \"a statement of which  the party has manifested\r\n\nan adoption  or belief  in its  truth\").   The  burden is  on\r\n\nVazquez  to  show  that  the  circumstances  surrounding  the\r\n\nconversation with Lopez  demonstrate that Lopez  manifested a\r\n\nbelief in  the accusation of  retaliation.

Vazquez can point to three conversations to  support\r\n\nthis theory.   First,  he can point  to Del  Valle's comments\r\n\nthat \"the problem\" was Vazquez's \"political differences\" with\r\n\nLopez.  Second,  he can point to Lopez's acknowledgement that\r\n\nhe made  \"some comments\" to  Del Valle  that he did  not want\r\n\nVazquez to hear.   Finally, he can note Gonzalez's  statement\r\n\nthat  Gonzalez  felt  \"pressure\"  not  to  reverse  Vazquez's\r\n\ndismissal.\r\n\n          These comments  are insufficient to  establish that\r\n\nLopez engineered  Vazquez's dismissal  in order  to retaliate\r\n\nfor Vazquez's support  of Romero, and amount to  no more than\r\n\n\"unsupported  and speculative assertions.\"  LaRou, 98 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n661.    Even viewing  these  statements  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable to Vazquez, no reasonable jury could find that such\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nstatements  prove by  a preponderance  of  the evidence  that\r\n\nVazquez's   support   of  Romero   was  a   \"substantial\"  or\r\n\n\"motivating\"  factor in the PRMSA Board's decision to include\r\n\nhis  position  in  the  reorganization.    That  Vazquez  had\r\n\n\"political differences\" with  a single PRMSA Board  member at\r\n\nsome unidentified time does not establish that the Board or a\r\n\nmajority of the  Board acquiesced in a plan  to eliminate his\r\n\nposition in retaliation for  those differences.  Nor does  it\r\n\nestablish that \"the  problem\" referred to the  elimination of\r\n\nVazquez's position.  Similarly, Gonzalez's statement  that he\r\n\nfelt  \"pressure\"  not  to  reverse  Vazquez's  dismissal says\r\n\nnothing about the reason for  the pressure.  Facing a deficit\r\n\nin  excess of $300  million, PRMSA Board  members undoubtedly\r\n\nfelt pressure to stand by the reorganization plan.\r\n\n          Finally,  we find  no abuse  of  discretion in  the\r\n\naction of the district court in entering summary judgment sua\r\n\nsponte for  PRMSA, following  the district  court's grant  of\r\n\nsummary  judgment   to  PRMMI   and  Lopez.
