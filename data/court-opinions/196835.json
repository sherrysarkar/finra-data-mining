Tatirosian on  brief for appellees\r                                                      \r\nJohn Perrone and Donald Jennings.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n          Per  Curiam.   Appellant  James Peter  Kyricopoulos\r                                 \r\r\n\nappeals from the dismissal  of his complaint, filed  under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    1983.  After  carefully reading the  record and the\r\n\nparties'  briefs, we  affirm  the district  court's judgment,\r\n\nexcept as  to Counts 1, 3,  4, 7, 9, and  10, for essentially\r\n\nthe reasons stated in the court's Memorandum and Order, dated\r\n\nOctober 5, 1995.  We affirm the  dismissal of these counts on\r\n\ndifferent grounds.\r\n\n          The  district court reasonably  construed Counts 1,\r\n\n3,  4, 7,  9,  and 10  as  challenging, as  unconstitutional,\r\n\nplaintiff's convictions  in three  state cases.   The court's\r\n\nconclusion  that these  claims were time-barred,  however, is\r\n\nmistaken.   In Heck v. Humphrey,  114 S. Ct. 2364 (1994), the\r                                           \r\n\nSupreme Court held that \"a   1983 cause of action for damages\r\n\nattributable  to an  unconstitutional conviction  or sentence\r\n\ndoes not  accrue until the  conviction or  sentence has  been\r\n\ninvalidated.\"  Id.  at 2374.   Therefore, if  \"a judgment  in\r                              \r\n\nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity\r\n\nof his conviction  or sentence . . . ,  the complaint must be\r\n\ndismissed  unless the  plaintiff  can  demonstrate  that  the\r\n\nconviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\"  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n2372.  Heck applies  retroactively to this case.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nBoyd  v. Biggers,  31  F.3d 279,  282  n.2 (5th  Cir.  1994).\r                            \r\n\nBecause   none   of   plaintiff's   convictions   have   been\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ninvalidated,  these  counts are  not cognizable  in a    1983\r\n\naction.\r\n\n          Notwithstanding  Heck, we  affirm the  dismissal of\r                                           \r\n\ncounts  1, 9  and  10 on  the  ground of  absolute  immunity,\r\n\ninsofar as they name as defendants various District Attorneys\r\n\nand assistant district attorneys.   Here, Counts 1, 9  and 10\r\n\nessentially  allege that  the prosecutors  conspired to  have\r\n\nplaintiff falsely prosecuted.  Because  such conduct involves\r\n\nthe initiation  and presentation  of the state's  case, these\r\n\ndefendants  are  absolutely  immune  from  this  action   for\r\n\ndamages.   See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 269, 272\r                                                 \r\n\n(1993).\r\n\n          Counts 4 and 7 make charges against two state trial\r\n\njudges.  These judges are  absolutely immune from this action\r\n\nin  the absence  of  any indication  that they  acted outside\r\n\ntheir \"judicial jurisdiction.\"   See Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n547, 553-54 (1967).  There is no such indication here.\r\n\n          Finally,  we reject  the  remainder of  appellant's\r\n\narguments.    First, the  district  court did  not  abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion  in  dismissing  the  complaint  before  plaintiff\r\n\nconducted discovery.   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6) specifically\r\n\nis  designed  to  streamline  litigation  and  do  away  with\r\n\n\"needless  discovery\"  by  permitting  a  district  court  to\r\n\ndismiss  a  claim where  relief on  that  claim could  not be\r\n\ngranted under any facts plaintiff could prove consistent with\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nhis allegations.  Neitzke  v. Williams, 490 U.S.  319, 326-27\r                                                  \r\n\n(1989).    Further, plaintiff  had over  a  year in  which to\r\n\nconduct discovery,  but did nothing.   Second, appellant must\r\n\nraise issues regarding the district court judge's bias in the\r\n\nfirst  instance in  the  district court.    See Thibeault  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSquare D.
