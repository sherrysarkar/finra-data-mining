Attorney Paul Nyer (\"Nyer\")\n\nappeals from an order sanctioning him under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 11 for his attempt to bring an unfair trade practices claim\n\nagainst Winterthur International Insurance Company (\"Winterthur\") in\n\nconnection with Winterthur's defense of a personal injury suit against\n\nits insured.   For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          In 1994, Avery Dennison Corp. (\"Avery\") contracted with Bobst\n\nGroup, Inc. (\"Bobst\") to install and service certain controls and\n\nequipment on Avery's printing press. On August 2, 1994, an explosion\n\nin the printing press seriously injured two Avery employees, Ismael\n\nHochen and Richard Dufault.     The two men retained Nyer as their\n\nattorney and filed suit against Bobst in 1996, alleging inter alia that\n\nBobst's negligent maintenance of the presses caused the explosion.\n\nBobst filed several motions for summary judgment and obtained partial\n\nsummary judgment in 1997 on the statute of repose issue and partial\n\nsummary judgment in 2000 on Hochen's claims regarding breach of\n\nwarranty and failure to warn.1 After the summary judgment motions, only\n\nthe negligent maintenance issue remained for trial.\n\n\n     1The merits of the underlying suit are addressed in a\nseparate opinion issued this day. See Hochen v. Bobst Group,\nInc., No. 96-11214 (D. Mass. 2000), appeal docketed, No. 00-1841\n(1st Cir. March 20, 2001).\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           On February 18, 2000, approximately two and a half months\n\nbefore the trial was set to begin, the plaintiffs attempted to add\n\nWinterthur, Bobst's insurance carrier, as a direct defendant in the\n\nlawsuit.   In their motion to amend, the plaintiffs alleged that\n\nWinterthur had violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A because\n\nits negotiation tactics ran afoul of Massachusetts General Law chapter\n\n176D, which regulates insurance companies.2 The magistrate judge\n\ndeferred ruling on the motion in order to see whether the plaintiffs\n\nwould prevail at trial against Bobst.3 After the magistrate judge\n\ndirected a verdict in favor of Bobst and entered judgment on May 19,\n\n2000, he denied the motion to amend the complaint as moot. On June 9,\n\n2000, Winterthur filed a motion for attorney fees, costs and sanctions\n\nagainst the plaintiffs' attorney Nyer pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11\n\nand 28 U.S.C. ยง 1927. Nyer opposed the motion on June 30, 2000, and\n\nWinterthur filed its response on July 12, 2000.\n\n           In determining whether sanctions were appropriate, the\n\nmagistrate judge reviewed the history of negotiations between the\n\nparties. Plaintiffs began the settlement negotiations by making a\n\ndemand to settle of $5 million -- $3 million for Hochen and $2 million\n\nfor Dufault.     On June 22, 1999, the plaintiffs, Bobst and\n\n\n\n     2See infra note 7 and accompanying text for further\nexplanation of the relationship between chapters 93A and 176D.\n     3\n     The parties consented to proceed before the magistrate\njudge for trial and entry of judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง\n636(c).\n\n                                 -3-\n\frepresentatives from Winterthur participated in a mediation session,\n\nduring which Winterthur made an offer to settle the case for $475,000.\n\nAccording to Nyer, the plaintiffs rejected the offer because (1)\n\nWinterthur did not apportion the settlement among the individual\n\ndefendants and (2) with the workers' compensation liens at $417,000,\n\nthe settlement would be virtually unprofitable. The parties met again\n\nfor settlement discussions on September 22, 1999. Although the record\n\ndoes not include the specifics of any offer allegedly made by\n\nWinterthur at that meeting, Nyer claims that Winterthur refused to put\n\nits offer in writing and again rejected Nyer's request that it\n\napportion the proposed settlement among the individual plaintiffs.\n\n          After this September meeting, Nyer sent Winterthur a 93A\n\ndemand letter alleging that Winterthur's failure to apportion the offer\n\nor put it in writing violated Massachusetts General Law chapters 93A\n\nand 176D. After retaining outside counsel, Winterthur responded to the\n\nletter by offering $550,000 to resolve the case, although still\n\ninsisting that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that liability was\n\nreasonably clear. Shortly thereafter, Winterthur presented a proposed\n\napportionment of the offer, allocating $110,000 to each of the five\n\nplaintiffs.4 Nyer and the workers' compensation carrier, however,\n\nrejected this offer.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n     The three additional plaintiffs named in the lawsuit were\nfamily members of Richard Dufault.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          In its motion for sanctions, Winterthur claimed that it was\n\nunder no obligation to make a settlement offer to the plaintiffs under\n\nchapter 176D because they could not show that Bobst's liability was\n\nreasonably clear. As it had no duty even to negotiate, Winterthur\n\nargued, it could not be found liable for violating the insurance\n\nregulations laid out in chapter 176D or unfair trade practices\n\nprovision in chapter 93A. Therefore, Winterthur concluded, the 93A\n\nclaim that the plaintiffs attempted to assert against it was frivolous\n\nand made only for the improper purpose of forcing Winterthur to offer\n\na higher settlement figure.\n\n          In his defense, Nyer claimed that the parties understood that\n\nBobst's liability was reasonably clear, as reflected by the size of\n\nWinterthur's settlement offers.        Therefore, in Nyer's view,\n\nWinterthur's refusal to apportion the settlement offer to the\n\nindividual plaintiffs and the fact that the offer was barely above the\n\namount of the workers' compensation lien constituted an unfair\n\nsettlement practice. Consequently, Nyer insisted that his attempt to\n\nassert a 93A claim against Winterthur should not be sanctionable.\n\n          Before reaching the merits of Winterthur's motion, the\n\nmagistrate judge rejected Nyer's arguments that Winterthur did not have\n\nstanding to seek sanctions and that Winterthur's motion was untimely.\n\nHe then determined that there was no basis for a 93A claim against\n\nWinterthur in light of relevant Massachusetts law, and imposed\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsanctions pursuant to Rule 11, along with attorneys' fees and costs.5\n\nHochen v. Bobst Group Inc., 198 F.R.D. 11 (D. Mass. 2000). Nyer timely\n\nappealed.\n\n\n\n\n     5Although the magistrate judge concluded that Nyer had\nviolated Rule 11, he found it \"not as clear that [Nyer's]\nactions were vexatious so as to multiply the proceedings,\" in\nviolation of ยง 1927. Hochen, 198 F.R.D. at 18. Because Rule 11\nprovided a sufficient basis to award Winterthur with all of the\nrelief it sought, the magistrate judge found it unnecessary to\nreach the issue of whether Nyer's conduct infringed ยง 1927. Id.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                                 II.\n\nA.   Standing\n\n          Before assessing the propriety of the magistrate judge's\n\nruling, we must first inquire as to whether Winterthur had standing to\n\nseek sanctions under Rule 11. We review issues of standing de novo.\n\nNew Hampshire Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d\n\n8, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          As a general rule, non-parties to a case may not bring a\n\nmotion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11. New York News, Inc., v.\n\nKheel, 972 F.2d 482, 488 (2d Cir. 1992). In limited circumstances,\n\nhowever, a non-party may have standing to move for Rule 11 sanctions.\n\nFor example, in Westmoreland v. CBS, Inc., 770 F.2d 1168 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1985), a non-party witness was permitted to bring a Rule 11 motion\n\nstemming from defense counsel's commencement of contempt proceedings\n\nagainst him. On the other hand, individuals that are either explicitly\n\ndiscussed in a complaint or entities that are indirectly implicated by\n\na complaint's allegations may not intervene in the litigation for the\n\nsole purpose of seeking Rule 11 sanctions. See New York News, Inc.,\n\n972 F.2d at 488-89 (individual); Port Drum Co. v. Umphrey, 852 F.2d 148\n\n(5th Cir. 1988) (corporate entity).\n\n          In Greenberg v. Sala, 822 F.2d 882 (9th Cir. 1987), the Ninth\n\nCircuit ruled that individuals who had been named in a frivolous\n\ncomplaint could seek Rule 11 sanctions, even though they had never\n\nactually become official parties to the litigation due to lack of\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fservice. In finding that the would-be defendants had standing, the\n\ncourt noted that \"the filing of the complaint . . . caused the\n\ndefendants to incur costs and attorney fees. . . . Moreover, the filing\n\nof the complaint necessarily triggered the expenditure of court\n\nresources.\"   Id. at 885.\n\n          We consider this case to be closely analogous to Greenburg.\n\nWinterthur was never formally made a party to the litigation, but this\n\nwas due to the fact that the magistrate judge decided to reserve\n\njudgment on the motion to amend plaintiffs' complaint until the\n\nunderlying issues regarding Bobst's liability were resolved.\n\nFurthermore, although Winterthur was never required to refute the\n\nchapter 93A allegations contained in the amended complaint, Winterthur\n\nwas forced to prepare a possible defense against the charge of unfair\n\ntrade practices. In this sense, Winterthur was similarly situated to\n\nthe non-party witness in Westmoreland who had to defend himself against\n\na petition for civil contempt arising out of his refusal to allow his\n\ndeposition to be videotaped. Therefore, we find that, even under the\n\nreasoning of New York News, Inc., Winterthur qualifies as one of the\n\ntypes of non-parties that may bring a motion for Rule 11 sanctions.\n\nSee 972 F.2d at 488-89 (distinguishing Westmoreland and Greenberg).\n\nAccordingly, we find that Winterthur has standing to file a motion for\n\nRule 11 sanctions.\n\nB.   Timeliness\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          One additional issue remains before we can turn to the merits\n\nof the Rule 11 determination.     Nyer has not sought review of the\n\ndistrict court's ruling that Winterthur's motion for sanctions was\n\ntimely filed. In his appeal, however, Nyer alleges for the first time\n\nthat Winterthur failed to comply with the \"safe harbor\" provision of\n\nRule 11, which requires a movant to wait twenty-one days after serving\n\na motion for sanctions on opposing counsel before filing the motion\n\nwith the court.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1)(A).     This provision is\n\ndesigned to allow an attorney to correct his error before a party\n\ncommences Rule 11 proceedings. In this case, however, we need not\n\ndecide whether there was any failure to comply with the \"safe harbor\"\n\nprovision because Nyer did not present this issue to the magistrate\n\njudge in his opposition to the motion for sanctions. \"If any principle\n\nis firmly established in this circuit, it is that, in the absence of\n\nexcusatory circumstances -- and none are apparent here -- arguments not\n\nseasonably raised in the district court cannot be raised for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\" Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 248 F.3d\n\n40, 44 (1st Cir. 2001).6\n\n\n     6We note, however, that Nyer filed his motion to amend on\nFebruary 18, 2000 and the motion was dismissed as moot on May\n19, 2000. Interestingly, Winterthur did not file its motion for\nfees and sanctions until June 9, 2000, i.e., twenty one days\nafter the magistrate judge entered judgment and dismissed the\nmotion to amend. Prior to the dismissal, Nyer had approximately\nthree months to reconsider and withdraw the motion to amend but\nchose not to do so.    Once the magistrate judge dismissed the\nmotion as moot, the purposes of the safe harbor provision could\nno longer be effectuated because Nyer had lost his opportunity\nto reverse course.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          With those preliminary matters resolved, we now focus on the\n\nquestion of whether sanctions were appropriate in this case. Rule 11\n\nprovides for the imposition of sanctions against an attorney who files\n\na pleading, motion or paper that is not \"well grounded in fact\" or is\n\nnot \"warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law,\" or is\n\n\"interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause\n\nunnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 11.\n\n          We pause momentarily to offer some clarification as to the\n\nproper standard of review in this case. In this circuit, as a general\n\nrule, all aspects of a district court's Rule 11 determination are\n\nexamined under the abuse of discretion standard. See Kale v. Combined\n\nIns. Co. of Am., 861 F.2d 746, 757-58 (1st Cir. 1988).         By \"all\n\naspects,\" we refer to both \"the legal conclusion of the district court\n\nthat the facts constitute a violation of the Rule and . . . the\n\nappropriateness of the sanction imposed.\" Figueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria,\n\n905 F.2d 545, 548 n.2 (1st Cir. 1990).      As the Supreme Court has\n\ninstructed, however, \"[a] district court would necessarily abuse its\n\ndiscretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on\n\na clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\" Cooter & Gell v.\n\nHartmax Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990). Therefore, in order to assess\n\nwhether the magistrate judge acted within his discretion in imposing\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fsanctions, we must discern whether he properly interpreted the relevant\n\nMassachusetts authorities regarding liability under chapters 93A and\n\n176D.\n\n           Under state law, insurance companies in Massachusetts have\n\nan obligation to abstain from \"unfair claim settlement practices,\" such\n\nas \"failing to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of\n\nclaims in which liability has become reasonably clear. . . .\" Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 176D ยง 3(9)(f).7 In order to determine whether liability\n\nis \"reasonably clear,\" the fact finder must determine \"whether a\n\nreasonable person, with knowledge of the relevant facts and law, would\n\nprobably have concluded, for good reason, that the insurer was liable\n\nto the plaintiff.\" Demeo v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 38 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 955, 956-57, 649 N.E. 2d 803, 804 (1995).\n\n          For the purposes of assessing whether Nyer's attempt to bring\n\nan unfair trade practices claim against Winterthur violated Rule 11,\n\nthe court must focus on whether Nyer had evidentiary support for his\n\nclaim and/or whether his accusations were \"warranted by existing law or\n\nby a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal\n\n\n     7\n     Chapter 93A of Massachusetts law also protects consumers\nfrom unfair trade practices.     Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A ยง 2(a)\n(\"Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or\npractices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby\ndeclared unlawful.\").   When drafted, neither chapter 93A nor\nchapter 176D provided any avenue for the private enforcement of\nthese protections. In 1979, however, the legislature amended\nchapter 93A, granting consumers a private cause of action\nagainst insurers who violate chapter 176D.     Id. ยง 9(1).   See\ngenerally Thomas P. Billings, The Massachusetts Law of Unfair\nInsurance Settlement Practices, 76 Mass. L. Rev. 55 (June 1991).\n\n                                 -11-\n\fof existing law . . . .\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2)-(3).       After\n\nreviewing the history of negotiations between the parties and examining\n\nthe underlying personal injury litigation, the magistrate judge\n\ndetermined that no reasonable attorney would have believed that he had\n\nany evidence to support a claim that Winterthur failed to negotiate a\n\nsettlement in good faith on behalf of its insured, whose liability was\n\nreasonably clear.\n\n          Nyer insists that Winterthur's substantial settlement offer\n\nwas an implicit acknowledgment that Bobst's liability was \"reasonably\n\nclear.\" Yet, as the magistrate judge noted, Winterthur explicitly\n\nstated that its settlement proposal represented an amount approximating\n\nthe estimated cost of defense. This practice is not uncommon. In\n\nfact, many cases are settled simply to avoid the uncertainties and\n\ncosts of going to trial. Under Nyer's view, however, the mere proposal\n\nof a settlement offer would serve as an admission by the insurer that\n\nliability is reasonably clear. Not only is this interpretation of\n\nchapter 176D legally erroneous, but it would also produce the highly\n\nundesirable effect of drastically reducing the willingness of parties\n\nto seek an amicable resolution to their dispute.\n\n          The magistrate judge observed that \"the relevant evidence to\n\nconsider when determining whether liability was reasonably clear is not\n\nsettlement offers made by defense counsel but rather facts concerning\n\nthe actual underlying claim.\"       Hochen, 198 F.R.D. at 17.      The\n\nmagistrate judge's assessment was that, in light of the significant\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhurdles facing the plaintiffs in the underlying litigation, no\n\nreasonable attorney, on these facts, would have had a basis for\n\nbelieving    that   Bobst's    liability   was   reasonably    clear.\n\n            In his appeal and in the proceedings below, Nyer has insisted\n\nthat it was Winterthur's failure to apportion the settlement amount\n\nthat constituted bad faith on the insurer's part.        Nyer offers no\n\nauthority, however, to support his position that Winterthur was somehow\n\nobligated to apportion the sum among the various parties. We are\n\nunaware of any Massachusetts law that would impose an apportionment\n\nobligation upon Winterthur and counsel has not pointed us to any such\n\nauthority.    Therefore, no attorney, particularly relying on this\n\napportionment argument, could reasonably have believed that the facts\n\nof this case could sustain a claim against Winterthur under chapter 93A\n\nand 176D.    This argument is simply frivolous.\n\n            We emphasize that the standard for determining whether an\n\ninsurance company has violated chapter 176D claim is distinct from the\n\nstandard for determining whether an attorney has offended Rule 11 by\n\nmaking (or attempting to make) such an allegation. Yet, one cannot\n\nassess the latter without a precise understanding of the former. The\n\nmagistrate judge did not err in his conclusion. Because we agree that\n\nthe apportionment argument raised by the appellant is totally\n\nfrivolous, in reviewing the magistrate judge's decision to impose\n\nsanctions under the abuse of discretion standard, we find no error\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fbecause, \"at its core[, the] imposition of sanctions is a judgment\n\ncall.\"   Kale, 861 F.2d at 758 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n                               IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the imposition of\n\nsanctions under Rule 11 against attorney Nyer.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f",

Attorney Paul Nyer (\"Nyer\")\n\nappeals from an order sanctioning him under Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 11 for his attempt to bring an unfair trade practices claim\n\nagainst Winterthur International Insurance Company (\"Winterthur\") in\n\nconnection with Winterthur's defense of a personal injury suit against\n\nits insured.   For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          In 1994, Avery Dennison Corp. (\"Avery\") contracted with Bobst\n\nGroup, Inc. (\"Bobst\") to install and service certain controls and\n\nequipment on Avery's printing press. On August 2, 1994, an explosion\n\nin the printing press seriously injured two Avery employees, Ismael\n\nHochen and Richard Dufault.     The two men retained Nyer as their\n\nattorney and filed suit against Bobst in 1996, alleging inter alia that\n\nBobst's negligent maintenance of the presses caused the explosion.\n\nBobst filed several motions for summary judgment and obtained partial\n\nsummary judgment in 1997 on the statute of repose issue and partial\n\nsummary judgment in 2000 on Hochen's claims regarding breach of\n\nwarranty and failure to warn.1 After the summary judgment motions, only\n\nthe negligent maintenance issue remained for trial.\n\n\n     1The merits of the underlying suit are addressed in a\nseparate opinion issued this day. See Hochen v. Bobst Group,\nInc., No. 96-11214 (D. Mass. 2000), appeal docketed, No. 00-1841\n(1st Cir. March 20, 2001).\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           On February 18, 2000, approximately two and a half months\n\nbefore the trial was set to begin, the plaintiffs attempted to add\n\nWinterthur, Bobst's insurance carrier, as a direct defendant in the\n\nlawsuit.   In their motion to amend, the plaintiffs alleged that\n\nWinterthur had violated Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A because\n\nits negotiation tactics ran afoul of Massachusetts General Law chapter\n\n176D, which regulates insurance companies.2 The magistrate judge\n\ndeferred ruling on the motion in order to see whether the plaintiffs\n\nwould prevail at trial against Bobst.3 After the magistrate judge\n\ndirected a verdict in favor of Bobst and entered judgment on May 19,\n\n2000, he denied the motion to amend the complaint as moot. On June 9,\n\n2000, Winterthur filed a motion for attorney fees, costs and sanctions\n\nagainst the plaintiffs' attorney Nyer pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11\n\nand 28 U.S.C. ยง 1927. Nyer opposed the motion on June 30, 2000, and\n\nWinterthur filed its response on July 12, 2000.\n\n           In determining whether sanctions were appropriate, the\n\nmagistrate judge reviewed the history of negotiations between the\n\nparties. Plaintiffs began the settlement negotiations by making a\n\ndemand to settle of $5 million -- $3 million for Hochen and $2 million\n\nfor Dufault.     On June 22, 1999, the plaintiffs, Bobst and\n\n\n\n     2See infra note 7 and accompanying text for further\nexplanation of the relationship between chapters 93A and 176D.\n     3\n     The parties consented to proceed before the magistrate\njudge for trial and entry of judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง\n636(c).\n\n                                 -3-\n\frepresentatives from Winterthur participated in a mediation session,\n\nduring which Winterthur made an offer to settle the case for $475,000.\n\nAccording to Nyer, the plaintiffs rejected the offer because (1)\n\nWinterthur did not apportion the settlement among the individual\n\ndefendants and (2) with the workers' compensation liens at $417,000,\n\nthe settlement would be virtually unprofitable. The parties met again\n\nfor settlement discussions on September 22, 1999. Although the record\n\ndoes not include the specifics of any offer allegedly made by\n\nWinterthur at that meeting, Nyer claims that Winterthur refused to put\n\nits offer in writing and again rejected Nyer's request that it\n\napportion the proposed settlement among the individual plaintiffs.\n\n          After this September meeting, Nyer sent Winterthur a 93A\n\ndemand letter alleging that Winterthur's failure to apportion the offer\n\nor put it in writing violated Massachusetts General Law chapters 93A\n\nand 176D. After retaining outside counsel, Winterthur responded to the\n\nletter by offering $550,000 to resolve the case, although still\n\ninsisting that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that liability was\n\nreasonably clear. Shortly thereafter, Winterthur presented a proposed\n\napportionment of the offer, allocating $110,000 to each of the five\n\nplaintiffs.4 Nyer and the workers' compensation carrier, however,\n\nrejected this offer.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n     The three additional plaintiffs named in the lawsuit were\nfamily members of Richard Dufault.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          In its motion for sanctions, Winterthur claimed that it was\n\nunder no obligation to make a settlement offer to the plaintiffs under\n\nchapter 176D because they could not show that Bobst's liability was\n\nreasonably clear. As it had no duty even to negotiate, Winterthur\n\nargued, it could not be found liable for violating the insurance\n\nregulations laid out in chapter 176D or unfair trade practices\n\nprovision in chapter 93A. Therefore, Winterthur concluded, the 93A\n\nclaim that the plaintiffs attempted to assert against it was frivolous\n\nand made only for the improper purpose of forcing Winterthur to offer\n\na higher settlement figure.\n\n          In his defense, Nyer claimed that the parties understood that\n\nBobst's liability was reasonably clear, as reflected by the size of\n\nWinterthur's settlement offers.        Therefore, in Nyer's view,\n\nWinterthur's refusal to apportion the settlement offer to the\n\nindividual plaintiffs and the fact that the offer was barely above the\n\namount of the workers' compensation lien constituted an unfair\n\nsettlement practice. Consequently, Nyer insisted that his attempt to\n\nassert a 93A claim against Winterthur should not be sanctionable.\n\n          Before reaching the merits of Winterthur's motion, the\n\nmagistrate judge rejected Nyer's arguments that Winterthur did not have\n\nstanding to seek sanctions and that Winterthur's motion was untimely.\n\nHe then determined that there was no basis for a 93A claim against\n\nWinterthur in light of relevant Massachusetts law, and imposed\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fsanctions pursuant to Rule 11, along with attorneys' fees and costs.5\n\nHochen v.

Nyer timely\n\nappealed.\n\n\n\n\n     5Although the magistrate judge concluded that Nyer had\nviolated Rule 11, he found it \"not as clear that [Nyer's]\nactions were vexatious so as to multiply the proceedings,\" in\nviolation of ยง 1927. Hochen, 198 F.R.D. at 18. Because Rule 11\nprovided a sufficient basis to award Winterthur with all of the\nrelief it sought, the magistrate judge found it unnecessary to\nreach the issue of whether Nyer's conduct infringed ยง 1927. Id.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                                 II.\n\nA.   Standing\n\n          Before assessing the propriety of the magistrate judge's\n\nruling, we must first inquire as to whether Winterthur had standing to\n\nseek sanctions under Rule 11. We review issues of standing de novo.\n\nNew Hampshire Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Gardner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197054\"><a href=\"/opinion/197054/nh-right-to-life-v-nh-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          As a general rule, non-parties to a case may not bring a\n\nmotion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11.

In limited circumstances,\n\nhowever, a non-party may have standing to move for Rule 11 sanctions.\n\nFor example, in Westmoreland v. CBS, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457539\"><a href=\"/opinion/457539/general-william-c-westmoreland-ambassador-richard-helms-v-cbs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n\n1985), a non-party witness was permitted to bring a Rule 11 motion\n\nstemming from defense counsel's commencement of contempt proceedings\n\nagainst him. On the other hand, individuals that are either explicitly\n\ndiscussed in a complaint or entities that are indirectly implicated by\n\na complaint's allegations may not intervene in the litigation for the\n\nsole purpose of seeking Rule 11 sanctions. See New York News, Inc.,\n\n972 F.2d at 488-89 (individual); Port Drum Co. v. Umphrey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509015\"><a href=\"/opinion/509015/port-drum-company-v-walter-umphrey-and-kurt-b-chacon/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(5th Cir. 1988) (corporate entity).\n\n          In Greenberg v.

In finding that the would-be defendants had standing, the\n\ncourt noted that \"the filing of the complaint . . . caused the\n\ndefendants to incur costs and attorney fees. . . . Moreover, the filing\n\nof the complaint necessarily triggered the expenditure of court\n\nresources.\"   Id. at 885.\n\n          We consider this case to be closely analogous to Greenburg.\n\nWinterthur was never formally made a party to the litigation, but this\n\nwas due to the fact that the magistrate judge decided to reserve\n\njudgment on the motion to amend plaintiffs' complaint until the\n\nunderlying issues regarding Bobst's liability were resolved.\n\nFurthermore, although Winterthur was never required to refute the\n\nchapter 93A allegations contained in the amended complaint, Winterthur\n\nwas forced to prepare a possible defense against the charge of unfair\n\ntrade practices. In this sense, Winterthur was similarly situated to\n\nthe non-party witness in Westmoreland who had to defend himself against\n\na petition for civil contempt arising out of his refusal to allow his\n\ndeposition to be videotaped. Therefore, we find that, even under the\n\nreasoning of New York News, Inc., Winterthur qualifies as one of the\n\ntypes of non-parties that may bring a motion for Rule 11 sanctions.\n\nSee 972 F.2d at 488-89 (distinguishing Westmoreland and Greenberg).\n\nAccordingly, we find that Winterthur has standing to file a motion for\n\nRule 11 sanctions.\n\nB.   Timeliness\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          One additional issue remains before we can turn to the merits\n\nof the Rule 11 determination.     Nyer has not sought review of the\n\ndistrict court's ruling that Winterthur's motion for sanctions was\n\ntimely filed. In his appeal, however, Nyer alleges for the first time\n\nthat Winterthur failed to comply with the \"safe harbor\" provision of\n\nRule 11, which requires a movant to wait twenty-one days after serving\n\na motion for sanctions on opposing counsel before filing the motion\n\nwith the court.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1)(A).     This provision is\n\ndesigned to allow an attorney to correct his error before a party\n\ncommences Rule 11 proceedings. In this case, however, we need not\n\ndecide whether there was any failure to comply with the \"safe harbor\"\n\nprovision because Nyer did not present this issue to the magistrate\n\njudge in his opposition to the motion for sanctions. \"If any principle\n\nis firmly established in this circuit, it is that, in the absence of\n\nexcusatory circumstances -- and none are apparent here -- arguments not\n\nseasonably raised in the district court cannot be raised for the first\n\ntime on appeal.\" Corrada Betances v.

Interestingly, Winterthur did not file its motion for\nfees and sanctions until June 9, 2000, i.e., twenty one days\nafter the magistrate judge entered judgment and dismissed the\nmotion to amend. Prior to the dismissal, Nyer had approximately\nthree months to reconsider and withdraw the motion to amend but\nchose not to do so.    Once the magistrate judge dismissed the\nmotion as moot, the purposes of the safe harbor provision could\nno longer be effectuated because Nyer had lost his opportunity\nto reverse course.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f                                 III.\n\n          With those preliminary matters resolved, we now focus on the\n\nquestion of whether sanctions were appropriate in this case. Rule 11\n\nprovides for the imposition of sanctions against an attorney who files\n\na pleading, motion or paper that is not \"well grounded in fact\" or is\n\nnot \"warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the\n\nextension, modification, or reversal of existing law,\" or is\n\n\"interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause\n\nunnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 11.\n\n          We pause momentarily to offer some clarification as to the\n\nproper standard of review in this case. In this circuit, as a general\n\nrule, all aspects of a district court's Rule 11 determination are\n\nexamined under the abuse of discretion standard. See Kale v. Combined\n\nIns.

After\n\nreviewing the history of negotiations between the parties and examining\n\nthe underlying personal injury litigation, the magistrate judge\n\ndetermined that no reasonable attorney would have believed that he had\n\nany evidence to support a claim that Winterthur failed to negotiate a\n\nsettlement in good faith on behalf of its insured, whose liability was\n\nreasonably clear.\n\n          Nyer insists that Winterthur's substantial settlement offer\n\nwas an implicit acknowledgment that Bobst's liability was \"reasonably\n\nclear.\" Yet, as the magistrate judge noted, Winterthur explicitly\n\nstated that its settlement proposal represented an amount approximating\n\nthe estimated cost of defense. This practice is not uncommon. In\n\nfact, many cases are settled simply to avoid the uncertainties and\n\ncosts of going to trial. Under Nyer's view, however, the mere proposal\n\nof a settlement offer would serve as an admission by the insurer that\n\nliability is reasonably clear. Not only is this interpretation of\n\nchapter 176D legally erroneous, but it would also produce the highly\n\nundesirable effect of drastically reducing the willingness of parties\n\nto seek an amicable resolution to their dispute.\n\n          The magistrate judge observed that \"the relevant evidence to\n\nconsider when determining whether liability was reasonably clear is not\n\nsettlement offers made by defense counsel but rather facts concerning\n\nthe actual underlying claim.\"       Hochen, 198 F.R.D. at 17.      The\n\nmagistrate judge's assessment was that, in light of the significant\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhurdles facing the plaintiffs in the underlying litigation, no\n\nreasonable attorney, on these facts, would have had a basis for\n\nbelieving    that   Bobst's    liability   was   reasonably    clear.\n\n            In his appeal and in the proceedings below, Nyer has insisted\n\nthat it was Winterthur's failure to apportion the settlement amount\n\nthat constituted bad faith on the insurer's part.        Nyer offers no\n\nauthority, however, to support his position that Winterthur was somehow\n\nobligated to apportion the sum among the various parties. We are\n\nunaware of any Massachusetts law that would impose an apportionment\n\nobligation upon Winterthur and counsel has not pointed us to any such\n\nauthority.    Therefore, no attorney, particularly relying on this\n\napportionment argument, could reasonably have believed that the facts\n\nof this case could sustain a claim against Winterthur under chapter 93A\n\nand 176D.    This argument is simply frivolous.\n\n            We emphasize that the standard for determining whether an\n\ninsurance company has violated chapter 176D claim is distinct from the\n\nstandard for determining whether an attorney has offended Rule 11 by\n\nmaking (or attempting to make) such an allegation. Yet, one cannot\n\nassess the latter without a precise understanding of the former. The\n\nmagistrate judge did not err in his conclusion. Because we agree that\n\nthe apportionment argument raised by the appellant is totally\n\nfrivolous, in reviewing the magistrate judge's decision to impose\n\nsanctions under the abuse of discretion standard, we find no error\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fbecause, \"at its core[, the] imposition of sanctions is a judgment\n\ncall.\"   Kale, 861 F.2d at 758 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n                               IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the imposition of\n\nsanctions under Rule 11 against attorney Nyer.\n\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f</pre>",
