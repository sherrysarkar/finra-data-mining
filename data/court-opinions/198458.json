Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                     \r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n     Torruella, Stahl, and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                     \r\n\nMiriam Ramos Grateroles and Luz M. Rios Rosario on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nJorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Nelson Prez-Sosa, and Guillermo Gil on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\n                                     \r\n\n                     May 7, 1999\r\n                                     \r\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  After reaching a plea agreement\r\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), defendant John Doe pled guilty\r\nto conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  He appeals from his sentence. \r\nWe affirm.\r\nActing on wiretap information, Drug Enforcement\r\nAdministration agents pulled over a car driven by Doe.  The car\r\ncontained approximately 120 kilograms of cocaine.  Agents also\r\nexecuted a warrant to search the home of co-defendant Nelson De\r\nJess-Morales, and found approximately 529 kilograms of cocaine as\r\nwell as evidence of cocaine traffic approaching 3,000 kilograms.\r\nA grand jury indicted Doe with conspiracy to distribute\r\ncocaine, see 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1) (West 1981) &amp; 846 (West Supp.\r\n1999), and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  See\r\n21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C.  2 (West 1969).  The parties\r\nreached a plea agreement, under which Doe pled guilty to the\r\nconspiracy charge and the government sought dismissal of the\r\npossession charge.  The agreement attributed 50-150 kilograms of\r\ncocaine to Doe, leading to a base offense level of 36.  See U.S.\r\nSentencing Guidelines  2D1.1(c) (1998).  The agreement proposed a\r\nthree-level reduction in the offense level for acceptance of\r\nresponsibility, see U.S.S.G.  3E1.1, and an additional two-level\r\nreduction should the court determine that Doe met the criteria of\r\nthe 'safety valve' provision set forth in U.S.S.G.  5C1.2.  If\r\nboth reductions applied, defendant's adjusted offense level would\r\nbe 31, and the government would recommend the minimum sentence of\r\n120 months' imprisonment.  The agreement noted that, should Doe\r\nfail to meet the safety valve criteria, his adjusted offense level\r\nwould be 33 and his minimum sentence would be 135 months.  Finally,\r\nthe agreement acknowledged that all sentencing conclusions remained\r\n\"within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge.\"\r\nThe sentencing hearing focused on  5C1.2, the safety\r\nvalve provision.  The government argued that  5C1.2 should not\r\napply because Doe did not meet its requirement of truthfulness:\r\n[N]ot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the\r\ndefendant has truthfully provided to the Government all\r\ninformation and evidence the defendant has concerning the\r\noffense or offenses that were part of the same course of\r\nconduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that\r\nthe defendant has no relevant or useful other information\r\nto provide or that the Government is already aware of the\r\ninformation shall not preclude a determination by the\r\ncourt that the defendant has complied with this\r\nrequirement.\r\nU.S.S.G.  5C1.2(5).  Doe replied that he had satisfied the\r\ntruthfulness requirement and merited a two-level reduction.\r\nAfter holding a sentencing hearing, the district court\r\nagreed with the government.  Noting that \"even on the stand [Doe]\r\nhas been hesitant,\" the district court found that Doe had not been\r\nfully truthful.  Doe moved for reconsideration, and the court\r\nentertained further discussion before denying his motion.  The\r\ncourt did apply the reduction for acceptance of responsibility,\r\nreaching an adjusted offense level of 33, and sentenced Doe to the\r\nminimum term of 135 months' imprisonment followed by five years of\r\nsupervised release.\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the sentencing court\r\nerred in denying a two-level reduction under  5C1.2.  We review de\r\nnovo any legal interpretation of this section, see United States v.\r\nWhite, 119 F.3d 70, 73 n.6 (1st Cir. 1997), and review factual\r\ndeterminations for clear error.  See United States v. Miranda-\r\nSantiago, 96 F.3d 517, 527 (1st Cir. 1996).  Doe bore the burden of\r\nproof: to benefit from the safety valve, he had to \"persuade the\r\ndistrict court that he ha[d] truthfully provided the required\r\ninformation and evidence to the government.\"  United States v.\r\nMontanez, 82 F.3d 520, 523 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).\r\nDoe makes two alternative arguments.  He first contends\r\nthat the district court erred in three ways: by improperly applying\r\nthe standard of U.S.S.G.  5K1.1 to his case, by failing to credit\r\nhis desire to cooperate, and by sanctioning him for failing to\r\nprovide evidence of a different drug conspiracy not \"part of the\r\nsame course of conduct or . . . common scheme or plan.\"  Had the\r\ndistrict court not committed these errors, Doe argues, it would\r\nhave found that he met the requirements of  5C1.2.  \r\nThe record is clear that the district court did not apply\r\n5K1.1 in this case and that it used the appropriate standard\r\nunder  5C1.2.  At the sentencing hearing, which took place over\r\ntwo days and resulted in 180 transcript pages, the government\r\nintroduced sufficient evidence for the district court to find that\r\nDoe was not fully truthful as required by  5C1.2.  Contrary to\r\nDoe's depiction of his own meager involvement, a co-defendant\r\nidentified Doe as responsible for packaging and mailing of the\r\ncocaine to New York; another witness identified Doe as an active\r\nparticipant in three meetings packaging the cocaine for shipment;\r\nand the court, having heard Doe's testimony, found that he was not\r\nforthcoming.  There was no error.\r\nIn the alternative, Doe argues that the district court\r\napplied  5C1.2 harshly against him, but leniently against co-\r\ndefendant Nelson De Jess-Morales.  Doe believes that De Jess-\r\nMorales received a  5C1.2 reduction only because he was higher in\r\nthe drug organization and therefore had more information to\r\ndisclose than Doe, who characterizes himself as a mere \"mule.\" \r\nWhether or not De Jess-Morales knew (and disclosed) more\r\ninformation than Doe, Doe's argument does nothing to rebut the\r\ndistrict court's conclusion that he was not fully truthful.  That\r\nwas ample reason for any disparity and there can be no claim that\r\nthe resulting sentence was disproportionate to the crime.  Cf.\r\nUnited States v. Singleterry, 29 F.3d 733, 740-41 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nThe sentencing order is affirmed.\n",
