Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                  and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Harry L. Miles, with whom Green, Miles, Lipton, White &amp;\r\nFitz-Gibbon, were on brief for appellant.\r\n\n   William M. Welch, II, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, were on brief for\r\nappellee.   \r\n\nJune 21, 1999\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant\r\nKristen Gilbert was charged in a single-count indictment with\r\nmaking a telephone bomb threat on September 26, 1996, to the\r\nDepartment of Veteran's Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in Leeds,\r\nMassachusetts, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  844(e).  Gilbert was\r\nfound guilty by a jury and was sentenced to imprisonment for\r\nfifteen months and three years of supervised release.  We affirm.\r\nThere are three issues for review:  (1) Was there subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction under the interstate commerce clause; (2) Did\r\nthe district court commit reversible error in the exclusion and\r\nallowance of certain evidence; (3) Was the evidence sufficient\r\nunder the reasonable doubt standard to sustain the jury's finding\r\nof guilt.\r\n                              I\r\nWe state the facts as they could have been found by the\r\njury.\r\nGilbert, a registered nurse, worked the 3:30 p.m. to\r\nmidnight shift on Ward C, an acute medical ward at the VAMC.  James\r\nPerrault was a VAMC police officer who worked the 3:00 p.m. to\r\n11:00 p.m. shift at the medical center.  In the summer of 1995\r\nGilbert and Perrault became friendly.  The friendship blossomed\r\ninto a full-blown affair in September and October of 1995.  At the\r\ntime Gilbert was married.  In November, 1995, Gilbert filed for\r\ndivorce against her husband, Glenn Gilbert, and moved out of their\r\nhome.  \r\nIn February, 1996, an investigation was launched at the\r\nVAMC because of some suspicious occurrences at the hospital.  The\r\ninvestigation became an official criminal investigation in a few\r\nmonths.  Gilbert was one of the targets of the investigation.  Many\r\nemployees at the VAMC were interviewed and grand jury subpoenas\r\nwere served on some employees.\r\nGilbert was photographed and handwriting samples were\r\ntaken from her.  Gilbert was upset by the investigation and made\r\nher feelings known.  She told her former husband (the divorce had\r\nbecome final) that he had the right not to speak to the\r\ninvestigators.  After he had spoken to them anyway, she became\r\nangry and upset.  She disparaged him to several people by\r\nbelittling him and using epithets to denigrate him.  Gilbert also\r\nexpressed anger and resentment against those of her co-workers who\r\ncooperated with the investigation.  She told a co-worker that\r\n\"maybe they ought to investigate\" Gilbert's nursing supervisor. \r\nGilbert became upset and angry with some of her co-workers on the\r\nevening shift because they would not talk to a private investigator\r\nshe had retained.\r\nGilbert talked about the investigation with Perrault. \r\nShe told him that three nurses who worked in Ward C were\r\nresponsible for starting the investigation and she \"couldn't\r\nunderstand why they were trying to do this to me.\"  Perrault\r\nsuggested leaving the area, but Gilbert refused, saying she \"wanted\r\neverybody here to see what they had done to ruin her life.\" \r\nPerrault tried to end their relationship in June of 1996, but she\r\nbegged him not to do so.  In late July, 1996, Gilbert told a friend\r\nof hers that if Perrault \"dumped her, she probably would start\r\nstalking him.\"  Perrault tried again in late August of 1996 to\r\nbreak his relationship with Gilbert.  She became upset and blamed\r\nthe investigation for this.\r\nIn September, 1996, Perrault told Gilbert of the day and \r\ntime he had agreed to be interviewed in Springfield, Massachusetts, \r\nby investigators from the United States Attorney's Office.  Gilbert \r\nbecame upset and begged Perrault not to attend the interview.  On \r\nthe day of the interview, Gilbert blocked Perrault's car with her \r\ncar as he attempted to drive out of his driveway.  She asked \r\nPerrault to talk to her and not to go to the interview.  When \r\nPerrault made it clear that he would not do as she wished, she \r\nreturned to her car and drove off.  On arriving at Springfield, \r\nPerrault used a parking garage that he and Gilbert had used on \r\nprior occasions.  When Perrault returned to his car after the \r\ninterview he found that air had been let out of his right front \r\ntire.\r\nDuring the next several days Perrault's car was stained \r\nby egg yolks from eggs that had been thrown at it, the windshield \r\nwas spray-painted, scratches were made on the exterior by keys, and \r\nthe front license plate was damaged.  After the damage to the \r\nlicense plate, Perrault saw a car similar in appearance to \r\nGilbert's enter the parking lot that Perrault used.  \r\nGilbert denied that she was responsible for the damage to\r\nPerrault's car, but admitted she had been in the parking lot prior\r\nto and after the bomb threat to the VAMC on September 26, 1996. \r\nGilbert called a neighbor of hers on two occasions to ask if\r\nPerrault had been checking on her.  When told that Perrault had\r\ninquired about her, the neighbor testified that Gilbert became very\r\nangry and said, \"Twit, fucking twit,\" in what the neighbor\r\ndescribed as a deep controlled tone of voice.\r\nStarting in mid-September Perrault received a number of\r\nphone calls at his residence.  There was no voice communication,\r\nonly heavy breathing or hang-ups.  Perrault unsuccessfully tried to\r\ntrace the calls.  He contacted NYNEX which traced seven of the\r\ncalls to Gilbert's telephone number.  A pen register was installed\r\non Gilbert's phone on September 26, after the bomb threat.  The pen\r\nregister showed that, between September 26 and October 1, 1996, \r\nabout one half of Gilbert's phone calls to Perrault used a method\r\n(called the \"*67 function\") which prevented Perrault from tracing\r\nher calls from his own telephone.\r\nOn September 26, the day of the bomb threat that was the\r\nbasis of the indictment, Gilbert purchased a \"Talkgirl Jr.\" with\r\nher VISA credit card at Toys-R-Us.  She also bought several\r\npackages of Energizer batteries from a Thrifty Drug Store about an\r\nhour after the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" purchase.  The batteries could be\r\nused to activate the \"Talkgirl Jr.\"  The toy is a hand-held voice\r\nchanger that records a statement which can be played back at a\r\nhigher or lower speed than the original recording.  Words recorded\r\nby a woman played back at a lower speed make them sound like a\r\nman's voice.\r\nOn September 26, the following message was received at\r\n3:34 p.m. on the telephone answering machine of Glenn Gilbert,\r\ndivorced husband of defendant-appellant:  \"I just wanted to say\r\ngoodbye for the last time.  Goodbye.\"  Glenn Gilbert described the\r\nvoice as \"an altered voice, an almost haunting voice.\"\r\nOn September 26, Perrault was on patrol for two hours at\r\nthe VAMC and then took over the security desk at 5:00 p.m. \r\nGilbert's neighbor saw her leave her apartment about 5:00 p.m. \r\nGilbert knew that Perrault would be at the security desk for two\r\nhours starting at 5:00 p.m.  She also knew the direct dial\r\ntelephone number for the security desk.\r\nPerrault answered a security desk phone call at 5:11 p.m. \r\nA recorded message from an unidentified caller stated:  \"This\r\nmessage is for all Persian Gulf veterans who were exposed to\r\nchemical weapons.\"  Perrault was a Persian Gulf War veteran and\r\nGilbert knew it.  Perrault described the telephone voice as\r\n\"staticky, almost like there was a mechanical ring to it.\" \r\nPerrault dismissed the call as a prank.\r\nFrom 5:22 p.m. through 7:07 p.m. during the evening of\r\nSeptember 26, Perrault received a series of unidentified phone\r\ncalls at the security desk.  He described the voice as being\r\nexactly the same as the one directed to Persian Gulf veterans.  The\r\nmessages received were as follows:\r\n  Content of Messages   Time\r\n\"There are three explosive devices in             5:22\r\nBuilding One.  You have two hours.\"\r\n\n\"Nothing will compare as to what is\r\ngoing to happen tonight.\"    5:30\r\n\n\"I want those patients out on time.               5:36\r\nRemember.\"\r\n\n\"Would you like to know where to locate           5:40\r\nthe devices?\"\r\n\nUndiscernable.               5:45\r\n\nUndiscernable (small plane heard)                 5:50\r\n\n\"You sound dumb or you would go . . .\"            5:55\r\n\n\"You mustn't think this is very                   6:10\r\nserious, just sitting in your office\r\nanswering the phone.\"\r\n\n\"You must be pretty stupid . . .\"                 6:18\r\n\nUndiscernable.               6:25\r\n\n\"You find this exciting, don't you?\"              6:48\r\n\n\"This is my last call.  In twenty-five            6:51\r\nminutes, I'll see you in hell.\"\r\n\n\"It's your job to think about the                 7:07\r\npatients.  I do care, but the\r\nGovernment needs a message.\"\r\n\nAll of the phone calls had the same ring pattern,\r\nindicating that they were made from outside the VAMC.  An officer,\r\nother than Perrault, answered the 5:30 call.  He described the\r\nvoice as distorted, not a normal voice   \"like some kind of tape\r\nrecorder.\"\r\nAs a result of the bomb threat, fifty acutely ill\r\npatients were moved by wheelchairs and stretchers from the building\r\ncontaining Ward C and Ward C Annex to another building several\r\nhundred yards away.  No explosive devices were found in the\r\nbuilding.\r\nOn the evening of September 27, Perrault received two\r\nanonymous telephone calls while on duty at the security desk.  He\r\ndescribed the voice as exactly like that of the caller on\r\nSeptember 26.  Gilbert's telephone toll records did not show any\r\ncalls from her home at the time of the September 27th calls. \r\nAfter listening again to the taped calls made on\r\nSeptember 26, Perrault noticed that certain tones of the caller\r\nsounded very familiar.  He described the caller as sounding hurt,\r\nupset, taunting, provocative, cold, and unfeeling.  He also noticed\r\nthat the calls seemed directed at him personally.  He was of the\r\nopinion that the caller was Gilbert.\r\nOn September 28 and 29 Perrault was off from work and was\r\nnot on duty at the VAMC.  No anonymous phone calls were received at\r\nthe VAMC on either of those days.\r\nOn September 30, Gilbert told her neighbor (O'Donnell)\r\nthat she had gone to the Holyoke Mall and visited an Internet\r\ncoffee shop.  She said that she had logged onto the Internet and\r\nobtained a bomb recipe which she said was \"easy to find.\"\r\nAbout 6:25 p.m. on the 30th, Gilbert bought a \"Talkboy\r\nJr.\" and the batteries to run it at Toys-R-Us with a personal\r\ncheck.  Like the \"Talkgirl\" the \"Talkboy\" is a voice changer and\r\noperates in the same manner.  The cashier who sold the toy to\r\nGilbert remembered that Gilbert wanted to be sure that the\r\nbatteries worked with it and that Gilbert told her she wanted the\r\ntoy for her nephews.  Gilbert does not have any nephews.\r\nAt 6:44 p.m. on September 30, Perrault received a phone\r\ncall stating, \"Officer Perrault, I've been watching you, boy.\" \r\nPerrault described the voice as the same as the one who made the\r\ncall on September 26, except that this time the caller appeared to\r\nbe \"trying to put a southern drawl into it.\"  Perrault received two\r\nmore calls on September 30.  The caller sounded the same as the one\r\nwho had made the first call that evening.\r\nOn the same evening, September 30, other departments at\r\nthe VAMC, i.e., Admissions and the Nurses' Station on Ward C, also\r\nreceived unidentified phone calls.  Those who received the calls\r\ndescribed the voice as sounding electronically altered or as a\r\nmechanical-sounding voice.\r\nAfter finishing his shift on September 30, Perrault went\r\nto the local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Club about midnight. \r\nShortly after arriving he received a phone call at the bar.  The\r\ncaller stated:  \"You think you have a problem?  Just wait and see\r\nwhat I have planned for you.\"  Perrault recognized the voice as\r\nbeing the same as the one in the prior phone calls.  Gilbert knew\r\nthat Perrault usually stopped at that VFW on the way home from\r\nwork.  In fact, she had met him there on several prior occasions,\r\nwithout notice beforehand.  On this same day, September 30,\r\nPerrault received a letter from Gilbert in which she said that as\r\nshe drove by the VFW one evening she saw his car and stood outside\r\nand watched him through a window playing darts.\r\nOn October 1, 1996, Perrault met with investigators and\r\nit was agreed that he would call Gilbert when he started his shift\r\non the security desk at 5:00 p.m.  Surveillance of a number of pay\r\ntelephone booths in the vicinity of Gilbert's apartment was\r\narranged for that evening.  Perrault called Gilbert at 5:12 p.m.\r\nand left a message on her answering machine that he would be at the\r\nsecurity desk until 7:00 p.m.  Perrault received a series of\r\nanonymous phone calls at 5:25 p.m., 5:41 p.m., 5:44 p.m., and\r\n6:37 p.m.  The voice was the same as that of the prior anonymous\r\ncalls.  Another officer on duty received an anonymous call at\r\n7:35 p.m.  He described the voice as strange, male-sounding and\r\ndistorted.  The 5:41 p.m. and 5:44 p.m. calls were traced to\r\ntelephone pay stations at a Citgo gas station and the Daily\r\nHampshire Gazette.  Gilbert later admitted to Perrault that she had\r\nused those pay phones, but denied making any of the phone calls in\r\nquestion.\r\nShortly before the 6:37 p.m. pay-booth phone call,\r\nMassachusetts State Trooper Kevin Murphy, who was on surveillance,\r\nsaw Gilbert arrive in her car at the Tasty Top, an ice cream stand,\r\nand use the pay telephone booth outside of it.  Trooper Murphy\r\nradioed to Special Agent Plante (a member of the surveillance\r\nteam).  Plante contacted Perrault at the VAMC security desk, who\r\nconfirmed that he had just received a call in which there was\r\ntraffic noise and heavy breathing noise.\r\nA fingerprint from Gilbert's right index finger was\r\nlifted from the telephone receiver at the Tasty Top phone booth. \r\nGilbert later told Perrault that she had made a phone call from the\r\nTasty Top booth to check her answering machine and that she had\r\nseen a State Trooper at the Tasty Top.  \r\nOn the evening of October 1, 1996, a search warrant was\r\nexecuted at Gilbert's apartment.  Trooper Murphy seized from the\r\ntrash three empty battery packages for Energizer batteries, two\r\nbatteries stamped LI54 on the back, and a Thrifty Drug Store\r\nreceipt showing the purchase of the Energizer batteries.  Detective\r\nLieutenant Thomas Soutier also seized a \"Talkboy\" from a closet in\r\na child's room which contained a tape cassette that was blank. \r\nAgent Plante seized operating instructions for the \"Talkboy\" from\r\nthe left pocket of Gilbert's outdoor jacket, which Agent Plante\r\nfound lying on her bed.  Agent Plante also found a Daily Hampshire\r\nGazette, dated September 27, 1996, on Gilbert's bed that contained\r\nan article about the bomb threat.\r\nWhile the police were executing the search warrant,\r\nGilbert went over to her neighbor's (O'Donnell) apartment.  Gilbert\r\ntold O'Donnell that the police were looking for a voice-changing\r\ndevice, similar to a toy that her son owned, that \"could change\r\nyour voice up high like a chipmunk or down low like a man.\"  She\r\nalso told O'Donnell that if the police found such a device in her\r\nhouse, it might be broken, the tape might be erased or blank, or\r\nthe batteries might be dead.  The investigators never told Gilbert\r\nthat they were looking for a child's toy that could change a\r\nperson's voice.  The VAMC did not receive any more telephone calls\r\nfrom the anonymous caller after October 1st.\r\nBruce Koenig, a government expert, tested the \"Talkboy\"\r\nand determined that the variance in speed from low to high speed on\r\nthe \"Talkboy\" was 31.1%.  Koenig increased the playback speed for\r\nexhibit 13, the tape containing the September 30th phone calls, by\r\n31.1%.  The telephone calls on exhibit 13 were tape-recorded\r\nmessages; the messages had been pre-recorded on the \"Talkboy\", and\r\nthen played back at a slower speed.  Mr. Koenig created a speed-\r\ncorrected tape of exhibit 13, which became exhibit 44. \r\nOne of Gilbert's friends, Ms. Abderhalden, who had known\r\nand worked with Gilbert for over five years and had talked to\r\nGilbert daily in the fall of 1996, identified the voice on\r\nexhibit 44 as Gilbert's voice, as did Glenn Gilbert her former\r\nhusband. \r\n                              II\r\nWe first turn to the interstate commerce-jurisdiction\r\nissue.  Gilbert argues that because there was no evidence \"that the\r\ntelephone system used was more than an intrastate system, or that\r\nthe threat call was routed through an interstate system,\" there was\r\nno effect on or nexus to interstate commerce.  Appellant's Br. at\r\n19.  This claim is one of the many that have surfaced in the wake\r\nof United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995).  And, as with most\r\nof the others, the claim fails to float.\r\nBefore starting our legal analysis, we address the\r\ngovernment's suggestion that Gilbert's claim was procedurally\r\ndefaulted and is reviewable only for plain error.  We do not have\r\nto resolve the issue because we do not think there was error, plain\r\nor otherwise.\r\nWe now proceed to our analysis of the interstate\r\ncommerce-jurisdictional question.  The first paragraph of Lopez\r\nsummarizes the case:\r\n     In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990,\r\nCongress made it a federal offense \"for any \r\nindividual knowingly to possess a firearm at a \r\nplace that the individual knows, or has \r\nreasonable cause to believe, is a school \r\nzone.\"  18 U.S.C.  922(q)(1)(A)(1988 ed.,\r\nSupp.  V).  The Act neither regulates a\r\ncommercial  activity nor contains a\r\nrequirement that the  possession be connected\r\nin any way to  interstate commerce.  We hold\r\nthat the Act  exceeds the authority of\r\nCongress \"[t]o  regulate Commerce . . . among\r\nthe several  States . . . .\" U.S. Const., Art.\r\nI, 8, cl. 3.\r\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 551.\r\n\nLopez does not apply because a telephone is an\r\ninstrumentality of interstate commerce and this alone is a\r\nsufficient basis for jurisdiction based on interstate commerce.\r\nIn Lopez itself the Court held:\r\n  First, Congress may regulate the use of the \r\nchannels of interstate commerce . . . . \r\nSecond, Congress is empowered to regulate and\r\nprotect the instrumentalities of interstate\r\ncommerce, or persons or things in interstate\r\ncommerce, even though the threat comes only\r\nfrom intrastate activities . . . .  Finally,\r\nCongress' commerce authority includes the\r\npower to regulate those activities having a\r\nsubstantial relation to interstate commerce\r\n. . . , i.e., those activities that\r\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce.  \r\n\nId. at 558 (emphasis ours, cites and quotes omitted.)  The Court\r\nheld that the statute at issue in Lopez fell into the third\r\ncategory and could only be sustained \"as a regulation of an\r\nactivity that substantially affects interstate commerce,\" id. at\r\n559.  In the present case, we are dealing instead with the second\r\ncategory.\r\nShortly after Lopez was decided the Court issued a per\r\ncuriam opinion in United States v. Robertson, 514 U.S. 669 (1995).\r\nThe case was brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\r\nPractices Act (RICO) on the basis that defendant had invested\r\nproceeds obtained from unlawful acts proscribed by RICO, in the\r\npurchase and operation of a gold mine.  Section 1962(a) prohibits\r\nthe \"acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or\r\noperation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities\r\nof which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\"  \r\nThe Ninth Circuit reversed defendant's conviction on the\r\nground that the government had failed to prove that the gold mine\r\n\"was engaged in or affect[ed] interstate commerce.\"  Id. at 670. \r\nThe Court did not consider the \"affecting\" commerce question.  It\r\npointed out that the evidence showed conclusively that the gold\r\nmine itself was engaged in interstate commerce activities.  These\r\nactivities \"assuredly brought the gold mine within  1962(a)'s\r\nalternative criterion of 'any enterprise . . . engaged in . . .\r\ninterstate or foreign commerce.'\"  Id. at 672.  This case is not\r\nprecisely on point but it illustrates that \"affecting interstate\r\ncommerce\" is not the sole test to use in determining whether there\r\nis interstate commerce jurisdiction.\r\nThere are cases directly on point:  United States v.\r\nKunzman, 54 F.3d 1522, 1527 (10th Cir. 1995), held:  \"As long as\r\nthe instrumentality used is itself an integral part of an\r\ninterstate system, Congress may regulate intrastate activities\r\ninvolving the use of the instrumentality under the federal\r\nsecurities laws.\" \r\nThe intrastate telephone call cases are of long standing\r\nbut like old wine have a pertinent robust taste.  Loveridge v.\r\nDreagoux, 678 F.2d 870, 874 (10th Cir. 1982), held:  \"[P]roof of\r\nintrastate telephonic messages in connection with the employment of\r\ndeceptive devices or contrivances is sufficient to confer\r\njurisdiction in a  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 action.\"  In Alley v.\r\nMiramon, 614 F.2d 1372, 1379 (5th Cir. 1980) the court held:  \"This\r\ncourt has consistently held that the intrastate use of the\r\ntelephone may confer jurisdiction over a private action under\r\nSection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\"  In Kerbs v. Fall River Indus.,\r\nInc., 502 F.2d 731 (10th Cir. 1974) the court explained cogently\r\nthe reason for the telephone-call rule: \r\n  Both intrastate and interstate telephone \r\ncommunications are part of an aggregate \r\ntelephonic system as a whole.  And as long as \r\nthe instrumentality itself is an integral part \r\nof an interstate system, Congress has power, \r\nwhen necessary for the protection of \r\ninterstate commerce, to include intrastate \r\nactivities within its regulatory control.\r\n\nId. at 738 (citation omitted).\r\nThe use of the telephone in this case to make a bomb-\r\nthreat was, without more, sufficient to sustain jurisdiction under\r\nthe interstate commerce clause.\r\n                             III\r\nThe first evidentiary issue is rather unique and requires\r\nexplanation.  Prior to the bomb threat, Gilbert and some others\r\nwere the subject of an investigation by the VAMC police and other\r\npolice agencies.  The investigation was prompted by unexpected\r\ndeaths at the VA hospital.  That there was an ongoing investigation\r\nwas common knowledge at the VAMC and in the outside community. \r\nPrior to trial, the district court discussed with counsel\r\nhow to handle the introduction of the fact that there was an\r\ninvestigation going on and that Gilbert was one of those being\r\ninvestigated.  The court told counsel that he would not exclude\r\nentirely the fact that there was an investigation in process\r\nbecause the case \"flowed\" around the investigation.  After a\r\nlengthy pre-trial conference on the instructions to be given to the\r\njury, the following instruction was given at the outset of the\r\ntrial:\r\n     Here is my preliminary instruction to you. \r\nI want to instruct you now on part of the \r\nbackground of this case.  Beginning around \r\nFebruary 1996, seven months before the bomb \r\nthreat charged by the Government in this case, \r\nan independent investigation began about \r\ncertain possible wrongdoing at the VA. \r\n\n     That separate investigation had nothing to \r\ndo with the charge in this case.  The supposed \r\nwrongdoing involved something else entirely.  \r\nFor a time that separate investigation \r\nincluded within its scope, among other people \r\nand things, the defendant here Kristen \r\nGilbert.\r\n\n     I'm not going to tell you about the \r\nspecifics of that other separate suspected \r\nwrongdoing because to do so would give that \r\nsupposed misconduct more weight than it \r\ndeserves.  I have also instructed counsel not \r\nto refer to the specifics of that \r\ninvestigation.  I do want to emphasize a \r\ncouple points however.\r\n\n     Nearly two years after that separate \r\ninvestigation first began, there is still no \r\nsufficient evidence that any wrongful act was \r\never committed by anyone.\r\n\n     Moreover, although at some point the \r\ninvestigation turned in part towards this \r\ndefendant, Ms. Gilbert has never been charged \r\nwith the wrongdoing that was the subject of \r\nthat separate investigation.  So as far as \r\nthis trial is concerned, even assuming that \r\nthe other wrongdoing ever actually occurred, \r\nshe is not only entirely innocent of that \r\nseparate misconduct, she has not ever been \r\ncharged with it.\r\n\n     The fact that there was an investigation, \r\nhowever, and that for some time it included \r\nthe defendant, among other persons and things \r\nwithin its scope, is part of the background of \r\nthis case.  You may hear references to that \r\ninvestigation, and I am therefore permitting \r\nyou to know of the fact of that separate \r\ninvestigation.\r\n\n     Do not speculate about the subject matter \r\nof that separate investigation.  It doesn't \r\nmatter.  Such speculation might distract you \r\nfrom your task in this trial, which is to \r\ndetermine whether the Government has proven \r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \r\nphoned a bomb threat to the VA on\r\nSeptember 26, 1996.\r\n\n     Keep in mind as well that the fact that a \r\nperson is investigated for some separate \r\nwrongdoing is not evidence of any kind that \r\nthe person is guilty of the crime they have \r\nactually been charged with.\r\n\n     You should not, as a matter of law and as a \r\nmatter of fundamental fairness, assume in any \r\nway that Ms. Gilbert is or might be guilty of \r\nphoning in a bomb threat simply because she \r\nhappened to fall within the scope of a \r\nseparate investigation involving something \r\nentirely different.  The fact that she was \r\nincluded for a time in that separate \r\ninvestigation is simply not evidence against \r\nher in this case in any way.\r\n\n     As I have said, I am permitting the \r\nevidence of the existence of that separate \r\ninvestigation to come in this limited form \r\nsimply to give you the background and context \r\nout of which the evidence in this case partly \r\narises.  Consider this evidence only in this \r\nlight.\r\n\nGilbert took the position at trial that evidence of the\r\nother investigation should not have been admitted at all.  She\r\nargues before us that its admission violated the provisions of Fed.\r\nR. Evid. 404(b), was an abuse of discretion, and deprived her of a\r\nfair trail.  The government counters that the evidence was properly\r\nadmissible under Fed. Rules of Evidence 401 and 403 and \"in the\r\nalternative\" under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\r\nPrior to giving the jury instruction the court made the\r\nfollowing rulings.  It expressed doubt that the investigation\r\nevidence \r\n  constitutes the sort of other-act evidence \r\nthat falls within the scope of Rule 404(b).  I \r\nthink the fact is that the evidence of the \r\nother investigation is connected to this case \r\nin a way that really makes it part of the \r\nGovernment's proof of the actual act that has \r\nbeen charged.\r\n\n     This isn't a pure other-act type of\r\nsituation where, for example, the Government\r\nwould be trying to prove that the defendant\r\nengaged in some kind of misconduct two or\r\nthree years ago and therefore is likely to be \r\nguilty or possibly guilty of the charge that \r\nshe's facing here at this time.\r\n\nThe court then acknowledged that it might be wrong about\r\nRule 404(b)'s applicability and stated that it was \"going to make\r\na finding under Rule 404(b) to cover the situation:\" \r\n     I want to make it clear that in permitting \r\nevidence of the other investigation to come \r\nin, I do find that it has special relevance in \r\nthis case both on the issues of motive and \r\nidentity, and that special relevance is \r\nentirely separate from any improper purpose \r\nthat the evidence might be offered for, \r\nmeaning propensity evidence.\r\n\n     I believe also that the probative value of \r\nthe evidence outweighs any unfair prejudice \r\nthat will be done to the defendant as a result \r\nof my letting this in, particularly in the \r\ncontext of the limiting instruction that I \r\nwill give.\r\n\n     So I want to make sure that my specific \r\nfindings are on the record to the extent that \r\nwe are in the area of Rule 404(b).  I also\r\nwant to make it clear because this is close to\r\n404(b) that I'm approaching it as if it were\r\n404(b) evidence in assessing the probative\r\nweight versus the unfair prejudice.\r\n\nWe start our analysis with the three evidentiary rules\r\nimplicated.  Rule 401 defines relevant evidence.  Rule 403 provides\r\nfor the exclusion of relevant evidence on the grounds of prejudice,\r\nconfusion or waste of time.  The pertinent part of Rule 404(b)\r\nstates:\r\n     (b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. \r\nEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is \r\nnot admissible to prove the character of a \r\nperson in order to show action in conformity \r\ntherewith.  It may, however, be admissible for \r\nother purposes, such as proof of motive, \r\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, \r\nknowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or \r\naccident.\r\n\nOur standard of review of a district court's admission or\r\nexclusion of evidence is abuse of discretion.\r\n  We review a trial court's Rule 403 balancing \r\ntest for an abuse of discretion, and only in \r\n\"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" \r\nwill we reverse a district court's \"on-the- \r\nspot judgment\" concerning the probative value \r\nand unfair effect of the proffered evidence.  \r\n\nUnited States v. Shea, 159 F.3d 37 (1st Cir. 1998); United States\r\nv. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nWe do not think that the investigation evidence is barred\r\nby either Rule 403 or Rule 404(b).  As the district court pointed\r\nout, it could be described as part of the proof that Gilbert was\r\nthe one who made the telephone bomb threat.  The jury could well\r\nhave found that her reaction to the investigation as shown by what\r\nshe said and did was the motive for the bomb threat.  And proof of\r\nmotive is one of the purposes for admitting evidence that would be\r\notherwise excludable under Rule 404(b).  Thanks to the admirable\r\ninstruction given the jury on this matter and the rulings made in\r\nconjunction with it by the district court, we need go no further. \r\nWe hold that the other investigation evidence was properly\r\nadmitted.\r\nThe next evidentiary issue is more troublesome.  It\r\ninvolves the admissions of expert testimony that resulted in the\r\npositive voice identification of Gilbert as the person who made the\r\ntelephone calls on September 30, 1996 (subsequent to the bomb\r\nthreat calls on September 26).  Gilbert argues that the admission\r\nwas erroneous for three reasons:  (1) ambush, abuse of discretion,\r\nand deprivation of a fair trial; (2) the voice identifications were\r\nunduly suggestive, inherently unreliable, and constituted an abuse\r\nof discretion; (3) the trial court's refusal to give an adverse\r\ninference instruction constituted reversible abuse of discretion. \r\nThe procedural history of the voice identification is\r\nimportant.  We first note that there was no mention of a positive\r\nidentification of Gilbert's voice in the government's opening.  We\r\nstart our recital of the facts underlying this issue by pointing\r\nout that what took place is based in part on the representations of\r\nthe prosecutor which the court obviously accepted.  We make no\r\nsuggestion that the prosecutor misrepresented the facts or the\r\ncourt erred in accepting the prosecutor's representations.\r\nTrial started on Wednesday, January 7, 1998.  On the\r\nweekend prior to trial, the prosecutor was \"fooling around\" with\r\nexhibit 13 on a play back tape recorder.  Exhibit 13 consisted of\r\ntape recordings of phone calls made on September 30.  Perrault\r\nreceived three phone calls during the evening of September 30.  The\r\nvoice on all three calls sounded the same to Perrault.  On the same\r\nevening, there were unidentified phone calls made to various\r\ndepartments of the VAMC.  The testimony of the recipients was that\r\nthe voice sounded as being electronically altered or was a\r\nmechanical sounding voice.\r\nAs the prosecutor \"fiddled\" with the tape recorder that\r\nheld exhibit 13, he became aware that when the play back speed of\r\nthe recorder was increased that Gilbert's natural voice was heard. \r\nThis discovery was confirmed on January 6.  On January 7, after the\r\ntrial started, the government sought to have Gilbert's ex-husband\r\nGlenn Gilbert, identify defendant's voice by playing exhibit 13 on\r\na voice transmitter with a variable speed adjustment.  The court\r\nsustained Gilbert's objection, subject to a change of ruling if the\r\ngovernment obtained an expert witness.  The court was of the\r\nopinion that allowing the government to vary the speed of the play\r\nback to obtain Gilbert's natural voice would be unreliable and too\r\nhaphazard.\r\nThe government promptly contacted an expert, Bruce\r\nKoenig, who was in the business of analyzing audio and video tapes. \r\nPreparatory to testifying, he speeded up the play back so that\r\nGilbert's natural voice was heard.  This was recorded on another\r\ntape, exhibit 44.  It must be borne in mind that part of the\r\ngovernment's theory on the voice identification issue was that\r\nGilbert had made the September 30 phone calls on the \"Talkboy\"\r\nrecorder that she bought on September 30 at 6:25 p.m. at Toys-R-Us.\r\nKoenig delivered the tape he created (exhibit 44) to the\r\ngovernment on Sunday, January 11, which immediately provided the\r\ndefense with a copy of it and a statement of Koenig's proposed\r\ntestimony.\r\nOn Monday, July 12, the prosecutor proffered Koenig as a\r\nwitness.  Gilbert objected on the grounds already stated.  She also\r\npointed out that she would be severely prejudiced because of the\r\nshort amount of time she had to prepare for his testimony.\r\nThe court decided to admit the evidence but gave Gilbert\r\nseveral options among which was a short continuance.  Gilbert\r\ndeclined the continuance but accepted the court's offer to allow\r\nher expert to testify out of order.  Gilbert was also given an\r\nopportunity to voir dire Koenig, which she did for ninety minutes.\r\nOn January 13, Gilbert called her expert, Christopher\r\nRyan.  Ryan was a full-time musician, master engineer, and record\r\nproducer.  His testimony was that, after listening to the \"Talkboy\"\r\ntape, he was of the opinion that it was incapable of producing the\r\nconversation recorded on exhibit 44.\r\nKoenig, the government's witness, testified as to how he\r\nhad tested the \"Talkboy\" for variances in speed and then created a\r\nspeed corrected tape of exhibit 13 which became exhibit 44.\r\nThere was testimony by two witnesses, a long time friend\r\nof Gilbert and Gilbert's ex-husband, that the voice on exhibit 44\r\nwas that of defendant.\r\nWe do not doubt that Gilbert was surprised by the\r\npositive voice identification testimony.  We do not think, however,\r\nthat she was ambushed by it, if we define ambush as the government\r\ndeliberately laying a trap for her to walk into.  If the events\r\nleading to the discovery that speeding up of the September 30 tape\r\nrecordings disclosed Gilbert's natural voice were as the prosecutor\r\nstated, there was no ambush, just a fortuitous discovery by the\r\nprosecutor the weekend prior to start of the trial.  And even if we\r\nwere skeptical about the prosecutor's assertion, we would be bound\r\nby the district court's decision to admit the evidence.  \"A\r\ndistrict court's denial of a motion to suppress will be upheld if\r\nany reasonable view of the evidence supports the denial.\"  United\r\nStates v. Watson, 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).  United States v.\r\nde Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).  And the standard\r\nof review of discovery decisions is abuse of discretion.  United\r\nStates v. Samalot-Perez, 767 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1985). \r\nWe think that the district court's handling of this\r\nsurprise evidence treated Gilbert fairly under the circumstances. \r\nShe eschewed the offer of a short continuance and opted instead to\r\nput on her own expert out of order.  The prosecutor had given her,\r\nas soon as it was available, a statement of the testimony of its\r\nexpert that would be proffered at trial.  And Gilbert was accorded\r\nan extensive voir dire of the government's expert before he\r\ntestified before the jury.  Significantly, Gilbert does not state\r\nhow she was prejudiced by the late disclosure of the voice\r\nidentification testimony or how it would have changed her defense\r\nstrategy.  United States v. Melucci, 888 F.2d 200, 203 (1st Cir.\r\n1989).\r\nMoreover, Gilbert had been furnished a copy of exhibit 13\r\nover a year prior to trial.  She certainly had an opportunity to\r\nhave her expert perform as many tests on it as necessary.\r\nGilbert also argues on appeal that the court erred in not\r\nexcluding Koenig's testimony on the grounds that it was scientific\r\nevidence and did not pass the reliability and validity tests of\r\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 590-93\r\n(1993).  The short answer to this argument is that there was no\r\nobjection in the trial court on this basis.  No suggestion was made\r\nby Gilbert that the Daubert principles should be applied to\r\nKoenig's testimony.  Our rule is that an objection not made in the\r\ntrial court will not be considered in the first instance on appeal. \r\nCooperman v. Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1999);\r\nAlbion v. YMCA Camp Letts, 171 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999).\r\nGilbert's second contention is that the voice\r\nidentifications were unduly suggestive and their admission an abuse\r\nof discretion because the witnesses already knew Gilbert's voice\r\nbut were not given comparisons of tape recordings of other voices. \r\nIn addition, both witnesses had listened to exhibit 44 prior to\r\ntestifying and identified the voice as that of Gilbert.  For these\r\nreasons, Gilbert says that the trial judge should have excluded the\r\nidentifications in this case.\r\nWhile there were certainly suggestive elements in this\r\nprocedure, the Supreme Court has made clear that this does not\r\nviolate due process if the identification remains sufficiently\r\nreliable, see Manson v. Braithwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977), cf.\r\nGovernment of Virgin Islands v. Sanes, 57 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 1995). \r\nHere, the witnesses were both familiar with Gilbert's voice and\r\ntherefore had a solid basis for their opinion that the taped voice\r\nwas Gilbert's, and the defense was free to bring out on cross-\r\nexamination any aspects of suggestiveness, including the pretrial\r\nexposure of the witnesses to the tape.  This was a judgment call by\r\nthe district court under an abuse of discretion standard, and we do\r\nnot think that the discretion was abused.\r\nMoreover, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to\r\nconvict without the voice identification of the September 30\r\n\"Talkboy\" telephone calls.  We summarize the evidence, omitting the\r\nvoice identification testimony.  \r\nGilbert purchased a \"Talkgirl Jr.\" about three and one\r\nhalf hours before the bomb threat calls to the VAMC on the evening\r\nof September 26, 1996.  The \"Talkgirl Jr.\" could make a woman's\r\nvoice sound like that of a man.  Gilbert left her apartment eleven\r\nminutes before the first bomb threat calls were received at the\r\nVAMC.  She did not return home for about three hours.\r\nAfter listening to the tape recordings of the ten phone\r\ncalls made on the evening of September 26, 1996, the first of which\r\nwas the bomb threat, Perrault believed that they all were made by\r\nGilbert.  She admitted to Perrault that she watched from across the\r\nstreet as the building which the caller said \"contained three\r\nexplosive devices\" was evacuated.  \r\nPersonnel at the VAMC and Perrault received a number of\r\nunidentified phone calls over the next several days.  The calls\r\nwere made by someone who knew Perrault's work schedule, which\r\nGilbert did.  Some of the calls to Perrault were of a personal\r\nnature.  Perrault believed that the voice on these calls was the\r\nsame as the one that had made the bomb threat calls.\r\nOn September 27th, Gilbert purchased a \"Talkboy Jr.\"\r\nwhich like the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" could make a woman's voice sound like\r\nthat of a man.  She told the clerk from whom she made the purchase\r\nthat it was a gift for her nephews.  Gilbert does not have any\r\nnephews.  The VAMC received an unidentified phone call about 15\r\nminutes after the purchase.  The caller's voice sounded the same as\r\nthe other calls.\r\nOn October first, it was decided to conduct a\r\nsurveillance of a number of pay phone booths in the vicinity of\r\nGilbert's apartment.  Perrault agreed to call Gilbert from the\r\nsecurity desk at VAMC, which he did at 5:00 p.m.  At 6:37 p.m. the\r\nVAMC received an unidentified phone call in the same voice as the\r\nothers.  At the same time Gilbert was observed by a state trooper\r\nmaking a phone call from a pay phone booth near her apartment.  A\r\nfingerprint from Gilbert's right index finger was lifted from the\r\nreceiver at the phone booth.\r\nA warrant-authorized search was made of Gilbert's\r\napartment during the evening of October 1.  A \"Talkboy Jr.\" and\r\nother incriminating evidence was seized.\r\nThis evidence was sufficient without the voice\r\nidentification evidence for a conviction.  Because, however, the\r\nadmission of the voice identification was not error, we need not\r\ndecide whether it would have been harmless error.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n",

James Perrault was a VAMC police officer who worked the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift at the medical center. In the summer of 1995 Gilbert and Perrault became friendly. The friendship blossomed into a full-blown affair in September and October of 1995. At the time Gilbert was married. In November, 1995, Gilbert filed for divorce against her husband, Glenn Gilbert, and moved out of their home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 1996, an investigation was launched at the VAMC because of some suspicious occurrences at the hospital. The investigation became an official criminal investigation in a few months. Gilbert was one of the targets of the investigation. Many employees at the VAMC were interviewed and grand jury subpoenas were served on some employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert was photographed and handwriting samples were taken from her. Gilbert was upset by the investigation and made her feelings known. She told her former husband (the divorce had become final) that he had the    right not to speak to the investigators. After he had spoken to them anyway, she became angry and upset. She disparaged him to several people by belittling him and using epithets to denigrate him. Gilbert also expressed anger and resentment against those of her co-workers who cooperated with the investigation. She told a co-worker that \"maybe they ought to investigate\" Gilbert's nursing supervisor. Gilbert became upset and angry with some of her co-workers on the evening shift because they would not talk to a private investigator she had retained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert talked about the investigation with Perrault. She told him that three nurses who worked in Ward C were responsible for starting the investigation and she \"couldn't understand why they were trying to do this to me.\" Perrault suggested leaving the area, but Gilbert refused, saying she \"wanted everybody here to see what they had done to ruin her life.\" Perrault tried to end their relationship in June of 1996, but she begged him not to do so. In late July, 1996, Gilbert told a friend of hers that if Perrault \"dumped her, she probably would start stalking him.\" Perrault tried again in late August of 1996 to break his relationship with    Gilbert. She became upset and blamed the investigation for this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, 1996, Perrault told Gilbert of the day and time he had agreed to be interviewed in Springfield, Massachusetts, by investigators from the United States Attorney's Office. Gilbert became upset and begged Perrault not to attend the interview. On the day of the interview, Gilbert blocked Perrault's car with her car as he attempted to drive out of his driveway. She asked Perrault to talk to her and not to go to the interview. When Perrault made it clear that he would not do as she wished, she returned to her car and drove off. On arriving at Springfield, Perrault used a parking garage that he and Gilbert had used on prior occasions. When Perrault returned to his car after the interview he found that air had been let out of his right front tire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the next several days Perrault's car was stained by egg yolks from eggs that had been thrown at it, the windshield was spray-painted, scratches were made on the exterior by keys, and the front license plate was damaged. After the damage to the license plate, Perrault saw a car similar in appearance to Gilbert's enter the parking lot that Perrault used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert denied that she was responsible for the damage to Perrault's car, but admitted she had been in the parking lot prior to and after the bomb threat to the VAMC on September 26, 1996. Gilbert called a neighbor of hers on two occasions to ask if Perrault had been checking on her. When told that Perrault had inquired about her, the neighbor testified that Gilbert became very angry and said, \"Twit, fucking twit,\" in what the neighbor described as a deep controlled tone of voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting in mid-September Perrault received a number of phone calls at his residence. There was no voice communication, only heavy breathing or hang-ups. Perrault unsuccessfully tried to trace the calls. He contacted NYNEX which traced seven of the calls to Gilbert's telephone number. A pen register was installed on Gilbert's phone on September 26, after the bomb threat. The pen register showed that, between September 26 and October 1, 1996, about one half of Gilbert's phone calls to Perrault used a method (called the \" *67 function\") which prevented Perrault from tracing her calls from his own telephone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, the day of the bomb threat that was the basis of the indictment, Gilbert purchased a \"Talkgirl    Jr.\" with her VISA credit card at Toys-R-Us. She also bought several packages of Energizer batteries from a Thrifty Drug Store about an hour after the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" purchase. The batteries could be used to activate the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" The toy is a hand-held voice changer that records a statement which can be played back at a higher or lower speed than the original recording.

An officer, other than Perrault, answered the 5:30 call. He described the voice as distorted, not a normal voice - \"like some kind of tape recorder.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the bomb threat, fifty acutely ill patients were moved by wheelchairs and stretchers from the building containing Ward C and Ward C Annex to another building several hundred yards away.

He described the voice as exactly like that of the caller on September 26. Gilbert's telephone toll records did not show any calls from her home at the time of the September 27th calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening again to the taped calls made on September 26, Perrault noticed that certain tones of the caller sounded very familiar. He described the caller as sounding hurt, upset, taunting, provocative, cold, and unfeeling. He also noticed that the calls seemed directed at him personally. He was of the opinion that the caller was Gilbert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28 and 29 Perrault was off from work and was not on duty at the VAMC. No anonymous phone calls were received at the VAMC on either of those days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, Gilbert told her neighbor (O'Donnell) that she had gone to the Holyoke Mall and visited an Internet coffee shop. She said that she had logged onto the Internet and obtained a bomb recipe which she said was \"easy to find.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 6:25 p.m. on the 30th, Gilbert bought a \"Talkboy Jr.\" and the batteries to run it at Toys-R-Us with a personal check. Like the \"Talkgirl\" the \"Talkboy\" is a voice changer and operates in the same manner. The cashier who    sold the toy to Gilbert remembered that Gilbert wanted to be sure that the batteries worked with it and that Gilbert told her she wanted the toy for her nephews. Gilbert does not have any nephews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 6:44 p.m. on September 30, Perrault received a phone call stating, \"Officer Perrault, I've been watching you, boy.\" Perrault described the voice as the same as the one who made the call on September 26, except that this time the caller appeared to be \"trying to put a southern drawl into it.\" Perrault received two more calls on September 30. The caller sounded the same as the one who had made the first call that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same evening, September 30, other departments at the VAMC, i.e., Admissions and the Nurses' Station on Ward C, also received unidentified phone calls. Those who received the calls described the voice as sounding electronically altered or as a mechanical-sounding voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After finishing his shift on September 30, Perrault went to the local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Club about midnight. Shortly after arriving he received a phone call at the bar. The caller stated: \"You think you have a problem? Just wait and see what I have planned for you.\" Perrault recognized    the voice as being the same as the one in the prior phone calls. Gilbert knew that Perrault usually stopped at that VFW on the way home from work. In fact, she had met him there on several prior occasions, without notice beforehand. On this same day, September 30, Perrault received a letter from Gilbert in which she said that as she drove by the VFW one evening she saw his car and stood outside and watched him through a window playing darts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 1, 1996, Perrault met with investigators and it was agreed that he would call Gilbert when he started his shift on the security desk at 5:00 p.m. Surveillance of a number of pay telephone booths in the vicinity of Gilbert's apartment was arranged for that evening. Perrault called Gilbert at 5:12 p.m. and left a message on her answering machine that he would be at the security desk until 7:00 p.m. Perrault received a series of anonymous phone calls at 5:25 p.m., 5:41 p.m., 5:44 p.m., and 6:37 p.m. The voice was the same as that of the prior anonymous calls. Another officer on duty received an anonymous call at 7:35 p.m. He described the voice as strange, male-sounding and distorted. The 5:41 p.m. and 5:44 p.m. calls were traced to telephone    pay stations at a Citgo gas station and the Daily Hampshire Gazette. Gilbert later admitted to Perrault that she had used those pay phones, but denied making any of the phone calls in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the 6:37 p.m. pay-booth phone call, Massachusetts State Trooper Kevin Murphy, who was on surveillance, saw Gilbert arrive in her car at the Tasty Top, an ice cream stand, and use the pay telephone booth outside of it. Trooper Murphy radioed to Special Agent Plante (a member of the surveillance team). Plante contacted Perrault at the VAMC security desk, who confirmed that he had just received a call in which there was traffic noise and heavy breathing noise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fingerprint from Gilbert's right index finger was lifted from the telephone receiver at the Tasty Top phone booth. Gilbert later told Perrault that she had made a phone call from the Tasty Top booth to check her answering machine and that she had seen a State Trooper at the Tasty Top.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of October 1, 1996, a search warrant was executed at Gilbert's apartment. Trooper Murphy seized from the trash three empty battery packages for Energizer batteries, two batteries stamped LI54 on the back, and a Thrifty Drug    Store receipt showing the purchase of the Energizer batteries. Detective Lieutenant Thomas Soutier also seized a \"Talkboy\" from a closet in a child's room which contained a tape cassette that was blank. Agent Plante seized operating instructions for the \"Talkboy\" from the left pocket of Gilbert's outdoor jacket, which Agent Plante found lying on her bed. Agent Plante also found a Daily Hampshire Gazette, dated September 27, 1996, on Gilbert's bed that contained an article about the bomb threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the police were executing the search warrant, Gilbert went over to her neighbor's (O'Donnell) apartment. Gilbert told O'Donnell that the police were looking for a voice-changing device, similar to a toy that her son owned, that \"could change your voice up high like a chipmunk or down low like a man.\" She also told O'Donnell that if the police found such a device in her house, it might be broken, the tape might be erased or blank, or the batteries might be dead. The investigators never told Gilbert that they were looking for a child's toy that could change a person's voice. The VAMC did not receive any more telephone calls from the anonymous caller after October 1st.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bruce Koenig, a government    expert, tested the \"Talkboy\" and determined that the variance in speed from low to high speed on the \"Talkboy\" was 31.1%. Koenig increased the playback speed for exhibit 13, the tape containing the September 30th phone calls, by 31.1%. The telephone calls on exhibit 13 were tape-recorded messages; the messages had been pre-recorded on the \"Talkboy\", and then played back at a slower speed. Mr. Koenig created a speed-corrected tape of exhibit 13, which became exhibit 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of Gilbert's friends, Ms. Abderhalden, who had known and worked with Gilbert for over five years and had talked to Gilbert daily in the fall of 1996, identified the voice on exhibit 44 as Gilbert's voice, as did Glenn Gilbert her former husband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first turn to the interstate commerce-jurisdiction issue. Gilbert argues that because there was no evidence \"that the telephone system used was more than an intrastate system, or that the threat call was routed through an interstate system,\" there was no effect on or nexus to interstate commerce. Appellant's Br. at 19. This claim is one of the many that have surfaced in the wake of United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 131 L. Ed. 2d 626, 115 S. Ct. 1624    (1995). And, as with most of the others, the claim fails to float.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before starting our legal analysis, we address the government's suggestion that Gilbert's claim was procedurally defaulted and is reviewable only for plain error. We do not have to resolve the issue because we do not think there was error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now proceed to our analysis of the interstate commerce-jurisdictional question. The first paragraph of Lopez summarizes the case:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Congress made it a federal offense \"for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.\" 18 U.S.C.  922(q)(1)(A)(1988 ed., Supp. V). The Act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce. We hold that the Act exceeds the authority of Congress \"to regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . .\" U.S. Const., Art. I,  8,cl. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez, 514 U.S. at 551.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez does not apply because a telephone is an instrumentality of interstate commerce and this alone is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction    based on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In Lopez itself the Court held:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce . . . . Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities      of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat comes only from intrastate activities . . . . Finally, Congress'      commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce . . ., i.e., those activities that      substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 558 (emphasis ours, cites and quotes omitted.) The Court held that the statute at issue in Lopez fell into the third category and could only be sustained \"as a regulation of an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce,\" id. at 559. In the present case, we are dealing instead with the second category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Lopez was decided the Court issued a per curiam opinion in United States v. Robertson, 514 U.S. 669, 131 L. Ed. 2d 714, 115 S. Ct. 1732 (1995). The case was brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Practices Act (RICO) on the basis    that defendant had invested proceeds obtained from unlawful acts proscribed by RICO, in the purchase and operation of a gold mine. Section 1962(a) prohibits the \"acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit reversed defendant's conviction on the ground that the government had failed to prove that the gold mine \"was engaged in or affected interstate commerce.\" Id. at 670. The Court did not consider the \"affecting\" commerce question. It pointed out that the evidence showed conclusively that the gold mine itself was engaged in interstate commerce activities. These activities \"assuredly brought the gold mine within  1962(a)'s alternative criterion of 'any enterprise . . . engaged in . . . interstate or foreign commerce.'\" Id. at 672. This case is not precisely on point but it illustrates that \"affecting interstate commerce\" is not the sole test to use in determining whether there is interstate commerce jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are cases directly on point: United States v. Kunzman, 54 F.3d 1522, 1527 (10th Cir. 1995), held: \"As long    as the instrumentality used is itself an integral part of an interstate system, Congress may regulate intrastate activities involving the use of the instrumentality under the federal securities laws.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intrastate telephone call cases are of long standing but like old wine have a pertinent robust taste. Loveridge v. Dreagoux, 678 F.2d 870, 874 (10th Cir. 1982), held: \"Proof of intrastate telephonic messages in connection with the employment of deceptive devices or contrivances is sufficient to confer jurisdiction in a  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 action.\" In Alley v. Miramon, 614 F.2d 1372, 1379 (5th Cir. 1980) the court held: \"This court has consistently held that the intrastate use of the telephone may confer jurisdiction over a private action under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\" In Kerbs v. Fall River Indus., Inc., 502 F.2d 731 (10th Cir. 1974) the court explained cogently the reason for the telephone-call rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both intrastate and interstate telephone communications are part of an aggregate telephonic system as a whole. And as long as the instrumentality itself is an integral part of an interstate system, Congress has power, when necessary for the protection of interstate commerce, to include intrastate activities within its regulatory control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 738 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of the telephone in this case to make a bomb-threat was, without more, sufficient to sustain jurisdiction under the interstate commerce clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first evidentiary issue is rather unique and requires explanation. Prior to the bomb threat, Gilbert and some others were the subject of an investigation by the VAMC police and other police agencies. The investigation was prompted by unexpected deaths at the VA hospital. That there was an ongoing investigation was common knowledge at the VAMC and in the outside community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, the district court discussed with counsel how to handle the introduction of the fact that there was an investigation going on and that Gilbert was one of those being investigated. The court told counsel that he would not exclude entirely the fact that there was an investigation in process because the case \"flowed\" around the investigation. After a lengthy pre-trial conference on the instructions to be given to the jury, the following instruction was given at the outset of the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here is my preliminary instruction to you. I want to instruct you now on part of the background of this case. Beginning around February 1996, seven months      before the bomb threat charged by the Government in this case, an independent investigation began about certain possible wrongdoing at the VA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That separate investigation had nothing to do with the charge in this case. The supposed wrongdoing involved something else entirely. For a time that separate investigation included within its scope, among other people and things, the defendant here Kristen Gilbert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm not going to tell you about the specifics of that other separate suspected wrongdoing because to do so would give that supposed misconduct more weight than it deserves. I have also instructed counsel not to refer to the specifics of that investigation. I do want to emphasize a couple points however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly two years after that separate investigation first began, there is still no sufficient evidence that any wrongful act was ever committed by anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although at some point the investigation turned in part towards this defendant, Ms. Gilbert has never been charged with the wrongdoing that was the subject of that separate investigation. So as far as this trial is concerned, even assuming that the other wrongdoing ever actually occurred, she is not only entirely innocent of that separate misconduct, she has not ever been charged with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that there was an investigation, however, and that for some time it included the defendant, among other persons and things within its scope, is part of the background of this case. You may hear references to that investigation, and I am therefore permitting you to know of the fact of that separate investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Do not speculate about the subject matter of that separate investigation. It doesn't matter. Such speculation might distract you from your task in this trial, which is to determine whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant phoned a bomb threat to the VA on September 26, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keep in mind as well that the fact that a person is investigated for some separate wrongdoing is not evidence of any kind that the person is guilty of the crime they have actually been charged with.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You should not, as a matter of law and as a matter of fundamental fairness, assume in any way that Ms. Gilbert is or might be guilty of phoning in a bomb threat simply because she happened to fall within the scope of a separate investigation involving something entirely different. The fact that she was included for a time in that separate investigation is simply not evidence against her in this case in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I have said, I am permitting the evidence of the existence of that separate investigation to come in this limited form simply to give you the background and context out of which the evidence in this case partly arises. Consider this evidence only in this light.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert took the position at trial that evidence of the other investigation should not have been admitted at all. She argues before us that its admission violated the provisions of Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), was an abuse of discretion, and deprived her of a fair trial. The government counters that the evidence was properly admissible under Fed. Rules of Evidence 401 and 403 and \"in the alternative\" under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to giving the jury instruction the court made the following rulings. It expressed doubt that the investigation evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">constitutes the sort of other-act evidence that falls within the scope of Rule 404(b). I think the fact is that the evidence of the other investigation is connected to this case in a way that really makes it part of the Government's proof of the actual act that has been charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This isn't a pure other-act type of situation where, for example, the Government would be trying to prove that the defendant engaged in some kind of misconduct two or three years ago and therefore is likely to be guilty or possibly guilty of the charge that she's facing here at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then acknowledged that it might be wrong about Rule 404(b)'s applicability and stated that it was \"going to make a finding under Rule 404(b) to cover the situation:\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I want to make it clear that in permitting evidence of the other investigation to come in, I do find that it has special relevance in this case both on the issues of motive and identity, and that special relevance is entirely separate from any improper purpose that the evidence might be offered for, meaning propensity evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe also that the probative value of the evidence outweighs any unfair prejudice that will be done to the defendant as a result of my letting this in, particularly in the context of the limiting instruction that I will give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I want to make sure that my specific findings are on the record to the extent that we are in the area of Rule 404(b). I also want to make it clear because this is close to 404(b) that I'm approaching it as if it were 404(b) evidence in assessing the probative weight versus the unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis with the three evidentiary rules implicated. Rule 401 defines relevant evidence. Rule 403 provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence on the grounds of prejudice, confusion or waste of time. The pertinent part of Rule 404(b) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review of a district court's admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a trial court's Rule 403 balancing test for an abuse of discretion, and only in \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" will we reverse a district court's \"on-the-spot judgment\" concerning the probative value and unfair effect of the proffered evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Shea, 159 F.3d 37 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that the investigation evidence is barred by either Rule 403 or Rule 404(b). As the district court pointed out, it could be described as part of the proof that Gilbert was the one who made the telephone bomb threat. The jury could well have found that her reaction to the investigation as shown by what she said and did was the motive for the bomb threat. And proof of motive is one of the purposes for admitting evidence that would be otherwise excludable under Rule 404(b). Thanks to the admirable instruction given the jury on this matter and the rulings made in conjunction with it by the district court, we need go no further. We hold that the other investigation evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next evidentiary issue is more troublesome. It involves the admissions of expert testimony that resulted in the positive voice identification of Gilbert as the person who made the telephone calls on September 30, 1996 (subsequent to the bomb threat calls    on September 26). Gilbert argues that the admission was erroneous for three reasons: (1) ambush, abuse of discretion, and deprivation of a fair trial; (2) the voice identifications were unduly suggestive, inherently unreliable, and constituted an abuse of discretion; (3) the trial court's refusal to give an adverse inference instruction constituted reversible abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedural history of the voice identification is important. We first note that there was no mention of a positive identification of Gilbert's voice in the government's opening. We start our recital of the facts underlying this issue by pointing out that what took place is based in part on the representations of the prosecutor which the court obviously accepted. We make no suggestion that the prosecutor misrepresented the facts or the court erred in accepting the prosecutor's representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial started on Wednesday, January 7, 1998. On the weekend prior to trial, the prosecutor was \"fooling around\" with exhibit 13 on a play back tape recorder. Exhibit 13 consisted of tape recordings of phone calls made on September 30. Perrault received three phone calls during the evening of September 30. The voice    on all three calls sounded the same to Perrault. On the same evening, there were unidentified phone calls made to various departments of the VAMC. The testimony of the recipients was that the voice sounded as being electronically altered or was a mechanical sounding voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the prosecutor \"fiddled\" with the tape recorder that held exhibit 13, he became aware that when the play back speed of the recorder was increased that Gilbert's natural voice was heard. This discovery was confirmed on January 6. On January 7, after the trial started, the government sought to have Gilbert's ex-husband Glenn Gilbert, identify defendant's voice by playing exhibit 13 on a voice transmitter with a variable speed adjustment. The court sustained Gilbert's objection, subject to a change of ruling if the government obtained an expert witness. The court was of the opinion that allowing the government to vary the speed of the play back to obtain Gilbert's natural voice would be unreliable and too haphazard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government promptly contacted an expert, Bruce Koenig, who was in the business of analyzing audio and video tapes. Preparatory to testifying, he speeded up the play back so that Gilbert's natural    voice was heard. This was recorded on another tape, exhibit 44. It must be borne in mind that part of the government's theory on the voice identification issue was that Gilbert had made the September 30 phone calls on the \"Talkboy\" recorder that she bought on September 30 at 6:25 p.m. at Toys-R-Us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koenig delivered the tape he created (exhibit 44) to the government on Sunday, January 11, which immediately provided the defense with a copy of it and a statement of Koenig's proposed testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Monday, July 12, the prosecutor proffered Koenig as a witness. Gilbert objected on the grounds already stated. She also pointed out that she would be severely prejudiced because of the short amount of time she had to prepare for his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court decided to admit the evidence but gave Gilbert several options among which was a short continuance. Gilbert declined the continuance but accepted the court's offer to allow her expert to testify out of order. Gilbert was also given an opportunity to voir dire Koenig, which she did for ninety minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 13, Gilbert called her expert, Christopher Ryan. Ryan was a full-time musician, master engineer, and record producer. His testimony    was that, after listening to the \"Talkboy\" tape, he was of the opinion that it was incapable of producing the conversation recorded on exhibit 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koenig, the government's witness, testified as to how he had tested the \"Talkboy\" for variances in speed and then created a speed corrected tape of exhibit 13 which became exhibit 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was testimony by two witnesses, a long time friend of Gilbert and Gilbert's ex-husband, that the voice on exhibit 44 was that of defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not doubt that Gilbert was surprised by the positive voice identification testimony. We do not think, however, that she was ambushed by it, if we define ambush as the government deliberately laying a trap for her to walk into. If the events leading to the discovery that speeding up of the September 30 tape recordings disclosed Gilbert's natural voice were as the prosecutor stated, there was no ambush, just a fortuitous discovery by the prosecutor the weekend prior to start of the trial. And even if we were skeptical about the prosecutor's assertion, we would be bound by the district court's decision to admit the evidence. \"A district court's denial of a motion to suppress will be upheld if any reasonable    view of the evidence supports the denial.\" United States v. Watson, 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1996). United States v. de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir. 1993). And the standard of review of discovery decisions is abuse of discretion. United States v. Samalot-Perez, 767 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that the district court's handling of this surprise evidence treated Gilbert fairly under the circumstances. She eschewed the offer of a short continuance and opted instead to put on her own expert out of order. The prosecutor had given her, as soon as it was available, a statement of the testimony of its expert that would be proffered at trial. And Gilbert was accorded an extensive voir dire of the government's expert before he testified before the jury. Significantly, Gilbert does not state how she was prejudiced by the late disclosure of the voice identification testimony or how it would have changed her defense strategy. United States v. Melucci, 888 F.2d 200, 203 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Gilbert had been furnished a copy of exhibit 13 over a year prior to trial. She certainly had an opportunity to have her expert perform as many tests on it as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert also argues on appeal that the court erred in not excluding Koenig's testimony on the grounds that it was scientific evidence and did not pass the reliability and validity tests of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 590-93, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993). The short answer to this argument is that there was no objection in the trial court on this basis. No suggestion was made by Gilbert that the Daubert principles should be applied to Koenig's testimony. Our rule is that an objection not made in the trial court will not be considered in the first instance on appeal. Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1999); Albion v. YMCA Camp Letts, 171 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert's second contention is that the voice identifications were unduly suggestive and their admission an abuse of discretion because the witnesses already knew Gilbert's voice but were not given comparisons of tape recordings of other voices. In addition, both witnesses had listened to exhibit 44 prior to testifying and identified the voice as that of Gilbert. For these reasons, Gilbert says that the trial judge should have excluded the    identifications in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there were certainly suggestive elements in this procedure, the Supreme Court has made clear that this does not violate due process if the identification remains sufficiently reliable, see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140, 97 S. Ct. 2243 (1977), cf. Government of Virgin Islands v. Sanes, 32 V.I. 462, 57 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 1995). Here, the witnesses were both familiar with Gilbert's voice and therefore had a solid basis for their opinion that the taped voice was Gilbert's, and the defense was free to bring out on cross-examination any aspects of suggestiveness, including the pretrial exposure of the witnesses to the tape. This was a judgment call by the district court under an abuse of discretion standard, and we do not think that the discretion was abused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict without the voice identification of the September 30 \"Talkboy\" telephone calls. We summarize the evidence, omitting the voice identification testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert purchased a \"Talkgirl Jr.\" about three and one half hours before the bomb threat calls to the VAMC on the evening of September 26, 1996. The \"Talkgirl    Jr.\" could make a woman's voice sound like that of a man. Gilbert left her apartment eleven minutes before the first bomb threat calls were received at the VAMC. She did not return home for about three hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the tape recordings of the ten phone calls made on the evening of September 26, 1996, the first of which was the bomb threat, Perrault believed that they all were made by Gilbert. She admitted to Perrault that she watched from across the street as the building which the caller said \"contained three explosive devices\" was evacuated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Personnel at the VAMC and Perrault received a number of unidentified phone calls over the next several days. The calls were made by someone who knew Perrault's work schedule, which Gilbert did. Some of the calls to Perrault were of a personal nature. Perrault believed that the voice on these calls was the same as the one that had made the bomb threat calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27th, Gilbert purchased a \"Talkboy Jr.\" which like the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" could make a woman's voice sound like that of a man. She told the clerk from whom she made the purchase that it was a gift for her nephews. Gilbert does not have any nephews. The VAMC received    an unidentified phone call about 15 minutes after the purchase. The caller's voice sounded the same as the other calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October first, it was decided to conduct a surveillance of a number of pay phone booths in the vicinity of Gilbert's apartment. Perrault agreed to call Gilbert from the security desk at VAMC, which he did at 5:00 p.m. At 6:37 p.m. the VAMC received an unidentified phone call in the same voice as the others. At the same time Gilbert was observed by a state trooper making a phone call from a pay phone booth near her apartment. A fingerprint from Gilbert's right index finger was lifted from the receiver at the phone booth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A warrant-authorized search was made of Gilbert's apartment during the evening of October 1. A \"Talkboy Jr.\" and other incriminating evidence was seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence was sufficient without the voice identification evidence for a conviction. Because, however, the admission of the voice identification was not error, we need not decide whether it would have been harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Gilbert was found guilty by a jury and was sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen months and three years of supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three issues for review: (1) Was there subject matter jurisdiction under the interstate commerce clause; (2) Did the district court commit reversible error in the exclusion and allowance of certain evidence; (3) Was the evidence sufficient under the reasonable    doubt standard to sustain the jury's finding of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* We state the facts as they could have been found by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert, a registered nurse, worked the 3:30 p.m. to midnight shift on Ward C, an acute medical ward at the VAMC. James Perrault was a VAMC police officer who worked the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift at the medical center. In the summer of 1995 Gilbert and Perrault became friendly. The friendship blossomed into a full-blown affair in September and October of 1995. At the time Gilbert was married. In November, 1995, Gilbert filed for divorce against her husband, Glenn Gilbert, and moved out of their home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 1996, an investigation was launched at the VAMC because of some suspicious occurrences at the hospital. The investigation became an official criminal investigation in a few months. Gilbert was one of the targets of the investigation. Many employees at the VAMC were interviewed and grand jury subpoenas were served on some employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert was photographed and handwriting samples were taken from her. Gilbert was upset by the investigation and made her feelings known. She told her former husband (the divorce had become final) that he had the    right not to speak to the investigators. After he had spoken to them anyway, she became angry and upset. She disparaged him to several people by belittling him and using epithets to denigrate him. Gilbert also expressed anger and resentment against those of her co-workers who cooperated with the investigation. She told a co-worker that \"maybe they ought to investigate\" Gilbert's nursing supervisor. Gilbert became upset and angry with some of her co-workers on the evening shift because they would not talk to a private investigator she had retained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert talked about the investigation with Perrault. She told him that three nurses who worked in Ward C were responsible for starting the investigation and she \"couldn't understand why they were trying to do this to me.\" Perrault suggested leaving the area, but Gilbert refused, saying she \"wanted everybody here to see what they had done to ruin her life.\" Perrault tried to end their relationship in June of 1996, but she begged him not to do so. In late July, 1996, Gilbert told a friend of hers that if Perrault \"dumped her, she probably would start stalking him.\" Perrault tried again in late August of 1996 to break his relationship with    Gilbert. She became upset and blamed the investigation for this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, 1996, Perrault told Gilbert of the day and time he had agreed to be interviewed in Springfield, Massachusetts, by investigators from the United States Attorney's Office. Gilbert became upset and begged Perrault not to attend the interview. On the day of the interview, Gilbert blocked Perrault's car with her car as he attempted to drive out of his driveway. She asked Perrault to talk to her and not to go to the interview. When Perrault made it clear that he would not do as she wished, she returned to her car and drove off. On arriving at Springfield, Perrault used a parking garage that he and Gilbert had used on prior occasions. When Perrault returned to his car after the interview he found that air had been let out of his right front tire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the next several days Perrault's car was stained by egg yolks from eggs that had been thrown at it, the windshield was spray-painted, scratches were made on the exterior by keys, and the front license plate was damaged. After the damage to the license plate, Perrault saw a car similar in appearance to Gilbert's enter the parking lot that Perrault used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert denied that she was responsible for the damage to Perrault's car, but admitted she had been in the parking lot prior to and after the bomb threat to the VAMC on September 26, 1996. Gilbert called a neighbor of hers on two occasions to ask if Perrault had been checking on her. When told that Perrault had inquired about her, the neighbor testified that Gilbert became very angry and said, \"Twit, fucking twit,\" in what the neighbor described as a deep controlled tone of voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting in mid-September Perrault received a number of phone calls at his residence. There was no voice communication, only heavy breathing or hang-ups. Perrault unsuccessfully tried to trace the calls. He contacted NYNEX which traced seven of the calls to Gilbert's telephone number. A pen register was installed on Gilbert's phone on September 26, after the bomb threat. The pen register showed that, between September 26 and October 1, 1996, about one half of Gilbert's phone calls to Perrault used a method (called the \" *67 function\") which prevented Perrault from tracing her calls from his own telephone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, the day of the bomb threat that was the basis of the indictment, Gilbert purchased a \"Talkgirl    Jr.\" with her VISA credit card at Toys-R-Us. She also bought several packages of Energizer batteries from a Thrifty Drug Store about an hour after the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" purchase. The batteries could be used to activate the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" The toy is a hand-held voice changer that records a statement which can be played back at a higher or lower speed than the original recording. Words recorded by a woman played back at a lower speed make them sound like a man's voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, the following message was received at 3:34 p.m. on the telephone answering machine of Glenn Gilbert, divorced husband of defendant-appellant: \"I just wanted to say goodbye for the last time.

Perrault described the telephone voice as \"staticky, almost like there was a mechanical ring to it.\" Perrault dismissed the call as a prank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 5:22 p.m. through 7:07 p.m. during the evening of September 26, Perrault received a series of unidentified phone calls at the security desk. He described the voice as being exactly the same as the one directed to Persian Gulf veterans.

An officer, other than Perrault, answered the 5:30 call. He described the voice as distorted, not a normal voice - \"like some kind of tape recorder.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the bomb threat, fifty acutely ill patients were moved by wheelchairs and stretchers from the building containing Ward C and Ward C Annex to another building several hundred yards away.

He described the voice as exactly like that of the caller on September 26. Gilbert's telephone toll records did not show any calls from her home at the time of the September 27th calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening again to the taped calls made on September 26, Perrault noticed that certain tones of the caller sounded very familiar. He described the caller as sounding hurt, upset, taunting, provocative, cold, and unfeeling. He also noticed that the calls seemed directed at him personally. He was of the opinion that the caller was Gilbert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 28 and 29 Perrault was off from work and was not on duty at the VAMC. No anonymous phone calls were received at the VAMC on either of those days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, Gilbert told her neighbor (O'Donnell) that she had gone to the Holyoke Mall and visited an Internet coffee shop. She said that she had logged onto the Internet and obtained a bomb recipe which she said was \"easy to find.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 6:25 p.m. on the 30th, Gilbert bought a \"Talkboy Jr.\" and the batteries to run it at Toys-R-Us with a personal check. Like the \"Talkgirl\" the \"Talkboy\" is a voice changer and operates in the same manner. The cashier who    sold the toy to Gilbert remembered that Gilbert wanted to be sure that the batteries worked with it and that Gilbert told her she wanted the toy for her nephews. Gilbert does not have any nephews.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 6:44 p.m. on September 30, Perrault received a phone call stating, \"Officer Perrault, I've been watching you, boy.\" Perrault described the voice as the same as the one who made the call on September 26, except that this time the caller appeared to be \"trying to put a southern drawl into it.\" Perrault received two more calls on September 30. The caller sounded the same as the one who had made the first call that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same evening, September 30, other departments at the VAMC, i.e., Admissions and the Nurses' Station on Ward C, also received unidentified phone calls. Those who received the calls described the voice as sounding electronically altered or as a mechanical-sounding voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After finishing his shift on September 30, Perrault went to the local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Club about midnight. Shortly after arriving he received a phone call at the bar. The caller stated: \"You think you have a problem? Just wait and see what I have planned for you.\" Perrault recognized    the voice as being the same as the one in the prior phone calls. Gilbert knew that Perrault usually stopped at that VFW on the way home from work. In fact, she had met him there on several prior occasions, without notice beforehand. On this same day, September 30, Perrault received a letter from Gilbert in which she said that as she drove by the VFW one evening she saw his car and stood outside and watched him through a window playing darts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 1, 1996, Perrault met with investigators and it was agreed that he would call Gilbert when he started his shift on the security desk at 5:00 p.m. Surveillance of a number of pay telephone booths in the vicinity of Gilbert's apartment was arranged for that evening. Perrault called Gilbert at 5:12 p.m. and left a message on her answering machine that he would be at the security desk until 7:00 p.m. Perrault received a series of anonymous phone calls at 5:25 p.m., 5:41 p.m., 5:44 p.m., and 6:37 p.m. The voice was the same as that of the prior anonymous calls. Another officer on duty received an anonymous call at 7:35 p.m. He described the voice as strange, male-sounding and distorted. The 5:41 p.m. and 5:44 p.m. calls were traced to telephone    pay stations at a Citgo gas station and the Daily Hampshire Gazette. Gilbert later admitted to Perrault that she had used those pay phones, but denied making any of the phone calls in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the 6:37 p.m. pay-booth phone call, Massachusetts State Trooper Kevin Murphy, who was on surveillance, saw Gilbert arrive in her car at the Tasty Top, an ice cream stand, and use the pay telephone booth outside of it. Trooper Murphy radioed to Special Agent Plante (a member of the surveillance team). Plante contacted Perrault at the VAMC security desk, who confirmed that he had just received a call in which there was traffic noise and heavy breathing noise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fingerprint from Gilbert's right index finger was lifted from the telephone receiver at the Tasty Top phone booth. Gilbert later told Perrault that she had made a phone call from the Tasty Top booth to check her answering machine and that she had seen a State Trooper at the Tasty Top.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of October 1, 1996, a search warrant was executed at Gilbert's apartment. Trooper Murphy seized from the trash three empty battery packages for Energizer batteries, two batteries stamped LI54 on the back, and a Thrifty Drug    Store receipt showing the purchase of the Energizer batteries. Detective Lieutenant Thomas Soutier also seized a \"Talkboy\" from a closet in a child's room which contained a tape cassette that was blank. Agent Plante seized operating instructions for the \"Talkboy\" from the left pocket of Gilbert's outdoor jacket, which Agent Plante found lying on her bed. Agent Plante also found a Daily Hampshire Gazette, dated September 27, 1996, on Gilbert's bed that contained an article about the bomb threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the police were executing the search warrant, Gilbert went over to her neighbor's (O'Donnell) apartment. Gilbert told O'Donnell that the police were looking for a voice-changing device, similar to a toy that her son owned, that \"could change your voice up high like a chipmunk or down low like a man.\" She also told O'Donnell that if the police found such a device in her house, it might be broken, the tape might be erased or blank, or the batteries might be dead. The investigators never told Gilbert that they were looking for a child's toy that could change a person's voice. The VAMC did not receive any more telephone calls from the anonymous caller after October 1st.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bruce Koenig, a government    expert, tested the \"Talkboy\" and determined that the variance in speed from low to high speed on the \"Talkboy\" was 31.1%. Koenig increased the playback speed for exhibit 13, the tape containing the September 30th phone calls, by 31.1%. The telephone calls on exhibit 13 were tape-recorded messages; the messages had been pre-recorded on the \"Talkboy\", and then played back at a slower speed. Mr. Koenig created a speed-corrected tape of exhibit 13, which became exhibit 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of Gilbert's friends, Ms. Abderhalden, who had known and worked with Gilbert for over five years and had talked to Gilbert daily in the fall of 1996, identified the voice on exhibit 44 as Gilbert's voice, as did Glenn Gilbert her former husband.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first turn to the interstate commerce-jurisdiction issue. Gilbert argues that because there was no evidence \"that the telephone system used was more than an intrastate system, or that the threat call was routed through an interstate system,\" there was no effect on or nexus to interstate commerce. Appellant's Br. at 19. This claim is one of the many that have surfaced in the wake of United States v.

The Act neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be connected in any way to interstate commerce.

The Court did not consider the \"affecting\" commerce question. It pointed out that the evidence showed conclusively that the gold mine itself was engaged in interstate commerce activities. These activities \"assuredly brought the gold mine within  1962(a)'s alternative criterion of 'any enterprise . . . engaged in . . . interstate or foreign commerce.'\" Id. at 672.

The investigation was prompted by unexpected deaths at the VA hospital. That there was an ongoing investigation was common knowledge at the VAMC and in the outside community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, the district court discussed with counsel how to handle the introduction of the fact that there was an investigation going on and that Gilbert was one of those being investigated. The court told counsel that he would not exclude entirely the fact that there was an investigation in process because the case \"flowed\" around the investigation. After a lengthy pre-trial conference on the instructions to be given to the jury, the following instruction was given at the outset of the trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here is my preliminary instruction to you. I want to instruct you now on part of the background of this case. Beginning around February 1996, seven months      before the bomb threat charged by the Government in this case, an independent investigation began about certain possible wrongdoing at the VA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That separate investigation had nothing to do with the charge in this case. The supposed wrongdoing involved something else entirely. For a time that separate investigation included within its scope, among other people and things, the defendant here Kristen Gilbert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm not going to tell you about the specifics of that other separate suspected wrongdoing because to do so would give that supposed misconduct more weight than it deserves. I have also instructed counsel not to refer to the specifics of that investigation. I do want to emphasize a couple points however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nearly two years after that separate investigation first began, there is still no sufficient evidence that any wrongful act was ever committed by anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, although at some point the investigation turned in part towards this defendant, Ms. Gilbert has never been charged with the wrongdoing that was the subject of that separate investigation. So as far as this trial is concerned, even assuming that the other wrongdoing ever actually occurred, she is not only entirely innocent of that separate misconduct, she has not ever been charged with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that there was an investigation, however, and that for some time it included the defendant, among other persons and things within its scope, is part of the background of this case. You may hear references to that investigation, and I am therefore permitting you to know of the fact of that separate investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Do not speculate about the subject matter of that separate investigation. It doesn't matter. Such speculation might distract you from your task in this trial, which is to determine whether the Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant phoned a bomb threat to the VA on September 26, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keep in mind as well that the fact that a person is investigated for some separate wrongdoing is not evidence of any kind that the person is guilty of the crime they have actually been charged with.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You should not, as a matter of law and as a matter of fundamental fairness, assume in any way that Ms. Gilbert is or might be guilty of phoning in a bomb threat simply because she happened to fall within the scope of a separate investigation involving something entirely different. The fact that she was included for a time in that separate investigation is simply not evidence against her in this case in any way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I have said, I am permitting the evidence of the existence of that separate investigation to come in this limited form simply to give you the background and context out of which the evidence in this case partly arises. Consider this evidence only in this light.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert took the position at trial that evidence of the other investigation should not have been admitted at all. She argues before us that its admission violated the provisions of Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), was an abuse of discretion, and deprived her of a fair trial. The government counters that the evidence was properly admissible under Fed. Rules of Evidence 401 and 403 and \"in the alternative\" under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to giving the jury instruction the court made the following rulings. It expressed doubt that the investigation evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">constitutes the sort of other-act evidence that falls within the scope of Rule 404(b). I think the fact is that the evidence of the other investigation is connected to this case in a way that really makes it part of the Government's proof of the actual act that has been charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This isn't a pure other-act type of situation where, for example, the Government would be trying to prove that the defendant engaged in some kind of misconduct two or three years ago and therefore is likely to be guilty or possibly guilty of the charge that she's facing here at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then acknowledged that it might be wrong about Rule 404(b)'s applicability and stated that it was \"going to make a finding under Rule 404(b) to cover the situation:\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I want to make it clear that in permitting evidence of the other investigation to come in, I do find that it has special relevance in this case both on the issues of motive and identity, and that special relevance is entirely separate from any improper purpose that the evidence might be offered for, meaning propensity evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe also that the probative value of the evidence outweighs any unfair prejudice that will be done to the defendant as a result of my letting this in, particularly in the context of the limiting instruction that I will give.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So I want to make sure that my specific findings are on the record to the extent that we are in the area of Rule 404(b). I also want to make it clear because this is close to 404(b) that I'm approaching it as if it were 404(b) evidence in assessing the probative weight versus the unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start our analysis with the three evidentiary rules implicated. Rule 401 defines relevant evidence. Rule 403 provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence on the grounds of prejudice, confusion or waste of time. The pertinent part of Rule 404(b) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review of a district court's admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a trial court's Rule 403 balancing test for an abuse of discretion, and only in \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances\" will we reverse a district court's \"on-the-spot judgment\" concerning the probative value and unfair effect of the proffered evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

As the district court pointed out, it could be described as part of the proof that Gilbert was the one who made the telephone bomb threat. The jury could well have found that her reaction to the investigation as shown by what she said and did was the motive for the bomb threat. And proof of motive is one of the purposes for admitting evidence that would be otherwise excludable under Rule 404(b). Thanks to the admirable instruction given the jury on this matter and the rulings made in conjunction with it by the district court, we need go no further. We hold that the other investigation evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next evidentiary issue is more troublesome. It involves the admissions of expert testimony that resulted in the positive voice identification of Gilbert as the person who made the telephone calls on September 30, 1996 (subsequent to the bomb threat calls    on September 26). Gilbert argues that the admission was erroneous for three reasons: (1) ambush, abuse of discretion, and deprivation of a fair trial; (2) the voice identifications were unduly suggestive, inherently unreliable, and constituted an abuse of discretion; (3) the trial court's refusal to give an adverse inference instruction constituted reversible abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedural history of the voice identification is important. We first note that there was no mention of a positive identification of Gilbert's voice in the government's opening. We start our recital of the facts underlying this issue by pointing out that what took place is based in part on the representations of the prosecutor which the court obviously accepted. We make no suggestion that the prosecutor misrepresented the facts or the court erred in accepting the prosecutor's representations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial started on Wednesday, January 7, 1998. On the weekend prior to trial, the prosecutor was \"fooling around\" with exhibit 13 on a play back tape recorder. Exhibit 13 consisted of tape recordings of phone calls made on September 30. Perrault received three phone calls during the evening of September 30. The voice    on all three calls sounded the same to Perrault. On the same evening, there were unidentified phone calls made to various departments of the VAMC. The testimony of the recipients was that the voice sounded as being electronically altered or was a mechanical sounding voice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the prosecutor \"fiddled\" with the tape recorder that held exhibit 13, he became aware that when the play back speed of the recorder was increased that Gilbert's natural voice was heard. This discovery was confirmed on January 6. On January 7, after the trial started, the government sought to have Gilbert's ex-husband Glenn Gilbert, identify defendant's voice by playing exhibit 13 on a voice transmitter with a variable speed adjustment. The court sustained Gilbert's objection, subject to a change of ruling if the government obtained an expert witness. The court was of the opinion that allowing the government to vary the speed of the play back to obtain Gilbert's natural voice would be unreliable and too haphazard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government promptly contacted an expert, Bruce Koenig, who was in the business of analyzing audio and video tapes. Preparatory to testifying, he speeded up the play back so that Gilbert's natural    voice was heard. This was recorded on another tape, exhibit 44. It must be borne in mind that part of the government's theory on the voice identification issue was that Gilbert had made the September 30 phone calls on the \"Talkboy\" recorder that she bought on September 30 at 6:25 p.m. at Toys-R-Us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koenig delivered the tape he created (exhibit 44) to the government on Sunday, January 11, which immediately provided the defense with a copy of it and a statement of Koenig's proposed testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Monday, July 12, the prosecutor proffered Koenig as a witness. Gilbert objected on the grounds already stated. She also pointed out that she would be severely prejudiced because of the short amount of time she had to prepare for his testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court decided to admit the evidence but gave Gilbert several options among which was a short continuance. Gilbert declined the continuance but accepted the court's offer to allow her expert to testify out of order. Gilbert was also given an opportunity to voir dire Koenig, which she did for ninety minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 13, Gilbert called her expert, Christopher Ryan. Ryan was a full-time musician, master engineer, and record producer. His testimony    was that, after listening to the \"Talkboy\" tape, he was of the opinion that it was incapable of producing the conversation recorded on exhibit 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koenig, the government's witness, testified as to how he had tested the \"Talkboy\" for variances in speed and then created a speed corrected tape of exhibit 13 which became exhibit 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was testimony by two witnesses, a long time friend of Gilbert and Gilbert's ex-husband, that the voice on exhibit 44 was that of defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not doubt that Gilbert was surprised by the positive voice identification testimony. We do not think, however, that she was ambushed by it, if we define ambush as the government deliberately laying a trap for her to walk into. If the events leading to the discovery that speeding up of the September 30 tape recordings disclosed Gilbert's natural voice were as the prosecutor stated, there was no ambush, just a fortuitous discovery by the prosecutor the weekend prior to start of the trial. And even if we were skeptical about the prosecutor's assertion, we would be bound by the district court's decision to admit the evidence. \"A district court's denial of a motion to suppress will be upheld if any reasonable    view of the evidence supports the denial.\" United States v. Watson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196550\"><a href=\"/opinion/196550/united-states-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).

She eschewed the offer of a short continuance and opted instead to put on her own expert out of order. The prosecutor had given her, as soon as it was available, a statement of the testimony of its expert that would be proffered at trial. And Gilbert was accorded an extensive voir dire of the government's expert before he testified before the jury. Significantly, Gilbert does not state how she was prejudiced by the late disclosure of the voice identification testimony or how it would have changed her defense strategy. United States v. Melucci, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531206\"><a href=\"/opinion/531206/united-states-v-louis-w-melucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 203 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Gilbert had been furnished a copy of exhibit 13 over a year prior to trial. She certainly had an opportunity to have her expert perform as many tests on it as necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilbert also argues on appeal that the court erred in not excluding Koenig's testimony on the grounds that it was scientific evidence and did not pass the reliability and validity tests of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 590-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2786</span></a></span> (1993). The short answer to this argument is that there was no objection in the trial court on this basis. No suggestion was made by Gilbert that the Daubert principles should be applied to Koenig's testimony. Our rule is that an objection not made in the trial court will not be considered in the first instance on appeal. Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762535\"><a href=\"/opinion/762535/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90450-steven-g-cooperman-v-individual-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir. 1999); Albion v.

In addition, both witnesses had listened to exhibit 44 prior to testifying and identified the voice as that of Gilbert. For these reasons, Gilbert says that the trial judge should have excluded the    identifications in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there were certainly suggestive elements in this procedure, the Supreme Court has made clear that this does not violate due process if the identification remains sufficiently reliable, see Manson v.

Here, the witnesses were both familiar with Gilbert's voice and therefore had a solid basis for their opinion that the taped voice was Gilbert's, and the defense was free to bring out on cross-examination any aspects of suggestiveness, including the pretrial exposure of the witnesses to the tape. This was a judgment call by the district court under an abuse of discretion standard, and we do not think that the discretion was abused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict without the voice identification of the September 30 \"Talkboy\" telephone calls.

The \"Talkgirl    Jr.\" could make a woman's voice sound like that of a man. Gilbert left her apartment eleven minutes before the first bomb threat calls were received at the VAMC. She did not return home for about three hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the tape recordings of the ten phone calls made on the evening of September 26, 1996, the first of which was the bomb threat, Perrault believed that they all were made by Gilbert. She admitted to Perrault that she watched from across the street as the building which the caller said \"contained three explosive devices\" was evacuated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Personnel at the VAMC and Perrault received a number of unidentified phone calls over the next several days. The calls were made by someone who knew Perrault's work schedule, which Gilbert did. Some of the calls to Perrault were of a personal nature. Perrault believed that the voice on these calls was the same as the one that had made the bomb threat calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 27th, Gilbert purchased a \"Talkboy Jr.\" which like the \"Talkgirl Jr.\" could make a woman's voice sound like that of a man. She told the clerk from whom she made the purchase that it was a gift for her nephews. Gilbert does not have any nephews. The VAMC received    an unidentified phone call about 15 minutes after the purchase.

Perrault agreed to call Gilbert from the security desk at VAMC, which he did at 5:00 p.m. At 6:37 p.m. the VAMC received an unidentified phone call in the same voice as the others. At the same time Gilbert was observed by a state trooper making a phone call from a pay phone booth near her apartment. A fingerprint from Gilbert's right index finger was lifted from the receiver at the phone booth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A warrant-authorized search was made of Gilbert's apartment during the evening of October 1.
