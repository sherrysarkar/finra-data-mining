The district\r\n\ncourt granted summary judgment for Polychrome.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              FACTS\r                                             \r\n\n     The two parties in the instant appeal are a manufacturer of\r\n\nlithographic supplies, Polychrome Corporation (\"Polychrome\"), and\r\n\na Puerto Rico dealer of these supplies, Graphics Supply, Inc.\r\n\n(\"Graphics\").  Graphics contends that an exclusive dealer  \r\n\nrelationship existed between the two entities, and that\r\n\nPolychrome took a series of actions that impaired the\r\n\nrelationship, thereby violating Puerto Rico's Law 75, \"the\r\n\nDealer's Act,\"  10 L.R.P.A. 278.  We review the pertinent facts\r\n\nin the light most favorable to Graphics.  See Grenier v. Cyanamid\r                                                                           \r\n\nPlastics, Inc., 70 F.3d 667, 671 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                        \r\n\n     Graphics has served as a dealer for Polychrome in the Puerto\r\n\nRico market since 1975.  On January 1, 1989, a new Dealer\r\n\nAgreement was executed between the two (the \"Dealer Agreement\"),\r\n\ndefining their arrangement as a standard dealer relationship. \r\n\nWhile Graphics initially protested signing this new Agreement,\r\n\ncontending that it wished to continue the exclusive relationship\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nit maintained existed between the two, Graphics eventually\r\n\ncapitulated, at least partially in response to a letter from\r\n\nPolychrome's vice president for legal affairs, Barbara Cane,\r\n\nindicating that the two companies had never had an exclusive\r\n\nrelationship and that Graphics' failure to sign the standard\r\n\ndealership agreement might result in a termination of the\r\n\nrelationship altogether.1  Graphics asserted that it was assured\r\n\nby individuals at Polychrome that an exclusive relationship would\r\n\ncontinue to exist, the new Agreement notwithstanding; Polychrome\r\n\ndisagrees with this assertion.  However, as of April 26, 1996,\r\n\nGraphics concedes that this is a non-exclusive agreement, and\r\n\ndoes not contend there were private assurances.   \r\n\n     The dealings between the two companies apparently\r\n\ndeteriorated over the following years, with Graphics contending\r\n\nthat Polychrome improperly approached clients directly, and that\r\n\nPolychrome failed to keep Graphics adequately supplied, leading\r\n\nto losses by Graphics.  Graphics eventually filed suit against\r\n\nPolychrome, alleging violation of the Puerto Rico Dealer's Act,\r\n\nbreach of contract, and tortious interference with the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    Graphics cites  as support  for its contention  that an\r\nexclusive relationship had previously  existed a 1980 letter from\r\nJames M. Graves, executive vice president of Polychrome, to Peter\r\nJavier, president of Graphics.  This letter (which confirmed  the\r\nsubstance of a  meeting between  Graves and Javier  in New  York)\r\nstated  that Polychrome  would  not  actively  pursue  additional\r\ndistributors in  Puerto Rico, and that  Polychrome could continue\r\nto sell its products to another Puerto Rico company.  It did not,\r\nhowever, state  that the  relationship between the  two would  be\r\nexclusive.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ncontractual relationship between Graphics and two of its\r\n\nemployees.\r\n\n     The district court initially granted Polychrome's Motion for\r\n\nSummary Judgment on four of the six counts brought by Graphics,2\r\n\nbut refused to grant summary judgment on the remaining two \r\n\ncounts, stating that there was a genuine issue of material fact\r\n\non Count IV, and that Count VI could not be dismissed where Count\r\n\nIV survived.3  However, the district court, on Polychrome's\r\n\nmotion for reconsideration, with little explanation for its\r\n\nactions, subsequently granted summary judgment on these counts as\r\n\nwell.  This appeal by Graphics followed.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n1.   Standard of Review.\r                                 \r\n\n     Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\n\nis de novo.   See Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    These four counts  were as follows:   Count I: tortious\r\ninterference   by   Polychrome    with   Graphics'    contractual\r\nrelationship  with  two  of  its employees;  Count  II:  tortious\r\ninterference by  Polychrome  with Graphics'  business  operations\r\nthrough a series  of actions; Count III:  violation of Law 75  by\r\nPolychrome by  selling its  products directly  to several  of its\r\ncustomers in Puerto Rico;  and Count V:  violation  by Polychrome\r\nof  Law  75 by  negotiating  with potential  distributors  in the\r\nDominican Republic.\r\n\n     3    Count  IV  alleged   that  Polychrome  breached   their\r\ncontract  by purposely  failing  to  supply ordered  merchandise;\r\nCount  VI alleged  that Polychrome  failed  to honor  debit notes\r\nsubmitted by Graphics to Polychrome.  \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n1996).  We may affirm on the grounds cited by the district court,\r\n\nor on any independently sufficient ground.  See Garside v. Osco\r                                                                         \r\n\nDrugs, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990). \r                     \r\n\n     Graphics appeals three issues:  first, the district court's\r\n\ndetermination that a non-exclusive relationship existed between\r\n\nPolychrome and Graphics;4 second, the grant of summary judgment\r\n\non Count IV; and finally, the grant of summary judgment on Count\r\n\nVI.  We address each in turn. \r\n\n2.   Nature of the Dealer Agreement.\r                                             \r\n\n     As noted above, Graphics contends that the district court\r\n\nerred in concluding that the parties did not have an exclusive\r\n\nrelationship.  Our starting point in reviewing this determination\r\n\nmust be the language of the Dealer Agreement between Graphics and\r\n\nPolychrome, as it is well established that the interpretation of\r\n\nsuch a contract under Puerto Rico law is limited to the terms of\r\n\nthe Agreement, barring ambiguities in those terms or apparent\r\n\ninconsistency with the contracting parties' intent.  See Borschow\r                                                                           \r\n\nHosp. &amp; Medical v. Cesar Castillo, 96 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1996); see also Vulcan Tools of Puerto Rico v. Makita USA, Inc.,\r                                                                         \r\n\n23 F.3d 564, 567 (1st Cir. 1994); Marina Ind. Inc. v. Brown\r                                                                     \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4    Graphics  casts this issue as an appeal on Counts III &amp;\r\nV;  Polychrome,  on  the  other  hand,  addresses  this issue  as\r\nrelating to Counts II and III.  The district court, for its part,\r\nprimarily addressed this issue in its discussion of Count III.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nBoveri Corp., 114 P.R. Offic. Trans. 64, 72 (1983).  Indeed\r                      \r\n\nArticle 1233 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code provides:\r\n\n     If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no\r\n     doubt as to the intentions of the contracting\r\n     parties, the literal sense of its stipulations\r\n     shall be observed.  If the words should appear\r\n     contrary to the evident intention of the\r\n     contracting parties, the intention shall prevail. \r\n     31 L.R.P.A.   3471 (1991).\r\n\nThe 1989 Dealer Agreement between Graphics and Polychrome states\r\n\nin section 1, \"Purpose of Agreement\": \r\n\n     The purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the\r\n     relationship of Polychrome and dealer and to\r\n     reduce to writing their entire Agreement. \r\n     Polychrome agrees to sell to dealer, on a\r                                                        \r\n     non-exclusive basis, such of the Polychrome\r                                  \r\n     Products of the Printing Division (Polychrome\r\n     Products) that from time to time Polychrome may\r\n     elect to make available to the Dealer (emphasis\r\n     added).\r\n\nThe language of the Agreement unambiguously states that the\r\n\nrelationship established is a non-exclusive one.  Furthermore,\r\n\nthe Agreement stipulates that it constitutes the full Agreement\r\n\nbetween the parties.  See Borschow, 96 F.3d at 16 (integration\r                                            \r\n\nclause nullifies any other oral or written understandings reached\r\n\nbetween the two parties).5  In addition to these terms, the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5    We  note that  the conduct  in  Borschow was  much more\r                                                            \r\negregious than that alleged here.  Here, there is a dispute as to\r\nwhether Polychrome ever made  representations to Graphics that an\r\nexclusive  relationship between  the two  was either  intended or\r\ncontemplated.    In Borschow,  the  manufacturer's representative\r                                      \r\nexplicitly assured the dealer  that an exclusive relationship was\r\nintended,  notwithstanding  the  non-exclusive  language  in  the\r\ncontract between  the  two, and  the representative  subsequently\r\nsent the dealer a document to  that effect.  See Borschow Hosp. &amp;\r                                                                           \r\nMedical v. Cesar  Castillo, 96  F.3d 10, 12-13  (1st Cir.  1996).\r                                    \r\nHowever,  even  in that  situation,  the  court  adhered  to  the\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nAgreement contains other terms indicating that a non-exclusive\r\n\nrelationship is contemplated.  For example, it explicitly\r\n\nreserves to Polychrome the right to sell directly to any class of\r\n\ncustomers and to appoint other dealers.\r\n\n     Graphics offers several theories as to why we should\r\n\ndisregard the Dealer Agreement's clear terms and find instead\r\n\nthat an exclusive relationship existed: the company alleges that\r\n\nan earlier, 1980 agreement established an exclusive arrangement;\r\n\nit claims that the new Agreement was signed under duress; and\r\n\nmost importantly, it alleges that the non-exclusive agreement was\r\n\neither altered or replaced by a new one reflected in a January 1,\r\n\n1992 letter from a Polychrome official to Graphics. \r\n\n     We note at the outset that much of the information upon\r\n\nwhich Graphics hangs its hat is patently inadmissible since the\r\n\nlanguage of the Agreement is clear.  See Borschow, 96 F.3d at\r                                                           \r\n\n15-16 (Puerto Rico Civil Code and parol evidence rule both\r\n\npreclude reference to extrinsic evidence where contract terms are\r\n\nclear).  It is therefore unnecessary to dwell on these\r\n\nallegations; however, we choose to dispose of them briefly.6\r\n\n     The January 1, 1992 letter, which Graphics suggests is\r\n\neither a novation or a substitution of an exclusive Agreement for\r\n\nthe non-exclusive one created by the Dealer Agreement, does not\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nlanguage of the contract and found that the relationship  between\r\nthe two was a non-exclusive one.  See id.\r                                                  \r\n\n     6    The  parties'  intent  is  not  an issue  here,  as  no\r\nevidence has  been presented suggesting that  Polychrome intended\r\nan exclusive  relationship other than  Graphics' obviously  self-\r\nserving statements to this effect.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nsupport Graphics' position.7  The letter nowhere says that it\r\n\nestablishes an exclusive relationship.  Graphics contends that,\r\n\nbecause the letter sets out the terms of compensation Graphics\r\n\nwas to receive for accounts pursued directly by Polychrome, it\r\n\nestablishes that an exclusive relationship already existed\r\n\nbetween the two.  In fact, the letter merely specifies\r\n\ncompensation rates for services to be rendered by Graphics to\r\n\naccounts pursued directly by Polychrome, in exact accordance with\r\n\nthe terms stipulated in the Dealer Agreement,  7.8\r\n\n     Under Law 75, where the conduct of the parties indicates an\r\n\nintent to continue operating according to the terms of an\r\n\nAgreement, this Agreement remains in continuing force between\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7    Paragraph six of the letter states as follows:\r\n\n     6.   Graphics Supply and Polychrome will prepare a\r\n     joint target account list* [sic] (film and plates)\r                                         \r\n     of accounts  $50,000 or larger  in annual  volume.\r\n     In  situations  where competitive  prices  are not\r\n     acceptable  to  Graphics  Supply, Polychrome  will\r\n     pursue  the business  on  a direct  basis.   Where\r\n     Polychrome direct business is obtained, Polychrome\r\n     will compensate Graphics  Supply based upon annual\r\n     account   volume.     This  compensation   is  for\r\n     equipment  maintenance   and  emergency  inventory\r\n     fulfillment services (emphasis in original).\r\n\n     8    Section 7 of the Dealer Agreement states as follows:\r\n\n     It is agreed that the execution of this Agreement shall\r\n     not limit  in anyway  [sic] Polychrome's right  to sell\r\n     any  Polychrome  Products  directly  to  any  class  of\r\n     customers,  in any  geographical  location.    However,\r\n     Polychrome, at its discretion, may  elect to compensate\r\n     Dealer for  services performed  by Dealer for  accounts\r\n     sold directly to Polychrome.\r\n\n     The  letter states:    \"This compensation  is for  equipment\r\nmaintenance and emergency inventory fulfillment services.\"\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthem, despite any expiration date contained in the Agreement.9 \r\n\nSee Gemco Latinoamerica, Inc. v. Seiko Time Corp., 623 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n\n912, 918 (D.P.R. 1985).  We discern nothing in the record\r\n\nindicating that the parties intended anything other than to\r\n\ncontinue the relationship as set out in the Dealer Agreement. \r\n\nGraphics contends that the 1992 letter reveals a new exclusive\r\n\nrelationship, formed because Polychrome wished Graphics to\r\n\ntransfer to it business that Graphics handled for a competitor;\r\n\nin return for doing so, Graphics alleges that Polychrome agreed\r\n\nto reappoint Graphics as its sole distributor within Puerto Rico. \r\n\nIn order for an Agreement to be novated, either the new agreement\r\n\nmust expressly declare that it replaces the old agreement, or the\r\n\nold and the new agreements must be incompatible in all points. \r\n\nSee id. at 919 (citing Article 1158 of the Civil Code of Puerto\r                \r\n\nRico, 31 L.R.P.A.   3242).  However, as noted above, the letter\r\n\nmirrors the terms of the continuing non-exclusive Dealer\r\n\nAgreement.  Additionally, it defies credulity to view the letter\r\n\nas a replacement for the five page extremely detailed non-\r\n\nexclusive Agreement of January 1, 1989, impliedly -- but without\r\n\nexplicitly saying so -- instituting an exclusive dealership. \r\n\nFurthermore, it is logically impossible for Graphics to be\r\n\n\"reappointed\" to a status which the prior Agreement did not\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9    We  note that  this  also counters  Graphics' assertion\r\nthat the non-exclusive Dealer Agreement had expired.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nconfer.  The letter is therefore neither a novation nor the\r\n\nsubstitution of an exclusive relationship for the existing one.10\r\n\n     The district court summarily dismissed the duress claim,\r\n\nstating that Graphics had failed to provide sufficient evidence\r\n\nto support it.  Our review of the record supports this\r\n\nconclusion, as the only evidence presented was Javier's statement\r\n\nto this effect in his Declaration.  As for the purported 1980\r\n\nAgreement (as reflected in the 1980 Graves letter, see supra note\r                                                                      \r\n\n1), even were this to be seen as an exclusive relationship, which\r\n\nwe doubt, it is clearly superseded by the 1989 non-exclusive\r\n\nDealer Agreement.\r\n\n3. Summary Judgment on Count IV.\r                                         \r\n\n     Count IV alleged that Polychrome breached the Dealer\r\n\nAgreement by purposefully failing to supply merchandise ordered\r\n\nby Graphics.  Law 75 specifically provides that \"when the\r\n\nprincipal or grantor unjustifiably refuses or fails to fill the\r\n\norder for merchandise sent to him by the dealer in reasonable\r\n\namounts and within a reasonable time,\" this shall be presumed to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10   We  also note that the novation theory may be waived as\r\nit  was   not  presented  below.     See  Teamsters,  Chauffeurs,\r                                                                           \r\nWarehousemen &amp; Helpers  Union, Local No. 59 v.

However, in its April 25,\r\n\n1996 Order, the court stated only that it found that Polychrome\r\n\nwas entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all counts\r\n\n(including Count IV) on the ground that Graphics had not provided\r\n\nany evidence suggesting the existence of any issues of material\r\n\nfact.  The court therefore issued an order on that same day\r\n\ndismissing the complaint, and later denied Graphics' motion for\r\n\nreconsideration. \r\n\n     We note again that in the summary judgment context, the\r\n\nparty seeking to avoid summary disposition must bring forth\r\n\nspecific, material facts showing a genuine issue for trial.  See\r                                                                          \r\n\nGarside, 895 F.2d at 48 (a fact is material if it could\r                 \r\n\npotentially affect the suit's outcome); see also Nat'l\r                                                                \r\n\nAmusements, Inc. v.

See  Vulcan\r                                                                           \r\nTools v. Makita USA, Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 569 (1st Cir. 1994). \r                                   \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ninferences helpful to the party resisting summary judgment could\r\n\nresolve the dispute in this party's favor).  \r\n\n     Graphics' complaint listed two items of support for its\r\n\nallegation of unfilled orders:  first, that Polychrome failed to\r\n\nsupply Graphics with lithographic film for more than nine months\r\n\n(para 36); and second, that Polychrome failed to supply Graphics\r\n\nwith all the merchandise it had ordered, including lithographic\r\n\nplates, and to supply Graphics on time with ordered merchandise. \r\n\nThese failures, Graphics maintains, establish that Polychrome\r\n\nintentionally impaired the relationship.  Graphics' president,\r\n\nPeter Javier, notes in his Declaration several occasions on which\r\n\norders were shipped via air freight rather than via the normal\r\n\nmethods; he maintains this expedited shipping was utilized by\r\n\nPolychrome because it was not filling orders in a timely manner. \r\n\n     Polychrome counters by referring to a 1994 sworn statement\r\n\n(the Colon declaration) indicating that the delays Graphics\r\n\nexperienced were due to a number of factors, none of which was\r\n\nmotivated by an intent to not fully supply Graphics.  These\r\n\nincluded problems arising from special pricing accorded to\r\n\nGraphics (which slowed the approval process), and lack of\r\n\ninventory available for shipment due to the shutdown and\r\n\nrenovation of one of Polychrome's plants.  Indeed, Polychrome\r\n\npoints to the air shipments as evidence of its attempt to keep\r\n\nGraphics as fully supplied as possible in the circumstances.  \r\n\n     Graphics makes no effort to refute the detailed explanations\r\n\nin the Colon declaration.  We are left with no evidence that the\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nalleged delays were unjustifiable.  Moreover, many of the\r\n\ndocuments submitted by the parties that bear on this issue and\r\n\nmight elucidate it are in Spanish, without English\r\n\ntranslations.12  Where the existing record is inconclusive, it is\r\n\nthe appellant who must bear the brunt of the insufficient record\r\n\non appeal.  See Donovan v. Ritchie, 68 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1995); see also Real v. Hogan, 828 F.2d 58, 60 (1st Cir. 1987). \r                                       \r\n\nWe are therefore compelled to affirm the district court's\r\n\ndismissal of this claim, as without further assistance, we are\r\n\nunable to discern support for Graphics' position in the record. \r\n\n4. Count VI:  Jurisdictional Minimum.\r                                              \r\n\n     Graphics' original Count VI was a claim for debit notes\r\n\nallegedly due in the amount of $9,500 (see Para 41 of Amended\r                                                    \r\n\nComplaint).  On appeal, Graphics maintains that the allegation\r\n\ncontained in Count VI was that Polychrome refused to honor debit\r\n\nnotes and intentionally and maliciously withheld sums of money\r\n\ndue to Graphics, specifically $5,522.46 in commissions for\r\n\nservices provided to accounts to which Polychrome had sold\r\n\ndirectly.13  However, there is no mention in the original Count\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12     Furthermore,  the  district  court  supplied  minimal\r\nreasoning for its volte face on this issue. \r\n\n     13   This amount is undisputed by the parties, although they\r\ndiffer  as to when payment  for this amount  was actually issued.\r\nGraphics  alleges that  the check  was issued  on March  3, 1995,\r\nwhereas Polychrome says  it was paid  on December 19, 1994.   The\r\nphotocopy of the check contained in the record bears the date \"03\r\n03 95.\"\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nVI of allegedly withheld commissions.  We have repeatedly noted\r\n\nthat, absent extraordinary circumstances, a legal theory not\r\n\nraised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the\r\n\nfirst time on appeal.  See Superline, 953 F.3d at 21.  However,\r                                              \r\n\nwhether this claim is seen as for $9,500 in debit notes or\r\n\n$5,522.46 in withheld commissions, the amount falls below the\r\n\njurisdictional minimum, and we therefore affirm its dismissal on\r\n\nthis ground.   \r\n\nAffirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                   -14-\r\r\n\n                                  -15-\r\r\n",

On January 1, 1989, a new Dealer\r\n\nAgreement was executed between the two (the \"Dealer Agreement\"),\r\n\ndefining their arrangement as a standard dealer relationship. \r\n\nWhile Graphics initially protested signing this new Agreement,\r\n\ncontending that it wished to continue the exclusive relationship\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nit maintained existed between the two, Graphics eventually\r\n\ncapitulated, at least partially in response to a letter from\r\n\nPolychrome's vice president for legal affairs, Barbara Cane,\r\n\nindicating that the two companies had never had an exclusive\r\n\nrelationship and that Graphics' failure to sign the standard\r\n\ndealership agreement might result in a termination of the\r\n\nrelationship altogether.1  Graphics asserted that it was assured\r\n\nby individuals at Polychrome that an exclusive relationship would\r\n\ncontinue to exist, the new Agreement notwithstanding; Polychrome\r\n\ndisagrees with this assertion.  However, as of April 26, 1996,\r\n\nGraphics concedes that this is a non-exclusive agreement, and\r\n\ndoes not contend there were private assurances.   \r\n\n     The dealings between the two companies apparently\r\n\ndeteriorated over the following years, with Graphics contending\r\n\nthat Polychrome improperly approached clients directly, and that\r\n\nPolychrome failed to keep Graphics adequately supplied, leading\r\n\nto losses by Graphics.  Graphics eventually filed suit against\r\n\nPolychrome, alleging violation of the Puerto Rico Dealer's Act,\r\n\nbreach of contract, and tortious interference with the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    Graphics cites  as support  for its contention  that an\r\nexclusive relationship had previously  existed a 1980 letter from\r\nJames M. Graves, executive vice president of Polychrome, to Peter\r\nJavier, president of Graphics.  This letter (which confirmed  the\r\nsubstance of a  meeting between  Graves and Javier  in New  York)\r\nstated  that Polychrome  would  not  actively  pursue  additional\r\ndistributors in  Puerto Rico, and that  Polychrome could continue\r\nto sell its products to another Puerto Rico company.  It did not,\r\nhowever, state  that the  relationship between the  two would  be\r\nexclusive.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ncontractual relationship between Graphics and two of its\r\n\nemployees.\r\n\n     The district court initially granted Polychrome's Motion for\r\n\nSummary Judgment on four of the six counts brought by Graphics,2\r\n\nbut refused to grant summary judgment on the remaining two \r\n\ncounts, stating that there was a genuine issue of material fact\r\n\non Count IV, and that Count VI could not be dismissed where Count\r\n\nIV survived.3  However, the district court, on Polychrome's\r\n\nmotion for reconsideration, with little explanation for its\r\n\nactions, subsequently granted summary judgment on these counts as\r\n\nwell.

Indeed\r                      \r\n\nArticle 1233 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code provides:\r\n\n     If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no\r\n     doubt as to the intentions of the contracting\r\n     parties, the literal sense of its stipulations\r\n     shall be observed.  If the words should appear\r\n     contrary to the evident intention of the\r\n     contracting parties, the intention shall prevail. \r\n     31 L.R.P.A.   3471 (1991).\r\n\nThe 1989 Dealer Agreement between Graphics and Polychrome states\r\n\nin section 1, \"Purpose of Agreement\": \r\n\n     The purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the\r\n     relationship of Polychrome and dealer and to\r\n     reduce to writing their entire Agreement. \r\n     Polychrome agrees to sell to dealer, on a\r                                                        \r\n     non-exclusive basis, such of the Polychrome\r                                  \r\n     Products of the Printing Division (Polychrome\r\n     Products) that from time to time Polychrome may\r\n     elect to make available to the Dealer (emphasis\r\n     added).\r\n\nThe language of the Agreement unambiguously states that the\r\n\nrelationship established is a non-exclusive one.  Furthermore,\r\n\nthe Agreement stipulates that it constitutes the full Agreement\r\n\nbetween the parties.  See Borschow, 96 F.3d at 16 (integration\r                                            \r\n\nclause nullifies any other oral or written understandings reached\r\n\nbetween the two parties).5  In addition to these terms, the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5    We  note that  the conduct  in  Borschow was  much more\r                                                            \r\negregious than that alleged here.  Here, there is a dispute as to\r\nwhether Polychrome ever made  representations to Graphics that an\r\nexclusive  relationship between  the two  was either  intended or\r\ncontemplated.    In Borschow,  the  manufacturer's representative\r                                      \r\nexplicitly assured the dealer  that an exclusive relationship was\r\nintended,  notwithstanding  the  non-exclusive  language  in  the\r\ncontract between  the  two, and  the representative  subsequently\r\nsent the dealer a document to  that effect.  See Borschow Hosp. &amp;\r                                                                           \r\nMedical v.

For example, it explicitly\r\n\nreserves to Polychrome the right to sell directly to any class of\r\n\ncustomers and to appoint other dealers.\r\n\n     Graphics offers several theories as to why we should\r\n\ndisregard the Dealer Agreement's clear terms and find instead\r\n\nthat an exclusive relationship existed: the company alleges that\r\n\nan earlier, 1980 agreement established an exclusive arrangement;\r\n\nit claims that the new Agreement was signed under duress; and\r\n\nmost importantly, it alleges that the non-exclusive agreement was\r\n\neither altered or replaced by a new one reflected in a January 1,\r\n\n1992 letter from a Polychrome official to Graphics. \r\n\n     We note at the outset that much of the information upon\r\n\nwhich Graphics hangs its hat is patently inadmissible since the\r\n\nlanguage of the Agreement is clear.  See Borschow, 96 F.3d at\r                                                           \r\n\n15-16 (Puerto Rico Civil Code and parol evidence rule both\r\n\npreclude reference to extrinsic evidence where contract terms are\r\n\nclear).  It is therefore unnecessary to dwell on these\r\n\nallegations; however, we choose to dispose of them briefly.6\r\n\n     The January 1, 1992 letter, which Graphics suggests is\r\n\neither a novation or a substitution of an exclusive Agreement for\r\n\nthe non-exclusive one created by the Dealer Agreement, does not\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nlanguage of the contract and found that the relationship  between\r\nthe two was a non-exclusive one.  See id.\r                                                  \r\n\n     6    The  parties'  intent  is  not  an issue  here,  as  no\r\nevidence has  been presented suggesting that  Polychrome intended\r\nan exclusive  relationship other than  Graphics' obviously  self-\r\nserving statements to this effect.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nsupport Graphics' position.7  The letter nowhere says that it\r\n\nestablishes an exclusive relationship.  Graphics contends that,\r\n\nbecause the letter sets out the terms of compensation Graphics\r\n\nwas to receive for accounts pursued directly by Polychrome, it\r\n\nestablishes that an exclusive relationship already existed\r\n\nbetween the two.  In fact, the letter merely specifies\r\n\ncompensation rates for services to be rendered by Graphics to\r\n\naccounts pursued directly by Polychrome, in exact accordance with\r\n\nthe terms stipulated in the Dealer Agreement,  7.8\r\n\n     Under Law 75, where the conduct of the parties indicates an\r\n\nintent to continue operating according to the terms of an\r\n\nAgreement, this Agreement remains in continuing force between\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7    Paragraph six of the letter states as follows:\r\n\n     6.   Graphics Supply and Polychrome will prepare a\r\n     joint target account list* [sic] (film and plates)\r                                         \r\n     of accounts  $50,000 or larger  in annual  volume.\r\n     In  situations  where competitive  prices  are not\r\n     acceptable  to  Graphics  Supply, Polychrome  will\r\n     pursue  the business  on  a direct  basis.   Where\r\n     Polychrome direct business is obtained, Polychrome\r\n     will compensate Graphics  Supply based upon annual\r\n     account   volume.     This  compensation   is  for\r\n     equipment  maintenance   and  emergency  inventory\r\n     fulfillment services (emphasis in original).\r\n\n     8    Section 7 of the Dealer Agreement states as follows:\r\n\n     It is agreed that the execution of this Agreement shall\r\n     not limit  in anyway  [sic] Polychrome's right  to sell\r\n     any  Polychrome  Products  directly  to  any  class  of\r\n     customers,  in any  geographical  location.    However,\r\n     Polychrome, at its discretion, may  elect to compensate\r\n     Dealer for  services performed  by Dealer for  accounts\r\n     sold directly to Polychrome.\r\n\n     The  letter states:    \"This compensation  is for  equipment\r\nmaintenance and emergency inventory fulfillment services.\"\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthem, despite any expiration date contained in the Agreement.9 \r\n\nSee Gemco Latinoamerica, Inc. v.

We discern nothing in the record\r\n\nindicating that the parties intended anything other than to\r\n\ncontinue the relationship as set out in the Dealer Agreement. \r\n\nGraphics contends that the 1992 letter reveals a new exclusive\r\n\nrelationship, formed because Polychrome wished Graphics to\r\n\ntransfer to it business that Graphics handled for a competitor;\r\n\nin return for doing so, Graphics alleges that Polychrome agreed\r\n\nto reappoint Graphics as its sole distributor within Puerto Rico. \r\n\nIn order for an Agreement to be novated, either the new agreement\r\n\nmust expressly declare that it replaces the old agreement, or the\r\n\nold and the new agreements must be incompatible in all points. \r\n\nSee id. at 919 (citing Article 1158 of the Civil Code of Puerto\r                \r\n\nRico, 31 L.R.P.A.   3242).  However, as noted above, the letter\r\n\nmirrors the terms of the continuing non-exclusive Dealer\r\n\nAgreement.  Additionally, it defies credulity to view the letter\r\n\nas a replacement for the five page extremely detailed non-\r\n\nexclusive Agreement of January 1, 1989, impliedly -- but without\r\n\nexplicitly saying so -- instituting an exclusive dealership. \r\n\nFurthermore, it is logically impossible for Graphics to be\r\n\n\"reappointed\" to a status which the prior Agreement did not\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9    We  note that  this  also counters  Graphics' assertion\r\nthat the non-exclusive Dealer Agreement had expired.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nconfer.  The letter is therefore neither a novation nor the\r\n\nsubstitution of an exclusive relationship for the existing one.10\r\n\n     The district court summarily dismissed the duress claim,\r\n\nstating that Graphics had failed to provide sufficient evidence\r\n\nto support it.  Our review of the record supports this\r\n\nconclusion, as the only evidence presented was Javier's statement\r\n\nto this effect in his Declaration.  As for the purported 1980\r\n\nAgreement (as reflected in the 1980 Graves letter, see supra note\r                                                                      \r\n\n1), even were this to be seen as an exclusive relationship, which\r\n\nwe doubt, it is clearly superseded by the 1989 non-exclusive\r\n\nDealer Agreement.\r\n\n3.

Law 75 specifically provides that \"when the\r\n\nprincipal or grantor unjustifiably refuses or fails to fill the\r\n\norder for merchandise sent to him by the dealer in reasonable\r\n\namounts and within a reasonable time,\" this shall be presumed to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10   We  also note that the novation theory may be waived as\r\nit  was   not  presented  below.

However, in its April 25,\r\n\n1996 Order, the court stated only that it found that Polychrome\r\n\nwas entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all counts\r\n\n(including Count IV) on the ground that Graphics had not provided\r\n\nany evidence suggesting the existence of any issues of material\r\n\nfact.  The court therefore issued an order on that same day\r\n\ndismissing the complaint, and later denied Graphics' motion for\r\n\nreconsideration. \r\n\n     We note again that in the summary judgment context, the\r\n\nparty seeking to avoid summary disposition must bring forth\r\n\nspecific, material facts showing a genuine issue for trial.

Graphics' president,\r\n\nPeter Javier, notes in his Declaration several occasions on which\r\n\norders were shipped via air freight rather than via the normal\r\n\nmethods; he maintains this expedited shipping was utilized by\r\n\nPolychrome because it was not filling orders in a timely manner. \r\n\n     Polychrome counters by referring to a 1994 sworn statement\r\n\n(the Colon declaration) indicating that the delays Graphics\r\n\nexperienced were due to a number of factors, none of which was\r\n\nmotivated by an intent to not fully supply Graphics.  These\r\n\nincluded problems arising from special pricing accorded to\r\n\nGraphics (which slowed the approval process), and lack of\r\n\ninventory available for shipment due to the shutdown and\r\n\nrenovation of one of Polychrome's plants.  Indeed, Polychrome\r\n\npoints to the air shipments as evidence of its attempt to keep\r\n\nGraphics as fully supplied as possible in the circumstances.  \r\n\n     Graphics makes no effort to refute the detailed explanations\r\n\nin the Colon declaration.  We are left with no evidence that the\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nalleged delays were unjustifiable.  Moreover, many of the\r\n\ndocuments submitted by the parties that bear on this issue and\r\n\nmight elucidate it are in Spanish, without English\r\n\ntranslations.12  Where the existing record is inconclusive, it is\r\n\nthe appellant who must bear the brunt of the insufficient record\r\n\non appeal.

Count VI:  Jurisdictional Minimum.\r                                              \r\n\n     Graphics' original Count VI was a claim for debit notes\r\n\nallegedly due in the amount of $9,500 (see Para 41 of Amended\r                                                    \r\n\nComplaint).  On appeal, Graphics maintains that the allegation\r\n\ncontained in Count VI was that Polychrome refused to honor debit\r\n\nnotes and intentionally and maliciously withheld sums of money\r\n\ndue to Graphics, specifically $5,522.46 in commissions for\r\n\nservices provided to accounts to which Polychrome had sold\r\n\ndirectly.13  However, there is no mention in the original Count\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12     Furthermore,  the  district  court  supplied  minimal\r\nreasoning for its volte face on this issue. \r\n\n     13   This amount is undisputed by the parties, although they\r\ndiffer  as to when payment  for this amount  was actually issued.\r\nGraphics  alleges that  the check  was issued  on March  3, 1995,\r\nwhereas Polychrome says  it was paid  on December 19, 1994.

However,\r                                              \r\n\nwhether this claim is seen as for $9,500 in debit notes or\r\n\n$5,522.46 in withheld commissions, the amount falls below the\r\n\njurisdictional minimum, and we therefore affirm its dismissal on\r\n\nthis ground.   \r\n\nAffirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                   -14-\r\r\n\n                                  -15-\r\r\n</pre>",
