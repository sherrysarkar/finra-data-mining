In August 1994  John Grelle\r                    CUMMINGS, Circuit  Judge.\r                                            \r\n\nand Robert Joost  were indicted for conspiracy  to commit robbery\r\n\nin violation  of the  Hobbs Act,  18 U.S.C.    1951.   The 12-day\r\n\ntrial  commenced in  March  1995.   The  jury returned  a  guilty\r\n\nverdict against  Joost, but was unable  to reach a verdict  as to\r\n\nGrelle.   In May 1995 a  new jury was impaneled  to retry Grelle.\r\n\nIn June,  he pled guilty to  the single count  indictment and was\r\n\nsentenced to 46 months in prison plus supervised release of three\r\n\nyears.  Grelle appeals  three offense characteristic enhancements\r\n\nimposed  by  the  district   court  pursuant  to  the  Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines.  We now affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          The following summary  of the facts  is drawn from  the\r\n\npresentence report,  the first  trial record, and  transcripts of\r\n\ntapes  of recorded conversations admitted at the trial.  In March\r\n\n1994,  Detectives Steven  O'Donnell  and Joseph  DelPrete of  the\r\n\nRhode Island State  Police conducted an undercover  investigation\r\n\nof  the manufacture of  counterfeit Foxwoods Casino, Connecticut,\r\n\nslot machine tokens by Joost.   The detectives met Joost on March\r\n\n23, 1994.   Approximately a  month later, after  several meetings\r\n\nwith Joost  and various  deliveries of counterfeit  tokens, Joost\r\n\nasked  the detectives if they would commit an armored car robbery\r\n\nwith  him.  The  detectives learned that  the plan was  to rob an\r\n\narmored car belonging to Meehan Armored, Inc.  Among other items,\r\n\nthe  car carried a  gold cargo that it  picked up late afternoons\r\n\nfrom  Leach and  Garner,  an Attleboro,  Massachusetts,  precious\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nmetals  manufacturer.   The armored  car and  the gold  were then\r\n\nstored overnight at the  Meehan headquarters in Woonsocket, Rhode\r\n\nIsland.  At 3:00 a.m. two  Meehan guards would load the gold into\r\n\nthe armored  car at Woonsocket  and drive the  cargo to New  York\r\n\nCity.    Joost planned  to rob  the armored  car  as it  left the\r\n\nWoonsocket  building  while the  guards  were  busy securing  the\r\n\npremises. At the meeting, Joost  detailed how he, the detectives,\r\n\nand  a fourth person would conduct the robbery; he indicated that\r\n\nhe needed four guys for the operation and that he already had one\r\n\n\"guy.\"\r\n\n          The  same three  met again  several times  in May  1994\r\n\nduring which Joost told the detectives further details  about the\r\n\nproposed  robbery.   On May  28 he  introduced them  to defendant\r\n\nGrelle.  The four traveled  to Pennsylvania to rob a trailer  and\r\n\nwarehouse, but a prearranged stop by the police brought an end to\r\n\nthe  plan.   During  the  trip,  however,  Grelle  told  the  two\r\n\ndetectives  that he was going  to participate in  the armored car\r\n\nrobbery along  with them and Joost.   Grelle also  stated that he\r\n\nwas the manufacturer of the counterfeit Foxwoods Casino tokens.  \r\n\n          On  June 16,  Joost  told the  detectives  that he  had\r\n\nlooked  at the Meehan building  around midnight but  left when he\r\n\nsaw a  police officer driving up  the access road.   He said that\r\n\nfive people would  be the right number to  commit the robbery and\r\n\ngave  them other details.  On June  27, Joost told the detectives\r\n\nthat  he and they  would arrive at  the Meehan  building the next\r\n\nmidnight in order to survey the premises.  Joost said that Grelle\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nwould drop them off and pick them up at 4:30 in the morning.  The\r\n\ntrip was then postponed to the following evening.  The detectives\r\n\nmet  Joost on  the evening of  June 29  and he  said that  he had\r\n\nexplained the robbery plans  to Grelle.  At 11:00  p.m. the three\r\n\nmen  met Grelle in Smithfield,  Rhode Island.   One detective and\r\n\nJoost  drove with  Grelle in  his car  while the  other detective\r\n\nfollowed  in his  own car.   During  the drive,  Joost complained\r\n\nabout Grelle's choice of a car,  and Grelle promised a better car\r\n\nfor the robbery itself.\r\n\n          The two cars met up at a housing complex in Cumberland.\r\n\nWhen  Detective  DelPrete asked  Grelle  how  he knew  about  the\r\n\ncomplex, Grelle responded, \"When  you plan, you plan well.\"   All\r\n\nfour then proceeded to Woonsocket in Grelle's car.  Joost and the\r\n\ntwo detectives left Grelle in order to survey the Meehan building\r\n\nwhile Grelle  agreed to pick them  up later.  The  details of the\r\n\nplanned  robbery  were  then  explained  by   Joost  to  the  two\r\n\ndetectives.  Joost explained how one guard would be handcuffed in\r\n\nthe  truck and his mouth  taped, and how they  would put a gun to\r\n\nthe guard's  head and shoot if  necessary.  Since the  guards had\r\n\nnot appeared as expected  at 4:00 a.m., Joost and  the detectives\r\n\nreturned to the pickup point where  Grelle met them.  Joost  told\r\n\nGrelle that they had missed the armored car.\r\n\n          On  July  21, Joost  again  described  the armored  car\r\n\nrobbery  plan to the detectives and again mentioned putting a gun\r\n\nto the head of one of the Meehan guards.   On August 5, Joost and\r\n\nGrelle  were arrested by  federal agents and  Rhode Island police\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndetectives and  Grelle's office  was searched by  federal agents,\r\n\nwho  seized a mold for  counterfeiting U.S. quarters.   They also\r\n\nseized from  his car molds  for counterfeit one-  and five-dollar\r\n\nFoxwoods  Casino tokens and  two counterfeit  one-dollar Foxwoods\r\n\nCasino tokens.    From Grelle's  home  in North  Scituate,  Rhode\r\n\nIsland,  the agents  seized  15 counterfeit  U.S. quarters,  some\r\n\nmarijuana plants, a bag of marijuana, and still other counterfeit\r\n\ncasino tokens.\r\n\n          At the  joint trial, the  director of security  for two\r\n\nmanufacturing   companies   testified   that    those   companies\r\n\nmanufactured  items   in  gold  and  silver   in  the  Attleboro,\r\n\nMassachusetts, area  and shipped the finished  products five days\r\n\nweekly  to New York City via the Meehan Woonsocket company, which\r\n\ndelivered  the products  to various  customers in  New York.   He\r\n\nindicated that  the dollar value  of the average  daily shipments\r\n\nfrom  April 1994 to August 1994 ranged from $455,887 to $848,998.\r\n\nA Meehan  official testified that other  precious metal shipments\r\n\naccompanying that cargo averaged about $5,000,000 daily.\r\n\n          Subsequently  Grelle prepared a statement for inclusion\r\n\nin  the  presentence  report  in support  of  an  adjustment  for\r\n\nacceptance  of responsibility.    He admitted  that  he had  been\r\n\ninvolved in  the robbery and counterfeit  tokens conspiracies and\r\n\nadded \"I knowingly involved myself, and in doing that I committed\r\n\na crime.\"   In return  for Grelle's guilty  plea, the  government\r\n\nagreed to recommend the lowest term  in the applicable Guidelines\r\n\nrange  and that it run  concurrently to any  other sentence.  The\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ngovernment  agreed  that  Grelle   did  not  participate  in  the\r\n\nconversations between Joost  and the detectives in  which (1) the\r\n\namount  of  gold,  (2) the  use  of  firearms,  (3) the  possible\r\n\nshooting or killing of the Meehan guards, or (4) the restraint of\r\n\nthose   guards  were   discussed.     However,   the   government\r\n\nspecifically reserved  its right to argue that these details were\r\n\nreasonably foreseeable to Grelle.\r\n\n          In  the   plea  agreement  the  government   agreed  to\r\n\nrecommend that Grelle receive a two-level decrease for acceptance\r\n\nof responsibility  provided that (1) he admit  his involvement in\r\n\nthe  criminal conduct,  (2) he  otherwise complied  with all  the\r\n\nrequirements of U.S.S.G.    3E1.1, and (3) he  did not receive an\r\n\nenhancement for obstruction  pursuant to U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.   The\r\n\ngovernment also agreed to recommend that he receive a three-level\r\n\ndecrease  under U.S.S.G.    2X1.1(b)(2)  because the  substantive\r\n\ncrime was  not close to  commission and  that he receive  a four-\r\n\nlevel decrease for a minimal role under U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(a).\r\n\n          The district court determined the base offense level to\r\n\nbe 20.   It then imposed a 6-level increase for intended use of a\r\n\nfirearm, a 2-level  increase for intended restraint  of a victim,\r\n\nand  a 3-level increase for an intended loss between $250,000 and\r\n\n$800,000.   The court then  subtracted 3 levels for insubstantial\r\n\ncompletion of the substantive defense, 4 levels for minimal role,\r\n\nand 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility.  The total offense\r\n\nlevel  was  22  with  a sentencing  range  of  41  to  51 months'\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nimprisonment.    The court  imposed a  sentence  of 46  months in\r\n\nprison and 3 years of supervised release.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Grelle claims that the three sentence enhancements were\r\n\nerroneous  on the ground that the evidence was inadequate to show\r\n\nthat he  had knowledge of  the intended conduct or  the amount of\r\n\nthe intended loss.  However, we  conclude that the circumstantial\r\n\nevidence  is  more than  adequate to  establish  that the  use of\r\n\nfirearms, the  restraint of armored  car guards and  the intended\r\n\nloss  of a  gold cargo  were not  only reasonably  foreseeable to\r\n\ndefendant  but that he knew  the plan involved  those factors and\r\n\nthat his agreement to participate covered such conduct.\r\n\n          As  noted, defendant  pled  guilty to  a conspiracy  to\r\n\ncommit  robbery.    The  guideline  applicable  to  conspiracies,\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2X1.1, tells the  trial court to use the  base offense\r\n\nlevel for  the substantive offense plus  appropriate adjustments.\r\n\nHere  the  substantive  offense  was  robbery,  and  the  robbery\r\n\nguideline  sets  the base  offense level  at  20 and  includes as\r\n\nspecific offense characteristics the use of a firearm, U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n2B3.1(b)(2)(B);  physical  restraint of  a  person to  facilitate\r\n\ncommission of  the offense or escape,  U.S.S.G.   2B3.1(b)(4)(B);\r\n\nand the amount of  loss, U.S.S.G.   2B3.1(b)(6).   In determining\r\n\nthe applicability of these  specific offense characteristics, the\r\n\nGuidelines direct  the court to consider not only the defendant's\r\n\nactual conduct and the  conduct he agreed to undertake,  but also\r\n\n\"all  reasonably  foreseeable acts  and  omissions  of others  in\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nfurtherance  of the  jointly undertaken criminal  activity .  . .\r\n\nthat occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,\r\n\nin preparation for that  offense, or in the course  of attempting\r\n\nto avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\"  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n   1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  The  Commentary explains that  a defendant is\r\n\naccountable  for the  conduct  of others  in  furtherance of  the\r\n\njointly undertaken criminal  activity and reasonably  foreseeable\r\n\nin connection with that criminal activity.  See U.S.S.G.   1B1.3,\r                                                         \r\n\ncomment.\r\n\n          The  Commentary  states   that  the  relevant   conduct\r\n\ndetermination for a particular defendant  depends on the scope of\r\n\nthe  activity he agreed to  undertake jointly.   To determine the\r\n\nscope of  a defendant's  agreement, \"the  court may consider  any\r\n\nexplicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the\r\n\nconduct  of the  defendant  and others.\"    Id.   The  Commentary\r                                                         \r\n\nadmonishes that \"the criminal  activity that the defendant agreed\r\n\nto jointly  undertake, and the reasonably  foreseeable conduct of\r\n\nothers  in  furtherance  of   that  criminal  activity,  are  not\r\n\nnecessarily identical.\"  Id.   For example, the note  describes a\r                                      \r\n\ndefendant  who  agrees  with  another to  commit  a  robbery  and\r\n\nexplains that  even though the  defendant did not  contemplate an\r\n\nassault,  he would be accountable  for an accomplice's assault of\r\n\nthe victim in the  course of the robbery \"because  the assaultive\r\n\nconduct  was in  furtherance of  the jointly  undertaken criminal\r\n\nactivity   (the  robbery)  and   was  reasonably  foreseeable  in\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nconnection with  that criminal activity (given the  nature of the\r\n\noffense).\"  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          The Guidelines thus contemplate that  a defendant would\r\n\nbe  accountable  for sentencing  purposes  for  his own  intended\r\n\nconduct within the scope of the conspiracy,  but also accountable\r\n\nfor  the  intended  scope  of  his  co-conspirator  that  was  in\r\n\nfurtherance of  the conspiracy and was  reasonably foreseeable to\r\n\nthe defendant.  The  reasonable certainty requirement of U.S.S.G.\r\n\n    2X1.1(a)   contemplates    that   in   considering   specific\r\n\nenhancements,  the  sentencing  court  will consider  \"what  with\r\n\nreasonable certainty  can be  determined to be  the conspirator's\r\n\nintent.\"  United States  v. Madeiros, 897  F.2d 13, 19 (1st  Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1990).    Finally,  the  conspiracy guideline  considers  that  a\r\n\ndefendant may be held accountable for acts that have not yet been\r\n\nperformed.  See  United States  v. Chapdelaine, 989  F.2d 28,  35\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 114 S. Ct. 696 (1994).\r                                       \r\n\n          We   now  proceed   to  Grelle's   specific  objections\r\n\nregarding the  three enhancements imposed by  the district court.\r\n\nA court's  factual determinations  supporting a sentence  must be\r\n\nproved  by the government by a preponderance of the evidence, and\r\n\nthis  Court reviews such findings  only for clear  error.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 499 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                           \r\n\n                                A.\r\n\n          The conspiracy and robbery  guidelines provide for a 6-\r\n\nlevel  enhancement  for  intended use  of  a  firearm.   U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2B3.1(b)(2)(B).   District Judge  Lisi presided over  the first\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ntrial and was therefore familiar with the details of the case, so\r\n\nthat  her rulings  are entitled  to great  deference.   18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  3742(e).    She  found  here  that  the  use  of  firearms  was\r\n\nforeseeable to this defendant because Grelle acknowledged that he\r\n\nhad knowingly  become involved  in an \"armed  robbery conspiracy\"\r\n\nand admitted  that Joost, his co-defendant in the original trial,\r\n\ntold him  about the robbery and  had taken Grelle  to the robbery\r\n\nsite on  the previous day.   Indeed,  as early as  May 28,  1994,\r\n\ndefendant had become a  co-conspirator by planning to participate\r\n\nin the armored car robbery with Joost and the detectives.\r\n\n          Grelle was present during many of Joost's conversations\r\n\nwith the detectives,  though it  is not established  that he  was\r\n\npresent  when  Joost  specifically  mentioned  firearms.    Joost\r\n\nnevertheless  mentioned  to the  detectives  that  guns would  be\r\n\nneeded to subdue the guards and that it might be necessary to put\r\n\nguns to their  heads and shoot  them.  Under  the plans known  to\r\n\nGrelle,  he would certainly  realize that the  armored car guards\r\n\nwould be  carrying firearms and would have to be subdued in order\r\n\nto steal the  gold, thus requiring firearm use.   Joost's plan to\r\n\nuse firearms was reasonably foreseeable  to Grelle and was proved\r\n\nby  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  so  that   the  6-level\r\n\nenhancement was properly assessed.\r\n\n                                B.\r\n\n          Under the robbery  guideline, a 2-level enhancement  is\r\n\nto  be  imposed  if  \"any  person was  physically  restrained  to\r\n\nfacilitate commission  of the  offense or to  facilitate escape.\"\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2B3.1(b)(4)(B).    Under  the  conspiracy  guideline,\r\n\ndefendant was subject to such  enhancement since the record shows\r\n\nthat he knew or could reasonably foresee that  one of the robbers\r\n\nintended  to restrain  another person  in the  commission  of the\r\n\nrobbery  or the escape afterwards.  Here the district court found\r\n\nthat Grelle's participation  in the conspiracy  contemplated that\r\n\nthe robbery would take  place at the Meehan facility  when guards\r\n\nwould be present.  As a result, the court properly concluded that\r\n\nit  was reasonably certain that  Grelle knew that  a person would\r\n\nhave  to  be restrained  in  order to  successfully  conclude the\r\n\nrobbery.   In addition, Joost  had discussed detailed  plans with\r\n\nthe  detectives involving the restraint of a Meehan guard.  Based\r\n\non  Joost's willingness to discuss the plan's details with two of\r\n\nthe  participants,  the  district  court  found  that  he  likely\r\n\ndiscussed  the same  plans  with Grelle.    The district  court's\r\n\nfinding that Grelle knew  or could reasonably have  foreseen that\r\n\nthe  plan involved  the restraint  of others  was supported  by a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n                                C.\r\n\n          Finally,   the   3-level  enhancement   under  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2B3.1(b)(6)(D) was for an intended loss of between $250,000 and\r\n\n$800,000.    Grelle was  not  held  accountable  for  the  entire\r\n\n$5,000,000 value of the cargo -- the value testified to at  trial\r\n\n-- because the district  judge found that he  was not aware  that\r\n\nthe armored car  contained precious  cargo other  than the  gold.\r\n\nRather, the district  court based its determination on  the trial\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ntestimony which showed that from April through August 1994, about\r\n\na month before the intended  robbery, the armored vehicle carried\r\n\nbetween $455,887 and $848,998 worth of gold on each run.\r\n\n          Grelle attacks the determination  on the basis that the\r\n\nfigures  were  not  certain.    However,  the Commentary  to  the\r\n\nguideline  states that  the  \"loss need  not  be determined  with\r\n\nprecision.  The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the\r\n\nloss,  given  the  available  information.\"   U.S.S.G.     2B1.1,\r\n\ncomment.  It is clear that Grelle intended to participate  in the\r\n\narmored car robbery  and that both Grelle and Joost knew or could\r\n\nreasonably foresee that  the vehicle contained a  large amount of\r\n\nmoney.  At  one point, Joost told the  detectives that he thought\r\n\nthe car could contain  as much as several million dollars.  Based\r\n\non  this  information, the  district  court  acted reasonably  in\r\n\nimposing  a 3-level increase for the intended loss.  The decision\r\n\nwas not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons,  the sentence imposed by the\r\n\ndistrict court is AFFIRMED.\r                                    \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n",

The 12-day trial commenced in March 1995.   The jury returned a guilty verdict against Joost, but was unable to reach a verdict as to Grelle.   In May 1995 a new jury was impaneled to retry Grelle.   In June, he pled guilty to the single count indictment and was sentenced to 46 months in prison plus supervised release of three years.   Grelle appeals three offense characteristic enhancements imposed by the district court pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines.   We now affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following summary of the facts is drawn from the presentence report, the first trial record, and transcripts of tapes of recorded conversations admitted at the trial.   In March 1994, Detectives Steven O'Donnell and Joseph DelPrete of the Rhode Island State Police conducted an undercover investigation of the manufacture of counterfeit Foxwoods Casino, Connecticut, slot machine tokens by Joost.   The detectives met Joost on March 23, 1994.   Approximately a month later, after several meetings with Joost and various deliveries of counterfeit tokens, Joost asked the detectives if they would commit an armored car robbery with him.   The detectives learned that the plan was to rob an armored car belonging to Meehan Armored, Inc. Among other items, the car carried a gold cargo that it picked up late afternoons from Leach and Garner, an Attleboro, Massachusetts, precious metals manufacturer.   The armored car and the gold were then stored overnight at the Meehan headquarters in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.   At 3:00 a.m.   two Meehan guards would load the gold into the armored car at Woonsocket and drive the cargo to New York City.  Joost planned to rob the armored car as it left the Woonsocket building while the guards were busy securing the premises.   At the meeting, Joost detailed how he, the detectives, and a fourth person would conduct the robbery;  he indicated that he needed four guys for the operation and that he already had one \"guy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same three met again several times in May 1994 during which Joost told the detectives further details about the proposed robbery.   On May 28 he introduced them to defendant Grelle.   The four traveled to Pennsylvania to rob a trailer and warehouse, but a prearranged stop by the police brought an end to the plan.   During the trip, however, Grelle told the two detectives that he was going to participate in the armored car robbery along with them and Joost.   Grelle also stated that he was the manufacturer of the counterfeit Foxwoods Casino tokens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, Joost told the detectives that he had looked at the Meehan building around midnight but left when he saw a police officer driving up the access road.   He said that five people would be the right number to commit the robbery and gave them other details.   On June 27, Joost told the detectives that he and they would arrive at the Meehan building the next midnight in order to survey the premises.   Joost said that Grelle would drop them off and pick them up at 4:30 in the morning.   The trip was then postponed to the following evening.   The detectives met Joost on the evening of June 29 and he said that he had explained the robbery plans to Grelle.   At 11:00 p.m.   the three men met Grelle in Smithfield, Rhode Island.   One detective and Joost drove with Grelle in his car while the other detective followed in his own car.   During the drive, Joost complained about Grelle's choice of a car, and Grelle promised a better car for the robbery itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two cars met up at a housing complex in Cumberland.   When Detective DelPrete asked Grelle how he knew about the complex, Grelle responded, \"When you plan, you plan well.\"   All four then proceeded to Woonsocket in Grelle's car.   Joost and the two detectives left Grelle in order to survey the Meehan building while Grelle agreed to pick them up later.   The details of the planned robbery were then explained by Joost to the two detectives.   Joost explained how one guard would be handcuffed in the truck and his mouth taped, and how they would put a gun to the guard's head and shoot if necessary.   Since the guards had not appeared as expected at 4:00 a.m., Joost and the detectives returned to the pickup point where Grelle met them.   Joost told Grelle that they had missed the armored car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, Joost again described the armored car robbery plan to the detectives and again mentioned putting a gun to the head of one of the Meehan guards.   On August 5, Joost and Grelle were arrested by federal agents and Rhode Island police detectives and Grelle's office was searched by federal agents, who seized a mold for counterfeiting U.S. quarters.   They also seized from his car molds for counterfeit one- and five-dollar Foxwoods Casino tokens and two counterfeit one-dollar Foxwoods Casino tokens.   From Grelle's home in North Scituate, Rhode Island, the agents seized 15 counterfeit U.S. quarters, some marijuana plants, a bag of marijuana, and still other counterfeit casino tokens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the joint trial, the director of security for two manufacturing companies testified that those companies manufactured items in gold and silver in the Attleboro, Massachusetts, area and shipped the finished products five days weekly to New York City via the Meehan Woonsocket company, which delivered the products to various customers in New York.  He indicated that the dollar value of the average daily shipments from April 1994 to August 1994 ranged from $455,887 to $848,998.   A Meehan official testified that other precious metal shipments accompanying that cargo averaged about $5,000,000 daily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently Grelle prepared a statement for inclusion in the presentence report in support of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.   He admitted that he had been involved in the robbery and counterfeit tokens conspiracies and added \"I knowingly involved myself, and in doing that I committed a crime.\"   In return for Grelle's guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend the lowest term in the applicable Guidelines range and that it run concurrently to any other sentence.   The government agreed that Grelle did not participate in the conversations between Joost and the detectives in which (1) the amount of gold, (2) the use of firearms, (3) the possible shooting or killing of the Meehan guards, or (4) the restraint of those guards were discussed.   However, the government specifically reserved its right to argue that these details were reasonably foreseeable to Grelle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plea agreement the government agreed to recommend that Grelle receive a two-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility provided that (1) he admit his involvement in the criminal conduct, (2) he otherwise complied with all the requirements of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, and (3) he did not receive an enhancement for obstruction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  The government also agreed to recommend that he receive a three-level decrease under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(b)(2) because the substantive crime was not close to commission and that he receive a four-level decrease for a minimal role under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined the base offense level to be 20.   It then imposed a 6-level increase for intended use of a firearm, a 2-level increase for intended restraint of a victim, and a 3-level increase for an intended loss between $250,000 and $800,000.   The court then subtracted 3 levels for insubstantial completion of the substantive defense, 4 levels for minimal role, and 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility.   The total offense level was 22 with a sentencing range of 41 to 51 months' imprisonment.   The court imposed a sentence of 46 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grelle claims that the three sentence enhancements were erroneous on the ground that the evidence was inadequate to show that he had knowledge of the intended conduct or the amount of the intended loss.   However, we conclude that the circumstantial evidence is more than adequate to establish that the use of firearms, the restraint of armored car guards and the intended loss of a gold cargo were not only reasonably foreseeable to defendant but that he knew the plan involved those factors and that his agreement to participate covered such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, defendant pled guilty to a conspiracy to commit robbery.   The guideline applicable to conspiracies, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1, tells the trial court to use the base offense level for the substantive offense plus appropriate adjustments.   Here the substantive offense was robbery, and the robbery guideline sets the base offense level at 20 and includes as specific offense characteristics the use of a firearm, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(B);  physical restraint of a person to facilitate commission of the offense or escape, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(4)(B);  and the amount of loss, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(6).   In determining the applicability of these specific offense characteristics, the Guidelines direct the court to consider not only the defendant's actual conduct and the conduct he agreed to undertake, but also \"all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).   The Commentary explains that a defendant is accountable for the conduct of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commentary states that the relevant conduct determination for a particular defendant depends on the scope of the activity he agreed to undertake jointly.   To determine the scope of a defendant's agreement, \"the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.\"   Id. The Commentary admonishes that \"the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical.\"   Id. For example, the note describes a defendant who agrees with another to commit a robbery and explains that even though the defendant did not contemplate an assault, he would be accountable for an accomplice's assault of the victim in the course of the robbery \"because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines thus contemplate that a defendant would be accountable for sentencing purposes for his own intended conduct within the scope of the conspiracy, but also accountable for the intended scope of his co-conspirator that was in furtherance of the conspiracy and was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.   The reasonable certainty requirement of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(a) contemplates that in considering specific enhancements, the sentencing court will consider \"what with reasonable certainty can be determined to be the conspirator's intent.\"   United States v. Madeiros, 897 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir.1990).   Finally, the conspiracy guideline considers that a defendant may be held accountable for acts that have not yet been performed.   See United States v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 35 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S.----, 114 S.Ct. 696 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now proceed to Grelle's specific objections regarding the three enhancements imposed by the district court.   A court's factual determinations supporting a sentence must be proved by the government by a preponderance of the evidence, and this Court reviews such findings only for clear error.  United States v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 499 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy and robbery guidelines provide for a 6-level enhancement for intended use of a firearm.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(B).   District Judge Lisi presided over the first trial and was therefore familiar with the details of the case, so that her rulings are entitled to great deference.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e).   She found here that the use of firearms was foreseeable to this defendant because Grelle acknowledged that he had knowingly become involved in an \"armed robbery conspiracy\" and admitted that Joost, his co-defendant in the original trial, told him about the robbery and had taken Grelle to the robbery site on the previous day.   Indeed, as early as May 28, 1994, defendant had become a co-conspirator by planning to participate in the armored car robbery with Joost and the detectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grelle was present during many of Joost's conversations with the detectives, though it is not established that he was present when Joost specifically mentioned firearms.   Joost nevertheless mentioned to the detectives that guns would be needed to subdue the guards and that it might be necessary to put guns to their heads and shoot them.   Under the plans known to Grelle, he would certainly realize that the armored car guards would be carrying firearms and would have to be subdued in order to steal the gold, thus requiring firearm use.   Joost's plan to use firearms was reasonably foreseeable to Grelle and was proved by a preponderance of the evidence, so that the 6-level enhancement was properly assessed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the robbery guideline, a 2-level enhancement is to be imposed if \"any person was physically restrained to facilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate escape.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(4)(B).   Under the conspiracy guideline, defendant was subject to such enhancement since the record shows that he knew or could reasonably foresee that one of the robbers intended to restrain another person in the commission of the robbery or the escape afterwards.   Here the district court found that Grelle's participation in the conspiracy contemplated that the robbery would take place at the Meehan facility when guards would be present.   As a result, the court properly concluded that it was reasonably certain that Grelle knew that a person would have to be restrained in order to successfully conclude the robbery.   In addition, Joost had discussed detailed plans with the detectives involving the restraint of a Meehan guard.   Based on Joost's willingness to discuss the plan's details with two of the participants, the district court found that he likely discussed the same plans with Grelle.   The district court's finding that Grelle knew or could reasonably have foreseen that the plan involved the restraint of others was supported by a preponderance of the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the 3-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(6)(D) was for an intended loss of between $250,000 and $800,000.   Grelle was not held accountable for the entire $5,000,000 value of the cargo--the value testified to at trial--because the district judge found that he was not aware that the armored car contained precious cargo other than the gold.   Rather, the district court based its determination on the trial testimony which showed that from April through August 1994, about a month before the intended robbery, the armored vehicle carried between $455,887 and $848,998 worth of gold on each run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grelle attacks the determination on the basis that the figures were not certain.   However, the Commentary to the guideline states that the \"loss need not be determined with precision.   The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, comment.   It is clear that Grelle intended to participate in the armored car robbery and that both Grelle and Joost knew or could reasonably foresee that the vehicle contained a large amount of money.   At one point, Joost told the detectives that he thought the car could contain as much as several million dollars.   Based on this information, the district court acted reasonably in imposing a 3-level increase for the intended loss.   The decision was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In March 1994, Detectives Steven O'Donnell and Joseph DelPrete of the Rhode Island State Police conducted an undercover investigation of the manufacture of counterfeit Foxwoods Casino, Connecticut, slot machine tokens by Joost.

At the meeting, Joost detailed how he, the detectives, and a fourth person would conduct the robbery;  he indicated that he needed four guys for the operation and that he already had one \"guy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same three met again several times in May 1994 during which Joost told the detectives further details about the proposed robbery.   On May 28 he introduced them to defendant Grelle.   The four traveled to Pennsylvania to rob a trailer and warehouse, but a prearranged stop by the police brought an end to the plan.   During the trip, however, Grelle told the two detectives that he was going to participate in the armored car robbery along with them and Joost.   Grelle also stated that he was the manufacturer of the counterfeit Foxwoods Casino tokens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, Joost told the detectives that he had looked at the Meehan building around midnight but left when he saw a police officer driving up the access road.   He said that five people would be the right number to commit the robbery and gave them other details.   On June 27, Joost told the detectives that he and they would arrive at the Meehan building the next midnight in order to survey the premises.   Joost said that Grelle would drop them off and pick them up at 4:30 in the morning.   The trip was then postponed to the following evening.   The detectives met Joost on the evening of June 29 and he said that he had explained the robbery plans to Grelle.   At 11:00 p.m.   the three men met Grelle in Smithfield, Rhode Island.   One detective and Joost drove with Grelle in his car while the other detective followed in his own car.   During the drive, Joost complained about Grelle's choice of a car, and Grelle promised a better car for the robbery itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two cars met up at a housing complex in Cumberland.   When Detective DelPrete asked Grelle how he knew about the complex, Grelle responded, \"When you plan, you plan well.\"   All four then proceeded to Woonsocket in Grelle's car.   Joost and the two detectives left Grelle in order to survey the Meehan building while Grelle agreed to pick them up later.   The details of the planned robbery were then explained by Joost to the two detectives.   Joost explained how one guard would be handcuffed in the truck and his mouth taped, and how they would put a gun to the guard's head and shoot if necessary.   Since the guards had not appeared as expected at 4:00 a.m., Joost and the detectives returned to the pickup point where Grelle met them.   Joost told Grelle that they had missed the armored car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, Joost again described the armored car robbery plan to the detectives and again mentioned putting a gun to the head of one of the Meehan guards.   On August 5, Joost and Grelle were arrested by federal agents and Rhode Island police detectives and Grelle's office was searched by federal agents, who seized a mold for counterfeiting U.S. quarters.   They also seized from his car molds for counterfeit one- and five-dollar Foxwoods Casino tokens and two counterfeit one-dollar Foxwoods Casino tokens.   From Grelle's home in North Scituate, Rhode Island, the agents seized 15 counterfeit U.S. quarters, some marijuana plants, a bag of marijuana, and still other counterfeit casino tokens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the joint trial, the director of security for two manufacturing companies testified that those companies manufactured items in gold and silver in the Attleboro, Massachusetts, area and shipped the finished products five days weekly to New York City via the Meehan Woonsocket company, which delivered the products to various customers in New York.  He indicated that the dollar value of the average daily shipments from April 1994 to August 1994 ranged from $455,887 to $848,998.   A Meehan official testified that other precious metal shipments accompanying that cargo averaged about $5,000,000 daily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently Grelle prepared a statement for inclusion in the presentence report in support of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.   He admitted that he had been involved in the robbery and counterfeit tokens conspiracies and added \"I knowingly involved myself, and in doing that I committed a crime.\"   In return for Grelle's guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend the lowest term in the applicable Guidelines range and that it run concurrently to any other sentence.   The government agreed that Grelle did not participate in the conversations between Joost and the detectives in which (1) the amount of gold, (2) the use of firearms, (3) the possible shooting or killing of the Meehan guards, or (4) the restraint of those guards were discussed.   However, the government specifically reserved its right to argue that these details were reasonably foreseeable to Grelle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plea agreement the government agreed to recommend that Grelle receive a two-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility provided that (1) he admit his involvement in the criminal conduct, (2) he otherwise complied with all the requirements of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, and (3) he did not receive an enhancement for obstruction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1.  The government also agreed to recommend that he receive a three-level decrease under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(b)(2) because the substantive crime was not close to commission and that he receive a four-level decrease for a minimal role under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined the base offense level to be 20.   It then imposed a 6-level increase for intended use of a firearm, a 2-level increase for intended restraint of a victim, and a 3-level increase for an intended loss between $250,000 and $800,000.   The court then subtracted 3 levels for insubstantial completion of the substantive defense, 4 levels for minimal role, and 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility.   The total offense level was 22 with a sentencing range of 41 to 51 months' imprisonment.   The court imposed a sentence of 46 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grelle claims that the three sentence enhancements were erroneous on the ground that the evidence was inadequate to show that he had knowledge of the intended conduct or the amount of the intended loss.   However, we conclude that the circumstantial evidence is more than adequate to establish that the use of firearms, the restraint of armored car guards and the intended loss of a gold cargo were not only reasonably foreseeable to defendant but that he knew the plan involved those factors and that his agreement to participate covered such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, defendant pled guilty to a conspiracy to commit robbery.   The guideline applicable to conspiracies, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1, tells the trial court to use the base offense level for the substantive offense plus appropriate adjustments.   Here the substantive offense was robbery, and the robbery guideline sets the base offense level at 20 and includes as specific offense characteristics the use of a firearm, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(B);  physical restraint of a person to facilitate commission of the offense or escape, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(4)(B);  and the amount of loss, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(6).   In determining the applicability of these specific offense characteristics, the Guidelines direct the court to consider not only the defendant's actual conduct and the conduct he agreed to undertake, but also \"all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).   The Commentary explains that a defendant is accountable for the conduct of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3, comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commentary states that the relevant conduct determination for a particular defendant depends on the scope of the activity he agreed to undertake jointly.   To determine the scope of a defendant's agreement, \"the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.\"   Id. The Commentary admonishes that \"the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical.\"   Id. For example, the note describes a defendant who agrees with another to commit a robbery and explains that even though the defendant did not contemplate an assault, he would be accountable for an accomplice's assault of the victim in the course of the robbery \"because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines thus contemplate that a defendant would be accountable for sentencing purposes for his own intended conduct within the scope of the conspiracy, but also accountable for the intended scope of his co-conspirator that was in furtherance of the conspiracy and was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.   The reasonable certainty requirement of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(a) contemplates that in considering specific enhancements, the sentencing court will consider \"what with reasonable certainty can be determined to be the conspirator's intent.\"   United States v. Madeiros, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537187\"><a href=\"/opinion/537187/united-states-v-joseph-l-medeiros-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1990).   Finally, the conspiracy guideline considers that a defendant may be held accountable for acts that have not yet been performed.   See United States v. Chapdelaine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602833\"><a href=\"/opinion/602833/united-states-v-george-chapdelaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S.----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A court's factual determinations supporting a sentence must be proved by the government by a preponderance of the evidence, and this Court reviews such findings only for clear error.  United States v. Legarda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195229\"><a href=\"/opinion/195229/united-states-v-legarda/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 499 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy and robbery guidelines provide for a 6-level enhancement for intended use of a firearm.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(B).   District Judge Lisi presided over the first trial and was therefore familiar with the details of the case, so that her rulings are entitled to great deference.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e).   She found here that the use of firearms was foreseeable to this defendant because Grelle acknowledged that he had knowingly become involved in an \"armed robbery conspiracy\" and admitted that Joost, his co-defendant in the original trial, told him about the robbery and had taken Grelle to the robbery site on the previous day.   Indeed, as early as May 28, 1994, defendant had become a co-conspirator by planning to participate in the armored car robbery with Joost and the detectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grelle was present during many of Joost's conversations with the detectives, though it is not established that he was present when Joost specifically mentioned firearms.   Joost nevertheless mentioned to the detectives that guns would be needed to subdue the guards and that it might be necessary to put guns to their heads and shoot them.   Under the plans known to Grelle, he would certainly realize that the armored car guards would be carrying firearms and would have to be subdued in order to steal the gold, thus requiring firearm use.   Joost's plan to use firearms was reasonably foreseeable to Grelle and was proved by a preponderance of the evidence, so that the 6-level enhancement was properly assessed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the robbery guideline, a 2-level enhancement is to be imposed if \"any person was physically restrained to facilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate escape.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(4)(B).   Under the conspiracy guideline, defendant was subject to such enhancement since the record shows that he knew or could reasonably foresee that one of the robbers intended to restrain another person in the commission of the robbery or the escape afterwards.   Here the district court found that Grelle's participation in the conspiracy contemplated that the robbery would take place at the Meehan facility when guards would be present.   As a result, the court properly concluded that it was reasonably certain that Grelle knew that a person would have to be restrained in order to successfully conclude the robbery.   In addition, Joost had discussed detailed plans with the detectives involving the restraint of a Meehan guard.   Based on Joost's willingness to discuss the plan's details with two of the participants, the district court found that he likely discussed the same plans with Grelle.   The district court's finding that Grelle knew or could reasonably have foreseen that the plan involved the restraint of others was supported by a preponderance of the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the 3-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(6)(D) was for an intended loss of between $250,000 and $800,000.   Grelle was not held accountable for the entire $5,000,000 value of the cargo--the value testified to at trial--because the district judge found that he was not aware that the armored car contained precious cargo other than the gold.   Rather, the district court based its determination on the trial testimony which showed that from April through August 1994, about a month before the intended robbery, the armored vehicle carried between $455,887 and $848,998 worth of gold on each run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grelle attacks the determination on the basis that the figures were not certain.   However, the Commentary to the guideline states that the \"loss need not be determined with precision.   The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B1.1, comment.   It is clear that Grelle intended to participate in the armored car robbery and that both Grelle and Joost knew or could reasonably foresee that the vehicle contained a large amount of money.   At one point, Joost told the detectives that he thought the car could contain as much as several million dollars.   Based on this information, the district court acted reasonably in imposing a 3-level increase for the intended loss.   The decision was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
