Defendant-appellant  David C.\r                    SELYA,  Circuit  Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nWhite wants to  regain his  interest in a  parcel of real  estate\r\n\nknown as \"the Farm.\"   The government seized White's  interest in\r\n\nthis tract after  he and  several others pled  guilty to  charges\r\n\nthat they collogued to  distribute marijuana.  White acknowledges\r\n\nthat  his  coconspirators  used   the  Farm  to  carry  out   the\r\n\nconspiracy's  nefarious  objectives,  but  he  insists  that  the\r\n\ngovernment  cannot seize  his  interest in  the property  without\r\n\nfirst showing that he  personally used it to further  the illicit\r                                           \r\n\nactivity.\r\n\n          This is an argument which  requires red meat and strong\r\n\ndrink, but the appellant  offers little in the way  of sustenance\r\n\nfor it.  Consequently, we reject his theory and instead hold that\r\n\nthe nexus between White's involvement in the marijuana conspiracy\r\n\nand his coconspirators' use of the Farm permits forfeiture.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          White  was  indicted  along  with  several  others  for\r\n\nconspiring to distribute  marijuana in violation of  21 U.S.C.   \r\n\n841(a)(1),  841(b)(1)(A),  846.    The  same  indictment   sought\r\n\ncriminal  forfeiture of  the Farm  pursuant to  21 U.S.C.    853.\r\n\nWhite pled guilty to the conspiracy count and waived his right to\r\n\na jury trial on  the forfeiture count.  In conjunction  with this\r\n\nwaiver,  the  parties  stipulated  to the  facts  underlying  the\r\n\nforfeiture count.  We summarize these facts.\r\n\n          The Farm is located in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  White\r\n\ninherited his  interest  in  it from  his  mother.   He  owns  an\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nundivided  one-fourth  interest,  as   does  each  of  his  three\r\n\nsiblings.  During  the course  of the conspiracy,  White did  not\r\n\nlive on the Farm, but he knew that  his sister and coconspirator,\r\n\nRebecca White,  resided  there with  another coconspirator,  Gary\r\n\nDethlefs.  White also was cognizant  of the fact that Rebecca and\r\n\nGary  were using  the  Farm to  facilitate  the business  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy.    Although  White did  not  attempt  to prevent  his\r\n\ncoconspirators  from   storing  drugs  on  the   Farm,  he  never\r\n\npersonally conducted illicit activities in that venue.\r\n\n          After  the  district court  adjudicated  White's guilt,\r\n\nWhite filed  a motion for judgment,  asseverating that forfeiture\r\n\nis improper  when there is  no proof that  the defendant/property\r\n\nowner personally used the targeted property to carry out criminal\r\n\nactivity.   The  district court  rejected White's  \"personal use\"\r\n\nargument and denied his  motion.  See United States  v. Dethlefs,\r                                                                          \r\n\n934 F.Supp. 475  (D. Me.  1996).  Shortly  thereafter, the  court\r\n\nentered an order of forfeiture.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n          Because   this  matter   does  not   implicate  factual\r\n\ndisputes,  but only  requires us to  assay the  appellant's legal\r\n\ntheory by  resort to the drug-trafficking  forfeiture statute, 21\r\n\nU.S.C.    853,  our review  is  plenary.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPitrone,      F.3d    ,      (1st Cir. 1997)  [No. 96-2090, slip.\r                 \r\n\nop. at 6]; United States  v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 472  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1994).\r\n\nII.  PRINCIPLES AFFECTING CRIMINAL FORFEITURE\r          II.  PRINCIPLES AFFECTING CRIMINAL FORFEITURE\r\n\n          The applicable statute, which permits the government to\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nseize drug-related property, provides  in pertinent part that any\r\n\nperson who is convicted of a federal felony drug violation\r\n\n          shall   forfeit   to   the   United   States,\r\n          irrespective of any provision of State law  \r\n             (1)  any property constituting, or derived\r\n          from,  any  proceeds  the   person  obtained,\r\n          directly or indirectly, as the result of such\r\n          violation;\r\n                (2)  any of the person's property used,\r\n          or  intended to  be  used, in  any manner  or\r\n          part,  to  commit,   or  to  facilitate   the\r\n          commission of, such violation . . . . \r\n\n21 U.S.C.     853(a)  (1994).   This  statute  contemplates  both\r\n\n\"property obtained\" and \"property  used\" forfeitures; that is, it\r\n\nallows  the  government  to  confiscate  a  criminal  defendant's\r\n\nproperty where the property  either is the fruit  of drug-related\r\n\ncriminal  activity  or  has  been used  to  further  drug-related\r\n\ncriminal activity.\r\n\n          The legislative history of section 853  is significant.\r\n\nCongress enacted the  statute as part of  the Comprehensive Crime\r\n\nControl  Act of 1984.  See Act of  Oct. 12, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-\r                                    \r\n\n473, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  (98 Stat. 1837).  Congress expressed high\r\n\nhopes  for this legislation, intending  it as a  vehicle \"to make\r\n\nmajor comprehensive  improvements to the Federal  criminal laws.\"\r\n\nS. Rep. No. 98-225,  at 1 (1984), reprinted in  1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r                                                        \r\n\n3182,  3184.    To  bolster  federal  crime  prevention  efforts,\r\n\nCongress \"enhance[d]  the use of forfeiture,  and, in particular,\r\n\nthe sanction of criminal forfeiture, as a law enforcement tool in\r\n\ncombating  two of  the  most serious  crime  problems facing  the\r\n\ncountry:  racketeering and drug trafficking.\"  Id. at 3374.\r                                                            \r\n\n          To  implement these  sentiments, Congress  expanded the\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\npreexisting Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO)\r\n\nforfeiture  provision,   embodied  in  18  U.S.C.      1963,  and\r\n\nsimultaneously created the  drug-related forfeiture provision now\r\n\ncodified in section 853.  Congress took pains to note that \"[t]he\r\n\nprovisions of this new criminal forfeiture statute for major drug\r\n\noffenses closely parallel those  of the [amended] RICO forfeiture\r\n\nprovisions  .  .  .  .\"    Id.  at  3381.    Since  then,  courts\r                                        \r\n\nconsistently  have  construed  the RICO  forfeiture  statute,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.      1963,   and   the   statute  governing   drug-related\r\n\nforfeitures, 21 U.S.C.   853, in  pari passu.  See United  States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Ct. 356  (1995);\r                                                 \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Bissell, 866  F.2d 1343,  1348 n.3  (11th Cir.\r                                    \r\n\n1989);  United States v. Benevento,  663 F. Supp.  1115, 1118 n.2\r                                            \r\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1987), aff'd per  curiam, 836 F.2d 129 (2d  Cir. 1988).\r                                            \r\n\nWe join these courts in  holding that case law under 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1963 is persuasive in construing 21 U.S.C.   853, and vice versa.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court has  held that criminal forfeiture is\r\n\nless  a substantive offense and more an element of the offender's\r\n\nsentence.   See Libretti, 116  S. Ct. at  363.  For  this reason,\r                                  \r\n\ncriminal  forfeitures   do  not  engender  the   same  procedural\r\n\nprotections  as do felony  charges simpliciter.  See id.  at 364,\r                                                                  \r\n\n367.   This  does  not mean,  however,  that the  government  can\r\n\nforfeit  assets for the  asking.  One restriction  is that \"  853\r\n\nlimits forfeiture  by establishing a  factual nexus  requirement:\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nOnly  drug-tainted assets may  be forfeited.\"   Id. at 364.   Put\r                                                             \r\n\nmore  precisely, criminal  forfeiture  is  not permissible  under\r\n\nsection  853  unless  the  government  establishes  a  connection\r\n\nbetween  the  forfeited  property  and  the defendant's  criminal\r\n\nconduct.\r\n\n          The  exact  dimensions of  this  nexus requirement  are\r\n\nlargely uncharted.  In  United States v. Desmarais, 938  F.2d 347\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991), government  officials effected a \"property used\"\r\n\nforfeiture and  seized the defendant's house  pursuant to section\r\n\n853(a)(2).  On  appeal, the defendant  claimed that the  district\r\n\ncourt had  erred in instructing  the jurors anent  the connection\r\n\nbetween the seized property and the defendant's criminal conduct.\r\n\nWithout  venturing to  delineate  the contours  of the  necessary\r\n\nconnection, we held that the jury instructions  were adequate and\r\n\nthat  the  facts  sufficiently established  the  requisite  nexus\r\n\nbetween  the defendant's  (forfeited) dwelling  and his  criminal\r\n\nmisconduct.   Id.  at 353  (mentioning  that narcotics  had  been\r                           \r\n\nmailed  to  the  house  and that  officers  had  discovered  drug\r\n\nparaphernalia  therein).   We  acknowledged, however,  that \"[w]e\r\n\nhave yet  to define  the degree  of interrelatedness  required to\r\n\nsupport a  criminal forfeiture under  21 U.S.C.    853(a)(2), nor\r\n\nhas any other court done so to our knowledge.\"  Id.\r                                                             \r\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\r          III.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          White posits  that, in this case,  forfeiture is proper\r\n\nonly  if there is  a watertight  nexus between  the Farm  and his\r\n\ncriminal conduct  and that,  therefore, the government  must show\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthat he personally used  the Farm to  commit the conspiracy.   He\r\n\nrelies upon  two distinctions in  forfeiture law to  support this\r\n\nconstruct.   First, he points out  that although civil forfeiture\r\n\nis a proceeding  against the property,  criminal forfeiture is  a\r\n\nproceeding against  the person.   This distinction,  according to\r\n\nthe appellant, highlights the criminal law's traditional focus on\r\n\nindividual culpability.  Second, he hypothesizes that a \"property\r\n\nused\" forfeiture  is distinguishable  from a  \"property obtained\"\r\n\nforfeiture in that the former requires a showing of criminal use.\r\n\nThe  appellant then  adds these  two distinctions  together, like\r\n\nnumbers in an equation, to produce the desired sum:  the supposed\r\n\nrequirement that the government must show that he personally used\r\n\nthe Farm to conduct illegal activity.\r\n\n          We  agree with  the  appellant's two  premises, and  we\r\n\nrecognize  the distinctions  that  he delineates.   We  disagree,\r\n\nhowever,  with  his  conclusion  because we  believe  that  these\r\n\ndistinctions,  severally  and  in  combination, fail  to  make  a\r\n\nmaterial difference in the outcome  of this case.  In  short, the\r\n\nappellant's equation is out of balance.\r\n\n          Courts  have declined to bootstrap into the appellant's\r\n\nfirst distinction   criminal versus civil   the  proposition that\r\n\na criminal forfeiture  proceeding must be viewed through a highly\r\n\nindividualized  lens.   In  the  context  of \"property  obtained\"\r\n\nforfeitures, for example, several  courts of appeals have refused\r\n\nto  limit criminal forfeiture  to proceeds  defendants personally\r\n\nobtained and  have held  defendants jointly and  severally liable\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nfor the proceeds  obtained by their  coconspirators.  See  McHan,\r                                                                          \r\n\n101 F.3d at  1043 (holding that section  853(a)(1) forfeiture \"is\r\n\nnot limited to property  that the defendant acquired individually\r\n\nbut includes  all property that the  defendant derived indirectly\r\n\nfrom  those who  acted  in concert  with  him in  furthering  the\r\n\ncriminal enterprise\");  United States v.

In holding\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthe defendant jointly  and severally liable  for all the  illicit\r\n\nprofits  procured  by  means  of the  conspiracy  and  reasonably\r\n\nforeseeable to the defendant, we reasoned that:\r\n\n          Under  established case  law,  members  of  a\r\n          conspiracy are substantively  liable for  the\r\n          foreseeable  criminal  conduct  of the  other\r\n          members  of the  conspiracy.

Using\r                                  \r\n          the same concept,  the Sentencing  Guidelines\r\n          attribute  to a  defendant at  sentencing the\r\n          foreseeable   conduct   of   co-conspirators.\r\n          U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  It would be odd .\r\n          .  .   to  depart  from   this  principle  of\r\n          attributed conduct when it comes to apply the\r\n          forfeiture rules, which have aspects  both of\r\n          substantive liability and of penalty.\r\n\nId.  at  22.    Thus,  contrary  to  the  appellant's  assertion,\r             \r\n\ntraditional  notions of criminal law do  not preclude courts from\r\n\nholding defendants  in forfeiture  proceedings  liable for  their\r\n\ncoconspirators' behavior.  See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1043; Caporale,\r                                                                          \r\n\n806  F.2d   at  1508.     Consequently,  the   appellant's  first\r\n\ndistinction drops from his equation.\r\n\n          White's  second distinction  likewise fails  to support\r\n\nhis  \"personal use\"  argument.   There  is  simply no  analytical\r\n\ngrounding  for the  proposition  that \"property  used\" forfeiture\r\n\nrequires a  showing that  defendant personally used  the property\r\n\nfor illicit  reasons when,  as the appellant  concedes, \"property\r\n\nobtained\"  forfeitures do  not require  a similar  showing.   The\r\n\nPinkerton principle, see Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640\r                                                             \r\n\n(1946),  is  equally  applicable  to  both  subsets  of  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture.  Moreover, the plain language  of the \"property used\"\r\n\nforfeiture, 21 U.S.C.   853(a)(2), simply does not direct a court\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nto find that a  defendant personally used the property  to commit\r\n\nthe underlying crime.   We  would usurp Congress'  power were  we\r\n\ngratuitously to read such  a restriction into the statute.   This\r\n\nis especially true because Congress explicitly warned the federal\r\n\ncourts not to  construe section 853 grudgingly.  See  21 U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n853(o)  (\"The  provisions  of  this section  shall  be  liberally\r\n\nconstrued to effectuate its remedial purpose.\").\r\n\n          In fine,  the sum  of the appellant's  arguments is  no\r\n\nmore than the sum of its parts    and that adds up to very little\r\n\nin the context of this case.   White cites no apposite  authority\r\n\nfor  his  views,1  and  neither of  his  proffered  distinctions,\r\n\nstanding  alone  or  added  together,  support  his  vision of  a\r\n\n\"personal use\"  requirement for \"property used\"  forfeitures.  By\r\n\nits terms, section 853(a)(2) requires only that  the defendant be\r\n\nconvicted of  a drug-trafficking offense and that his property be\r\n\nused  to  facilitate  the  commission  of that  offense.    These\r\n\nrequirements are fully satisfied in White's case.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1White  cites United States  v. Ragonese,  607 F.  Supp. 649\r                                                       \r\n(S.D. Fla. 1985),  aff'd, 784 F.2d 403 (11th Cir.  1986), for the\r                                  \r\nproposition that a coconspirator's  use of a defendant's property\r\nis insufficient  to justify its  forfeiture.  The  Ragonese court\r                                                                     \r\nmade  no such holding.  There, the government sought to establish\r\na nexus  between the seized  property (an apartment  complex) and\r\nthe substantive  RICO violation  by proving that  a coconspirator\r\ndealt drugs from units within the apartment  complex.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n652.  The defendant, however, was outraged by this activity as it\r\ntended to lower property values.  Id.  The court refused to order\r                                               \r\nforfeiture,  reasoning  that  the  requisite  nexus  between  the\r\ntargeted property  and the  underlying criminal conduct  does not\r\nexist  where  the  defendant/property owner  disapproves  of, and\r\nattempts to curtail, his  coconspirator's use of the  property to\r\nconduct criminal activity.   See id.  at 651-52.   This case,  in\r                                              \r\nwhich White acquiesced complacently in his coconspirators' use of\r\nthe Farm, stands in vivid contrast to Ragonese.\r                                                        \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.  Forfeiture  under section 853,\r\n\nwhether  of  the  \"property  obtained\"  or  the  \"property  used\"\r\n\nvariety,  requires a court to  find a nexus  between the targeted\r\n\nproperty and the defendant's  underlying criminal activity.  This\r\n\nnexus  exists here inasmuch as the appellant owned an interest in\r\n\nthe property that his  coconspirators, to his knowledge  and with\r\n\nhis  tacit acquiescence, used in facilitating the business of the\r\n\nmarijuana conspiracy.  See  generally Pinkerton v. United States,\r                                                                          \r\n\n328  U.S.  640 (1946).    The  law simply  does  not require  the\r\n\ngovernment  to show,  as a  precondition to  criminal forfeiture,\r\n\nthat White personally used the Farm to conduct illicit activity.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n",

White wants to regain his interest in a parcel of real estate known as \"the Farm.\"  The government seized White's interest in this tract after he and several others pled guilty to charges that they collogued to distribute marijuana.  White acknowledges that his coconspirators used the Farm to carry out the conspiracy's nefarious objectives, but he insists that the government cannot seize his interest in the property without first showing that he personally used it to further the illicit activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an argument which requires red meat and strong drink, but the appellant offers little in the way of sustenance for it.  Consequently, we reject his theory and instead hold that the nexus between White's involvement in the marijuana conspiracy and his coconspirators' use of the Farm permits forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White was indicted along with several others for conspiring to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846.  The same indictment sought criminal forfeiture of the Farm pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  White pled guilty to the conspiracy count and waived his right to a jury trial on the forfeiture count.  In conjunction with this waiver, the parties stipulated to the facts underlying the forfeiture count.  We summarize these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Farm is located in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  White inherited his interest in it from his mother.  He owns an undivided one-fourth interest, as does each of his three siblings.  During the course of the conspiracy, White did not live on the Farm, but he knew that his sister and coconspirator, Rebecca White, resided there with another coconspirator, Gary Dethlefs.  White also was cognizant of the fact that Rebecca and Gary were using the Farm to facilitate the business of the conspiracy.  Although White did not attempt to prevent his coconspirators from storing drugs on the Farm, he never personally conducted illicit activities in that venue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court adjudicated White's guilt, White filed a motion for judgment, asseverating that forfeiture is improper when there is no proof that the defendant/property owner personally used the targeted property to carry out criminal activity.  The district court rejected White's \"personal use\" argument and denied his motion.  See United States v. Dethlefs, 934 F.Supp. 475 (D.Me.1996).  Shortly thereafter, the court entered an order of forfeiture.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this matter does not implicate factual disputes, but only requires us to assay the appellant's legal theory by resort to the drug-trafficking forfeiture statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, our review is plenary.  See United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 472 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PRINCIPLES AFFECTING CRIMINAL FORFEITURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable statute, which permits the government to seize drug-related property, provides in pertinent part that any person who is convicted of a federal felony drug violation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a) (1994).  This statute contemplates both \"property obtained\" and \"property used\" forfeitures;  that is, it allows the government to confiscate a criminal defendant's property where the property either is the fruit of drug-related criminal activity or has been used to further drug-related criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of section 853 is significant.  Congress enacted the statute as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  See Act of Oct. 12, 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  (98 Stat. 1837).  Congress expressed high hopes for this legislation, intending it as a vehicle \"to make major comprehensive improvements to the Federal criminal laws.\"   S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 1 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3184.   To bolster federal crime prevention efforts, Congress \"enhance[d] the use of forfeiture, and, in particular, the sanction of criminal forfeiture, as a law enforcement tool in combating two of the most serious crime problems facing the country:  racketeering and drug trafficking.\"  Id. at 3374.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To implement these sentiments, Congress expanded the preexisting Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) forfeiture provision, embodied in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963, and simultaneously created the drug-related forfeiture provision now codified in section 853.  Congress took pains to note that \"[t]he provisions of this new criminal forfeiture statute for major drug offenses closely parallel those of the [amended] RICO forfeiture provisions....\"  Id. at 3381.   Since then, courts consistently have construed the RICO forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963, and the statute governing drug-related forfeitures, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, in pari passu.  See United States v. McHan, 101 F.3d 1027, 1042 (4th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2468, 138 L.Ed.2d 223 (1997);  United States v. Libretti, 38 F.3d 523, 528, n. 6 (10th Cir.1994), aff'd, 516 U.S. 29, 116 S.Ct. 356, 133 L.Ed.2d 271 (1995);  United States v. Bissell, 866 F.2d 1343, 1348 n. 3 (11th Cir.1989);  United States v. Benevento, 663 F.Supp. 1115, 1118 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y.1987), aff'd per curiam, 836 F.2d 129 (2d Cir.1988).  We join these courts in holding that case law under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963 is persuasive in construing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, and vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that criminal forfeiture is less a substantive offense and more an element of the offender's sentence.  See Libretti, 516 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 363.   For this reason, criminal forfeitures do not engender the same procedural protections as do felony charges simpliciter.  See id. at ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. at 364, 367.   This does not mean, however, that the government can forfeit assets for the asking.  One restriction is that \" &#167; 853 limits forfeiture by establishing a factual nexus requirement:  Only drug-tainted assets may be forfeited.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 364.   Put more precisely, criminal forfeiture is not permissible under section 853 unless the government establishes a connection between the forfeited property and the defendant's criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exact dimensions of this nexus requirement are largely uncharted.  In United States v. Desmarais, 938 F.2d 347 (1st Cir.1991), government officials effected a \"property used\" forfeiture and seized the defendant's house pursuant to section 853(a)(2).  On appeal, the defendant claimed that the district court had erred in instructing the jurors anent the connection between the seized property and the defendant's criminal conduct.  Without venturing to delineate the contours of the necessary connection, we held that the jury instructions were adequate and that the facts sufficiently established the requisite nexus between the defendant's (forfeited) dwelling and his criminal misconduct.  Id. at 353 (mentioning that narcotics had been mailed to the house and that officers had discovered drug paraphernalia therein).  We acknowledged, however, that \"[w]e have yet to define the degree of interrelatedness required to support a criminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(2), nor has any other court done so to our knowledge.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White posits that, in this case, forfeiture is proper only if there is a watertight nexus between the Farm and his criminal conduct and that, therefore, the government must show that he personally used the Farm to commit the conspiracy.  He relies upon two distinctions in forfeiture law to support this construct.  First, he points out that although civil forfeiture is a proceeding against the property, criminal forfeiture is a proceeding against the person.  This distinction, according to the appellant, highlights the criminal law's traditional focus on individual culpability.  Second, he hypothesizes that a \"property used\" forfeiture is distinguishable from a \"property obtained\" forfeiture in that the former requires a showing of criminal use.  The appellant then adds these two distinctions together, like numbers in an equation, to produce the desired sum:  the supposed requirement that the government must show that he personally used the Farm to conduct illegal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellant's two premises, and we recognize the distinctions that he delineates.  We disagree, however, with his conclusion because we believe that these distinctions, severally and in combination, fail to make a material difference in the outcome of this case.  In short, the appellant's equation is out of balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have declined to bootstrap into the appellant's first distinction--criminal versus civil--the proposition that a criminal forfeiture proceeding must be viewed through a highly individualized lens.  In the context of \"property obtained\" forfeitures, for example, several courts of appeals have refused to limit criminal forfeiture to proceeds defendants personally obtained and have held defendants jointly and severally liable for the proceeds obtained by their coconspirators.  See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1043 (holding that section 853(a)(1) forfeiture \"is not limited to property that the defendant acquired individually but includes all property that the defendant derived indirectly from those who acted in concert with him in furthering the criminal enterprise\");  United States v. Masters, 924 F.2d 1362, 1370 (7th Cir.1991) (holding RICO defendant jointly and severally liable for proceeds obtained by his coconspirators, noting that each member of the conspiracy \"is fully liable for the receipts of the other members of the enterprise\");  United States v. Caporale, 806 F.2d 1487, 1506 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that the \"imposition of joint and several liability in a forfeiture order upon RICO co-conspirators is not only permissible but necessary ... to effectuate the purpose of the forfeiture provision\");  see also United States v. Wilson, 742 F.Supp. 905, 909 (E.D.Pa.1989) (holding that \"there is no bar to the imposition of joint and several liability on a RICO forfeiture verdict, and ... imposition of joint and several liability [is] consistent with the statutory scheme\"), aff'd, 909 F.2d 1478 (3d Cir.1990) (table);  Benevento, 663 F.Supp. at 1118 (applying the doctrine of joint and several liability to a section 853(a)(1) forfeiture).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court adopted the same approach in United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996), a RICO forfeiture case in which we refused to limit forfeiture to ill-gotten gains personally obtained.  In holding the defendant jointly and severally liable for all the illicit profits procured by means of the conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable to the defendant, we reasoned that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>Under established case law, members of a conspiracy are substantively liable for the foreseeable criminal conduct of the other members of the conspiracy.  Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946).  Using the same concept, the Sentencing Guidelines attribute to a defendant at sentencing the foreseeable conduct of co-conspirators.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  It would be odd ... to depart from this principle of attributed conduct when it comes to apply the forfeiture rules, which have aspects both of substantive liability and of penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 22.   Thus, contrary to the appellant's assertion, traditional notions of criminal law do not preclude courts from holding defendants in forfeiture proceedings liable for their coconspirators' behavior.  See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1043;  Caporale, 806 F.2d at 1508.   Consequently, the appellant's first distinction drops from his equation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White's second distinction likewise fails to support his \"personal use\" argument.  There is simply no analytical grounding for the proposition that \"property used\" forfeiture requires a showing that defendant personally used the property for illicit reasons when, as the appellant concedes, \"property obtained\" forfeitures do not require a similar showing.  The Pinkerton principle, see Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946), is equally applicable to both subsets of criminal forfeiture.  Moreover, the plain language of the \"property used\" forfeiture, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(2), simply does not direct a court to find that a defendant personally used the property to commit the underlying crime.  We would usurp Congress' power were we gratuitously to read such a restriction into the statute.  This is especially true because Congress explicitly warned the federal courts not to construe section 853 grudgingly.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(o) (\"The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purpose.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fine, the sum of the appellant's arguments is no more than the sum of its parts--and that adds up to very little in the context of this case.  White cites no apposite authority for his views,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and neither of his proffered distinctions, standing alone or added together, support his vision of a \"personal use\" requirement for \"property used\" forfeitures.  By its terms, section 853(a)(2) requires only that the defendant be convicted of a drug-trafficking offense and that his property be used to facilitate the commission of that offense.  These requirements are fully satisfied in White's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Forfeiture under section 853, whether of the \"property obtained\" or the \"property used\" variety, requires a court to find a nexus between the targeted property and the defendant's underlying criminal activity.  This nexus exists here inasmuch as the appellant owned an interest in the property that his coconspirators, to his knowledge and with his tacit acquiescence, used in facilitating the business of the marijuana conspiracy.  See generally Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946).  The law simply does not require the government to show, as a precondition to criminal forfeiture, that White personally used the Farm to conduct illicit activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> White cites United States v. Ragonese, 607 F.Supp. 649 (S.D.Fla.1985), aff'd, 784 F.2d 403 (11th Cir.1986), for the proposition that a coconspirator's use of a defendant's property is insufficient to justify its forfeiture.  The Ragonese court made no such holding.  There, the government sought to establish a nexus between the seized property (an apartment complex) and the substantive RICO violation by proving that a coconspirator dealt drugs from units within the apartment complex.  See id. at 652.   The defendant, however, was outraged by this activity as it tended to lower property values.  Id. The court refused to order forfeiture, reasoning that the requisite nexus between the targeted property and the underlying criminal conduct does not exist where the defendant/property owner disapproves of, and attempts to curtail, his coconspirator's use of the property to conduct criminal activity.  See id. at 651-52.   This case, in which White acquiesced complacently in his coconspirators' use of the Farm, stands in vivid contrast to Ragonese</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

White wants to regain his interest in a parcel of real estate known as \"the Farm.\"  The government seized White's interest in this tract after he and several others pled guilty to charges that they collogued to distribute marijuana.  White acknowledges that his coconspirators used the Farm to carry out the conspiracy's nefarious objectives, but he insists that the government cannot seize his interest in the property without first showing that he personally used it to further the illicit activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an argument which requires red meat and strong drink, but the appellant offers little in the way of sustenance for it.  Consequently, we reject his theory and instead hold that the nexus between White's involvement in the marijuana conspiracy and his coconspirators' use of the Farm permits forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White was indicted along with several others for conspiring to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846.  The same indictment sought criminal forfeiture of the Farm pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  White pled guilty to the conspiracy count and waived his right to a jury trial on the forfeiture count.  In conjunction with this waiver, the parties stipulated to the facts underlying the forfeiture count.  We summarize these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Farm is located in Mansfield, Massachusetts.  White inherited his interest in it from his mother.  He owns an undivided one-fourth interest, as does each of his three siblings.  During the course of the conspiracy, White did not live on the Farm, but he knew that his sister and coconspirator, Rebecca White, resided there with another coconspirator, Gary Dethlefs.  White also was cognizant of the fact that Rebecca and Gary were using the Farm to facilitate the business of the conspiracy.  Although White did not attempt to prevent his coconspirators from storing drugs on the Farm, he never personally conducted illicit activities in that venue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court adjudicated White's guilt, White filed a motion for judgment, asseverating that forfeiture is improper when there is no proof that the defendant/property owner personally used the targeted property to carry out criminal activity.  The district court rejected White's \"personal use\" argument and denied his motion.  See United States v. Dethlefs, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></span> (D.Me.1996).  Shortly thereafter, the court entered an order of forfeiture.

PRINCIPLES AFFECTING CRIMINAL FORFEITURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicable statute, which permits the government to seize drug-related property, provides in pertinent part that any person who is convicted of a federal felony drug violation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>shall forfeit to the United States, irrespective of any provision of State law--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a) (1994).  This statute contemplates both \"property obtained\" and \"property used\" forfeitures;  that is, it allows the government to confiscate a criminal defendant's property where the property either is the fruit of drug-related criminal activity or has been used to further drug-related criminal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of section 853 is significant.  Congress enacted the statute as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984.  See Act of Oct. 12, 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.  (98 Stat. 1837).  Congress expressed high hopes for this legislation, intending it as a vehicle \"to make major comprehensive improvements to the Federal criminal laws.\"   S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 1 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3184.   To bolster federal crime prevention efforts, Congress \"enhance[d] the use of forfeiture, and, in particular, the sanction of criminal forfeiture, as a law enforcement tool in combating two of the most serious crime problems facing the country:  racketeering and drug trafficking.\"  Id. at 3374.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To implement these sentiments, Congress expanded the preexisting Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) forfeiture provision, embodied in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963, and simultaneously created the drug-related forfeiture provision now codified in section 853.  Congress took pains to note that \"[t]he provisions of this new criminal forfeiture statute for major drug offenses closely parallel those of the [amended] RICO forfeiture provisions....\"  Id. at 3381.   Since then, courts consistently have construed the RICO forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963, and the statute governing drug-related forfeitures, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, in pari passu.

We join these courts in holding that case law under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963 is persuasive in construing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, and vice versa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that criminal forfeiture is less a substantive offense and more an element of the offender's sentence.  See Libretti, 516 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 363.   For this reason, criminal forfeitures do not engender the same procedural protections as do felony charges simpliciter.  See id. at ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. at 364, 367.   This does not mean, however, that the government can forfeit assets for the asking.  One restriction is that \" &#167; 853 limits forfeiture by establishing a factual nexus requirement:  Only drug-tainted assets may be forfeited.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 364.   Put more precisely, criminal forfeiture is not permissible under section 853 unless the government establishes a connection between the forfeited property and the defendant's criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exact dimensions of this nexus requirement are largely uncharted.  In United States v. Desmarais, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564779\"><a href=\"/opinion/564779/united-states-v-paul-desmarais/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991), government officials effected a \"property used\" forfeiture and seized the defendant's house pursuant to section 853(a)(2).  On appeal, the defendant claimed that the district court had erred in instructing the jurors anent the connection between the seized property and the defendant's criminal conduct.  Without venturing to delineate the contours of the necessary connection, we held that the jury instructions were adequate and that the facts sufficiently established the requisite nexus between the defendant's (forfeited) dwelling and his criminal misconduct.  Id. at 353 (mentioning that narcotics had been mailed to the house and that officers had discovered drug paraphernalia therein).  We acknowledged, however, that \"[w]e have yet to define the degree of interrelatedness required to support a criminal forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(2), nor has any other court done so to our knowledge.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White posits that, in this case, forfeiture is proper only if there is a watertight nexus between the Farm and his criminal conduct and that, therefore, the government must show that he personally used the Farm to commit the conspiracy.  He relies upon two distinctions in forfeiture law to support this construct.  First, he points out that although civil forfeiture is a proceeding against the property, criminal forfeiture is a proceeding against the person.  This distinction, according to the appellant, highlights the criminal law's traditional focus on individual culpability.  Second, he hypothesizes that a \"property used\" forfeiture is distinguishable from a \"property obtained\" forfeiture in that the former requires a showing of criminal use.  The appellant then adds these two distinctions together, like numbers in an equation, to produce the desired sum:  the supposed requirement that the government must show that he personally used the Farm to conduct illegal activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the appellant's two premises, and we recognize the distinctions that he delineates.  We disagree, however, with his conclusion because we believe that these distinctions, severally and in combination, fail to make a material difference in the outcome of this case.  In short, the appellant's equation is out of balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have declined to bootstrap into the appellant's first distinction--criminal versus civil--the proposition that a criminal forfeiture proceeding must be viewed through a highly individualized lens.  In the context of \"property obtained\" forfeitures, for example, several courts of appeals have refused to limit criminal forfeiture to proceeds defendants personally obtained and have held defendants jointly and severally liable for the proceeds obtained by their coconspirators.  See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1043 (holding that section 853(a)(1) forfeiture \"is not limited to property that the defendant acquired individually but includes all property that the defendant derived indirectly from those who acted in concert with him in furthering the criminal enterprise\");  United States v.

U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  It would be odd ... to depart from this principle of attributed conduct when it comes to apply the forfeiture rules, which have aspects both of substantive liability and of penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 22.   Thus, contrary to the appellant's assertion, traditional notions of criminal law do not preclude courts from holding defendants in forfeiture proceedings liable for their coconspirators' behavior.  See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1043;  Caporale, 806 F.2d at 1508.   Consequently, the appellant's first distinction drops from his equation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White's second distinction likewise fails to support his \"personal use\" argument.  There is simply no analytical grounding for the proposition that \"property used\" forfeiture requires a showing that defendant personally used the property for illicit reasons when, as the appellant concedes, \"property obtained\" forfeitures do not require a similar showing.  The Pinkerton principle, see Pinkerton v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1489</span></a></span> (1946), is equally applicable to both subsets of criminal forfeiture.  Moreover, the plain language of the \"property used\" forfeiture, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(2), simply does not direct a court to find that a defendant personally used the property to commit the underlying crime.  We would usurp Congress' power were we gratuitously to read such a restriction into the statute.  This is especially true because Congress explicitly warned the federal courts not to construe section 853 grudgingly.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(o) (\"The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purpose.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fine, the sum of the appellant's arguments is no more than the sum of its parts--and that adds up to very little in the context of this case.  White cites no apposite authority for his views,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and neither of his proffered distinctions, standing alone or added together, support his vision of a \"personal use\" requirement for \"property used\" forfeitures.  By its terms, section 853(a)(2) requires only that the defendant be convicted of a drug-trafficking offense and that his property be used to facilitate the commission of that offense.  These requirements are fully satisfied in White's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Forfeiture under section 853, whether of the \"property obtained\" or the \"property used\" variety, requires a court to find a nexus between the targeted property and the defendant's underlying criminal activity.  This nexus exists here inasmuch as the appellant owned an interest in the property that his coconspirators, to his knowledge and with his tacit acquiescence, used in facilitating the business of the marijuana conspiracy.  See generally Pinkerton v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The law simply does not require the government to show, as a precondition to criminal forfeiture, that White personally used the Farm to conduct illicit activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> White cites United States v. Ragonese, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2372001\"><a href=\"/opinion/2372001/united-states-v-ragonese/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span> (S.D.Fla.1985), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465140\"><a href=\"/opinion/465140/united-states-v-ragonese/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1986), for the proposition that a coconspirator's use of a defendant's property is insufficient to justify its forfeiture.  The Ragonese court made no such holding.  There, the government sought to establish a nexus between the seized property (an apartment complex) and the substantive RICO violation by proving that a coconspirator dealt drugs from units within the apartment complex.  See id. at 652.   The defendant, however, was outraged by this activity as it tended to lower property values.  Id. The court refused to order forfeiture, reasoning that the requisite nexus between the targeted property and the underlying criminal conduct does not exist where the defendant/property owner disapproves of, and attempts to curtail, his coconspirator's use of the property to conduct criminal activity.  See id. at 651-52.   This case, in which White acquiesced complacently in his coconspirators' use of the Farm, stands in vivid contrast to Ragonese</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
