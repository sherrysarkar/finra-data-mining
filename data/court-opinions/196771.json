On November 3,  1993, a federal\r                    SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\r                                         \r\n\ngrand  jury empaneled  in the  District of  Puerto Rico  indicted\r\n\ndefendant-appellant Juan Laboy-Delgado  (Laboy) for conspiring to\r\n\npossess cocaine with  intent to  distribute, 21 U.S.C.     841  &amp;\r\n\n846,  attempting to import cocaine and conspiring to that end, 21\r\n\nU.S.C.    952, 960, &amp; 963, and aiding and abetting the commission\r\n\nof these  crimes, 18 U.S.C.   2.  Following Laboy's conviction on\r\n\nall counts  and the  district court's imposition  of a  211-month\r\n\nincarcerative sentence,  Laboy prosecuted this appeal.   He finds\r\n\nno safe harbor.  Determining, as  we do, that his assignments  of\r\n\nerror lack merit, we affirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We elucidate the  facts gleaned at  trial in the  light\r\n\nmost  flattering to  the jury's  verdict.   See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSpinney, 65 F.3d 231, 233 (1st Cir. 1995).  We note at the outset\r                 \r\n\nthat  many  of the  pivotal facts  come  from testimony  of Sonia\r\n\nFigueroa  Sanchez  (Figueroa),  the  former  wife  of  a  quondam\r\n\nconspirator,  Zebedo  Maisonet   Gonzalez  (Maisonet),  and  from\r\n\nMaisonet himself.1\r\n\n          In early 1990, certain individuals,  Maisonet included,\r\n\nhatched a plan  to import cocaine from Colombia to Puerto Rico by\r\n\nway of St. Maarten.  Maisonet testified that a fellow rogue, Papo\r\n\nMontijo,  sponsored the  appellant for  membership in  the cabal.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Figueroa began cooperating with the authorities  during the\r\ninvestigation.  Maisonet  joined her in a duet as  part of a plea\r\nagreement  negotiated between the date of his arrest and the date\r\nof the appellant's trial.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nMaisonet discussed the venture's  prospects with the appellant in\r\n\nthe spring of 1990, but forged no enduring alliance.\r\n\n          That  summer,  the  wind  shifted.   Customs  officials\r\n\ndetained a  conspirator attempting  to carry cocaine  into Puerto\r\n\nRico on a commercial  airline flight, and mechanical difficulties\r\n\nthwarted a  seaborne pickup of  cocaine in St.  Maarten.   As the\r\n\ngang  pondered new  strategies to  transport contraband  from St.\r\n\nMaarten  to Puerto  Rico, Montijo  again floated  the appellant's\r\n\nname.   This  time  the conspirators  approached  him and,  after\r\n\nhaggling over  the prospective  division of spoils,  enlisted his\r\n\nservices.\r\n\n          The appellant  arranged for his  cousin, Hector  Guzman\r\n\nRivera  (Guzman),  to ferry  a  shipment of  contraband  from St.\r\n\nMaarten  to  Puerto Rico.   He  (Laboy)  and Maisonet  planned to\r\n\ntravel  by boat to St.  Maarten to receive  the clandestine cargo\r\n\npreliminary to  its transshipment.   The planning  process proved\r\n\nlong on bravado  and short  on security.   Figueroa attended  the\r\n\npivotal meeting at which  details of the anticipated trip  to and\r\n\nfrom  St. Maarten were reviewed.  At the government's behest, she\r\n\nalso tape-recorded  telephone calls in which  she, the appellant,\r\n\nand other coconspirators freely discussed the pending smuggle.\r\n\n          Fueled by Figueroa's input,  a federal narcotics agent,\r\n\nVictor Ayala,  placed Guzman's boat under  surveillance on August\r\n\n9, 1990.   At around 11:00 a.m. on August  10, Ayala observed the\r\n\nappellant and a  conspirator known  only as  \"Jerry\" lugging  two\r\n\nheavy  suitcases  onto  the boat.    The  men  stayed aboard  for\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\napproximately  ten   minutes  and   then  departed   without  the\r\n\nsuitcases.   Late  that  morning, Guzman  and  Maria Sostre  came\r\n\naboard carrying a blue  rug.  Shortly before noon,  the appellant\r\n\nreappeared, remained aboard  for roughly half  an hour, and  left\r\n\ncarrying a  small  travel bag.    During the  afternoon,  various\r\n\npersons came and went, some bringing provisions.  Near the end of\r\n\nthe  day the local authorities, fearing that the vessel was being\r\n\nreadied  for departure,  boarded her.   They  found seventy-three\r\n\nkilograms  of cocaine concealed in  the ship (under  the blue rug\r\n\nthat Guzman  had brought aboard), and detected  traces of cocaine\r\n\nin  the now-empty  suitcases.   The authorities  also found  four\r\n\nindividuals  aboard the  ship:   Edwin  Burgos, Fabian  Martinez,\r\n\nMaria Sostre, and Miriam Garcia.  They arrested Guzman nearby.\r\n\n          The  appellant  had  flown  to  Puerto  Rico  that  day\r\n\n(sometime after delivering the suitcases) and was arrested there.\r\n\nIndictment,  trial,  conviction, and  sentencing  followed apace.\r\n\nThis appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\r          II.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\r\n\n          The appellant  challenges the sufficiency  of the proof\r\n\nadduced against him  at trial, insisting that  the district court\r\n\nshould have granted his timely motion for judgment  of acquittal.\r\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).  The standard of  appellate review is\r             \r\n\nfamiliar:   like  the  trial court,  the  court of  appeals  must\r\n\ndetermine whether  the evidence  proffered, arrayed in  the light\r\n\nmost favorable to  the prosecution,  enabled a  rational jury  to\r\n\nfind  each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nUnited States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 217 (1st Cir. 1995);  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Olbres, 61  F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116\r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct.  522 (1995).   In  so doing, we  must draw  all reasonable\r\n\nevidentiary inferences  in harmony  with the verdict,  see United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703,  706 (1st Cir. 1994), and resolve\r                           \r\n\nall disagreement  regarding the  credibility of witnesses  to the\r\n\ngovernment's behoof, see  United States v.  Taylor, 54 F.3d  967,\r                                                            \r\n\n974  (1st Cir. 1995).   As long  as the totality  of the evidence\r\n\npresented,  viewed  through  this   glass,  supports  the  jury's\r\n\nverdict, it is legally irrelevant that a different jury,  drawing\r\n\nalternative  inferences, might have  reached a  different result.\r\n\nSee United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                      \r\n\n          The   appellant  tries   to  place   his  insufficiency\r\n\nchallenge into bold relief by emphasizing three points.  None has\r\n\nforce.\r\n\n          1.    The appellant  says  that  the government's  case\r                    1.\r\n\nfalters  because the evidence  at trial did  not precisely define\r\n\nhis \"specific role in the criminal enterprise.\"  To be sure, that\r\n\nsort of definition is helpful in setting sentencing ranges,  see,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., U.S.S.G.   3B1.1, 3B1.2, but to prove a defendant guilty of\r              \r\n\na narcotics-related  conspiracy the  government need not  specify\r\n\nand prove with  particularity the defendant's  exact role in  the\r\n\nscheme.  See, e.g., United States v. Carroll, 871 F.2d 689,  692-\r                                                      \r\n\n93 (7th Cir.  1989).   Put another way,  the government need  not\r\n\nprove  facts  beyond those  that are  necessary to  establish the\r\n\nelements of the crimes  charged, see United States v.  Staula, 80\r                                                                       \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nF.3d 596,  605 (1st  Cir. 1996), and  neither the  elements of  a\r\n\ndrug-conspiracy charge under  21 U.S.C.   846  nor an importation\r\n\ncharge  under 21 U.S.C.   952  include a definitive specification\r\n\nof  the  defendant's role  in the  offense.2   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.  Sepulveda,  15  F.3d  1161,  1173   (1st  Cir.  1993)\r                               \r\n\n(discussing elements of offense  under   846), cert. denied,  114\r                                                                     \r\n\nS.  Ct. 2714  (1994); United States  v. Nueva, 979  F.2d 880, 884\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1992) (discussing  elements of offense  under    952),\r\n\ncert. denied, 507 U.S. 997 (1993).\r                      \r\n\n          2.   The appellant next  decries the fact  that much of\r                    2.\r\n\nthe  evidence against  him  came from  a cooperating  codefendant\r\n\n(Maisonet).     The   appellant   suggests  that   Maisonet   was\r\n\npresumptively untrustworthy because  of his strong  motivation to\r\n\nsay what the government wanted to hear.   This sort of suggestion\r\n\ncan be  molded into a  powerful jury argument  but it has  little\r\n\npotency on appeal.\r\n\n          The persons most knowledgeable about the inner workings\r\n\nof  criminal enterprises  tend  to be  the criminals  themselves.\r\n\nThus,  the government     which has  no choice  but  to take  its\r\n\nwitnesses as  it finds them   often  must rely on blackguards and\r\n\nknaves, whose  testimony is admittedly tinged with self-interest,\r\n\nto prove its allegations.  Such flaws do not render the testimony\r\n\ninadmissible   it would  be a surreal  system of justice if  only\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2To  the extent  that the  appellant claims  the prosecution\r\nmisfired  by failing to show that he possessed some special skill\r\nneeded by  the  conspirators, he  has  again strayed  beyond  the\r\nelements of the offense.  His claim is, therefore, unavailing.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthose who were  without sin  could offer evidence  in a  criminal\r\n\ncase   but a witness' involvement in the crime and his motive for\r\n\nturning on  his erstwhile accomplices  are fair game  for defense\r\n\ncounsel.   The rules thus  permit the witness'  credibility to be\r\n\ntested  in the crucible  of cross-examination.   In this instance\r\n\nthe  appellant vigorously  attacked Maisonet's motives  at trial,\r\n\nand  the resultant credibility choice  was for the  jury, not for\r\n\nthis court.3  See, e.g., O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706.\r                                          \r\n\n          3.      Relatedly,   the  appellant   bewails   certain\r                    3.\r\n\ncontradictions  in  Maisonet's testimony,  concluding  that these\r\n\ncontradictions rendered his testimony inherently unreliable.  The\r\n\nasserted contradictions  are mostly of  peripheral interest;  for\r\n\nexample,  Maisonet  at one  point  suggested  that the  appellant\r\n\ninvited  Guzman to join  the conspiracy, yet  mentioned, on other\r\n\noccasions, that  the conspirators had retained  Guzman's services\r\n\nbefore  the appellant hove into view.4  Court cases, however, are\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3We note that the  trial judge drew the jury's  attention to\r\nthe potential  problems with testimony of  this type, instructing\r\nthe jurors,  inter alia,  that  the testimony  of informants  and\r                                 \r\naccomplices cooperating with the government \"must be examined and\r\nweighed by [you] with greater care and caution than the testimony\r\nof ordinary witnesses.\"\r\n\n     4We say \"asserted contradictions\" because, for  example, the\r\njury could  have found the supposed  contradiction concerning who\r\nfirst hired Guzman to be more apparent than real.   The testimony\r\nrevealed  that, during Guzman's earlier trip, he worked for a few\r\nlow-level conspirators  and had  little contact with  Maisonet or\r\nhis  principal   partner.    When  Maisonet   and  the  appellant\r\nthereafter  discussed  ways  of  transporting  the  cocaine,  the\r\nappellant referred to Guzman only as his cousin, and not by name.\r\nThus,  Maisonet could have \"hired\" Guzman through Laboy in a very\r\nreal  sense,  notwithstanding  Guzman's  earlier  brush  with the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nnot choreographed with the precision of a ballet.  Some degree of\r\n\ncontradiction is commonplace and, for the most part, the judicial\r\n\nsystem relies  upon devices  such as the  cross-examiner's vigor,\r\n\nthe  jurors'  common  sense,  and  the  trial  judge's  practiced\r\n\nintuition  to  separate  grain  from  chaff.   Those  checks  and\r\n\nbalances were fully in play here and, on this scumbled record, we\r\n\nthink  that the  jury could  reasonably have  believed Maisonet's\r\n\ntestimony despite the asserted contradictions.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Romero, 32 F.3d  641, 646 (1st  Cir. 1994) (explaining\r                           \r\n\nthat  the court  of  appeals  \"will  not secondguess  the  jury's\r\n\ndecision  to credit testimony  which contains an inconsistency\");\r\n\nsee  also United States  v. Johnson, 55  F.3d 976, 979  (4th Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1995); United States v.  Jackson, 959 F.2d 81, 82-83  (8th Cir.),\r                                          \r\n\ncert. denied, 506 U.S. 852 (1992).\r                      \r\n\n          We  add   an  eschatocol  of  sorts.     Rejecting  the\r\n\nappellant's insufficiency  challenge comes  more readily  in this\r\n\ncase because  the  evidence  against  him  went  far  beyond  the\r\n\nfingerpointing of  a turncoat.   Figueroa's testimony  was little\r\n\nshort of damning, and, moreover, the jury heard the tape-recorded\r\n\nconversations  in  which the  appellant  and  others spelled  out\r\n\naspects  of  the  scheme.   Appellant  himself  made  inculpatory\r\n\nstatements when arrested.   Then, too,  Agent Ayala observed  the\r\n\nappellant  delivering suitcases  later  found  to have  contained\r\n\ncocaine.   In  similar situations,  where the  government offered\r\n\ncircumstantial  evidence of  defendants'  participation  in  drug\r\n\ncrimes,  combined with trace  elements of drugs  found in objects\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ncarried by those defendants, our sister circuits have had  little\r\n\ndifficulty  in  sustaining   convictions  against   insufficiency\r\n\nchallenges.   See,  e.g.,  United States  v. Rodriguez,  993 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1170,  1175-76 (5th  Cir. 1993),  cert. denied,  114 S.

So it is here.\r\n\nIII.  LIMITATION OF CROSS-EXAMINATION\r          III.  LIMITATION OF CROSS-EXAMINATION\r\n\n          The appellant  complains that the district  court erred\r\n\nin circumscribing his cross-examination  of a government witness.\r\n\nUnder the  Confrontation Clause,  every criminal defendant  has a\r\n\nright  \"to be confronted with  the witnesses against  him.\"  U.S.\r\n\nConst. amend. VI.  This protection \"means more than being allowed\r\n\nto confront the witness  physically.\"  Davis v. Alaska,  415 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n308, 315 (1974).  Rather, its primary purpose is to ensure that a\r\n\ndefendant has a fair opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nDelaware  v.

In defining  the scope of this guarantee,  the Court\r\n\nhas  \"recognized that  the exposure of  a witness'  motivation in\r\n\ntestifying   is  a   proper   and  important   function  of   the\r\n\nconstitutionally protected  right of cross-examination.\"   Davis,\r                                                                          \r\n\n415 U.S. at 316-17.\r\n\n          While the right to  test witnesses by cross-examination\r\n\nis fundamental, it is not unbridled.  See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  254; United States  v.

Fensterer, 474 U.S.  15, 20  (1984)\r                                                 \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n(per  curiam)  (explaining   that  \"[t]he  Confrontation   Clause\r\n\nguarantees  an opportunity  for effective  cross-examination, not\r                                    \r\n\ncross-examination  that  is effective  in  whatever  way, and  to\r\n\nwhatever extent, the defense might wish\") (emphasis in original).\r\n\nWhen  a witness'  credibility is  in issue,  the trial  court may\r\n\nimpose limits  on cross-examination as  long as the  court grants\r\n\nthe  defendant  sufficient  leeway  to  establish  \"a  reasonably\r\n\ncomplete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation.\"\r\n\nBoylan,  898  F.2d at  254.   If  the  trial  court imposes  such\r                \r\n\nlimitations  and  the  defendant  thereafter challenges  them  on\r\n\nappeal, we review  the record  de novo to  ascertain whether  the\r\n\ncourt, overall, gave the defendant a reasonable chance to develop\r\n\nthe whole picture.  See United States v. Nelson, 39 F.3d 705, 708\r                                                         \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1994).   If we find that the core concerns of the Sixth\r\n\nAmendment  have been  satisfied, we  \"will grant relief  from the\r\n\nshackling  of  cross-examination  only   for  manifest  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.\"  Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.\r                              \r\n\n          In   this  case,  the   appellant  cites  two  specific\r\n\ninstances in which the trial court cut off cross-examination, and\r\n\navers  that these  rulings are  insupportable.   We examine  each\r\n\ninstance.\r\n\n          1.  In the first iteration, the district judge directed\r                    1.\r\n\ndefense  counsel  to  pursue  new avenues  of  examination  after\r\n\ncounsel  queried Maisonet as to  the chronology of  events in St.\r\n\nMaarten on  the day the  drugs were seized.   But this was  not a\r\n\npathbreaking  expedition;  counsel  had  thrice   previously  led\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nMaisonet  down  the  same  road  and  Maisonet  had  consistently\r\n\nanswered that he returned to Puerto Rico that morning but that he\r\n\ncould  not remember the precise time.   Cross-examiners should be\r\n\ngiven reasonable latitude, especially in criminal cases, but they\r\n\nare not  at  liberty endlessly  to repastinate  the same  terrain\r\n\n(whether or not they are satisfied with the answers elicited from\r\n\na  particular witness).  In this instance we discern no prejudice\r\n\nin the district court's refusal to let counsel go to the well for\r\n\nwhat would have amounted  to a fourth time, and,  accordingly, we\r\n\ndetect  no  hint  of  either  constitutional  error  or  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.  See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254-55; Chaudhry, 850\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 856.\r\n\n          2.    In  the  second  iteration,  the  district  court\r                    2.\r\n\nprevented  defense counsel  from questioning  Maisonet  in detail\r\n\nregarding the terms and conditions of his plea agreement with the\r\n\ngovernment.     The  appellant  protests  that   this  limitation\r\n\nprevented his counsel from fully impeaching Maisonet's veracity.\r\n\n          The record  belies  the appellant's  protest.   Defense\r\n\ncounsel thoroughly  examined Maisonet anent  the charges  brought\r\n\nagainst him and the benefits that he expected to derive  from his\r\n\nplea  agreement.    Most  importantly,  the  court  admitted  the\r\n\nagreement  itself   into  evidence,  and  defense   counsel  made\r\n\nprofitable use of it.   No more was exigible.  See  United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT\r\n\n          The appellant calumnizes several statements made during\r\n\nthe  government's  closing argument.    He  maintains that  these\r\n\nimproper statements  tainted his  trial and,  concomitantly, that\r\n\nthe lower court improvidently denied his motions for mistrial.\r\n\n          In regard to  the first two statements  attacked by the\r\n\nappellant,  we conduct our review of the trial court's rulings de\r\n\nnovo and will  set aside the  verdict only if  we find that  \"the\r\n\nprosecutor's  remarks  were  both  inappropriate   and  harmful.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 771 (1st Cir. 1996); accord\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States  v.

Challenged  statements are  considered harmful  when,\r\n\nevaluated  in  the  totality  of the  circumstances,  they  would\r\n\nprobably have affected the outcome of the trial.  See  Wihbey, 75\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 771.  In assessing  harm, courts frequently look to  such\r\n\nfactors  as the severity of  the purported misconduct, the weight\r\n\nof the evidence supporting the  verdict, the presence and  likely\r\n\neffect of a curative instruction, and the prosecutor's purpose in\r\n\nmaking the statement (i.e.:  whether the statement was willful or\r\n\ninadvertent).  See  id. at  772; Sepulveda, 15  F.3d at  1187-88;\r                                                    \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nUnited States v.

The  appellant's  first  complaint  is  with  the\r                    1.\r\n\nprosecutor's  statement that  \"in the  case at  bar, there  is no\r\n\ndoubt  and  I  believe my  Brother  Counsel  would  agree that  a\r\n\nconspiracy existed.\"  When the  statement was made, the appellant\r\n\nobjected  and  the district  court  interrupted  the prosecutor's\r\n\nsummation with  an admonition to  the jury that  \"[t]he objection\r\n\nwas  sustained so  the statement  is stricken  and should  not be\r\n\ntaken in consideration by  you.\"  We have consistently  held that\r\n\nan  immediate  curative  instruction dilutes  (and  usually fully\r\n\ndissipates) the  potential prejudice from an  improper statement.\r\n\nSee, e.g., United States  v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993,  998 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1995); Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185.\r                               \r\n\n          Viewing  this statement in  context, see  Sepulveda, 15\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at  1187, we see no  reason why the usual  praxis should not\r\n\napply.   The appellant's theory of the  case, as expressed in his\r\n\nopening  statement, was that he  was \"not part  of [the] criminal\r\n\norganization.\"   By like token, defense  counsel acknowledged the\r\n\nconspiracy  and referred to  it in  summation as  an \"orchestra,\"\r\n\nconducted by Maisonet and others, in which appellant did not even\r\n\nplay second fiddle.   Given the appellant's stated theory  of the\r\n\ncase, the prosecutor's remark cannot easily be labelled as either\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n\"inappropriate\"  or \"harmful.\"   And,  moreover, the  lower court\r\n\ncured any  reasonable possibility of prejudice  when it sustained\r\n\nthe appellant's contemporaneous objection and instructed the jury\r\n\nto ignore the offending statement.  See, e.g., id. at 1185.\r                                                            \r\n\n          2.  At trial, Figueroa stated that she left Puerto Rico\r                    2.\r\n\nfor  Milwaukee \"because [she] found  out that on  August 10th the\r\n\ncrew  and  the  boat  had been  arrested  in  St.  Maarten.\"   In\r\n\nsummation,  the  prosecutor  put   a  twist  on  this  testimony,\r\n\nsuggesting  that  Figueroa,  after betraying  the  conspiracy  by\r\n\ngiving information to Agent Ayala, fled to Milwaukee \"to  protect\r\n\nherself.\"   The  appellant objected,  arguing that  the statement\r\n\nimplied  that Figueroa  feared that  those conspirators  still at\r\n\nlarge (or their cohorts) might attempt to do her harm.  The trial\r\n\ncourt  sustained the objection  and cautioned  the jury  that the\r\n\n\"statement   is  stricken   and  you   should  not  take   it  in\r\n\nconsideration   for  anything   in   this  case.\"     The   court\r\n\nsimultaneously denied the appellant's motion for a mistrial.\r\n\n          Viewed in light  of the copious evidence  of guilt that\r\n\npermeates  the record,  we cannot say  that this  remark warrants\r\n\nreversal.   Though the  prosecutor's statement was  untoward, its\r\n\nimpact  could  not  have been  great.    The  phrase \"to  protect\r\n\nherself\"  is inherently  ambiguous, and  there was  no intimation\r\n\nthat  the witness feared that  the defendant might  try to injure\r\n\nher.5    We  think that,  on  balance,  the  objectionable phrase\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5On appeal, Laboy attempts  to link the prosecutor's comment\r\nwith Maisonet's  testimony  that he  was  attacked at  one  point\r\nbecause  he was  suspected of  being an  informant.  There  is no\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nrepresents no more  than an isolated  comment, unlikely to  smear\r\n\nthe  appellant with facts not  in evidence, and  that the judge's\r\n\ncurative  instruction  sufficed  to  quell  any  prejudice.    We\r\n\ntherefore reject the appellant's  plaint that the wayward comment\r\n\nrequires us to set aside  his conviction.  On the same  basis, we\r\n\nlikewise  reject his  plaint  that the  district  court erred  in\r\n\nfailing to grant his motion for a mistrial.  See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st  Cir. 1994) (explaining that \"it is\r                \r\n\nonly  rarely      and  in extremely  compelling circumstances    \r\n\nthat  an appellate panel, informed by a cold record, will venture\r\n\nto  reverse  a  trial   judge's  on-the-spot  decision  that  the\r\n\ninterests of justice do not require aborting an  ongoing trial\"),\r\n\ncert. denied, 115 S.

The\r\n\nappellant's  point is  that  the  prosecutor  impermissibly  drew\r\n\nattention  to the  appellant's silence.6   See  United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nbasis either in the  record or in the prosecutor's  summation for\r\nforging such a link.\r\n\n     6We quote below the criticized remarks in their entirety:\r\n\n               \"He   told  you   also  about   the  two\r\n          reputation witnesses and that  I asked him an\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nLilly, 983 F.2d 300, 306-07 (1st Cir. 1992) (reaffirming that the\r               \r\n\nFifth Amendment  prohibits a prosecutor, directly  or indirectly,\r\n\nfrom  asking the  jury  to  draw  a  negative  inference  from  a\r\n\ndefendant's silence).  \r\n\n          These statements  did  not transgress  the  appellant's\r\n\nFifth  Amendment  rights.7   When  a  defendant  suggests  that a\r\n\nprosecutor  adverted   to  his  silence,  we   must  examine  the\r\n\nchallenged statement in context.

In point of fact, no contemporaneous objection was\r\nraised.   However, the appellant  advanced an  objection to  this\r\nline  of argument  at the  end of  the prosecutor's  rebuttal and\r\nsimultaneously moved for a mistrial.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nmeaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will\r\n\ndraw   that  meaning   from   the  plethora   of  less   damaging\r\n\ninterpretations.\"   Donnelly v.

The fairest characterization of\r\n\nthe   prosecutor's  argument      indeed,   the   only  plausible\r\n\ncharacterization    is as  an attempt to  accentuate the  general\r\n\nlack of testimony supporting the  appellant's position.  No fewer\r\n\nthan six individuals,  not including the  appellant, were on  the\r\n\nvessel on August  10, so the prosecutor's  allusion logically and\r\n\nnaturally  referred to  this  cadre of  individuals,  not to  the\r\n\nappellant himself.  See, e.g., Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187; United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

And  in  all  events,  the district  court's\r\n\nforceful  instructions regarding  the  appellant's  right not  to\r\n\ntestify resolved any conceivable ambiguity.8\r\n\nV.  USE OF SELF-INCRIMINATING STATEMENTS\r          V.  USE OF SELF-INCRIMINATING STATEMENTS\r\n\n          The  appellant complains  that  he was  not  adequately\r\n\nadvised of his  rights when  arrested, and that  the court  below\r\n\nshould  have  prohibited  the  government  from  introducing  the\r\n\nstatements  that he made into  evidence.  This  argument need not\r\n\ndetain  us.    The  appellant  neither  moved   to  suppress  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Since  we  find that  the  prosecutor's  statement did  not\r\nprejudicially  highlight the appellant's  failure to  testify, we\r\nfind no abuse of discretion in the district judge's denial of the\r\nconcomitant motion for a  mistrial.  See Pierro, 32  F.3d at 617;\r                                                         \r\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185.\r                   \r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nstatements nor objected to their introduction at trial.  At best,\r\n\nthen, the  standard of  review is  for plain  error.  See  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Olano,  507 U.S.  725, 730  (1993).   The plain  error\r                          \r\n\nhurdle is high:   the appellant  must show (1)  an error, id.  at\r                                                                       \r\n\n732, that (2)  is \"obvious\" or \"clear under current  law,\" id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n734, and that (3) \"affect[ed] substantial rights.\"  Fed. R. Crim.\r\n\nP. 52(b).9\r\n\n          In  this   instance  there  was  no   error,  plain  or\r\n\notherwise.  Agent Ayala testified without contradiction that both\r\n\nhe and his deputy advised the appellant of his rights before they\r\n\ninitiated any interrogation.   Thus, the court below had  a solid\r\n\nfoundation  on  which  to  rest  the  admission  of the  disputed\r\n\nevidence.\r\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r          VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need go no further.   From aught  that appears, the\r\n\nappellant was  fairly tried and justly  convicted.  Consequently,\r\n\nthe judgment of the district court must be \r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9Even if  these elements are  present, the court  of appeals\r\nretains  discretion to decide whether  to take notice  of a plain\r\nerror.  See Olano, 507 U.S. at 736.   We are inclined to exercise\r                           \r\nthat discretion sparingly, generally  limiting it to instances in\r\nwhich the error, if uncorrected, would result in a miscarriage of\r\njustice  or,  put  another  way, would  \"skew[]  the  fundamental\r\nfairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in some major\r\nrespect.\"  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 973.\r                           \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n",

Following Laboy's conviction on all counts and the district court's imposition of a 211-month incarcerative sentence, Laboy prosecuted this appeal.   He finds no safe harbor.   Determining, as we do, that his assignments of error lack merit, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We elucidate the facts gleaned at trial in the light most flattering to the jury's verdict.   See United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 233 (1st Cir.1995).   We note at the outset that many of the pivotal facts come from testimony of Sonia Figueroa Sanchez (Figueroa), the former wife of a quondam conspirator, Zebedo Maisonet Gonzalez (Maisonet), and from Maisonet himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990, certain individuals, Maisonet included, hatched a plan to import cocaine from Colombia to Puerto Rico by way of St. Maarten.   Maisonet testified that a fellow rogue, Papo Montijo, sponsored the appellant for membership in the cabal.   Maisonet discussed the venture's prospects with the appellant in the spring of 1990, but forged no enduring alliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That summer, the wind shifted.   Customs officials detained a conspirator attempting to carry cocaine into Puerto Rico on a commercial airline flight, and mechanical difficulties thwarted a seaborne pickup of cocaine in St. Maarten.   As the gang pondered new strategies to transport contraband from St. Maarten to Puerto Rico, Montijo again floated the appellant's name.   This time the conspirators approached him and, after haggling over the prospective division of spoils, enlisted his services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant arranged for his cousin, Hector Guzman Rivera (Guzman), to ferry a shipment of contraband from St. Maarten to Puerto Rico.  He (Laboy) and Maisonet planned to travel by boat to St. Maarten to receive the clandestine cargo preliminary to its transshipment.   The planning process proved long on bravado and short on security.   Figueroa attended the pivotal meeting at which details of the anticipated trip to and from St. Maarten were reviewed.   At the government's behest, she also tape-recorded telephone calls in which she, the appellant, and other coconspirators freely discussed the pending smuggle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fueled by Figueroa's input, a federal narcotics agent, Victor Ayala, placed Guzman's boat under surveillance on August 9, 1990.   At around 11:00 a.m.   on August 10, Ayala observed the appellant and a conspirator known only as \"Jerry\" lugging two heavy suitcases onto the boat.   The men stayed aboard for approximately ten minutes and then departed without the suitcases.   Late that morning, Guzman and Maria Sostre came aboard carrying a blue rug.   Shortly before noon, the appellant reappeared, remained aboard for roughly half an hour, and left carrying a small travel bag.   During the afternoon, various persons came and went, some bringing provisions.   Near the end of the day the local authorities, fearing that the vessel was being readied for departure, boarded her.   They found seventy-three kilograms of cocaine concealed in the ship (under the blue rug that Guzman had brought aboard), and detected traces of cocaine in the now-empty suitcases.   The authorities also found four individuals aboard the ship:  Edwin Burgos, Fabian Martinez, Maria Sostre, and Miriam Garcia.   They arrested Guzman nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant had flown to Puerto Rico that day (sometime after delivering the suitcases) and was arrested there.   Indictment, trial, conviction, and sentencing followed apace.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant challenges the sufficiency of the proof adduced against him at trial, insisting that the district court should have granted his timely motion for judgment of acquittal.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).   The standard of appellate review is familiar:  like the trial court, the court of appeals must determine whether the evidence proffered, arrayed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, enabled a rational jury to find each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.   See United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 217 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 522, 133 L.Ed.2d 430 (1995).   In so doing, we must draw all reasonable evidentiary inferences in harmony with the verdict, see United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994), and resolve all disagreement regarding the credibility of witnesses to the government's behoof, see United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir.1995).   As long as the totality of the evidence presented, viewed through this glass, supports the jury's verdict, it is legally irrelevant that a different jury, drawing alternative inferences, might have reached a different result.   See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tries to place his insufficiency challenge into bold relief by emphasizing three points.   None has force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The appellant says that the government's case falters because the evidence at trial did not precisely define his \"specific role in the criminal enterprise.\"   To be sure, that sort of definition is helpful in setting sentencing ranges, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 3B1.1, 3B1.2, but to prove a defendant guilty of a narcotics-related conspiracy the government need not specify and prove with particularity the defendant's exact role in the scheme.   See, e.g., United States v. Carroll, 871 F.2d 689, 692-93 (7th Cir.1989).   Put another way, the government need not prove facts beyond those that are necessary to establish the elements of the crimes charged, see United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 605 (1st Cir.1996), and neither the elements of a drug-conspiracy charge under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 nor an importation charge under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 952 include a definitive specification of the defendant's role in the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing elements of offense under &#167; 846), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994);  United States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880, 884 (1st Cir.1992) (discussing elements of offense under &#167; 952), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 997, 113 S.Ct. 1615, 123 L.Ed.2d 175 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The appellant next decries the fact that much of the evidence against him came from a cooperating codefendant (Maisonet).   The appellant suggests that Maisonet was presumptively untrustworthy because of his strong motivation to say what the government wanted to hear.   This sort of suggestion can be molded into a powerful jury argument but it has little potency on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The persons most knowledgeable about the inner workings of criminal enterprises tend to be the criminals themselves.   Thus, the government--which has no choice but to take its witnesses as it finds them--often must rely on blackguards and knaves, whose testimony is admittedly tinged with self-interest, to prove its allegations.   Such flaws do not render the testimony inadmissible--it would be a surreal system of justice if only those who were without sin could offer evidence in a criminal case--but a witness' involvement in the crime and his motive for turning on his erstwhile accomplices are fair game for defense counsel.   The rules thus permit the witness' credibility to be tested in the crucible of cross-examination.   In this instance the appellant vigorously attacked Maisonet's motives at trial, and the resultant credibility choice was for the jury, not for this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See, e.g., O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Relatedly, the appellant bewails certain contradictions in Maisonet's testimony, concluding that these contradictions rendered his testimony inherently unreliable.   The asserted contradictions are mostly of peripheral interest;  for example, Maisonet at one point suggested that the appellant invited Guzman to join the conspiracy, yet mentioned, on other occasions, that the conspirators had retained Guzman's services before the appellant hove into view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Court cases, however, are not choreographed with the precision of a ballet.   Some degree of contradiction is commonplace and, for the most part, the judicial system relies upon devices such as the cross-examiner's vigor, the jurors' common sense, and the trial judge's practiced intuition to separate grain from chaff.   Those checks and balances were fully in play here and, on this scumbled record, we think that the jury could reasonably have believed Maisonet's testimony despite the asserted contradictions.   See, e.g., United States v. Romero, 32 F.3d 641, 646 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that the court of appeals \"will not secondguess the jury's decision to credit testimony which contains an inconsistency\");  see also United States v. Johnson, 55 F.3d 976, 979 (4th Cir.1995);  United States v. Jackson, 959 F.2d 81, 82-83 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 852, 113 S.Ct. 155, 121 L.Ed.2d 105 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add an eschatocol of sorts.   Rejecting the appellant's insufficiency challenge comes more readily in this case because the evidence against him went far beyond the fingerpointing of a turncoat.   Figueroa's testimony was little short of damning, and, moreover, the jury heard the tape-recorded conversations in which the appellant and others spelled out aspects of the scheme.   Appellant himself made inculpatory statements when arrested.   Then, too, Agent Ayala observed the appellant delivering suitcases later found to have contained cocaine.   In similar situations, where the government offered circumstantial evidence of defendants' participation in drug crimes, combined with trace elements of drugs found in objects carried by those defendants, our sister circuits have had little difficulty in sustaining convictions against insufficiency challenges.   See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez, 993 F.2d 1170, 1175-76 (5th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1547, 128 L.Ed.2d 197 (1994);  United States v. Arango, 853 F.2d 818, 826 (11th Cir.1988).   So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. LIMITATION OF CROSS-EXAMINATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant complains that the district court erred in circumscribing his cross-examination of a government witness.   Under the Confrontation Clause, every criminal defendant has a right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\"   U.S. Const. amend.   VI. This protection \"means more than being allowed to confront the witness physically.\"  Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974).   Rather, its primary purpose is to ensure that a defendant has a fair opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.   See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1434, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986);  United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 849, 111 S.Ct. 139, 112 L.Ed.2d 106 (1990).   In defining the scope of this guarantee, the Court has \"recognized that the exposure of a witness' motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\"  Davis, 415 U.S. at 316-17, 94 S.Ct. at 1110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the right to test witnesses by cross-examination is fundamental, it is not unbridled.   See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254;  United States v. Chaudhry, 850 F.2d 851, 856 (1st Cir.1988);  see also Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 294, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985) (per curiam) (explaining that \"[t]he Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish\") (emphasis in original).   When a witness' credibility is in issue, the trial court may impose limits on cross-examination as long as the court grants the defendant sufficient leeway to establish \"a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation.\"  Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.   If the trial court imposes such limitations and the defendant thereafter challenges them on appeal, we review the record de novo to ascertain whether the court, overall, gave the defendant a reasonable chance to develop the whole picture.   See United States v. Nelson, 39 F.3d 705, 708 (7th Cir.1994).   If we find that the core concerns of the Sixth Amendment have been satisfied, we \"will grant relief from the shackling of cross-examination only for manifest abuse of discretion.\"  Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the appellant cites two specific instances in which the trial court cut off cross-examination, and avers that these rulings are insupportable.   We examine each instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. In the first iteration, the district judge directed defense counsel to pursue new avenues of examination after counsel queried Maisonet as to the chronology of events in St. Maarten on the day the drugs were seized.   But this was not a pathbreaking expedition;  counsel had thrice previously led Maisonet down the same road and Maisonet had consistently answered that he returned to Puerto Rico that morning but that he could not remember the precise time.   Cross-examiners should be given reasonable latitude, especially in criminal cases, but they are not at liberty endlessly to repastinate the same terrain (whether or not they are satisfied with the answers elicited from a particular witness).   In this instance we discern no prejudice in the district court's refusal to let counsel go to the well for what would have amounted to a fourth time, and, accordingly, we detect no hint of either constitutional error or abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254-55;  Chaudhry, 850 F.2d at 856.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In the second iteration, the district court prevented defense counsel from questioning Maisonet in detail regarding the terms and conditions of his plea agreement with the government.   The appellant protests that this limitation prevented his counsel from fully impeaching Maisonet's veracity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record belies the appellant's protest.   Defense counsel thoroughly examined Maisonet anent the charges brought against him and the benefits that he expected to derive from his plea agreement.   Most importantly, the court admitted the agreement itself into evidence, and defense counsel made profitable use of it.   No more was exigible.   See United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 219 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that, where cross examination informed the jury of the benefit a witness garnered from a plea agreement, the district court could properly limit further cross-examination on the subject), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 891 (1995);  United States v. Maceo, 947 F.2d 1191, 1200 (5th Cir.1991) (similar), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 949, 112 S.Ct. 1510, 117 L.Ed.2d 647 (1992);  United States v. Twomey, 806 F.2d 1136, 1139-40 (1st Cir.1986) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant calumnizes several statements made during the government's closing argument.   He maintains that these improper statements tainted his trial and, concomitantly, that the lower court improvidently denied his motions for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the first two statements attacked by the appellant, we conduct our review of the trial court's rulings de novo and will set aside the verdict only if we find that \"the prosecutor's remarks were both inappropriate and harmful.\"  United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 771 (1st Cir.1996);  accord United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67 F.3d 1002, 1008 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1558, 134 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996).   Challenged statements are considered harmful when, evaluated in the totality of the circumstances, they would probably have affected the outcome of the trial.   See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 771.   In assessing harm, courts frequently look to such factors as the severity of the purported misconduct, the weight of the evidence supporting the verdict, the presence and likely effect of a curative instruction, and the prosecutor's purpose in making the statement (i.e.:  whether the statement was willful or inadvertent).   See id. at 772;  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187-88;  United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.1987).   Above all, courts must refrain from examining challenged statements in a vacuum, but, rather, must look to context for assistance in determining both their meaning and their effect.   See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The appellant's first complaint is with the prosecutor's statement that \"in the case at bar, there is no doubt and I believe my Brother Counsel would agree that a conspiracy existed.\"   When the statement was made, the appellant objected and the district court interrupted the prosecutor's summation with an admonition to the jury that \"[t]he objection was sustained so the statement is stricken and should not be taken in consideration by you.\"   We have consistently held that an immediate curative instruction dilutes (and usually fully dissipates) the potential prejudice from an improper statement.   See, e.g., United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 998 (1st Cir.1995);  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing this statement in context, see Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187, we see no reason why the usual praxis should not apply.   The appellant's theory of the case, as expressed in his opening statement, was that he was \"not part of [the] criminal organization.\"   By like token, defense counsel acknowledged the conspiracy and referred to it in summation as an \"orchestra,\" conducted by Maisonet and others, in which appellant did not even play second fiddle.   Given the appellant's stated theory of the case, the prosecutor's remark cannot easily be labelled as either \"inappropriate\" or \"harmful.\"   And, moreover, the lower court cured any reasonable possibility of prejudice when it sustained the appellant's contemporaneous objection and instructed the jury to ignore the offending statement.   See, e.g., id. at 1185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. At trial, Figueroa stated that she left Puerto Rico for Milwaukee \"because [she] found out that on August 10th the crew and the boat had been arrested in St. Maarten.\"   In summation, the prosecutor put a twist on this testimony, suggesting that Figueroa, after betraying the conspiracy by giving information to Agent Ayala, fled to Milwaukee \"to protect herself.\"   The appellant objected, arguing that the statement implied that Figueroa feared that those conspirators still at large (or their cohorts) might attempt to do her harm.   The trial court sustained the objection and cautioned the jury that the \"statement is stricken and you should not take it in consideration for anything in this case.\"   The court simultaneously denied the appellant's motion for a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in light of the copious evidence of guilt that permeates the record, we cannot say that this remark warrants reversal.   Though the prosecutor's statement was untoward, its impact could not have been great.   The phrase \"to protect herself\" is inherently ambiguous, and there was no intimation that the witness feared that the defendant might try to injure her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We think that, on balance, the objectionable phrase represents no more than an isolated comment, unlikely to smear the appellant with facts not in evidence, and that the judge's curative instruction sufficed to quell any prejudice.   We therefore reject the appellant's plaint that the wayward comment requires us to set aside his conviction.   On the same basis, we likewise reject his plaint that the district court erred in failing to grant his motion for a mistrial.   See United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that \"it is only rarely--and in extremely compelling circumstances--that an appellate panel, informed by a cold record, will venture to reverse a trial judge's on-the-spot decision that the interests of justice do not require aborting an ongoing trial\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 919, 130 L.Ed.2d 799 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The appellant also criticizes the prosecutor's underscoring of the paucity of evidence supporting the appellant's theory of the case.   He objects particularly to the prosecutor pointing out that his character witnesses were not present in St. Maarten on the day of the denouement, and inviting the production of a percipient witness who could offer an alternative explanation of the events of August 10.   The appellant's point is that the prosecutor impermissibly drew attention to the appellant's silence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 306-07 (1st Cir.1992) (reaffirming that the Fifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor, directly or indirectly, from asking the jury to draw a negative inference from a defendant's silence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements did not transgress the appellant's Fifth Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  When a defendant suggests that a prosecutor adverted to his silence, we must examine the challenged statement in context.   See id. at 307.   The key to our inquiry is \"whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\"  Id. (citations omitted).   We will not \"lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\"  Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles, we are satisfied that the comments did not cross the line.   The fairest characterization of the prosecutor's argument--indeed, the only plausible characterization--is as an attempt to accentuate the general lack of testimony supporting the appellant's position.   No fewer than six individuals, not including the appellant, were on the vessel on August 10, so the prosecutor's allusion logically and naturally referred to this cadre of individuals, not to the appellant himself.   See, e.g., Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187;  United States v. Collatos, 798 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 993, 107 S.Ct. 594, 93 L.Ed.2d 595 (1986).   And in all events, the district court's forceful instructions regarding the appellant's right not to testify resolved any conceivable ambiguity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. USE OF SELF-INCRIMINATING STATEMENTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant complains that he was not adequately advised of his rights when arrested, and that the court below should have prohibited the government from introducing the statements that he made into evidence.   This argument need not detain us.   The appellant neither moved to suppress the statements nor objected to their introduction at trial.   At best, then, the standard of review is for plain error.   See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 730, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1775, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).   The plain error hurdle is high:  the appellant must show (1) an error, id. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776, that (2) is \"obvious\" or \"clear under current law,\" id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777, and that (3) \"affect[ed] substantial rights.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance there was no error, plain or otherwise.   Agent Ayala testified without contradiction that both he and his deputy advised the appellant of his rights before they initiated any interrogation.   Thus, the court below had a solid foundation on which to rest the admission of the disputed evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   From aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried and justly convicted.   Consequently, the judgment of the district court must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Figueroa began cooperating with the authorities during the investigation.   Maisonet joined her in a duet as part of a plea agreement negotiated between the date of his arrest and the date of the appellant's trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the appellant claims the prosecution misfired by failing to show that he possessed some special skill needed by the conspirators, he has again strayed beyond the elements of the offense.   His claim is, therefore, unavailing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that the trial judge drew the jury's attention to the potential problems with testimony of this type, instructing the jurors, inter alia, that the testimony of informants and accomplices cooperating with the government \"must be examined and weighed by [you] with greater care and caution than the testimony of ordinary witnesses.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We say \"asserted contradictions\" because, for example, the jury could have found the supposed contradiction concerning who first hired Guzman to be more apparent than real.   The testimony revealed that, during Guzman's earlier trip, he worked for a few low-level conspirators and had little contact with Maisonet or his principal partner.   When Maisonet and the appellant thereafter discussed ways of transporting the cocaine, the appellant referred to Guzman only as his cousin, and not by name.   Thus, Maisonet could have \"hired\" Guzman through Laboy in a very real sense, notwithstanding Guzman's earlier brush with the enterprise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> On appeal, Laboy attempts to link the prosecutor's comment with Maisonet's testimony that he was attacked at one point because he was suspected of being an informant.   There is no basis either in the record or in the prosecutor's summation for forging such a link</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We quote below the criticized remarks in their entirety:</p>\n        <p>\"He told you also about the two reputation witnesses and that I asked him an unfair question.   Those aren't unfair questions.   I asked him, \"Were you there\".   He wasn't there so he can't tell us anything.   You see, the issue is what happened that day and they are bringing witnesses to tell you about other things.   Well, bring me a witness to tell me what happened there.</p>\n        <p>What is a reputation witness going to say, He is a good friend.   The person that says he was like my brother and that man that came here is a very good man and so is the other one but see, he didn't know what Juan Laboy Delgado was doing in August of 1990 in St. Maarten because he was not there so he can't testify as to that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In undertaking this analysis we assume arguendo, but do not decide, that the appellant lodged a timely objection to this line of argument.   In point of fact, no contemporaneous objection was raised.   However, the appellant advanced an objection to this line of argument at the end of the prosecutor's rebuttal and simultaneously moved for a mistrial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Since we find that the prosecutor's statement did not prejudicially highlight the appellant's failure to testify, we find no abuse of discretion in the district judge's denial of the concomitant motion for a mistrial.

See Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1778.   We are inclined to exercise that discretion sparingly, generally limiting it to instances in which the error, if uncorrected, would result in a miscarriage of justice or, put another way, would \"skew[ ] the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in some major respect.\"  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 973</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Following Laboy's conviction on all counts and the district court's imposition of a 211-month incarcerative sentence, Laboy prosecuted this appeal.   He finds no safe harbor.   Determining, as we do, that his assignments of error lack merit, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We elucidate the facts gleaned at trial in the light most flattering to the jury's verdict.   See United States v. Spinney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 233 (1st Cir.1995).   We note at the outset that many of the pivotal facts come from testimony of Sonia Figueroa Sanchez (Figueroa), the former wife of a quondam conspirator, Zebedo Maisonet Gonzalez (Maisonet), and from Maisonet himself.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990, certain individuals, Maisonet included, hatched a plan to import cocaine from Colombia to Puerto Rico by way of St. Maarten.   Maisonet testified that a fellow rogue, Papo Montijo, sponsored the appellant for membership in the cabal.   Maisonet discussed the venture's prospects with the appellant in the spring of 1990, but forged no enduring alliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That summer, the wind shifted.   Customs officials detained a conspirator attempting to carry cocaine into Puerto Rico on a commercial airline flight, and mechanical difficulties thwarted a seaborne pickup of cocaine in St. Maarten.   As the gang pondered new strategies to transport contraband from St. Maarten to Puerto Rico, Montijo again floated the appellant's name.   This time the conspirators approached him and, after haggling over the prospective division of spoils, enlisted his services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant arranged for his cousin, Hector Guzman Rivera (Guzman), to ferry a shipment of contraband from St. Maarten to Puerto Rico.  He (Laboy) and Maisonet planned to travel by boat to St. Maarten to receive the clandestine cargo preliminary to its transshipment.   The planning process proved long on bravado and short on security.   Figueroa attended the pivotal meeting at which details of the anticipated trip to and from St. Maarten were reviewed.   At the government's behest, she also tape-recorded telephone calls in which she, the appellant, and other coconspirators freely discussed the pending smuggle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fueled by Figueroa's input, a federal narcotics agent, Victor Ayala, placed Guzman's boat under surveillance on August 9, 1990.   At around 11:00 a.m.   on August 10, Ayala observed the appellant and a conspirator known only as \"Jerry\" lugging two heavy suitcases onto the boat.   The men stayed aboard for approximately ten minutes and then departed without the suitcases.   Late that morning, Guzman and Maria Sostre came aboard carrying a blue rug.   Shortly before noon, the appellant reappeared, remained aboard for roughly half an hour, and left carrying a small travel bag.   During the afternoon, various persons came and went, some bringing provisions.   Near the end of the day the local authorities, fearing that the vessel was being readied for departure, boarded her.   They found seventy-three kilograms of cocaine concealed in the ship (under the blue rug that Guzman had brought aboard), and detected traces of cocaine in the now-empty suitcases.   The authorities also found four individuals aboard the ship:  Edwin Burgos, Fabian Martinez, Maria Sostre, and Miriam Garcia.   They arrested Guzman nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant had flown to Puerto Rico that day (sometime after delivering the suitcases) and was arrested there.   Indictment, trial, conviction, and sentencing followed apace.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant challenges the sufficiency of the proof adduced against him at trial, insisting that the district court should have granted his timely motion for judgment of acquittal.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).   The standard of appellate review is familiar:  like the trial court, the court of appeals must determine whether the evidence proffered, arrayed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, enabled a rational jury to find each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.   See United States v. Valle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196494\"><a href=\"/opinion/196494/united-states-v-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 217 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span> (1995).   In so doing, we must draw all reasonable evidentiary inferences in harmony with the verdict, see United States v. O'Brien, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661452\"><a href=\"/opinion/661452/43-socsecrepser-489-medicaremedicaid-guide-p-42092-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 706 (1st Cir.1994), and resolve all disagreement regarding the credibility of witnesses to the government's behoof, see United States v.

The appellant says that the government's case falters because the evidence at trial did not precisely define his \"specific role in the criminal enterprise.\"   To be sure, that sort of definition is helpful in setting sentencing ranges, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 3B1.1, 3B1.2, but to prove a defendant guilty of a narcotics-related conspiracy the government need not specify and prove with particularity the defendant's exact role in the scheme.

The appellant next decries the fact that much of the evidence against him came from a cooperating codefendant (Maisonet).   The appellant suggests that Maisonet was presumptively untrustworthy because of his strong motivation to say what the government wanted to hear.   This sort of suggestion can be molded into a powerful jury argument but it has little potency on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The persons most knowledgeable about the inner workings of criminal enterprises tend to be the criminals themselves.   Thus, the government--which has no choice but to take its witnesses as it finds them--often must rely on blackguards and knaves, whose testimony is admittedly tinged with self-interest, to prove its allegations.   Such flaws do not render the testimony inadmissible--it would be a surreal system of justice if only those who were without sin could offer evidence in a criminal case--but a witness' involvement in the crime and his motive for turning on his erstwhile accomplices are fair game for defense counsel.   The rules thus permit the witness' credibility to be tested in the crucible of cross-examination.   In this instance the appellant vigorously attacked Maisonet's motives at trial, and the resultant credibility choice was for the jury, not for this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See, e.g., O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 706.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Relatedly, the appellant bewails certain contradictions in Maisonet's testimony, concluding that these contradictions rendered his testimony inherently unreliable.   The asserted contradictions are mostly of peripheral interest;  for example, Maisonet at one point suggested that the appellant invited Guzman to join the conspiracy, yet mentioned, on other occasions, that the conspirators had retained Guzman's services before the appellant hove into view.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Court cases, however, are not choreographed with the precision of a ballet.   Some degree of contradiction is commonplace and, for the most part, the judicial system relies upon devices such as the cross-examiner's vigor, the jurors' common sense, and the trial judge's practiced intuition to separate grain from chaff.   Those checks and balances were fully in play here and, on this scumbled record, we think that the jury could reasonably have believed Maisonet's testimony despite the asserted contradictions.   See, e.g., United States v. Romero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195567\"><a href=\"/opinion/195567/united-states-v-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 646 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that the court of appeals \"will not secondguess the jury's decision to credit testimony which contains an inconsistency\");  see also United States v.

Rejecting the appellant's insufficiency challenge comes more readily in this case because the evidence against him went far beyond the fingerpointing of a turncoat.   Figueroa's testimony was little short of damning, and, moreover, the jury heard the tape-recorded conversations in which the appellant and others spelled out aspects of the scheme.   Appellant himself made inculpatory statements when arrested.   Then, too, Agent Ayala observed the appellant delivering suitcases later found to have contained cocaine.   In similar situations, where the government offered circumstantial evidence of defendants' participation in drug crimes, combined with trace elements of drugs found in objects carried by those defendants, our sister circuits have had little difficulty in sustaining convictions against insufficiency challenges.

When a witness' credibility is in issue, the trial court may impose limits on cross-examination as long as the court grants the defendant sufficient leeway to establish \"a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation.\"  Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.   If the trial court imposes such limitations and the defendant thereafter challenges them on appeal, we review the record de novo to ascertain whether the court, overall, gave the defendant a reasonable chance to develop the whole picture.   See United States v.

If we find that the core concerns of the Sixth Amendment have been satisfied, we \"will grant relief from the shackling of cross-examination only for manifest abuse of discretion.\"  Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the appellant cites two specific instances in which the trial court cut off cross-examination, and avers that these rulings are insupportable.   We examine each instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. In the first iteration, the district judge directed defense counsel to pursue new avenues of examination after counsel queried Maisonet as to the chronology of events in St. Maarten on the day the drugs were seized.   But this was not a pathbreaking expedition;  counsel had thrice previously led Maisonet down the same road and Maisonet had consistently answered that he returned to Puerto Rico that morning but that he could not remember the precise time.   Cross-examiners should be given reasonable latitude, especially in criminal cases, but they are not at liberty endlessly to repastinate the same terrain (whether or not they are satisfied with the answers elicited from a particular witness).   In this instance we discern no prejudice in the district court's refusal to let counsel go to the well for what would have amounted to a fourth time, and, accordingly, we detect no hint of either constitutional error or abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., Boylan, 898 F.2d at 254-55;  Chaudhry, 850 F.2d at 856.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

Challenged statements are considered harmful when, evaluated in the totality of the circumstances, they would probably have affected the outcome of the trial.   See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 771.   In assessing harm, courts frequently look to such factors as the severity of the purported misconduct, the weight of the evidence supporting the verdict, the presence and likely effect of a curative instruction, and the prosecutor's purpose in making the statement (i.e.:  whether the statement was willful or inadvertent).   See id. at 772;  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187-88;  United States v. Mejia-Lozano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494593\"><a href=\"/opinion/494593/united-states-v-martha-mejia-lozano/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 274 (1st Cir.1987).   Above all, courts must refrain from examining challenged statements in a vacuum, but, rather, must look to context for assistance in determining both their meaning and their effect.   See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The appellant's first complaint is with the prosecutor's statement that \"in the case at bar, there is no doubt and I believe my Brother Counsel would agree that a conspiracy existed.\"   When the statement was made, the appellant objected and the district court interrupted the prosecutor's summation with an admonition to the jury that \"[t]he objection was sustained so the statement is stricken and should not be taken in consideration by you.\"   We have consistently held that an immediate curative instruction dilutes (and usually fully dissipates) the potential prejudice from an improper statement.   See, e.g., United States v. Rivera-Gomez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705988\"><a href=\"/opinion/705988/united-states-v-luis-raul-rivera-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 998 (1st Cir.1995);  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing this statement in context, see Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187, we see no reason why the usual praxis should not apply.   The appellant's theory of the case, as expressed in his opening statement, was that he was \"not part of [the] criminal organization.\"   By like token, defense counsel acknowledged the conspiracy and referred to it in summation as an \"orchestra,\" conducted by Maisonet and others, in which appellant did not even play second fiddle.   Given the appellant's stated theory of the case, the prosecutor's remark cannot easily be labelled as either \"inappropriate\" or \"harmful.\"   And, moreover, the lower court cured any reasonable possibility of prejudice when it sustained the appellant's contemporaneous objection and instructed the jury to ignore the offending statement.   See, e.g., id. at 1185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. At trial, Figueroa stated that she left Puerto Rico for Milwaukee \"because [she] found out that on August 10th the crew and the boat had been arrested in St. Maarten.\"   In summation, the prosecutor put a twist on this testimony, suggesting that Figueroa, after betraying the conspiracy by giving information to Agent Ayala, fled to Milwaukee \"to protect herself.\"   The appellant objected, arguing that the statement implied that Figueroa feared that those conspirators still at large (or their cohorts) might attempt to do her harm.   The trial court sustained the objection and cautioned the jury that the \"statement is stricken and you should not take it in consideration for anything in this case.\"   The court simultaneously denied the appellant's motion for a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in light of the copious evidence of guilt that permeates the record, we cannot say that this remark warrants reversal.   Though the prosecutor's statement was untoward, its impact could not have been great.   The phrase \"to protect herself\" is inherently ambiguous, and there was no intimation that the witness feared that the defendant might try to injure her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We think that, on balance, the objectionable phrase represents no more than an isolated comment, unlikely to smear the appellant with facts not in evidence, and that the judge's curative instruction sufficed to quell any prejudice.   We therefore reject the appellant's plaint that the wayward comment requires us to set aside his conviction.   On the same basis, we likewise reject his plaint that the district court erred in failing to grant his motion for a mistrial.   See United States v. Pierro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 617 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that \"it is only rarely--and in extremely compelling circumstances--that an appellate panel, informed by a cold record, will venture to reverse a trial judge's on-the-spot decision that the interests of justice do not require aborting an ongoing trial\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The appellant also criticizes the prosecutor's underscoring of the paucity of evidence supporting the appellant's theory of the case.   He objects particularly to the prosecutor pointing out that his character witnesses were not present in St. Maarten on the day of the denouement, and inviting the production of a percipient witness who could offer an alternative explanation of the events of August 10.   The appellant's point is that the prosecutor impermissibly drew attention to the appellant's silence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 306-07 (1st Cir.1992) (reaffirming that the Fifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor, directly or indirectly, from asking the jury to draw a negative inference from a defendant's silence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statements did not transgress the appellant's Fifth Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  When a defendant suggests that a prosecutor adverted to his silence, we must examine the challenged statement in context.   See id. at 307.   The key to our inquiry is \"whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\"  Id. (citations omitted).   We will not \"lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\"  Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109024\"><a href=\"/opinion/109024/donnelly-v-dechristoforo/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 647, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109024\"><a href=\"/opinion/109024/donnelly-v-dechristoforo/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The fairest characterization of the prosecutor's argument--indeed, the only plausible characterization--is as an attempt to accentuate the general lack of testimony supporting the appellant's position.   No fewer than six individuals, not including the appellant, were on the vessel on August 10, so the prosecutor's allusion logically and naturally referred to this cadre of individuals, not to the appellant himself.   See, e.g., Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1187;  United States v. Collatos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474548\"><a href=\"/opinion/474548/united-states-v-george-n-collatos/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></span> (1986).   And in all events, the district court's forceful instructions regarding the appellant's right not to testify resolved any conceivable ambiguity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. USE OF SELF-INCRIMINATING STATEMENTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant complains that he was not adequately advised of his rights when arrested, and that the court below should have prohibited the government from introducing the statements that he made into evidence.   This argument need not detain us.   The appellant neither moved to suppress the statements nor objected to their introduction at trial.   At best, then, the standard of review is for plain error.   See United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 730, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>, 1775, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993).   The plain error hurdle is high:  the appellant must show (1) an error, id. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776, that (2) is \"obvious\" or \"clear under current law,\" id. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777, and that (3) \"affect[ed] substantial rights.\"   Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance there was no error, plain or otherwise.   Agent Ayala testified without contradiction that both he and his deputy advised the appellant of his rights before they initiated any interrogation.   Thus, the court below had a solid foundation on which to rest the admission of the disputed evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   From aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried and justly convicted.   Consequently, the judgment of the district court must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Figueroa began cooperating with the authorities during the investigation.   Maisonet joined her in a duet as part of a plea agreement negotiated between the date of his arrest and the date of the appellant's trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the appellant claims the prosecution misfired by failing to show that he possessed some special skill needed by the conspirators, he has again strayed beyond the elements of the offense.   His claim is, therefore, unavailing</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that the trial judge drew the jury's attention to the potential problems with testimony of this type, instructing the jurors, inter alia, that the testimony of informants and accomplices cooperating with the government \"must be examined and weighed by [you] with greater care and caution than the testimony of ordinary witnesses.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> We say \"asserted contradictions\" because, for example, the jury could have found the supposed contradiction concerning who first hired Guzman to be more apparent than real.   The testimony revealed that, during Guzman's earlier trip, he worked for a few low-level conspirators and had little contact with Maisonet or his principal partner.   When Maisonet and the appellant thereafter discussed ways of transporting the cocaine, the appellant referred to Guzman only as his cousin, and not by name.   Thus, Maisonet could have \"hired\" Guzman through Laboy in a very real sense, notwithstanding Guzman's earlier brush with the enterprise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> On appeal, Laboy attempts to link the prosecutor's comment with Maisonet's testimony that he was attacked at one point because he was suspected of being an informant.   There is no basis either in the record or in the prosecutor's summation for forging such a link</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We quote below the criticized remarks in their entirety:</p>\n        <p>\"He told you also about the two reputation witnesses and that I asked him an unfair question.   Those aren't unfair questions.   I asked him, \"Were you there\".   He wasn't there so he can't tell us anything.   You see, the issue is what happened that day and they are bringing witnesses to tell you about other things.   Well, bring me a witness to tell me what happened there.</p>\n        <p>What is a reputation witness going to say, He is a good friend.   The person that says he was like my brother and that man that came here is a very good man and so is the other one but see, he didn't know what Juan Laboy Delgado was doing in August of 1990 in St. Maarten because he was not there so he can't testify as to that.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In undertaking this analysis we assume arguendo, but do not decide, that the appellant lodged a timely objection to this line of argument.   In point of fact, no contemporaneous objection was raised.   However, the appellant advanced an objection to this line of argument at the end of the prosecutor's rebuttal and simultaneously moved for a mistrial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Since we find that the prosecutor's statement did not prejudicially highlight the appellant's failure to testify, we find no abuse of discretion in the district judge's denial of the concomitant motion for a mistrial.   See Pierro, 32 F.3d at 617;  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Even if these elements are present, the court of appeals retains discretion to decide whether to take notice of a plain error.   See Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1778.   We are inclined to exercise that discretion sparingly, generally limiting it to instances in which the error, if uncorrected, would result in a miscarriage of justice or, put another way, would \"skew[ ] the fundamental fairness or basic integrity of the proceeding below in some major respect.\"  Taylor, 54 F.3d at 973</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
