Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U. S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Melba N. Rivera Camacho on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Camille Velez Rive,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Robert M. Peckrill, Assistant\nRegional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       December 18, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam. We have reviewed the record and the\n\nbriefs of the parties in this Social Security disability\n\nbenefits case and have carefully considered claimant Luis\n\nEspada Rosado’s arguments that the administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ) erred by employing the incorrect legal standard in\n\nevaluating his application for reinstatement of withdrawn\n\ndisability   benefits   and   that    the   ALJ’s   decision   is   not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.          Espada is incorrect that\n\nthe ALJ should have employed the legal standard applicable\n\nto evaluating “medical improvement” in disability benefits\n\ncessation cases.    The cessation of benefits in Espada’s case\n\nwas not based on a finding of medical improvement.             Rather,\n\nthe cessation of benefits was initiated by a change in the\n\nsocial security laws, namely 42 U.S.C. §§ 423(d)2)(C) and\n\n1382(a)(3)(J).     The ALJ correctly employed the applicable\n\nstandards embodied in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1535 and 416.935 to\n\nevaluate Espada’s request for reinstatement of his disability\n\nbenefits.\n\n            After determining, based on the medical evidence\n\nprovided by both treating and consulting psychiatrists, that\n\nEspada’s emotional disorder left him unable to perform his\n\npast relevant work, the ALJ solicited the testimony of a\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fvocational    expert      (VE).         The    VE      testified    at     the\n\nadministrative hearing that there were other jobs in the\n\nnational economy which Espada could perform despite his\n\nemotional disorder.          Thus, the ALJ had specific evidence -\n\nthe VE’s testimony - that there were actual jobs in the\n\nnational economy which claimant could perform.                   Therefore,\n\nthe   decision    of   the    Commissioner      that    claimant    was    not\n\ndisabled is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n            The   final      judgment   of    the   magistrate     judge    is\n\naffirmed.    See Local Rule 27.1.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f",
