Valldejuli, by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal\nDivision, were on brief for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                        November 2, 2001\n\f\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.     In this case, Alberto De León\n\nappeals from his conviction for attempting to reenter the United\n\nStates after deportation.      The facts are undisputed.      De León,\n\na citizen of the Dominican Republic, first entered the United\n\nStates in 1980.     In 1995, he was convicted in state court of\n\npossession of heroin with intent to distribute and was sentenced\n\nto prison.    Following his release in July 1997, he was deported\n\nbased upon his conviction for drug dealing.\n\n            On May 16, 1999, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter intercepted\n\na small yawl about 15 nautical miles off the northwest coast of\n\nPuerto Rico (all references are to nautical miles).           The yawl\n\nwas   in   international   waters,   since   U.S.   territorial   waters\n\nextend only 12 miles from shore and, at the time, the U.S.\n\ncontiguous zone also extended only 12 miles from shore. 1            The\n\nyawl flew no flag and had no lights, registration number or\n\nother markings.    De León was one of the passengers on the yawl.\n\n            When approached by the cutter, the yawl turned away\n\nsharply but then halted and began to sink.          The yawl turned out\n\nto be carrying 72 Dominican nationals, and various passengers\n\n\n\n      1\n     The contiguous zone is an area in which the United States\nclaims certain rights short of sovereignty. In August 1999, the\nPresident signed a proclamation to extend the contiguous zone to\n24 miles from shore, but this occurred after the events\nimportant to this case. Presidential Proclamation No. 7219, 64\nFed. Reg. 48,701 (Aug. 2, 1999).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fadmitted that the yawl was attempting to transport them to\n\nPuerto Rico.         The passengers were taken by the Coast Guard to\n\nPuerto Rico.         There, an investigation revealed that De León had\n\nbeen previously deported as an aggravated felon and had not\n\nreceived permission from the Attorney General to enter the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           A grand jury indicted De León on one count under 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326 (1994).         That provision makes it a crime for an\n\nalien who has previously been deported to enter, attempt to\n\nenter,    or    be    found   in   the        United   States    unless    certain\n\nconditions are met (such as receiving express consent from the\n\nAttorney General to apply for admission).                    Id. § 1326(a).     The\n\ngovernment also invoked the more severe penalties that the\n\nstatute    provides       where    the    previous      deportation       occurred\n\nsubsequent     to     commission   of     an     aggravated     felony.     Id.    §\n\n1326(b)(2).      De León moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing\n\ninter alia that he could not be convicted for an attempt to\n\nenter based on acts that occurred entirely outside the United\n\nStates.\n\n           The district court denied the motion, and De León then\n\npled   guilty    to     attempting       to    enter   the    United   States     in\n\nviolation of the statute and was sentenced to 70 months in\n\nprison.    However, in his plea agreement De León reserved the\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fright to appeal on his claim that the statute did not apply to\n\nconduct that occurred wholly outside the United States.            That is\n\nthe only issue presented to us on this appeal.2\n\n             Apart from his claim as to territorial reach, there is\n\nno dispute that De León violated the statute.            \"Attempt,\" here\n\nas elsewhere, is a specific intent crime in the sense that an\n\n\"attempt to enter\" requires a subjective intent on the part of\n\nthe defendant to achieve entry into the United States as well as\n\na substantial step toward completing that entry.           United States\n\nv. Gracidas-Ulibarry, 231 F.3d 1188, 1195-96 (9th Cir. 2000) (en\n\nbanc).      However, as with most federal criminal statutes, there\n\nis no requirement that the defendant additionally know that what\n\nhe proposes to do--i.e., attempt to enter the United States--is\n\nfor   him    criminal   conduct.   1     LaFave   &   Scott,   Substantive\n\nCriminal Law § 5.1(d) (1986).\n\n             The adequacy of the factual basis for De León's plea\n\nis not disputed, and any such dispute would be foreclosed,\n\nabsent extraordinary circumstances, by the guilty plea itself.\n\nAcevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 307 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 506 U.S. 905 (1992).         As it happens, the evidence\n\n\n      2\n     Although De León also briefed a claim that his prior\ndeportation was invalid, he did not present that issue in the\ndistrict court or preserve it in the face of his guilty plea.\nIn oral argument, defense counsel in this court withdrew this\nclaim of error.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fwas ample to show that De León was on a vessel seeking to make\n\na surreptitious entry into the United States, and--given the\n\nstate and behavior of the vessel and the statements of other\n\npassengers--it is easy to infer that De León knew full well\n\nwhere he was headed and was on board for that purpose.\n\n          De León does not argue, nor could he, that Congress\n\nlacks constitutional authority to make criminal the conduct to\n\nwhich he pled guilty.      Although all of the alleged acts occurred\n\noutside of the United States, its territorial waters and its\n\nthen-defined       contiguous   zone,    the   acts   were   deliberately\n\ndirected to producing an effect within the United States.              The\n\nconstitutional power of Congress to criminalize such conduct is\n\nnot in doubt.3      Instead, De León argues Congress is presumed not\n\nto   intend   an    extraterritorial     application    of   its   general\n\ncriminal statutes.       Alternatively, he says that to do so here\n\nwould violate a treaty whose provisions are set forth below.\n\n          It is true that \"'legislation of Congress, unless a\n\ncontrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States.'\"             Foley Bros.,\n\n\n\n     3\n     See Blackmer v. United States, 284 U.S. 421, 436-38 (1932);\nsee also Restatement(Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the\nUnited States § 403(3) (1987); Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v.\nCalifornia, 509 U.S. 764, 795-96 (1993); Nippon Paper Indus.\nCo., 109 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Plummer,\n221 F.3d 1298, 1305-07 (11th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fInc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281, 285 (1949).               The policy reasons\n\nare obvious:        one is \"the common sense notion that Congress\n\ngenerally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.\"               Smith v.\n\nUnited    States,    507   U.S.    197,      204   n.5   (1993).    And    the\n\npresumption also \"serves to protect against intended clashes\n\nbetween our laws and those of other nations . . . .\"                 EEOC v.\n\nArabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991).\n\n              Here, statutory language taken alone does not disclose\n\nCongress' intent; although the statute makes criminal \"attempts\n\nto enter\" without limitation as to where the attempts occur,\n\nthat would be true of many provisions in the Criminal Code,\n\ne.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1028 (1994) (false ID documents), but few of\n\nthose provisions would be read automatically to apply to conduct\n\noccurring solely in France or Norway.              Nor does the government\n\npoint to any legislative history that might suggest a special\n\nconcern with attempts to enter the United States that occur on\n\nthe high seas or in foreign countries but which never reach U.S.\n\nterritory.      At the same time, this seems to us a singularly easy\n\ncase to conclude that Congress did mean to reach De León's\n\nconduct.\n\n              In the ordinary situation, Congress has little reason\n\nto care whether citizens in other countries behave in ways that\n\nwould    be   forbidden    in   this   country.      But   where   the   crime\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\finvolves a prior deportee's effort to re-enter the United States\n\nillegally, the federal interest is just about the same as that\n\nwhich leads Congress to punish one who \"enters . . . or is at\n\nany time found in, the United States\" after deportation.               8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326(a)(2).       Why would Congress want someone caught\n\nseveral miles outside territorial waters, who is shown to be\n\nattempting to enter illegally, to be freed and given a second\n\nchance to make a more successful entry?\n\n           No challenge is made here to the lawfulness of the\n\nseizure.   Had the yawl not been classed as a stateless vessel,\n\nthis could have affected the authority of the Coast Guard to\n\narrest De León at sea--absent permission from the flag state.\n\nSee 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c)(1)(C) (Supp. II 1996).            But such\n\nlimitations   on   place   of   arrest   would   not   alter   Congress'\n\ninterest in criminalizing De León's conduct or in prosecuting\n\nhim if the government could lawfully acquire custody.\n\n           The more interesting question is whether the statute\n\nwould apply if the acts comprising the \"attempt\" took place\n\nsolely within the territory of a foreign state.         In some cases,\n\nthe conduct--if distant and preliminary--might easily fail to\n\nconstitute an attempt, see United States v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207,\n\n211 (1st Cir. 1999); but one can imagine other cases where an\n\nattempt would be made out (e.g., suppose De León had been caught\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fin Canada a mile from the border and admitted that he was en\n\nroute to Detroit).   Without suggesting any doubt about Congress'\n\npower to punish such conduct, we need not decide now whether\n\nthere is any such limitation on the statute's reach.\n\n         This brings us to De León's argument based on the\n\nConvention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.   The\n\ngist of the argument is that by ratifying the Convention--which\n\naffirmatively authorizes the enforcement of national immigration\n\nlaws in its contiguous zone and territorial sea--the United\n\nStates has impliedly agreed that it will not apply its laws to\n\nconduct occurring beyond the zone, at least as to \"customs,\n\nfiscal, immigration or sanitary regulations . . . .\"\n\n         The Convention, ratified by the Senate in 1961 and\n\nentered into force in 1964, pertinently reads as follows:\n\n            (1) In a zone of the high seas contiguous\n         to its territorial sea, the coastal State\n         may exercise the control necessary to:\n\n                (a) Prevent infringement of\n                its     customs,     fiscal,\n                immigration    or    sanitary\n                regulations     within    its\n                territory or territorial sea;\n\n                (b) Punish infringement of the\n                above regulations committed\n                within   its    territory   or\n                territorial sea.\n\n             (2) The contiguous zone may not extend\n         beyond twelve miles from the baseline from\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f            which the breadth of the territorial sea is\n            measured [i.e., the shore].\n\nConvention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, Apr.\n\n29, 1958, art. 24, 15 U.S.T. 1606, 1612.\n\n            It is unclear how far the Convention is concerned with\n\nauthority    to    proscribe      conduct      as    opposed     to   authority   to\n\nenforce.     The introductory language--the coastal state \"may\n\nexercise    the     control       necessary         to\"--suggests      enforcement\n\nmeasures, giving the coastal state (for example) the power to\n\nhalt and arrest vessels of other states engaged in infringing\n\nthe named categories of rules.            Cf. Dean, The Geneva Conference\n\non the Law of the Sea: What Was Accomplished, 52 Am. J. Int'l L.\n\n607, 624 (1958) (\"Thus, hot pursuit of a vessel which has\n\ncommitted an offense within the territorial sea may commence\n\neven   though      the   vessel    is   first       sighted,     not   within     the\n\nterritorial sea, but within the contiguous zone\").\n\n            More    important,      assuming        that   the   Convention     also\n\nprovides or ratifies a power to regulate certain conduct within\n\nthe contiguous zone, the Convention nowhere purports to bar the\n\napplication of federal statutes to conduct, whether within or\n\nbeyond the contiguous zone, that has a substantial adverse\n\neffect within the United States.                    That power was assumed to\n\nexist well before the Convention, e.g., Logan Act, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n954 (1994), and well after, Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements\n\n                                        -10-\n\fAct of 1982, 18 U.S.C. § 6a (1994), and it is confirmed both by\n\ncase   law   and   commentary.     See    note   3,     above.      At   most,\n\nprescriptions      beyond   the   contiguous     zone    do   not   get    the\n\ndiplomatic protection that the Convention may afford if and when\n\nforeign states object.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

United States v. Gracidas-Ulibarry, 231 F.3d 1188, 1195-96 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). However, as with most federal criminal statutes, there is no requirement that the defendant additionally know that what he proposes to do--i.e., attempt to enter the United States--is for him criminal conduct. 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 5.1(d) (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The adequacy of the factual basis for De Leon's plea is not disputed, and any such dispute would be foreclosed, absent extraordinary circumstances, by the guilty plea itself.

Nor does the government point to any legislative history that might suggest a special concern with attempts to enter the United States that occur on the high seas or in foreign countries but which never reach U.S. territory.

In some cases, the conduct--if distant and preliminary--might easily fail to constitute an attempt, see United States v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207, 211 (1st Cir. 1999); but one can imagine other cases where an attempt would be made out (e.g., suppose De Leon had been caught in Canada a mile from the border and admitted that he was en route to Detroit).

The facts are undisputed. De Leon, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, first entered the United States in 1980. In 1995, he was convicted in state court of possession of heroin with intent to distribute and was sentenced to prison. Following his release in July 1997, he was deported based upon his conviction for drug dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 16, 1999, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter intercepted a small yawl about 15 nautical miles off the northwest coast of Puerto Rico (all references are to nautical miles). The yawl was in international waters, since U.S. territorial waters extend only 12 miles from shore and, at the time, the U.S. contiguous zone also extended only 12 miles from shore.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The yawl flew no flag and had no lights, registration number or other markings. De Leon was one of the passengers on the yawl.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When approached by the cutter, the yawl turned away sharply but then halted and began to sink. The yawl turned out to be carrying 72 Dominican nationals, and various passengers admitted that the yawl was attempting to transport them to Puerto Rico. The passengers were taken by the Coast Guard to Puerto Rico. There, an investigation revealed that De Leon had been previously deported as an aggravated felon and had not received permission from the Attorney General to enter the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury indicted De Leon on one count under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326 (1994). That provision makes it a crime for an alien who has previously been deported to enter, attempt to enter, or be found in the United States unless certain conditions are met (such as receiving express consent from the Attorney General to apply for admission). Id. &#167; 1326(a). The government also invoked the more severe penalties that the statute provides where the previous deportation occurred subsequent to commission of an aggravated felony. Id. &#167; 1326(b)(2). De Leon moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing inter alia that he could not be convicted for an attempt to enter based on acts that occurred entirely outside the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion, and De Leon then pled guilty to attempting to enter the United States in violation of the statute and was sentenced to 70 months in prison. However, in his plea agreement De Leon reserved the right to appeal on his claim that the statute did not apply to conduct that occurred wholly outside the United States. That is the only issue presented to us on this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from his claim as to territorial reach, there is no dispute that De Leon violated the statute. \"Attempt,\" here as elsewhere, is a specific intent crime in the sense that an \"attempt to enter\" requires a subjective intent on the part of the defendant to achieve entry into the United States as well as a substantial step toward completing that entry. United States v. Gracidas-Ulibarry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771052\"><a href=\"/opinion/771052/united-states-v-alfredo-gracidas-ulibarry/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></a></span>, 1195-96 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). However, as with most federal criminal statutes, there is no requirement that the defendant additionally know that what he proposes to do--i.e., attempt to enter the United States--is for him criminal conduct. 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 5.1(d) (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The adequacy of the factual basis for De Leon's plea is not disputed, and any such dispute would be foreclosed, absent extraordinary circumstances, by the guilty plea itself. Acevedo-Ramos v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581361\"><a href=\"/opinion/581361/hector-acevedo-ramos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></span> (1992). As it happens, the evidence was ample to show that De Leon was on a vessel seeking to make a surreptitious entry into the United States, and--given the state and behavior of the vessel and the statements of other passengers--it is easy to infer that De Leon knew full well where he was headed and was on board for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Leon does not argue, nor could he, that Congress lacks constitutional authority to make criminal the conduct to which he pled guilty. Although all of the alleged acts occurred outside of the United States, its territorial waters and its then-defined contiguous zone, the acts were deliberately directed to producing an effect within the United States. The constitutional power of Congress to criminalize such conduct is not in doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Instead, De Leon argues Congress is presumed not to intend an extraterritorial application of its general criminal statutes. Alternatively, he says that to do so here would violate a treaty whose provisions are set forth below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that \"'legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.'\" Foley Bros., Inc. v.
