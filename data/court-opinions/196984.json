In this consolidated appeal,\r                    GERTNER, District Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nwe consider challenges to the sentences of Ismael Rivera-DeCelis,\r\n\nCarmen  Pacheco-Rijos  and   Juan  Jos   Miranda-Santiago.     In\r\n\nSeptember of 1994, these defendant-appellants, along with twenty-\r\n\none  co-defendants,  pled  guilty  to  participation  in  a  drug\r\n\ndistribution  conspiracy  spanning  over  a  year  and  involving\r\n\ntrafficking in crack cocaine,  cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, as\r\n\nwell as using or brandishing firearms, and engaging in carjacking\r\n\nto facilitate their drug trade.\r\n\n          The  defendants  were  arraigned  in two  groups,  pled\r\n\nguilty before the  same judge  and were sentenced  before him  by\r\n\nearly 1995.\r\n\n          Ismael Rivera-DeCelis contends that his guilty plea was\r\n\nentered in violation of Rule 11 of the  Federal Rules of Criminal\r\n\nProcedure, and that the  district judge erred in calculating  his\r\n\nsentence. See U.S.S.G.   1B1.3.  He did not press the first point\r                       \r\n\nbelow.  We find that the plea colloquy in his case conformed with\r\n\nFed.  R.  Crim. P.  11 and  that  the sentence  calculations with\r\n\nrespect to  him were not  in error.   Accordingly, we  affirm his\r\n\nconviction and sentence.\r\n\n          Carmen Pacheco-Rijos challenges  her sentence,  arguing\r\n\nthat  the district court erred  in imposing the mandatory minimum\r\n\nrequired for  her offense.  Her attack is based on her claim that\r\n\nshe  met the conditions set forth in the \"safety valve provision\"\r\n\nof  the Sentencing Guidelines.  See 18 U.S.C.   3553(f); U.S.S.G.\r                                             \r\n\n  5C1.2.  We find  the record inadequate to justify  the district\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ncourt's decision not to grant relief.  Accordingly, we vacate the\r\n\nsentence  and remand  the case  for the  purpose of  allowing the\r\n\ndistrict court to revisit this issue and to clarify the record by\r\n\nfiling  supplemental findings.  In the event that the court finds\r\n\nits initial  calculation  in error,  it  should so  identify  and\r\n\nreturn,  as  well,  to   the  issue  of  other  adjustments,   if\r\n\nappropriate, under the Guidelines.\r\n\n          Juan  Jos  Miranda-Santiago also  attacks his sentence,\r\n\narguing that  the sentencing court erred, as  a matter of law, by\r\n\nfailing  to  grant a  two-level  downward adjustment  based  on a\r\n\nfinding  that the  defendant  was a  \"minor  participant\" in  the\r\n\ncriminal  activity.  See U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b).  We find inadequate\r                                  \r\n\nsupport  in the record for the court's conclusion that a downward\r\n\nadjustment was inappropriate.  We vacate this sentence and remand\r\n\nthe  case to  the district  court for the  purpose of  having the\r\n\ncourt  file  supplemental  findings  with  respect  to  appellant\r\n\nMiranda-Santiago's  role in the offense.   In the  event that the\r\n\ncourt  finds its computation in  error, it should  include such a\r\n\ndetermination in its findings.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r                        \r\n\n          We begin with an overview of events involving the three\r\n\nappellants.1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  We consider the facts as set forth in the uncontested portions\r\nof  the  Presentence  Report   (\"PSR\")  of  each  defendant,  the\r\ninformation  to  which  each   defendant  pled  guilty,  and  the\r\nsentencing   hearing  transcripts.     E.g.,  United   States  v.\r                                                                       \r\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555,  557 (1st Cir. 1996); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\nLeBlanc, 24 F.3d 340,  342 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,     U.S.   ,\r                                                             \r\n115 S. Ct. 250 (1994).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          On March 9,  1994 a grand  jury returned an  indictment\r\n\nagainst 19  defendants,  including appellants  Pacheco-Rijos  and\r\n\nMiranda- Santiago, charging  them with  conspiracy to  distribute\r\n\ndrugs, and with using firearms in connection with a drug offense.\r\n\nApparently, the  conspirators hid drug  substances, firearms  and\r\n\nproceeds of  drug sales in specific locations, guarded by members\r\n\nof  the  conspiracy.    Members  of   the  conspiracy  were  also\r\n\nencouraged to  commit -- and committed  -- \"carjacking\" offenses;\r\n\narmed,  they  would  steal cars  and  then  use  the vehicles  to\r\n\ntransport drugs back to their storage locations.\r\n\n          The indictment  and the PSRs adopted  by the appellants\r\n\nand  the district  court  detailed a  criminal enterprise  with a\r\n\nstrongly hierarchical structure;  some of the  accused controlled\r\n\nthe  operation,   while  others   served  as  drug   runners  and\r\n\nbodyguards.   A superseding indictment, returned on May 12, 1994,\r\n\nnamed  five  additional defendants,  including  appellant Rivera-\r\n\nDeCelis.\r\n\n          When arraigned,  each defendant  entered a plea  of not\r\n\nguilty.  In September  of 1994, Rivera-DeCelis, Pacheco-Rijos and\r\n\nMiranda- Santiago,  among others,  offered to change  their pleas\r\n\nwith  respect to  certain  charges.   After  each plea  colloquy,\r\n\nconducted individually, the court accepted the defendants' pleas.\r\n\nEach was separately sentenced.\r\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\r          II.  DISCUSSION\r                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          We consider  the facts  with respect to  each defendant\r\n\nand his or her legal challenges in turn.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          A.  Ismael Rivera-DeCelis\r                    A.  Ismael Rivera-DeCelis\r                                             \r\n\n              1.  Facts\r                        1.  Facts\r\n\n          Appellant  Rivera-DeCelis  was  alleged  to  have  been\r\n\ninvolved in several phases of the drug conspiracy detailed in the\r\n\nsuperseding  indictment.    He  was  charged  in Count  One  with\r\n\ndistributing not less than fifty grams of cocaine base, an amount\r\n\nof not less than five kilograms of cocaine, an amount of not less\r\n\nthan one kilogram  of heroin,  and some amount  of marijuana,  in\r\n\nviolation of 21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1)  &amp; 846.  Counts  Three, Four\r\n\nand  Five charged  him  with possessing  and brandishing  various\r\n\nfirearms in connection with his drug trafficking, in violation of\r\n\n21 U.S.C.   924(c)(1).\r\n\n          After an initial  plea of not  guilty, on September  8,\r\n\n1994, Rivera-DeCelis  offered  to change  his plea  to guilty  to\r\n\nCount One's charge that he acted in violation of 18 U.S.C.   846,\r\n\nand Count Three's charge that he  acted in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  924(c)(1).  The plea  agreement was entered into under  Fed. R.\r\n\nCrim. P. 11(e)(1)(c).2   It provided that the defendant  would be\r\n\nheld accountable at  sentencing for the  distribution of no  less\r\n\nthan 15  but no more than 50 kilograms of cocaine, resulting in a\r\n\nbase offense  level of  34.   See U.S.S.G.     2D1.1(a)(3).   The\r                                           \r\n\nparties also agreed that  the defendant was entitled to  a three-\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Rule 11(e)(1)(C) of  the Federal Rules  of Criminal Procedure\r\nauthorizes plea  agreements which stipulate specific sentences to\r\nbe  imposed.  In those circumstances, a district court may either\r\naccept the agreement in  toto or reject it, giving  the defendant\r\nthe  opportunity to withdraw the plea entirely.  Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n11(e)(4); U.S.S.G.   6B1.3(ps).  \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nlevel downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, under\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1(b)(1) &amp;  (2), reducing his offense  level to 31.\r\n\nThe parties further defined the term of imprisonment: In light of\r\n\nthe ten  year  mandatory minimum  sentence facing  Rivera-DeCelis\r\n\nunder 21  U.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B), and a  criminal history category\r\n\nof III,  they stipulated to  a 139 month  term of  confinement on\r\n\nCount One to be followed by a 60 month term on Count Three.3\r\n\n          During the  plea colloquy, the district  judge directly\r\n\naddressed Rivera-DeCelis.   He explained each  charge, detailing,\r\n\namong other things, the time frame of the conspiracy in which the\r\n\ndefendant allegedly  was involved  (roughly from January  of 1993\r\n\nthrough  March of  1994), the  elements of  the offenses  and the\r\n\nburden the government would  have if it tried to prove its case.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   The  139 month  prison term  on Count  One appears,  from the\r\nrecord  before us, to have been the result of negotiation between\r\nthe initial plea and sentencing.\r\n\n4  As  to the factual basis of the charges to which the defendant\r\nwas offering to plead, the colloquy included the following:\r\n\n          THE COURT:  Have you  received a copy  of the\r\n          superseding indictment that  mentions you  in\r\n          Counts One and Three?\r\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\r\n          THE COURT: Count  One is the  drug conspiracy\r\n          count.      There,  you   are   charged  with\r\n          participating in  a conspiracy .  . . .   The\r\n          allegation   is   that   you  knowingly   and\r\n          intentionally  conspired,  and agreed  with a\r\n          number   of   persons   to    knowingly   and\r\n          intentionally      distribute      controlled\r\n          substances.\r\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\r\n          THE COURT: Have with  you [sic], possess  and\r\n          distribute       controlled       substances,\r\n          specifically in an amount of not less than 50\r\n          grams of  crack cocaine, not  less than  five\r\n          kilograms of regular cocaine, some marijuana,\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nHe also explained to the defendant the sentences he faced and the\r\n\nconsequences of his  plea, inquired about coercion  and made sure\r\n\nthe  defendant understood  the  particular strictures  of a  plea\r\n\nentered into under Rule 11(e)(1)(c).  The defendant agreed to the\r\n\nfacts presented  in the indictment, without  asserting that there\r\n\nwere  any temporal  limits  to his  personal  involvement in  the\r\n\nconspiracy. \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          and at least one kilogram of heroin.   Do you\r\n          understand that?\r\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\r\n\nWith respect to the firearms charge, the colloquy included: \r\n\n          THE COURT: And that  aside from selling drugs\r\n          and  making money,  the different  members of\r\n          the  conspiracy  at  time possessed  weapons,\r\n          firearms,  to provide protection  to the drug\r\n          operations or the  conspiracy, not only  from\r\n          innocent  people but  also from  rival gangs,\r\n          and  to  prevent  the  intervention   of  law\r\n          enforcement  officers,  and   to  provide   a\r\n          certain degree  of  intimidation  .  .  .  of\r\n          innocent people . . . \r\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir. \r\n          THE  COURT:  Also,   that  at  times  certain\r\n          members of the conspiracy, of which you are a\r\n          part,  carjacked  citizens,  took their  cars\r\n          away by force, in  order to use the cars  for\r\n          purposes   of   --   related   to   the  drug\r\n          conspiracy.\r\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir . . . .\r\n          THE COURT:   You are also  pleading guilty to\r\n          Count  Three,  which is  the  firearms count.\r\n          There  the government  is alleging  that from\r\n          January of  1993, until on or  about March of\r\n          1994,  you, along with others, knowingly used\r\n          and     carried    firearms,     specifically\r\n          semiautomatic pistols, during and in relation\r\n          to   a  drug   trafficking  crime   which  is\r\n          precisely the drug trafficking crime that you\r\n          are charged with in Count One.\r\n          THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          Turning to the factual basis of the charges, the  judge\r\n\nasked Rivera-DeCelis whether the  defendant was \"recognizing [his\r\n\nguilt] ... for the drug conspiracy participation and also for the\r\n\nweapons  or  firearms count,\"  and  whether  he acknowledged  the\r\n\npunishment  he  could  face.    Rivera-DeCelis  answered  in  the\r\n\naffirmative to both questions.5\r\n\n          At sentencing, the defendant challenged the drug amount\r\n\nattributed  to  him in  the  PSR.    Notwithstanding his  earlier\r\n\nadmissions, Rivera-DeCelis asserted that  he was only involved in\r\n\nthe  conspiracy for three months  and that the  amount of cocaine\r\n\nreflected  in the plea agreement  was greater than  the amount he\r\n\ncould reasonably  have  foreseen  would  have been  part  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy during his membership in it. The government cast doubt\r\n\non the short duration of Rivera-DeCelis' involvement, noting that\r\n\nhe was pictured holding a gun  and serving as a bodyguard for one\r\n\nof the  conspiracy's leaders.  Logically,  the prosecutor argued,\r\n\nsuch a responsibility  would not  devolve to a  new and  marginal\r\n\nmember of the  organization.  In any event, even  within a 90 day\r\n\nperiod, the  government contended, the daily  quantities of drugs\r\n\nsold as part  of the conspiracy  would result in  a drug  offense\r\n\nlevel of over 34. \r\n\n          The  district  judge  did not  accept  the  defendant's\r\n\ncharacterization of  his involvement and rejected  his challenge.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  Rivera-DeCelis also admitted that he, as charged in Counts One\r\nand  Three,  actually   possessed  and  distributed   \"controlled\r\nsubstances being a member of a conspiracy,\" and that he was aware\r\nof   the  acts   of   his  co-conspirators   \"involving  weapons,\r\ncarjackings and proceeds, financial gain, et cetera.\"  \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nThe judge noted  that the benefits of this  plea agreement to the\r\n\ndefendant  were substantial,  since, for  instance, no  amount of\r\n\ncrack  cocaine was attributed to the defendant, a drug \"which all\r\n\nof  them were  dealing ...  without a  doubt.\"   Accordingly, the\r\n\ncourt  adopted a  base  offense  level  of  34  and  granted  the\r\n\ndefendant   a    three-level   reduction   for    acceptance   of\r\n\nresponsibility.    U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b).    Based  on a  criminal\r\n\nhistory category of III, Rivera-DeCelis was sentenced on the drug\r\n\ncharge to a  prison term of 139  months, at the lower  end of the\r\n\nguideline range,6  to be followed by  a term of 60  months on the\r\n\nfirearms  charge.  The  remaining charges  against Rivera-DeCelis\r\n\nwere dismissed.\r\n\n                  2.  Legal Analysis\r                            2.  Legal Analysis\r\n\n                      a.

Challenge to the Guilty Plea\r\n\n          Although he never moved  to withdraw his plea prior  to\r\n\nsentencing,  Rivera-DeCelis now  challenges  its  validity.7   He\r\n\nclaims  that his  plea was  not  voluntary, because  the district\r\n\ncourt  failed to  offer an  adequate explanation  of the  charges\r\n\nagainst   him  or   to  determine   whether  he   understood  the\r\n\nconsequences of his plea.  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Given  a base offense  level of 31  and a criminal  history of\r\nIII, Rivera-DeCelis  faced a  guideline sentencing range,  on the\r\ndrug count alone, of 135 - 168 months. \r\n\n7    To  the   contrary,  Rivera-DeCelis'  attorney  insisted  at\r\nsentencing that the request  that his client be held  responsible\r\nfor a lower drug quantity was based on objections to the PSR, and\r\nthat it was not a request to withdraw the defendant's plea.  When\r\npressed  further, defense  counsel acknowledged  that he  was not\r\nmaking a legal argument  but offering an allocution on  behalf of\r\nhis client. \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          We do not agree.

The Plea Colloquy\r                                    2.  The Plea Colloquy\r\n\nAs to the  validity of  the Rule 11  proceeding below,  appellant\r\n\nRivera-DeCelis rests his argument on two points: (1)  his limited\r\n\neducation and ability  to understand the written word, because of\r\n\nhis dyslexia; and (2) the district court's failure to ensure that\r\n\nRivera-DeCelis actually had read the superseding indictment under\r\n\nwhich he was charged.  The government argues that the appellant's\r\n\nRule  11 challenge  -- at  this late  hour --  is wholly  without\r\n\nmerit.\r\n\n          The government has the better argument.\r\n\n          The core concerns of Rule 11 require that the defendant\r\n\nbe instructed in open  court with respect  to the \"nature of  the\r\n\ncharge to which the  plea is offered,\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1),\r\n\nand that a plea \"'cannot be considered truly voluntary unless the\r\n\ndefendant possesses  an understanding of  the law in  relation to\r\n\nthe facts.'\" United  States v.

See United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535,\r                                                           \r\n1537 (1st Cir. 1989),  cert. denied, 502 U.S. 862 (1991); Fed.

Gray, 63 F.3d  57, 60 (1st\r                                                     \r\nCir. 1995) (citations omitted).\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\ndesigned  to  ensure  that   defendant  actually  understood  the\r\n\nproceedings.  The judge  specifically explained both the elements\r\n\nof  each   offense  and  the  factual   accusations  against  the\r\n\ndefendant.  As  he walked Rivera-DeCelis through these aspects of\r\n\nthe  case against  him, the  judge inquired  -- at  each turn  --\r\n\nwhether  Rivera-DeCelis  subjectively  understood the  situation.\r\n\nThe district judge  also made  sure that  Rivera-DeCelis in  fact\r\n\ngrasped the consequences of his plea.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1).\r\n\nOnly after  assuring himself  that Rivera-DeCelis  understood the\r\n\ncharges, the  facts that formed their bases  and the consequences\r\n\nof  his plea, did the district judge ask Rivera-DeCelis to attest\r\n\nto the facts to which he was pleading guilty.12\r\n\n          Consideration  of  other factors  surrounding  the plea\r\n\ndoes not yield a better  result for the appellant.  With  respect\r\n\nto the validity of  the proffered reasons for requesting  that we\r\n\nset   aside  Rivera-DeCelis'   plea,   we   are  not   persuaded,\r\n\nparticularly  given  the  care  with  which  the  district  judge\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12   It strikes  us that  the appellant  has turned a  legitimate\r\nargument on its head.  If the district court had merely made sure\r\nthat  a dyslexic  defendant  with  only  eight  years  of  formal\r\nschooling had read  an indictment -- without  oral questioning to\r\nensure actual understanding --  we might find error.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\nUnited  States v.

Given  Rivera-DeCelis'\r\nparticular  circumstances, the  district court's  direct, probing\r\nand careful  questioning of  the defendant  assures  us that  the\r\ntrial judge was doing as Rule 11 requires, looking to the reality\r\nof the situation faced by the defendant and  making sure that the\r\ndefendant actually  understood the nature of  the charges against\r\nhim and  the consequences of his  plea.  See Allard,  926 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n1245. \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ndirectly addressed the defendant on each issue of central concern\r\n\nunder  Rule 11.   The timing of  the request, made  for the first\r\n\ntime  before an  appellate court,  also counsels  against setting\r\n\naside  the  plea.   The  defendant  made  no  assertion of  legal\r\n\ninnocence; and,  finally,  the plea  was  offered pursuant  to  a\r\n\nnegotiated plea agreement. \r\n\n          In short,  the district judge fully  addressed the core\r\n\nconcerns  of Rule  11.   Accordingly,  we  decline to  set  aside\r\n\nappellant Rivera-DeCelis' plea of guilty.\r\n\n                      b.  Sentencing Challenge:  Relevant Conduct\r                                b.

The  error is  based, the appellant  argues, on  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  failure to  make individualized findings.

It is  the  project  of  the\r\n\nsentencing court  to determine what a  particular defendant could\r\n\nreasonably have foreseen.  Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 76. \r                                             \r\n\n          In  this case,  the sentencing  judge carried  out this\r\n\nresponsibility without error.\r\n\n          It is  undisputed  that Rivera-DeCelis  pled guilty  to\r\n\nengaging in  jointly undertaken criminal  activity triggering the\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\napplication  of section  1B1.3(a)(1)(B).   At  his plea  hearing,\r\n\nRivera-DeCelis accepted the factual recitation of the indictment,\r\n\nindicating  an involvement  in the  conspiracy from  January 1993\r\n\nthrough  March  of   1994.    He  also  acknowledged  knowing  of\r\n\ntrafficking in crack cocaine,  cocaine, heroin and marijuana over\r\n\nthat  period of  time.   His  plea, indeed,  situated him  in the\r\n\ncenter  of  the  conspiracy's activities,  aware  of  its use  of\r\n\nfirearms as well as the extent of the drug dealing. \r\n\n          The  district  judge  was   not  persuaded  by  defense\r\n\ncounsel's  explanation that he had urged his client to accept the\r\n\nplea   because he was  unsure he could  confirm the circumscribed\r\n\nscope of the defendant's involvement.13  The defendant did little\r\n\nelse to confirm that  his vantage point was  so distant from  the\r\n\nmain  activity and he  stood in  that place  for such  a fleeting\r\n\nmoment that he could  not reasonably have foreseen that  not less\r\n\nthan  15 but  not  more than  50 kilograms  of  cocaine would  be\r\n\ninvolved in the  offense.   Notably, he never  suggested --  much\r\n\nless  proved --  a precise  amount for  which  he should  be held\r\n\naccountable.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n13  When  asked why the defendant  would sign a  Rule 11(e)(1)(C)\r\nagreement for a specific  sentence, if he believed that  the true\r\nnature  of his involvement would result in a much lower sentence,\r\nthe defendant's attorney explained: \r\n\n          . .  . when I agreed to that, I was under the\r\n          impression . . .  that three months could not\r\n          be corroborated by the Government.  Now three\r\n          months   could   be   corroborated   by   the\r\n          Government . . .  the amount of cocaine would\r\n          --  should --  be less  than  the one  in the\r\n          indictment.\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n          Against  this shaky  challenge, the  government offered\r\n\nsturdy  support for attributing the defendant with at least 15 to\r\n\n50 kilograms of cocaine.  It reminded the sentencing court of the\r\n\ntestimony  of a  co-conspirator, which  had indicated  that daily\r\n\ndrug sales of which Rivera-DeCelis would have been aware amounted\r\n\nto well over 50 kilograms of cocaine in a matter of months.14  It\r\n\nalso  cast  doubt  on the  allegedly  limited  nature of  Rivera-\r\n\nDeCelis'  involvement  by focusing  the  court's  attention on  a\r\n\nphotograph  in  which  Rivera-DeCelis   is  pictured,  holding  a\r\n\nfirearm, as a bodyguard to the leader of the conspiracy.15  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n14  The government made the following argument at sentencing: \r\n\n          MR. PEREIRA:   Your  Honor, initially let  me\r\n          address the issue of the quantity of drugs so\r\n          that the  record is  clear as  to  that.   We\r\n          provided, of course, to this defendant as  we\r\n          did  to  all   defendants,  the  grand   jury\r\n          transcripts of Ram n Alexandro L pez and it's\r\n          part  of the record of this court. . . . [H]e\r\n          is asked,  have you ever heard  in terms from\r\n          anybody or your own estimation that a kilo of\r\n          cocaine  gets consumed  or cooked  into crack\r\n          every  11  days?    The answer  to  that  is,\r\n          yes. . . .\r\n\n          Now, even if we assume  that this individual,\r\n          that this present  defendant, Ismael  Rivera,\r\n          participated in this conspiracy only 90 days,\r\n          that is  eight kilos  of crack cocaine.   1.5\r\n          kilos of crack cocaine  is a level 38 offense\r\n          in  the 1994  guidelines, so,  [it] certainly\r\n          covers the sentence which he agreed to.\r\n\n15  We find the government's rendition wholly believable.  Where,\r\nas  here, a  view  of  the  record  is  entirely  plausible,  the\r\nsentencing  court's adoption of that view  cannot amount to clear\r\nerror.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 706 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n1992). \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n          On this record, the district judge did not clearly  err\r\n\nin adopting the government's reasoning, noting that the defendant\r\n\nreaped a  benefit  from  the  plea agreement  and  deciding  that\r\n\nRivera-DeCelis' base offense level should be 34.\r\n\n          We therefore  affirm  the district  court's  sentencing\r\n\ndetermination.\r\n\n          B.

Facts\r\n\n          Under  the  indictment  returned   in  March  of  1994,\r\n\nappellant Pacheco-Rijos was charged with four offenses: Count One\r\n\ncharged her  with conspiracy to  distribute drugs, in  amounts of\r\n\nnot  less than fifty  grams of cocaine  base, not less  than five\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine, not  less than one kilogram of  heroin, and\r\n\nsome  marijuana, from in  or about  January of  1993 until  in or\r\n\nabout March of 1994,  in violation of 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1) and\r\n\n846;  Counts Three, Four and  Five charged her,  along with other\r\n\nco-defendants, with knowingly using and  carrying firearms during\r\n\nand  in  relation to  her drug  trafficking,  in violation  of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    921(a)(3) &amp; (c)(1) &amp; 924(c)(1).\r\n\n          Pacheco-Rijos was arraigned on March 14, 1994, at which\r\n\ntime she pled not guilty.   On September 7, 1994, she changed her\r\n\nplea to guilty to Count One, which  charged her with violating 21\r\n\nU.S.C.      846.16    Her  plea  was  offered  pursuant  to  Rule\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n16    The underlying  offense was  21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1), which\r\nprohibits  the knowing or intentional manufacturing, distributing\r\nor possessing with intent  to manufacture, distribute or dispense\r\na controlled substance.  She did not plead guilty to any firearms\r\ncharges. \r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n11(e)(1)(A)  &amp; (B)  of the Federal  Rules of  Criminal Procedure,\r\n\nunder which the parties may  recommend sentencing terms but those\r\n\nterms  are not  binding upon the  court.   Cf.  Fed.  R. Crim. P.\r                                                        \r\n\n11(e)(1)(C).  \r\n\n          The agreement  recommended a  base offense level  of 28\r\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.   2D1.1 and a downward adjustment of three levels\r\n\nfor  acceptance of  responsibility  under  U.S.S.G.     3E1.1(b),\r\n\nresulting  in an offense level of 25.  The defendant acknowledged\r\n\nthat  although  those  preliminary  calculations  resulted  in  a\r\n\nguideline range of 57 to 71 months, she could receive a statutory\r\n\nminimum of 60 months imprisonment.   The agreement, however, left\r\n\nthe door  open for application  of other  provisions which  might\r\n\naffect her sentence.17\r\n\n          At the  outset of the sentencing  hearing, the district\r\n\njudge mischaracterized  the plea agreement as  a Rule 11(e)(1)(C)\r\n\nagreement, under which the sentencing judge  would be required to\r\n\naccept the agreement in  toto or reject it, thereby  allowing the\r\n\ndefendant to withdraw  her plea.   Such an  agreement would  have\r\n\nrepresented   the  parties'   negotiations  concerning   all  the\r\n\nguideline provisions that should determine the sentence.\r\n\n          Pacheco-Rijos' plea agreement, however, did not pretend\r\n\nto such completeness.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n17    The agreement  stated:   \"The  United States  and defendant\r\nstipulate a sixty (60)  month term of confinement.   No agreement\r\nconcerning the application of  any other sentencing guideline has\r\nbeen entered  into by  the parties.    All other  aspects of  the\r\nsentence are left to the sound discretion of the Court.\" \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n          When counsel for Pacheco-Rijos  moved for a three-level\r\n\nadjustment for  acceptance of responsibility, the  court accepted\r\n\nit  both because  the  plea agreement  had  contemplated such  an\r\n\nadjustment  and because he  found Pacheco-Rijos'  conduct merited\r\n\nit.  He accepted an  offense level of 25, with a  guideline range\r\n\nof 57 to 71 months. \r\n\n          However, when  counsel requested the application of the\r\n\nsafety valve provision, 21 U.S.C.   3553(f) and U.S.S.G.   5C1.2,\r\n\nand,  if  granted,  a   further  two-level  reduction  for  minor\r\n\nparticipant status under U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(b), requests that were\r\n\nnot  in the plea agreement, the district court declined to accept\r\n\nthem.  The appellant argued that she met all the requirements  of\r\n\nthe safety valve provision.  The government responded that, among\r\n\nother things,  Pacheco-Rijos had failed honestly  to disclose her\r\n\nown  participation in the conspiracy.18  In support of its claim,\r\n\nthe government stated  simply that  her failure  \"can be  gleaned\r\n\nfrom the Presentence Report in this case.\"  \r\n\n          The prosecutor's citation to the PSR is perplexing.  It\r\n\nappears that initially the PSR had not placed Pacheco-Rijos among\r\n\nthe defendants for  whom the government had  designated a minimal\r\n\nor  minor  role,  but  among  those for  whom  no  role  had been\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n18  The government  also argued that although this  defendant did\r\nnot  participate in conduct that  led to death  or serious bodily\r\ninjury  to  any  person,  others  in  the  conspiracy  did,  thus\r\nrendering her ineligible  for the  benefits of  the safety  valve\r\nprovision.   The district court  did not  address this  argument,\r\nfinding that Pacheco-Rijos  did not qualify for relief  under the\r\nsafety valve provision because she failed to cooperate fully.\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n\"adjudicated.\"19   However, after reviewing the  objection of the\r\n\ndefendant with  respect to  the scope  of her  participation, the\r\n\nprobation officer,  in the final PSR,  adopted Pacheco-Rijos' own\r\n\nview  of  her  participation,20   designating  her  as  a  \"minor\r\n\nparticipant\" and characterizing her role as \"passive.\"\r\n\n          Notwithstanding,  the  sentencing   judge  denied   the\r\n\nrequest  for  relief from  the  mandatory minimum  sentence.   He\r\n\nsummarily concluded: \"5C1.2  does not apply, because she  has not\r\n\ncooperated fully as required by  guideline Section 5C1.2(5).\"  In\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n19  The PSRs for all of the appellants contained the same factual\r\nrecitation  and structure.   It  therefore merits  some attention\r\nthat  Rivera-DeCelis' PSR,  prepared before  Pacheco-Rijos' final\r\nPSR, contained the following: \"[b]ased on the defendants' role in\r\nthe  drug enterprise\"  other  defendants were  identified by  the\r\ngovernment   as   being   \"minimal   participants,\"   or   \"minor\r\nparticipants,\" while Pacheco-Rijos was listed among those who had\r\n\"not been adjudicated any role adjustment\" since she, along  with\r\nothers, were \"considered equally  culpable in their participation\r\nin the offense.\" \r\n\n    After  Pacheco-Rijos  objected  to  the  probation  officer's\r\nfailure  to designate  her as  a minor  participant, the  PSR was\r\naltered, not only in  terms of the ultimate calculation  but also\r\nin terms of the factual recitation.   In her final PSR, the facts\r\nindicated  that the  \"government identified\"  Pacheco-Rijos as  a\r\nminor participant. \r\n\n20   Before  sentencing,  counsel for  Pacheco-Rijos submitted  a\r\nwritten statement concerning  the defendant's involvement in  the\r\noffense and  specifically elaborating on her  contention that she\r\nhad  a role  in the  enterprise but  one more  limited than  that\r\nsuggested  in  the  indictment.   She  conceded  that  other  co-\r\ndefendants used Pacheco-Rijos' home as a place to pack controlled\r\nsubstances, that she knew generally of these  activities and that\r\nshe did  little to  stop it.  She denied ever  handling money  or\r\ndrugs in the illegal  operation and ever being at all involved in\r\nthe  possession  or  concealment  of firearms.    Further,  while\r\nPacheco-Rijos lived with three of the co-defendants in this case,\r\nLuis Antonio Garc a, Agustin Aponte-Merced and Juan Jos  Miranda-\r\nSantiago, she vowed to having no other knowledge of their illegal\r\nacts.  \r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\naddition, he stated: \"And besides that, there is a stipulation in\r\n\nthe plea agreement [that]  she be sentenced to  60 months.   That\r\n\nwas  good  enough in  September, [so  it]  should be  good enough\r\n\ntoday.\"\r\n\n          In the  light  of his  rejection  of the  safety  valve\r\n\nprovision, the judge indicated that there was no need to consider\r\n\nwhether  Pacheco-Rijos  should  have   been  given  a   two-level\r\n\nadjustment based on her  role in the offense, an  adjustment that\r\n\nwould  have  brought  her  sentence under  the  Guidelines  still\r\n\nfurther below the 60 month statutory minimum.21\r\n\n          Continuing  the  same  apparent  misapprehension  under\r\n\nwhich he labored from the beginning, the district judge concluded\r\n\nthe sentencing  hearing by  reiterating: \"I  should make it  very\r\n\nclear on this record that her plea agreement was an 11 -- Federal\r\n\nRule Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C)  plea.  And therefore the  60\r\n\nmonths that I have given her was precisely what she bargained for\r\n\nduring the plea negotiations.\"\r\n\n              2.  Legal Analysis:  The Safety Valve Provision\r                        2.

And we're going to leave it at\r\n25. .  . .  This  Court understands  that  the defendant  is  not\r\nentitled toa minorparticipant adjustmentunderU.S.S.G.  3B1.2(b).\"\r\n    This  conclusion is  at odds  with the  district court's  own\r\njudgment in this case, in  which the court states that it  adopts\r\nthe  findings  and  sentence  calculations  of  the  PSR  without\r\nexception.  The PSR, however, had granted Pacheco-Rijos the minor\r\nparticipant adjustment.\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nminimum sentence for the drug trafficking in which she admits she\r\n\nwas   involved.

The\r                             \r\n\ngovernment  responds  that  the  sentencing  court  appropriately\r\n\ndetermined that she was  not entitled, in the first  instance, to\r\n\nrelief  from the mandatory minimum,  and that, in  any event, the\r\n\ndistrict court's decision does not amount to clear error.\r\n\n          We review for clear  error the district court's factual\r\n\ndeterminations with respect to whether the appellant was entitled\r\n\nto  relief from  the mandatory  minimum under  U.S.S.G.    5C1.2.\r\n\nUnited  States  v.

The\r\n\nreview  is complicated  by the  paucity of  detail in  the record\r\n\nbelow  and our concern for two obvious mistakes in the sentencing\r\n\nhearing  which shaped the outcome: first, that the district court\r\n\nwrongly  believed that the plea  agreement was a  binding one and\r\n\nPacheco-Rijos  was arguing for an  outcome for which  she had not\r\n\nnegotiated;  and  second,  that  the PSR  somehow  supported  the\r\n\ngovernment's position  on Pacheco-Rijos' cooperation, when it did\r\n\nnot. \r\n\n          When Congress enacted the Violent Crime Control and Law\r\n\nEnforcement  Act of  1994,  it passed  into  law a  safety  valve\r\n\nprovision  which permits judicial  departures for some low-level,\r\n\nfirst-time offenders  who otherwise would  face mandatory minimum\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nsentences.  Pub. L.  No. 103-322    80001,  108 Stat.  1796, 1985\r\n\n(1994)(amending 18 U.S.C.   3553).22       \r\n\n          Under 18  U.S.C.   3553(f),  a defendant may  avoid the\r\n\nmandatory minimum and be sentenced below the applicable guideline\r\n\nterm, if he or she  meets the five requirements set forth  in the\r\n\nprovision.  The section provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n          . . . the court shall impose a sentence . . .\r\n          without  regard  to  any   statutory  minimum\r\n          sentence,  if the court  finds at sentencing,\r\n          after  the Government  has been  afforded the\r\n          opportunity to make a recommendation, that:\r\n          (1) the  defendant does not have  more than 1\r\n          criminal history point,  as determined  under\r\n          the sentencing guidelines;\r\n          (2)  that defendant did  not use  violence or\r\n          credible  threats  of violence  or  possess a\r\n          firearm or other  dangerous weapon (or induce\r\n          another  participant to do  so) in connection\r\n          with the offense;\r\n          (3) the  offense did  not result in  death or\r\n          serious bodily injury to any person;\r\n          (4)  the  defendant  was  not  an  organizer,\r\n          leader, manager,  or supervisor of  others in\r\n          the offense . . .; and (5) not later than the\r\n          time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant\r\n          has truthfully provided to the Government all\r\n          information  and  evidence the  defendant has\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n22    The  safety valve  provision  was  enacted  in response  to\r\nconcerns  that mandatory  minimums  are not  compatible with  the\r\nguideline regime.   The provision addressed  the following irony:\r\nMandatory  minimums had,  and  have, little  real  impact on  the\r\nsentences  received  by  serious  repeat   offenders,  where  the\r\nguideline calculation arrives at a base offense level higher than\r\nthe mandatory minimum, and where mitigating factors may therefore\r\nbe considered.  Prior to passage of the section 3553(f), however,\r\nfor the least culpable  offenders, mandatory minimums operated to\r\nblock sentences from reflecting  the very mitigating factors that\r\ncould ease sentences  of the more  culpable.  Ironically,  courts\r\nwere  obliged  to  impose  upon  the  least  culpable  defendants\r\nsentences similar to those imposed on more culpable counterparts.\r\nAs  a House Report noted, the safety valve provision was designed\r\nto \"permit . . . greater integration between sentencing guideline\r\nmitigating  factors  and mandatory  minimums .  .  .\"   H.R.

Notably,\r\n\nwhether there  is a  binding plea agreement  or, as here,  a non-\r\n\nbinding agreement, if it  is determined that a defendant  has met\r\n\nthe  five requirements of the provision, the judge is required to\r\n\nset aside the  mandatory minimum and sentence the defendant under\r\n\nthe Guidelines.  \r\n\n          In this case, the  district judge denied application of\r\n\nthe  safety  valve  provision,  focusing  only on  the  issue  of\r\n\nPacheco-Rijos'   cooperation.23      Apparently   accepting   the\r\n\ngovernment's  argument that  the facts  which could  be \"gleaned\"\r\n\nfrom the PSR supported denying application of section 3553(f)(5),\r\n\nthe judge  determined that  Pacheco-Rijos did not  deserve relief\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n23   As  to  the other  requirements, there  is  no dispute  that\r\nPacheco-Rijos  was a first-time offender  and that she  was not a\r\nmanager  or leader  of the  conspiracy.   Nor has  the government\r\ncontended that she used  threats of violence in carrying  out her\r\nrole.  The disputes arose in the context of sections 3553(f)(3) &amp;\r\n(5).   At  sentencing, the  government contended  that:   (1) the\r\noffense to which  she pled guilty involved  serious bodily injury\r\nor death; and  (2) that  Pacheco-Rijos failed to  meet the  final\r\nrequirement of the safety valve provision, namely, that she fully\r\ndisclose her involvement  in the  offense.  As  noted above,  the\r\ncourt addressed only the government's second argument.\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nfrom  her mandatory  minimum sentence because  she had  failed to\r\n\n\"cooperate  fully.\"    In  so deciding,  he  also  stressed  that\r\n\nPacheco-Rijos had  not negotiated  for relief from  the mandatory\r\n\nminimum  in  her plea  agreement,  an agreement  which,  as noted\r\n\nabove, he incorrectly believed to be binding.   \r\n\n          Section 3553(f)(5) requires that defendants \"truthfully\r\n\nprovide  the  government\" no  later  than at  sentencing  all the\r\n\ninformation  they have  regarding \"the  offense or  offenses that\r\n\nwere  part of  the same  course of  conduct or  part of  a common\r\n\nscheme or plan.\"  18 U.S.C.   3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.  \r\n\n          Questions  with   respect  to  the  scope   of  both  a\r\n\ndefendant's duty to \"provide\" information -- and the  very nature\r\n\nof  that information -- have  already confronted this  Court.  In\r\n\nUnited  States v. Wrenn,  66 F.3d 1,  3 (1st Cir.  1995), we held\r                                 \r\n\nthat  where the  only  disclosure  to  the  government  was  made\r\n\ninadvertently  -- and  through  the government's  own efforts  to\r\n\nintercept the defendant's  conversations -- that defendant  could\r\n\nnot be said to have \"provided\" the information to the government.\r\n\nFurther,  the  Wrenn Court  noted  that where  the  defendant had\r                              \r\n\nindicated  that he knew the  identity of customers  involved in a\r\n\ndrug trafficking enterprise, but he refused to provide any names,\r\n\nit  certainly  was  not  erroneous  for  the  district  court  to\r\n\ndetermine  that  the  defendant   had  failed  to  provide  \"all\"\r\n\ninformation which he concededly had.  Id.\r                                                   \r\n\n           The question of scope  was further addressed in United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

While we determined that section 3553(f)(5) does\r             \r\n\nnot require that much,24  we agreed with the district  court that\r\n\nwhat the defendant provided in that case was patently inadequate.\r\n\nFor although Monta ez agreed  that he was supplied drugs  that he\r\n\nthen delivered, he  offered no  plausible reason why  he did  not\r\n\nprovide the  government with  the  names of  his drug  suppliers.\r\n\nUnder the circumstances, we found that Monta ez \"did not disclose\r\n\ninformation that he might reasonably be expected to  possess, nor\r\n\npersuasively explain its absence.\"   Id. at 523; see  also Wrenn,\r                                                                          \r\n\n66 F.3d at 3.\r\n\n          This  case is  not  like  Wrenn  or  Monta ez.    In  a\r                                                                 \r\n\nsubmission  by her counsel, included as part of her PSR, Pacheco-\r\n\nRijos  explained the limits of her involvement in the conspiracy:\r\n\nShe  was a passive participant, knowing that drugs were stored in\r\n\nthe house and doing little  to stop it.  She said that  she never\r\n\nhandled the drugs, nor was she aware of the firearms.\r\n\n          That  characterization   was  never  objected   to  nor\r\n\nexplicitly  contradicted  by  the government.    Furthermore,  it\r\n\nappears to have been accepted  by the probation department  whose\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n24  The  fact that a full debriefing is  not statutorily required\r\ndoes  not provide a  full answer to  the question.   The Monta ez\r                                                                           \r\nCourt  noted:  \"[A]s a practical matter, a defendant who declines\r\nto offer himself for a debriefing takes a very dangerous course.\"\r\nMonta ez, 82 F.3d at 523. \r                  \r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\namended  report  recommended granting  Pacheco-Rijos  a two-level\r\n\nadjustment as a minor  participant and specifically characterized\r\n\nher as a \"passive\" member of the conspiracy.\r\n\n          While it is entirely  possible that a minor participant\r\n\nin  the criminal activities  might know more  than her designated\r\n\nrole  suggests, the  government  offered nothing  concrete to  so\r\n\nindicate.  In this case, as distinguished from Wrenn or Monta ez,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthe government did not rebut a facially plausible tale of limited\r\n\ninvolvement by  pointing to information this  defendant must have\r\n\nknown; there was no allegation that this defendant knew the names\r\n\nof  drug suppliers  or customers  and refused  to indicate  those\r\n\nnames.  There was no specific information the  government alleged\r\n\nthat Pacheco-Rijos had and failed to provide. \r\n\n          The government  cannot assure success simply by saying,\r\n\n\"We  don't believe the defendant,\" and doing nothing more.  If it\r\n\ncould,   it  would   effectively  eliminate   the  self-conscious\r\n\ndifference between the safety  valve provision, U.S.S.G.   5C1.2,\r\n\nwhich obligates the district court  to determine if the defendant\r\n\nhas truthfully provided all information, see Monta ez, 82 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n523, and the substantial  assistance provision, U.S.S.G.   5K1.1,\r\n\nwhich permits,  upon the government's  motion and at  the court's\r\n\ndiscretion, a downward adjustment for certain defendants who have\r\n\nprovided substantial assistance to the government.25  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n25   By  this analysis,  we  do not  suggest  any change  in  the\r\ndefendant's ultimate burden of proof under U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.  The\r\ndefendant  plainly has the burden of  proving, by a preponderance\r\nof  the evidence,  entitlement to  relief under  section 3553(f).\r\nHowever,   where  a   defendant  in   her  submissions   credibly\r\n\n                               -30-\r\r\n\n          In  the PSR,  there was one  conceivable basis  for the\r\n\ngovernment's position,  a basis which, standing  alone, is wholly\r\n\ninadequate:  that because  Pacheco-Rijos  shared living  quarters\r\n\nwith other  co-defendants,26 she  must have had  more information\r\n\nthan she provided to the government. \r\n\n          Section  3553(f)(5) does  not invite  such speculation.\r\n\nIf  mere conjecture  based  on personal  relationships could  bar\r\n\napplication  of  section 3553(f)(5),  in  all  cases where  minor\r\n\nparticipants  knew   others  more  involved,  the   safety  valve\r\n\nprovision would  be beyond  their grasp.   Such a result  was not\r\n\nintended by  Congress and cannot  be permitted here.   Therefore,\r\n\ndistrict  court's  bare  conclusion  that  Pacheco-Rijos  did not\r\n\n\"cooperate fully,\"  absent either  specific  factual findings  or\r\n\neasily  recognizable support in  the record, cannot  be enough to\r\n\nthwart her  effort to  avoid imposition  of  a mandatory  minimum\r\n\nsentence.27 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ndemonstrates  that she has  provided the government  with all the\r\ninformation she  reasonably was expected to  possess, Monta ez 82\r                                                                        \r\nF.3d at 523, in order to defeat her claim, the government must at\r\nleast come forward with some sound reason to suggest otherwise.  \r\n\n26   One  co-defendant apparently  shared a  somewhat independent\r\nliving quarters with Pacheco-Rijos' daughter. \r\n\n27  We note one other strong inference from the record:  that the\r\ndistrict court did not  apply this provision out of  deference to\r\nthe plea agreement into  which the parties had entered  and which\r\nhe  erroneously believed  would  be completely  voided unless  he\r\naccepted the  sentencing terms.  This  was not the case.   In any\r\nevent, a plea agreement -- even a binding one -- does not replace\r\nthe independent determination of the district court as to whether\r\nthis provision applies.   See Carrozza, 4 F.3d at  87; U.S.S.G.  \r                                                \r\n6B1.2(c) &amp; commentary. \r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\n          Accordingly,  we vacate  the sentence  and remand  this\r\n\ncase  for the purpose of  allowing the district  court to revisit\r\n\nthis  issue  and  clarify   the  record  by  filing  supplemental\r\n\nfindings.28   In  the  event that  the  court finds  its  initial\r\n\ncalculation  in error, it should so identify and return, as well,\r\n\nto the  issue of  other adjustments,  if  appropriate, under  the\r\n\nGuidelines.\r\n\n          C.

Facts\r\n\n          Appellant Miranda-Santiago was indicted on the drug and\r\n\nfirearms  charges detailed in Counts One, Three, Four and Five of\r\n\nthe superseding  indictment in this  case.   At his  arraignment,\r\n\nMiranda-Santiago pled not guilty to all charges.  On September 7,\r\n\n1994, he  offered to change  his plea  to guilty.   Under a  plea\r\n\nagreement  entered  into  pursuant  to Rule  11(e)(1)(A)  &amp;  (B),\r\n\nMiranda-Santiago offered  to plead guilty to  Count One, charging\r\n\nhim  with  possession with  intent  to  distribute narcotics,  21\r\n\nU.S.C.    846.  In addition, the parties recommended to the court\r\n\na  base offense  level of  30, with  a three-level  reduction for\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G.   3E1.1(b)(1) &amp; (2),\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n28  The remaining argument  made by the government below  -- that\r\nthe  offense  involved serious  bodily  injury  or death  thereby\r\ndisqualifying Pacheco-Rijos from the benefits of the safety valve\r\nprovision  --  lacks merit.   It  therefore  does not  provide an\r\nalternative  reason  to  affirm the  district  court's  decision.\r\nIndeed, the government has all but abandoned the argument in this\r\nforum.\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nresulting in  a  sentencing range  of  70 -  87  months.29   More\r\n\nspecifically,  the parties  agreed to  ask for  a sentence  of 84\r\n\nmonths.\r\n\n            The Miranda-Santiago PSR  contained the same  general\r\n\nrecital  of the  facts  as  that  contained  in  the  other  PSRs\r\n\ndiscussed  above.     As   to  Miranda-Santiago's  role   in  the\r\n\nenterprise, the PSR  indicated that  this defendant  worked as  a\r\n\ndrug  distributor.   He was  not identified  as someone  who used\r\n\nfirearms  or provided  protection  for the  operation.   The  PSR\r\n\ndesignated   him  as   a  minor   participant  in   the  offense.\r\n\nNotwithstanding  that  finding,  the  probation  officer did  not\r\n\ninclude a two-level downward adjustment as part of the sentencing\r\n\ncalculation.  The PSR recommended a base level of 30, with only a\r\n\nthree-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  \r\n\n          The  appellant  was  sentenced  on  January  11,  1995.\r\n\nDuring  the  hearing, the  defendant voiced  no objection  to the\r\n\nfindings  contained in  the  PSR.30   Although he  did not  do so\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n29  The  parties had recommended  that, for sentencing  purposes,\r\nthe  defendant be held  accountable for at least  3.5 but no more\r\nthan 5 kilograms of cocaine.  Accordingly, the base offense level\r\nin this  case was set at  30.  U.S.S.G.    2D1.1.   The defendant\r\nfaced a mandatory minimum five year term of imprisonment under 21\r\nU.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B).  \r\n\n30  The  district judge  asked the defendant's  counsel if  there\r\nwere any objections to the PSR. He reported that there were  none\r\nand did not ask the  district court judge to make  specific role-\r\nin-the-offense findings.  The  judge also asked the defendant  if\r\nhe  had  reviewed  the  PSR  with his  attorney  and  if  he  any\r\nobjections  to  it.    Miranda-Santiago  responded  that  he  had\r\ndiscussed the report with  counsel and that he had  no objections\r\nto it.\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nduring the sentencing hearing, in the written judgment the  judge\r\n\nadopted  the  PSR's factual  findings,  without  exception.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court arrived  at  a  base  offense  level  of  27  and\r\n\nsentenced  Miranda-Santiago  to  a  prison  term  of  78  months,\r\n\neighteen months above the mandatory minimum for that offense.\r\n\n                  2.

Legal   Analysis:       Minor   Participant\r\n\nAdjustment\r          Adjustment\r\n\n          On  appeal,  Miranda-Santiago challenges  his sentence,\r\n\narguing  that the district court  erred by failing  to adjust his\r\n\noffense  level downward two levels  for his role  in the offense.\r\n\nThe appellant  contends that  since the sentencing  court adopted\r\n\nthe  factual findings  of  the PSR,  the  decision not  to  grant\r\n\nMiranda-Santiago  a  minor participant  adjustment  was a  simple\r\n\nmisapplication of the Guidelines.   Our review -- notwithstanding\r\n\nthe appellant's failure  to raise  the issue below  -- should  be\r\n\nplenary and the sentence vacated.\r\n\n          The  government disagrees  and makes,  essentially, two\r\n\narguments: First, it contends that,  as a procedural matter, this\r\n\nCourt ought not review this issue because the appellant waived is\r\n\nrights by not raising the question below.  Second, the government\r\n\nasserts  that, even  if the  issue is  not waived,  the appellant\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n    Before this Court, appellant  argues that he nor his  counsel\r\nnoticed the  inconsistency within the report. Defendant's counsel\r\nnotes that Miranda-Santiago is  illiterate, having only stayed in\r\nschool  through the  sixth grade  and that  since he  is Spanish-\r\nspeaking  and does not understand English, his only review of the\r\nPSR came through an oral translation of its nineteen pages.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nchallenges  a   factual  determination  at  sentencing   and  the\r\n\ndetermination was not clear error.  \r\n\n          We will consider each  of the government's arguments in\r\n\nturn.\r\n\n                      a.  Waiver\r                                a.  Waiver\r\n\n          The government argues that Miranda-Santiago, in voicing\r\n\nno objection  to the PSR at  sentencing, has waived  his right to\r\n\nraise this  issue on  appeal. The appellant  argues that  neither\r\n\ncounsel  nor   the  appellant   noticed  the  error,   and  that,\r\n\nparticularly  given  the pressures  put  on  non-English speaking\r\n\ndefendants with respect to lengthy reports only orally translated\r\n\ninto  Spanish, the absence of an  objection should not constitute\r\n\nwaiver.\r\n\n          We find that this defendant, given these circumstances,\r\n\nforfeited his rights but  did not waive them.   The difference is\r\n\ncritical: \"Whereas forfeiture  is the  failure to  make a  timely\r\n\nassertion of  a right, waiver is  the 'intentional relinquishment\r\n\nor abandonment of a known  right.'\"  United States v.  Olano, 507\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 725, 733  (1993); see also  Carrozza, 4 F.3d  at 87 &amp;  n.13.\r                                                   \r\n\nUnder Olano, the defendant who forfeited his right is entitled to\r                     \r\n\nreview  for plain  error.   This  is a  compelling  case for  the\r\n\ndoctrine.  After all, the claimed error could well have an impact\r\n\non the length of defendant's incarceration.\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\n                      b.  Standard of Review\r                                b.  Standard of Review\r\n\n          The standard  of review  is nonetheless imposing.   The\r\n\nappellant  seeks the benefit of a plenary review of the question.\r\n\nWe disagree.   Where a  defendant has failed  to raise the  legal\r\n\nissue below,   the issue can be examined only  for plain error.31\r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); Olano, 507 U.S. at 730-32. \r                                       \r\n\n                      c.  Minor Participant Adjustment\r                                c.  Minor Participant Adjustment\r\n\n          When a  defendant  is determined  to  be a  \"minor\"  or\r\n\n\"minimal\" participant in criminal activity, a sentencing court is\r\n\ndirected to decrease the base offense level. U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(a)\r\n\n&amp; (b).32    A minor  participant  is one  \"who  plays a  part  in\r\n\ncommitting the offense that makes him substantially less culpable\r\n\nthan  the  average  participant.\"    U.S.S.G.     3B1.2,  comment\r\n\n(backg'd).33\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n31    The  plain  error  standard  requires  that  the  appellant\r\ndemonstrate that:  (1) there was an  \"error;\" (2) it was \"plain;\"\r\nand  (3) it affected  \"the substantial rights\"  of the defendant.\r\nE.g.,  United States  v. Olano,  507  U.S. at  732-33. Even  if a\r                                        \r\ndefendant  meets the  standard  established by  the Olano  Court,\r                                                                   \r\nappellate courts  maintain discretion to recognize  the error and\r\nare directed to consider whether the error affects \"the fairness,\r\nintegrity or  public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n732, 735. \r\n\n32  Minimal participation  merits a four-level decrease; U.S.S.G.\r\n  1B1.2(a);  minor  participation  merits  a  two-level decrease,\r\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.2(b).\r\n\n    The appellant contends -- and the government initially agreed\r\n-- that Miranda-Santiago was a minor participant in the  criminal\r\nenterprise.    \r\n\n33  The  defendant carries the  burden of proving  that he was  a\r\nminor participant entitled to a two-level decrease under U.S.S.G.\r\n  3B1.2.  E.g.,  United States  v. Ocasio-Rivera, 991  F.2d 1,  3\r                                                          \r\n(1st Cir. 1993).  \r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\n          On appeal, Miranda-Santiago argues that he was entitled\r\n\nto  that  reduction, that,  indeed,  the  district court  adopted\r\n\nfactual findings consistent with  granting the reduction and that\r\n\nthe Court committed plain error in denying him the benefit of the\r\n\nrole-in-the-offense adjustment.   The government  argues that the\r\n\ndefendant  was not  entitled  to  the  adjustment  in  the  first\r\n\ninstance  and that the sentencing should not be disturbed at this\r\n\nlate hour, in any event.\r\n\n          The appellant has the better argument. \r\n\n          It is  a fundamental obligation of a  district court at\r\n\nsentencing to \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition\r\n\nof the particular sentence.\"  19 U.S.C.   3553(c).  To accomplish\r\n\nthis goal,  the court  ordinarily must make  \"reasonably specific\r\n\nfindings\" and \"explain, generally, how it computed the applicable\r\n\nguideline range.\"  United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1012\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).  \r\n\n          This obligation has become particularly  critical since\r\n\nthe enactment of the Sentencing  Guidelines.  Under the guideline\r\n\nregime, factual  determinations made by the  sentencing judge may\r\n\nhave   a   profound  effect   on   the   length  of   defendant's\r\n\nincarceration.   Ensuring  our  ability to  engage in  meaningful\r\n\nreview of those  findings is essential.   So while we have  found\r\n\nthat  a  sentencing  court  can comply  with  section  3553(c) by\r\n\nadopting  findings from  the  PSR, see,  e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSavoie,  985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir. 1993), this technique cannot\r                \r\n\nbe  employed  when  the  PSR  itself  is  unclear  or  inherently\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\ncontradictory.    Moreover,  we have  repeatedly  urged  district\r\n\ncourts, in  the interests of buttressing  sentencing calculations\r\n\nand facilitating appellate review, to make certain that the bases\r\n\nof  the calculations are clearly set forth.  See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nVan, 87 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1996) (collecting cases).    \r             \r\n\n          In this case, the  district judge made few findings  at\r\n\nthe sentencing hearing.   In his judgment, he simply  adopted the\r\n\nPSR,  in toto.   There is a  problem with that  procedure in this\r\n\ncase:  The PSR,  as  best we  can  decipher it,  judged  Miranda-\r\n\nSantiago a minor participant in the conspiracy.  It was merely in\r\n\ncalculating the sentence that this finding did not translate into\r\n\na  two-level downward adjustment.  The  record therefore does not\r\n\nprovide  an  adequate  factual  basis for  the  district  court's\r\n\ndetermination with respect to Miranda-Santiago's role.\r\n\n          This error  is clear, obvious, and  potentially affects\r\n\nthe appellant's substantial rights.   Accordingly, we vacate this\r\n\nsentence  and  remand this  case to  the  district court  for the\r\n\npurpose  of  having the  court  file  supplemental findings  with\r\n\nrespect to appellant Miranda-Santiago's role in the offense.   In\r\n\nthe event that the district court finds its computation in error,\r\n\nthe court should include such a determination in its findings.  \r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.

In September of 1994, these defendant-appellants, along with twenty-one co-defendants, pled guilty to participation in a drug distribution conspiracy spanning over a year and involving trafficking in crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, as well as using or brandishing firearms, and engaging in carjacking to facilitate their drug trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were arraigned in two groups, pled guilty before the same judge and were sentenced before him by early 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ismael Rivera-DeCelis contends that his guilty plea was entered in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and that the district judge erred in calculating his sentence.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.  He did not press the first point below.  We find that the plea colloquy in his case conformed with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and that the sentence calculations with respect to him were not in error.  Accordingly, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carmen Pacheco-Rijos challenges her sentence, arguing that the district court erred in imposing the mandatory minimum required for her offense.  Her attack is based on her claim that she met the conditions set forth in the \"safety valve provision\" of the Sentencing Guidelines.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.  We find the record inadequate to justify the district court's decision not to grant relief.  Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand the case for the purpose of allowing the district court to revisit this issue and to clarify the record by filing supplemental findings.  In the event that the court finds its initial calculation in error, it should so identify and return, as well, to the issue of other adjustments, if appropriate, under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juan Jose Miranda-Santiago also attacks his sentence, arguing that the sentencing court erred, as a matter of law, by failing to grant a two-level downward adjustment based on a finding that the defendant was a \"minor participant\" in the criminal activity.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b).  We find inadequate support in the record for the court's conclusion that a downward adjustment was inappropriate.  We vacate this sentence and remand the case to the district court for the purpose of having the court file supplemental findings with respect to appellant Miranda-Santiago's role in the offense.  In the event that the court finds its computation in error, it should include such a determination in its findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an overview of events involving the three appellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1994 a grand jury returned an indictment against 19 defendants, including appellants Pacheco-Rijos and Miranda-Santiago, charging them with conspiracy to distribute drugs, and with using firearms in connection with a drug offense.  Apparently, the conspirators hid drug substances, firearms and proceeds of drug sales in specific locations, guarded by members of the conspiracy.  Members of the conspiracy were also encouraged to commit--and committed--\"carjacking\" offenses;  armed, they would steal cars and then use the vehicles to transport drugs back to their storage locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment and the PSRs adopted by the appellants and the district court detailed a criminal enterprise with a strongly hierarchical structure;  some of the accused controlled the operation, while others served as drug runners and bodyguards.  A superseding indictment, returned on May 12, 1994, named five additional defendants, including appellant Rivera-DeCelis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When arraigned, each defendant entered a plea of not guilty.  In September of 1994, Rivera-DeCelis, Pacheco-Rijos and Miranda-Santiago, among others, offered to change their pleas with respect to certain charges.  After each plea colloquy, conducted individually, the court accepted the defendants' pleas.  Each was separately sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the facts with respect to each defendant and his or her legal challenges in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Ismael Rivera-DeCelis</p>\n    <p>1. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Rivera-DeCelis was alleged to have been involved in several phases of the drug conspiracy detailed in the superseding indictment.  He was charged in Count One with distributing not less than fifty grams of cocaine base, an amount of not less than five kilograms of cocaine, an amount of not less than one kilogram of heroin, and some amount of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846.  Counts Three, Four and Five charged him with possessing and brandishing various firearms in connection with his drug trafficking, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an initial plea of not guilty, on September 8, 1994, Rivera-DeCelis offered to change his plea to guilty to Count One's charge that he acted in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and Count Three's charge that he acted in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  The plea agreement was entered into under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It provided that the defendant would be held accountable at sentencing for the distribution of no less than 15 but no more than 50 kilograms of cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 34.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3).  The parties also agreed that the defendant was entitled to a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(1) &amp; (2), reducing his offense level to 31.  The parties further defined the term of imprisonment:  In light of the ten year mandatory minimum sentence facing Rivera-DeCelis under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), and a criminal history category of III, they stipulated to a 139 month term of confinement on Count One to be followed by a 60 month term on Count Three.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the plea colloquy, the district judge directly addressed Rivera-DeCelis.  He explained each charge, detailing, among other things, the time frame of the conspiracy in which the defendant allegedly was involved (roughly from January of 1993 through March of 1994), the elements of the offenses and the burden the government would have if it tried to prove its case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  He also explained to the defendant the sentences he faced and the consequences of his plea, inquired about coercion and made sure the defendant understood the particular strictures of a plea entered into under Rule 11(e)(1)(c).  The defendant agreed to the facts presented in the indictment, without asserting that there were any temporal limits to his personal involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the factual basis of the charges, the judge asked Rivera-DeCelis whether the defendant was \"recognizing [his guilt] ... for the drug conspiracy participation and also for the weapons or firearms count,\" and whether he acknowledged the punishment he could face.  Rivera-DeCelis answered in the affirmative to both questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the defendant challenged the drug amount attributed to him in the PSR.  Notwithstanding his earlier admissions, Rivera-DeCelis asserted that he was only involved in the conspiracy for three months and that the amount of cocaine reflected in the plea agreement was greater than the amount he could reasonably have foreseen would have been part of the conspiracy during his membership in it.  The government cast doubt on the short duration of Rivera-DeCelis' involvement, noting that he was pictured holding a gun and serving as a bodyguard for one of the conspiracy's leaders.  Logically, the prosecutor argued, such a responsibility would not devolve to a new and marginal member of the organization.  In any event, even within a 90 day period, the government contended, the daily quantities of drugs sold as part of the conspiracy would result in a drug offense level of over 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge did not accept the defendant's characterization of his involvement and rejected his challenge.  The judge noted that the benefits of this plea agreement to the defendant were substantial, since, for instance, no amount of crack cocaine was attributed to the defendant, a drug \"which all of them were dealing ... without a doubt.\"   Accordingly, the court adopted a base offense level of 34 and granted the defendant a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b).  Based on a criminal history category of III, Rivera-DeCelis was sentenced on the drug charge to a prison term of 139 months, at the lower end of the guideline range,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to be followed by a term of 60 months on the firearms charge.

The judge specifically explained both the elements of each offense and the factual accusations against the defendant.  As he walked Rivera-DeCelis through these aspects of the case against him, the judge inquired--at each turn--whether Rivera-DeCelis subjectively understood the situation.  The district judge also made sure that Rivera-DeCelis in fact grasped the consequences of his plea.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).  Only after assuring himself that Rivera-DeCelis understood the charges, the facts that formed their bases and the consequences of his plea, did the district judge ask Rivera-DeCelis to attest to the facts to which he was pleading guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consideration of other factors surrounding the plea does not yield a better result for the appellant.  With respect to the validity of the proffered reasons for requesting that we set aside Rivera-DeCelis' plea, we are not persuaded, particularly given the care with which the district judge directly addressed the defendant on each issue of central concern under Rule 11.  The timing of the request, made for the first time before an appellate court, also counsels against setting aside the plea.  The defendant made no assertion of legal innocence;  and, finally, the plea was offered pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district judge fully addressed the core concerns of Rule 11.

In the context of drug trafficking offenses, where sentences are driven largely by the amount of drugs for which a defendant is held accountable, \"the base offense level of a co-conspirator ... should reflect only the quantity of drugs he reasonably foresees is the object of the conspiracy to distribute after he joins the conspiracy.\"  United States v.

See, e.g., United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

At his plea hearing, Rivera-DeCelis accepted the factual recitation of the indictment, indicating an involvement in the conspiracy from January 1993 through March of 1994.  He also acknowledged knowing of trafficking in crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin and marijuana over that period of time.  His plea, indeed, situated him in the center of the conspiracy's activities, aware of its use of firearms as well as the extent of the drug dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge was not persuaded by defense counsel's explanation that he had urged his client to accept the plea because he was unsure he could confirm the circumscribed scope of the defendant's involvement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The defendant did little else to confirm that his vantage point was so distant from the main activity and he stood in that place for such a fleeting moment that he could not reasonably have foreseen that not less than 15 but not more than 50 kilograms of cocaine would be involved in the offense.  Notably, he never suggested--much less proved--a precise amount for which he should be held accountable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this shaky challenge, the government offered sturdy support for attributing the defendant with at least 15 to 50 kilograms of cocaine.  It reminded the sentencing court of the testimony of a co-conspirator, which had indicated that daily drug sales of which Rivera-DeCelis would have been aware amounted to well over 50 kilograms of cocaine in a matter of months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  It also cast doubt on the allegedly limited nature of Rivera-DeCelis' involvement by focusing the court's attention on a photograph in which Rivera-DeCelis is pictured, holding a firearm, as a bodyguard to the leader of the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, the district judge did not clearly err in adopting the government's reasoning, noting that the defendant reaped a benefit from the plea agreement and deciding that Rivera-DeCelis' base offense level should be 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore affirm the district court's sentencing determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the indictment returned in March of 1994, appellant Pacheco-Rijos was charged with four offenses:  Count One charged her with conspiracy to distribute drugs, in amounts of not less than fifty grams of cocaine base, not less than five kilograms of cocaine, not less than one kilogram of heroin, and some marijuana, from in or about January of 1993 until in or about March of 1994, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846;  Counts Three, Four and Five charged her, along with other co-defendants, with knowingly using and carrying firearms during and in relation to her drug trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 921(a)(3) &amp; (c)(1) &amp; 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pacheco-Rijos was arraigned on March 14, 1994, at which time she pled not guilty.  On September 7, 1994, she changed her plea to guilty to Count One, which charged her with violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Her plea was offered pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(A) &amp; (B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, under which the parties may recommend sentencing terms but those terms are not binding upon the court.  Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement recommended a base offense level of 28 under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 and a downward adjustment of three levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b), resulting in an offense level of 25.  The defendant acknowledged that although those preliminary calculations resulted in a guideline range of 57 to 71 months, she could receive a statutory minimum of 60 months imprisonment.  The agreement, however, left the door open for application of other provisions which might affect her sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the district judge mischaracterized the plea agreement as a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) agreement, under which the sentencing judge would be required to accept the agreement in toto or reject it, thereby allowing the defendant to withdraw her plea.  Such an agreement would have represented the parties' negotiations concerning all the guideline provisions that should determine the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pacheco-Rijos' plea agreement, however, did not pretend to such completeness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When counsel for Pacheco-Rijos moved for a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the court accepted it both because the plea agreement had contemplated such an adjustment and because he found Pacheco-Rijos' conduct merited it.  He accepted an offense level of 25, with a guideline range of 57 to 71 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, when counsel requested the application of the safety valve provision, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, and, if granted, a further two-level reduction for minor participant status under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b), requests that were not in the plea agreement, the district court declined to accept them.  The appellant argued that she met all the requirements of the safety valve provision.  The government responded that, among other things, Pacheco-Rijos had failed honestly to disclose her own participation in the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  In support of its claim, the government stated simply that her failure \"can be gleaned from the Presentence Report in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's citation to the PSR is perplexing.  It appears that initially the PSR had not placed Pacheco-Rijos among the defendants for whom the government had designated a minimal or minor role, but among those for whom no role had been \"adjudicated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  However, after reviewing the objection of the defendant with respect to the scope of her participation, the probation officer, in the final PSR, adopted Pacheco-Rijos' own view of her participation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> designating her as a \"minor participant\" and characterizing her role as \"passive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding, the sentencing judge denied the request for relief from the mandatory minimum sentence.  He summarily concluded:  \"5C1.2 does not apply, because she has not cooperated fully as required by guideline Section 5C1.2(5).\"   In addition, he stated:  \"And besides that, there is a stipulation in the plea agreement [that] she be sentenced to 60 months.  That was good enough in September, [so it] should be good enough today.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the light of his rejection of the safety valve provision, the judge indicated that there was no need to consider whether Pacheco-Rijos should have been given a two-level adjustment based on her role in the offense, an adjustment that would have brought her sentence under the Guidelines still further below the 60 month statutory minimum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Continuing the same apparent misapprehension under which he labored from the beginning, the district judge concluded the sentencing hearing by reiterating:  \"I should make it very clear on this record that her plea agreement was an 11--Federal Rule Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C) plea.  And therefore the 60 months that I have given her was precisely what she bargained for during the plea negotiations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>2.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.

The review is complicated by the paucity of detail in the record below and our concern for two obvious mistakes in the sentencing hearing which shaped the outcome:  first, that the district court wrongly believed that the plea agreement was a binding one and Pacheco-Rijos was arguing for an outcome for which she had not negotiated;  and second, that the PSR somehow supported the government's position on Pacheco-Rijos' cooperation, when it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Congress enacted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, it passed into law a safety valve provision which permits judicial departures for some low-level, first-time offenders who otherwise would face mandatory minimum sentences.

Notably, whether there is a binding plea agreement or, as here, a non-binding agreement, if it is determined that a defendant has met the five requirements of the provision, the judge is required to set aside the mandatory minimum and sentence the defendant under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district judge denied application of the safety valve provision, focusing only on the issue of Pacheco-Rijos' cooperation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Apparently accepting the government's argument that the facts which could be \"gleaned\" from the PSR supported denying application of section 3553(f)(5), the judge determined that Pacheco-Rijos did not deserve relief from her mandatory minimum sentence because she had failed to \"cooperate fully.\"   In so deciding, he also stressed that Pacheco-Rijos had not negotiated for relief from the mandatory minimum in her plea agreement, an agreement which, as noted above, he incorrectly believed to be binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(f)(5) requires that defendants \"truthfully provide the government\" no later than at sentencing all the information they have regarding \"the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or part of a common scheme or plan.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Questions with respect to the scope of both a defendant's duty to \"provide\" information--and the very nature of that information--have already confronted this Court.  In United States v. Wrenn, 66 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995), we held that where the only disclosure to the government was made inadvertently--and through the government's own efforts to intercept the defendant's conversations--that defendant could not be said to have \"provided\" the information to the government.  Further, the Wrenn Court noted that where the defendant had indicated that he knew the identity of customers involved in a drug trafficking enterprise, but he refused to provide any names, it certainly was not erroneous for the district court to determine that the defendant had failed to provide \"all\" information which he concededly had.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of scope was further addressed in United States v. Montanez, 82 F.3d 520 (1st Cir.1996), in which this Court confronted a slightly different question:  whether the requirement that a defendant truthfully provide \"all\" information established an affirmative duty on the part of that defendant to offer himself or herself up to the government for debriefing.  Id. at 522-523.   While we determined that section 3553(f)(5) does not require that much,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> we agreed with the district court that what the defendant provided in that case was patently inadequate.  For although Montanez agreed that he was supplied drugs that he then delivered, he offered no plausible reason why he did not provide the government with the names of his drug suppliers.  Under the circumstances, we found that Montanez \"did not disclose information that he might reasonably be expected to possess, nor persuasively explain its absence.\"  Id. at 523;  see also Wrenn, 66 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is not like Wrenn or Montanez.   In a submission by her counsel, included as part of her PSR, Pacheco-Rijos explained the limits of her involvement in the conspiracy:  She was a passive participant, knowing that drugs were stored in the house and doing little to stop it.  She said that she never handled the drugs, nor was she aware of the firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That characterization was never objected to nor explicitly contradicted by the government.  Furthermore, it appears to have been accepted by the probation department whose amended report recommended granting Pacheco-Rijos a two-level adjustment as a minor participant and specifically characterized her as a \"passive\" member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is entirely possible that a minor participant in the criminal activities might know more than her designated role suggests, the government offered nothing concrete to so indicate.  In this case, as distinguished from Wrenn or Montanez, the government did not rebut a facially plausible tale of limited involvement by pointing to information this defendant must have known;  there was no allegation that this defendant knew the names of drug suppliers or customers and refused to indicate those names.  There was no specific information the government alleged that Pacheco-Rijos had and failed to provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cannot assure success simply by saying, \"We don't believe the defendant,\" and doing nothing more.  If it could, it would effectively eliminate the self-conscious difference between the safety valve provision, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which obligates the district court to determine if the defendant has truthfully provided all information, see Montanez, 82 F.3d at 523, and the substantial assistance provision, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1, which permits, upon the government's motion and at the court's discretion, a downward adjustment for certain defendants who have provided substantial assistance to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the PSR, there was one conceivable basis for the government's position, a basis which, standing alone, is wholly inadequate:  that because Pacheco-Rijos shared living quarters with other co-defendants,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> she must have had more information than she provided to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(f)(5) does not invite such speculation.  If mere conjecture based on personal relationships could bar application of section 3553(f)(5), in all cases where minor participants knew others more involved, the safety valve provision would be beyond their grasp.  Such a result was not intended by Congress and cannot be permitted here.  Therefore, district court's bare conclusion that Pacheco-Rijos did not \"cooperate fully,\" absent either specific factual findings or easily recognizable support in the record, cannot be enough to thwart her effort to avoid imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand this case for the purpose of allowing the district court to revisit this issue and clarify the record by filing supplemental findings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  In the event that the court finds its initial calculation in error, it should so identify and return, as well, to the issue of other adjustments, if appropriate, under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Juan Jose Miranda-Santiago</p>\n    <p>1. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Miranda-Santiago was indicted on the drug and firearms charges detailed in Counts One, Three, Four and Five of the superseding indictment in this case.  At his arraignment, Miranda-Santiago pled not guilty to all charges.  On September 7, 1994, he offered to change his plea to guilty.  Under a plea agreement entered into pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(A) &amp; (B), Miranda-Santiago offered to plead guilty to Count One, charging him with possession with intent to distribute narcotics, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  In addition, the parties recommended to the court a base offense level of 30, with a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(1) &amp; (2), resulting in a sentencing range of 70-87 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  More specifically, the parties agreed to ask for a sentence of 84 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Miranda-Santiago PSR contained the same general recital of the facts as that contained in the other PSRs discussed above.  As to Miranda-Santiago's role in the enterprise, the PSR indicated that this defendant worked as a drug distributor.  He was not identified as someone who used firearms or provided protection for the operation.  The PSR designated him as a minor participant in the offense.  Notwithstanding that finding, the probation officer did not include a two-level downward adjustment as part of the sentencing calculation.  The PSR recommended a base level of 30, with only a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was sentenced on January 11, 1995.  During the hearing, the defendant voiced no objection to the findings contained in the PSR.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  Although he did not do so during the sentencing hearing, in the written judgment the judge adopted the PSR's factual findings, without exception.  The district court arrived at a base offense level of 27 and sentenced Miranda-Santiago to a prison term of 78 months, eighteen months above the mandatory minimum for that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>2. Legal Analysis:  Minor Participant Adjustment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Miranda-Santiago challenges his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by failing to adjust his offense level downward two levels for his role in the offense.  The appellant contends that since the sentencing court adopted the factual findings of the PSR, the decision not to grant Miranda-Santiago a minor participant adjustment was a simple misapplication of the Guidelines.  Our review--notwithstanding the appellant's failure to raise the issue below--should be plenary and the sentence vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government disagrees and makes, essentially, two arguments:  First, it contends that, as a procedural matter, this Court ought not review this issue because the appellant waived is rights by not raising the question below.  Second, the government asserts that, even if the issue is not waived, the appellant challenges a factual determination at sentencing and the determination was not clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will consider each of the government's arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>a. Waiver</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Miranda-Santiago, in voicing no objection to the PSR at sentencing, has waived his right to raise this issue on appeal.  The appellant argues that neither counsel nor the appellant noticed the error, and that, particularly given the pressures put on non-English speaking defendants with respect to lengthy reports only orally translated into Spanish, the absence of an objection should not constitute waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that this defendant, given these circumstances, forfeited his rights but did not waive them.  The difference is critical:  \"Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make a timely assertion of a right, waiver is the 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.' \"  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993);  see also Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 87 &amp; n. 13.   Under Olano, the defendant who forfeited his right is entitled to review for plain error.  This is a compelling case for the doctrine.  After all, the claimed error could well have an impact on the length of defendant's incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>b. Standard of Review</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review is nonetheless imposing.  The appellant seeks the benefit of a plenary review of the question.  We disagree.  Where a defendant has failed to raise the legal issue below, the issue can be examined only for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  Olano, 507 U.S. at 730-32, 113 S.Ct. at 1775-77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>c. Minor Participant Adjustment</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant is determined to be a \"minor\" or \"minimal\" participant in criminal activity, a sentencing court is directed to decrease the base offense level.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(a) &amp; (b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  A minor participant is one \"who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2, comment (backg'd).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Miranda-Santiago argues that he was entitled to that reduction, that, indeed, the district court adopted factual findings consistent with granting the reduction and that the Court committed plain error in denying him the benefit of the role-in-the-offense adjustment.  The government argues that the defendant was not entitled to the adjustment in the first instance and that the sentencing should not be disturbed at this late hour, in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has the better argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a fundamental obligation of a district court at sentencing to \"state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c).  To accomplish this goal, the court ordinarily must make \"reasonably specific findings\" and \"explain, generally, how it computed the applicable guideline range.\"  United States v. McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1012 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This obligation has become particularly critical since the enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines.  Under the guideline regime, factual determinations made by the sentencing judge may have a profound effect on the length of defendant's incarceration.  Ensuring our ability to engage in meaningful review of those findings is essential.  So while we have found that a sentencing court can comply with section 3553(c) by adopting findings from the PSR, see, e.g., United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st Cir.1993), this technique cannot be employed when the PSR itself is unclear or inherently contradictory.  Moreover, we have repeatedly urged district courts, in the interests of buttressing sentencing calculations and facilitating appellate review, to make certain that the bases of the calculations are clearly set forth.  See United States v. Van, 87 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1996) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district judge made few findings at the sentencing hearing.  In his judgment, he simply adopted the PSR, in toto.  There is a problem with that procedure in this case:  The PSR, as best we can decipher it, judged Miranda-Santiago a minor participant in the conspiracy.  It was merely in calculating the sentence that this finding did not translate into a two-level downward adjustment.  The record therefore does not provide an adequate factual basis for the district court's determination with respect to Miranda-Santiago's role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This error is clear, obvious, and potentially affects the appellant's substantial rights.  Accordingly, we vacate this sentence and remand this case to the district court for the purpose of having the court file supplemental findings with respect to appellant Miranda-Santiago's role in the offense.  In the event that the district court finds its computation in error, the court should include such a determination in its findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions of all appellants are affirmed.   The sentence of appellant Rivera-DeCelis is also affirmed.   The sentences of the appellants Pacheco-Rijos and Miranda-Santiago are vacated, and their cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District Court of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We consider the facts as set forth in the uncontested portions of the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") of each defendant, the information to which each defendant pled guilty, and the sentencing hearing transcripts.

Rule 11's core concerns oblige courts of appeals to review the challenged processes, since the Rule's strictures go to \" 'the fairness, integrity [and] public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"  Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d at 593 (citations omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The Allard Court noted:  \"There is no talismanic test for determining whether the core concerns of Rule 11 have been satisfied.

See United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1537 (1st Cir.1989), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 862, 112 S.Ct. 184, 116 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991);  Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.  As we have noted, \"these factors are relevant to the ultimate issue to be addressed, namely whether the plea was 'knowing, voluntary and intelligent within the meaning of [Fed.R.Crim.P.] 11.' \"  United States v.

If the district court had merely made sure that a dyslexic defendant with only eight years of formal schooling had read an indictment--without oral questioning to ensure actual understanding--we might find error.  See, e.g., United States v. Gray, 63 F.3d 57, 60-61 (1st Cir.1995) (reliance on a written document is an insufficient proxy for personal examination by the court)</p>\n        <p>That is not the case before us.  Given Rivera-DeCelis' particular circumstances, the district court's direct, probing and careful questioning of the defendant assures us that the trial judge was doing as Rule 11 requires, looking to the reality of the situation faced by the defendant and making sure that the defendant actually understood the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of his plea.  See Allard, 926 F.2d at 1245.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> When asked why the defendant would sign a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) agreement for a specific sentence, if he believed that the true nature of his involvement would result in a much lower sentence, the defendant's attorney explained:</p>\n        <p>... when I agreed to that, I was under the impression ... that three months could not be corroborated by the Government.  Now three months could be corroborated by the Government ... the amount of cocaine would--should--be less than the one in the indictment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The government made the following argument at sentencing:</p>\n        <p>MR. PEREIRA:  Your Honor, initially let me address the issue of the quantity of drugs so that the record is clear as to that.  We provided, of course, to this defendant as we did to all defendants, the grand jury transcripts of Ramn Alexandro Lpez and it's part of the record of this court....  [H]e is asked, have you ever heard in terms from anybody or your own estimation that a kilo of cocaine gets consumed or cooked into crack every 11 days?   The answer to that is, yes....</p>\n        <p>Now, even if we assume that this individual, that this present defendant, Ismael Rivera, participated in this conspiracy only 90 days, that is eight kilos of crack cocaine. 1.5 kilos of crack cocaine is a level 38 offense in the 1994 guidelines, so, [it] certainly covers the sentence which he agreed to.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We find the government's rendition wholly believable.  Where, as here, a view of the record is entirely plausible, the sentencing court's adoption of that view cannot amount to clear error.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 706 (1st Cir.1992)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> The underlying offense was 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), which prohibits the knowing or intentional manufacturing, distributing or possessing with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance.  She did not plead guilty to any firearms charges</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> The agreement stated:  \"The United States and defendant stipulate a sixty (60) month term of confinement.  No agreement concerning the application of any other sentencing guideline has been entered into by the parties.  All other aspects of the sentence are left to the sound discretion of the Court.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The government also argued that although this defendant did not participate in conduct that led to death or serious bodily injury to any person, others in the conspiracy did, thus rendering her ineligible for the benefits of the safety valve provision.  The district court did not address this argument, finding that Pacheco-Rijos did not qualify for relief under the safety valve provision because she failed to cooperate fully</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The PSRs for all of the appellants contained the same factual recitation and structure.  It therefore merits some attention that Rivera-DeCelis' PSR, prepared before Pacheco-Rijos' final PSR, contained the following:  \"[b]ased on the defendants' role in the drug enterprise\" other defendants were identified by the government as being \"minimal participants,\" or \"minor participants,\" while Pacheco-Rijos was listed among those who had \"not been adjudicated any role adjustment\" since she, along with others, were \"considered equally culpable in their participation in the offense.\"</p>\n        <p>After Pacheco-Rijos objected to the probation officer's failure to designate her as a minor participant, the PSR was altered, not only in terms of the ultimate calculation but also in terms of the factual recitation.  In her final PSR, the facts indicated that the \"government identified\" Pacheco-Rijos as a minor participant.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> Before sentencing, counsel for Pacheco-Rijos submitted a written statement concerning the defendant's involvement in the offense and specifically elaborating on her contention that she had a role in the enterprise but one more limited than that suggested in the indictment.  She conceded that other co-defendants used Pacheco-Rijos' home as a place to pack controlled substances, that she knew generally of these activities and that she did little to stop it.  She denied ever handling money or drugs in the illegal operation and ever being at all involved in the possession or concealment of firearms.  Further, while Pacheco-Rijos lived with three of the co-defendants in this case, Luis Antonio Garca, Agustin Aponte-Merced and Juan Jose Miranda-Santiago, she vowed to having no other knowledge of their illegal acts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Here again, the sentencing court focused on the plea agreement in a way that suggested he believed it to have been binding:  \"I'm going to leave it as it was in the plea agreement.  I will not honor that adjustment.  And we're going to leave it at 25....  This Court understands that the defendant is not entitled to a minor participant adjustment under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b).\"</p>\n        <p>This conclusion is at odds with the district court's own judgment in this case, in which the court states that it adopts the findings and sentence calculations of the PSR without exception.  The PSR, however, had granted Pacheco-Rijos the minor participant adjustment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The safety valve provision was enacted in response to concerns that mandatory minimums are not compatible with the guideline regime.  The provision addressed the following irony:  Mandatory minimums had, and have, little real impact on the sentences received by serious repeat offenders, where the guideline calculation arrives at a base offense level higher than the mandatory minimum, and where mitigating factors may therefore be considered.  Prior to passage of the section 3553(f), however, for the least culpable offenders, mandatory minimums operated to block sentences from reflecting the very mitigating factors that could ease sentences of the more culpable.  Ironically, courts were obliged to impose upon the least culpable defendants sentences similar to those imposed on more culpable counterparts.  As a House Report noted, the safety valve provision was designed to \"permit ... greater integration between sentencing guideline mitigating factors and mandatory minimums ...\" H.R.Rep. No. 460, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> As to the other requirements, there is no dispute that Pacheco-Rijos was a first-time offender and that she was not a manager or leader of the conspiracy.  Nor has the government contended that she used threats of violence in carrying out her role.  The disputes arose in the context of sections 3553(f)(3) &amp; (5).  At sentencing, the government contended that:  (1) the offense to which she pled guilty involved serious bodily injury or death;  and (2) that Pacheco-Rijos failed to meet the final requirement of the safety valve provision, namely, that she fully disclose her involvement in the offense.  As noted above, the court addressed only the government's second argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The fact that a full debriefing is not statutorily required does not provide a full answer to the question.  The Montanez Court noted:  \"[A]s a practical matter, a defendant who declines to offer himself for a debriefing takes a very dangerous course.\"  Montanez, 82 F.3d at 523</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> By this analysis, we do not suggest any change in the defendant's ultimate burden of proof under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.  The defendant plainly has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, entitlement to relief under section 3553(f).  However, where a defendant in her submissions credibly demonstrates that she has provided the government with all the information she reasonably was expected to possess, Montanez 82 F.3d at 523, in order to defeat her claim, the government must at least come forward with some sound reason to suggest otherwise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> One co-defendant apparently shared a somewhat independent living quarters with Pacheco-Rijos' daughter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> We note one other strong inference from the record:  that the district court did not apply this provision out of deference to the plea agreement into which the parties had entered and which he erroneously believed would be completely voided unless he accepted the sentencing terms.  This was not the case.  In any event, a plea agreement--even a binding one--does not replace the independent determination of the district court as to whether this provision applies.  See Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 87;  U.S.S.G. &#167; 6B1.2(c) &amp; commentary</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> The remaining argument made by the government below--that the offense involved serious bodily injury or death thereby disqualifying Pacheco-Rijos from the benefits of the safety valve provision--lacks merit.  It therefore does not provide an alternative reason to affirm the district court's decision.  Indeed, the government has all but abandoned the argument in this forum</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> The parties had recommended that, for sentencing purposes, the defendant be held accountable for at least 3.5 but no more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.  Accordingly, the base offense level in this case was set at 30.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1.  The defendant faced a mandatory minimum five year term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> The district judge asked the defendant's counsel if there were any objections to the PSR.

Miranda-Santiago responded that he had discussed the report with counsel and that he had no objections to it</p>\n        <p>Before this Court, appellant argues that he nor his counsel noticed the inconsistency within the report.

In September of 1994, these defendant-appellants, along with twenty-one co-defendants, pled guilty to participation in a drug distribution conspiracy spanning over a year and involving trafficking in crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, as well as using or brandishing firearms, and engaging in carjacking to facilitate their drug trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were arraigned in two groups, pled guilty before the same judge and were sentenced before him by early 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ismael Rivera-DeCelis contends that his guilty plea was entered in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and that the district judge erred in calculating his sentence.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3.  He did not press the first point below.  We find that the plea colloquy in his case conformed with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and that the sentence calculations with respect to him were not in error.  Accordingly, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carmen Pacheco-Rijos challenges her sentence, arguing that the district court erred in imposing the mandatory minimum required for her offense.  Her attack is based on her claim that she met the conditions set forth in the \"safety valve provision\" of the Sentencing Guidelines.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.  We find the record inadequate to justify the district court's decision not to grant relief.  Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand the case for the purpose of allowing the district court to revisit this issue and to clarify the record by filing supplemental findings.  In the event that the court finds its initial calculation in error, it should so identify and return, as well, to the issue of other adjustments, if appropriate, under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Juan Jose Miranda-Santiago also attacks his sentence, arguing that the sentencing court erred, as a matter of law, by failing to grant a two-level downward adjustment based on a finding that the defendant was a \"minor participant\" in the criminal activity.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b).  We find inadequate support in the record for the court's conclusion that a downward adjustment was inappropriate.  We vacate this sentence and remand the case to the district court for the purpose of having the court file supplemental findings with respect to appellant Miranda-Santiago's role in the offense.  In the event that the court finds its computation in error, it should include such a determination in its findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with an overview of events involving the three appellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1994 a grand jury returned an indictment against 19 defendants, including appellants Pacheco-Rijos and Miranda-Santiago, charging them with conspiracy to distribute drugs, and with using firearms in connection with a drug offense.  Apparently, the conspirators hid drug substances, firearms and proceeds of drug sales in specific locations, guarded by members of the conspiracy.  Members of the conspiracy were also encouraged to commit--and committed--\"carjacking\" offenses;  armed, they would steal cars and then use the vehicles to transport drugs back to their storage locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment and the PSRs adopted by the appellants and the district court detailed a criminal enterprise with a strongly hierarchical structure;  some of the accused controlled the operation, while others served as drug runners and bodyguards.  A superseding indictment, returned on May 12, 1994, named five additional defendants, including appellant Rivera-DeCelis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When arraigned, each defendant entered a plea of not guilty.  In September of 1994, Rivera-DeCelis, Pacheco-Rijos and Miranda-Santiago, among others, offered to change their pleas with respect to certain charges.  After each plea colloquy, conducted individually, the court accepted the defendants' pleas.  Each was separately sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

He was charged in Count One with distributing not less than fifty grams of cocaine base, an amount of not less than five kilograms of cocaine, an amount of not less than one kilogram of heroin, and some amount of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846.  Counts Three, Four and Five charged him with possessing and brandishing various firearms in connection with his drug trafficking, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an initial plea of not guilty, on September 8, 1994, Rivera-DeCelis offered to change his plea to guilty to Count One's charge that he acted in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and Count Three's charge that he acted in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1).  The plea agreement was entered into under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It provided that the defendant would be held accountable at sentencing for the distribution of no less than 15 but no more than 50 kilograms of cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 34.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(a)(3).  The parties also agreed that the defendant was entitled to a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(1) &amp; (2), reducing his offense level to 31.  The parties further defined the term of imprisonment:  In light of the ten year mandatory minimum sentence facing Rivera-DeCelis under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), and a criminal history category of III, they stipulated to a 139 month term of confinement on Count One to be followed by a 60 month term on Count Three.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the plea colloquy, the district judge directly addressed Rivera-DeCelis.  He explained each charge, detailing, among other things, the time frame of the conspiracy in which the defendant allegedly was involved (roughly from January of 1993 through March of 1994), the elements of the offenses and the burden the government would have if it tried to prove its case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  He also explained to the defendant the sentences he faced and the consequences of his plea, inquired about coercion and made sure the defendant understood the particular strictures of a plea entered into under Rule 11(e)(1)(c).  The defendant agreed to the facts presented in the indictment, without asserting that there were any temporal limits to his personal involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the factual basis of the charges, the judge asked Rivera-DeCelis whether the defendant was \"recognizing [his guilt] ... for the drug conspiracy participation and also for the weapons or firearms count,\" and whether he acknowledged the punishment he could face.  Rivera-DeCelis answered in the affirmative to both questions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the defendant challenged the drug amount attributed to him in the PSR.  Notwithstanding his earlier admissions, Rivera-DeCelis asserted that he was only involved in the conspiracy for three months and that the amount of cocaine reflected in the plea agreement was greater than the amount he could reasonably have foreseen would have been part of the conspiracy during his membership in it.  The government cast doubt on the short duration of Rivera-DeCelis' involvement, noting that he was pictured holding a gun and serving as a bodyguard for one of the conspiracy's leaders.  Logically, the prosecutor argued, such a responsibility would not devolve to a new and marginal member of the organization.  In any event, even within a 90 day period, the government contended, the daily quantities of drugs sold as part of the conspiracy would result in a drug offense level of over 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge did not accept the defendant's characterization of his involvement and rejected his challenge.  The judge noted that the benefits of this plea agreement to the defendant were substantial, since, for instance, no amount of crack cocaine was attributed to the defendant, a drug \"which all of them were dealing ... without a doubt.\"   Accordingly, the court adopted a base offense level of 34 and granted the defendant a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b).  Based on a criminal history category of III, Rivera-DeCelis was sentenced on the drug charge to a prison term of 139 months, at the lower end of the guideline range,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to be followed by a term of 60 months on the firearms charge.  The remaining charges against Rivera-DeCelis were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Legal Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>a.

The judge specifically explained both the elements of each offense and the factual accusations against the defendant.  As he walked Rivera-DeCelis through these aspects of the case against him, the judge inquired--at each turn--whether Rivera-DeCelis subjectively understood the situation.  The district judge also made sure that Rivera-DeCelis in fact grasped the consequences of his plea.  Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).  Only after assuring himself that Rivera-DeCelis understood the charges, the facts that formed their bases and the consequences of his plea, did the district judge ask Rivera-DeCelis to attest to the facts to which he was pleading guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consideration of other factors surrounding the plea does not yield a better result for the appellant.  With respect to the validity of the proffered reasons for requesting that we set aside Rivera-DeCelis' plea, we are not persuaded, particularly given the care with which the district judge directly addressed the defendant on each issue of central concern under Rule 11.  The timing of the request, made for the first time before an appellate court, also counsels against setting aside the plea.  The defendant made no assertion of legal innocence;  and, finally, the plea was offered pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the district judge fully addressed the core concerns of Rule 11.

At his plea hearing, Rivera-DeCelis accepted the factual recitation of the indictment, indicating an involvement in the conspiracy from January 1993 through March of 1994.  He also acknowledged knowing of trafficking in crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin and marijuana over that period of time.  His plea, indeed, situated him in the center of the conspiracy's activities, aware of its use of firearms as well as the extent of the drug dealing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge was not persuaded by defense counsel's explanation that he had urged his client to accept the plea because he was unsure he could confirm the circumscribed scope of the defendant's involvement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The defendant did little else to confirm that his vantage point was so distant from the main activity and he stood in that place for such a fleeting moment that he could not reasonably have foreseen that not less than 15 but not more than 50 kilograms of cocaine would be involved in the offense.

The defendant acknowledged that although those preliminary calculations resulted in a guideline range of 57 to 71 months, she could receive a statutory minimum of 60 months imprisonment.  The agreement, however, left the door open for application of other provisions which might affect her sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the district judge mischaracterized the plea agreement as a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) agreement, under which the sentencing judge would be required to accept the agreement in toto or reject it, thereby allowing the defendant to withdraw her plea.  Such an agreement would have represented the parties' negotiations concerning all the guideline provisions that should determine the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pacheco-Rijos' plea agreement, however, did not pretend to such completeness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When counsel for Pacheco-Rijos moved for a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the court accepted it both because the plea agreement had contemplated such an adjustment and because he found Pacheco-Rijos' conduct merited it.  He accepted an offense level of 25, with a guideline range of 57 to 71 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, when counsel requested the application of the safety valve provision, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, and, if granted, a further two-level reduction for minor participant status under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b), requests that were not in the plea agreement, the district court declined to accept them.  The appellant argued that she met all the requirements of the safety valve provision.  The government responded that, among other things, Pacheco-Rijos had failed honestly to disclose her own participation in the conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  In support of its claim, the government stated simply that her failure \"can be gleaned from the Presentence Report in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's citation to the PSR is perplexing.  It appears that initially the PSR had not placed Pacheco-Rijos among the defendants for whom the government had designated a minimal or minor role, but among those for whom no role had been \"adjudicated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  However, after reviewing the objection of the defendant with respect to the scope of her participation, the probation officer, in the final PSR, adopted Pacheco-Rijos' own view of her participation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> designating her as a \"minor participant\" and characterizing her role as \"passive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding, the sentencing judge denied the request for relief from the mandatory minimum sentence.  He summarily concluded:  \"5C1.2 does not apply, because she has not cooperated fully as required by guideline Section 5C1.2(5).\"   In addition, he stated:  \"And besides that, there is a stipulation in the plea agreement [that] she be sentenced to 60 months.  That was good enough in September, [so it] should be good enough today.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the light of his rejection of the safety valve provision, the judge indicated that there was no need to consider whether Pacheco-Rijos should have been given a two-level adjustment based on her role in the offense, an adjustment that would have brought her sentence under the Guidelines still further below the 60 month statutory minimum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Continuing the same apparent misapprehension under which he labored from the beginning, the district judge concluded the sentencing hearing by reiterating:  \"I should make it very clear on this record that her plea agreement was an 11--Federal Rule Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1)(C) plea.  And therefore the 60 months that I have given her was precisely what she bargained for during the plea negotiations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>2.

The review is complicated by the paucity of detail in the record below and our concern for two obvious mistakes in the sentencing hearing which shaped the outcome:  first, that the district court wrongly believed that the plea agreement was a binding one and Pacheco-Rijos was arguing for an outcome for which she had not negotiated;  and second, that the PSR somehow supported the government's position on Pacheco-Rijos' cooperation, when it did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Congress enacted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, it passed into law a safety valve provision which permits judicial departures for some low-level, first-time offenders who otherwise would face mandatory minimum sentences.

Notably, whether there is a binding plea agreement or, as here, a non-binding agreement, if it is determined that a defendant has met the five requirements of the provision, the judge is required to set aside the mandatory minimum and sentence the defendant under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district judge denied application of the safety valve provision, focusing only on the issue of Pacheco-Rijos' cooperation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Apparently accepting the government's argument that the facts which could be \"gleaned\" from the PSR supported denying application of section 3553(f)(5), the judge determined that Pacheco-Rijos did not deserve relief from her mandatory minimum sentence because she had failed to \"cooperate fully.\"   In so deciding, he also stressed that Pacheco-Rijos had not negotiated for relief from the mandatory minimum in her plea agreement, an agreement which, as noted above, he incorrectly believed to be binding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(f)(5) requires that defendants \"truthfully provide the government\" no later than at sentencing all the information they have regarding \"the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or part of a common scheme or plan.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Questions with respect to the scope of both a defendant's duty to \"provide\" information--and the very nature of that information--have already confronted this Court.  In United States v. Wrenn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196312\"><a href=\"/opinion/196312/united-states-v-wrenn/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1995), we held that where the only disclosure to the government was made inadvertently--and through the government's own efforts to intercept the defendant's conversations--that defendant could not be said to have \"provided\" the information to the government.  Further, the Wrenn Court noted that where the defendant had indicated that he knew the identity of customers involved in a drug trafficking enterprise, but he refused to provide any names, it certainly was not erroneous for the district court to determine that the defendant had failed to provide \"all\" information which he concededly had.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of scope was further addressed in United States v. Montanez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196724\"><a href=\"/opinion/196724/united-states-v-montanez/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), in which this Court confronted a slightly different question:  whether the requirement that a defendant truthfully provide \"all\" information established an affirmative duty on the part of that defendant to offer himself or herself up to the government for debriefing.  Id. at 522-523.   While we determined that section 3553(f)(5) does not require that much,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> we agreed with the district court that what the defendant provided in that case was patently inadequate.  For although Montanez agreed that he was supplied drugs that he then delivered, he offered no plausible reason why he did not provide the government with the names of his drug suppliers.  Under the circumstances, we found that Montanez \"did not disclose information that he might reasonably be expected to possess, nor persuasively explain its absence.\"  Id. at 523;  see also Wrenn, 66 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is not like Wrenn or Montanez.   In a submission by her counsel, included as part of her PSR, Pacheco-Rijos explained the limits of her involvement in the conspiracy:  She was a passive participant, knowing that drugs were stored in the house and doing little to stop it.  She said that she never handled the drugs, nor was she aware of the firearms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That characterization was never objected to nor explicitly contradicted by the government.  Furthermore, it appears to have been accepted by the probation department whose amended report recommended granting Pacheco-Rijos a two-level adjustment as a minor participant and specifically characterized her as a \"passive\" member of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is entirely possible that a minor participant in the criminal activities might know more than her designated role suggests, the government offered nothing concrete to so indicate.  In this case, as distinguished from Wrenn or Montanez, the government did not rebut a facially plausible tale of limited involvement by pointing to information this defendant must have known;  there was no allegation that this defendant knew the names of drug suppliers or customers and refused to indicate those names.  There was no specific information the government alleged that Pacheco-Rijos had and failed to provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government cannot assure success simply by saying, \"We don't believe the defendant,\" and doing nothing more.  If it could, it would effectively eliminate the self-conscious difference between the safety valve provision, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which obligates the district court to determine if the defendant has truthfully provided all information, see Montanez, 82 F.3d at 523, and the substantial assistance provision, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1, which permits, upon the government's motion and at the court's discretion, a downward adjustment for certain defendants who have provided substantial assistance to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the PSR, there was one conceivable basis for the government's position, a basis which, standing alone, is wholly inadequate:  that because Pacheco-Rijos shared living quarters with other co-defendants,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> she must have had more information than she provided to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3553(f)(5) does not invite such speculation.  If mere conjecture based on personal relationships could bar application of section 3553(f)(5), in all cases where minor participants knew others more involved, the safety valve provision would be beyond their grasp.  Such a result was not intended by Congress and cannot be permitted here.  Therefore, district court's bare conclusion that Pacheco-Rijos did not \"cooperate fully,\" absent either specific factual findings or easily recognizable support in the record, cannot be enough to thwart her effort to avoid imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand this case for the purpose of allowing the district court to revisit this issue and clarify the record by filing supplemental findings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  In the event that the court finds its initial calculation in error, it should so identify and return, as well, to the issue of other adjustments, if appropriate, under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

At his arraignment, Miranda-Santiago pled not guilty to all charges.  On September 7, 1994, he offered to change his plea to guilty.  Under a plea agreement entered into pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(A) &amp; (B), Miranda-Santiago offered to plead guilty to Count One, charging him with possession with intent to distribute narcotics, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846.  In addition, the parties recommended to the court a base offense level of 30, with a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b)(1) &amp; (2), resulting in a sentencing range of 70-87 months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>  More specifically, the parties agreed to ask for a sentence of 84 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Miranda-Santiago PSR contained the same general recital of the facts as that contained in the other PSRs discussed above.  As to Miranda-Santiago's role in the enterprise, the PSR indicated that this defendant worked as a drug distributor.  He was not identified as someone who used firearms or provided protection for the operation.  The PSR designated him as a minor participant in the offense.  Notwithstanding that finding, the probation officer did not include a two-level downward adjustment as part of the sentencing calculation.  The PSR recommended a base level of 30, with only a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was sentenced on January 11, 1995.  During the hearing, the defendant voiced no objection to the findings contained in the PSR.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  Although he did not do so during the sentencing hearing, in the written judgment the judge adopted the PSR's factual findings, without exception.  The district court arrived at a base offense level of 27 and sentenced Miranda-Santiago to a prison term of 78 months, eighteen months above the mandatory minimum for that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>2.

The appellant contends that since the sentencing court adopted the factual findings of the PSR, the decision not to grant Miranda-Santiago a minor participant adjustment was a simple misapplication of the Guidelines.  Our review--notwithstanding the appellant's failure to raise the issue below--should be plenary and the sentence vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government disagrees and makes, essentially, two arguments:  First, it contends that, as a procedural matter, this Court ought not review this issue because the appellant waived is rights by not raising the question below.  Second, the government asserts that, even if the issue is not waived, the appellant challenges a factual determination at sentencing and the determination was not clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will consider each of the government's arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>a. Waiver</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Miranda-Santiago, in voicing no objection to the PSR at sentencing, has waived his right to raise this issue on appeal.  The appellant argues that neither counsel nor the appellant noticed the error, and that, particularly given the pressures put on non-English speaking defendants with respect to lengthy reports only orally translated into Spanish, the absence of an objection should not constitute waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that this defendant, given these circumstances, forfeited his rights but did not waive them.

McDowell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551473\"><a href=\"/opinion/551473/united-states-v-billy-ray-mcdowell-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1012 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This obligation has become particularly critical since the enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines.  Under the guideline regime, factual determinations made by the sentencing judge may have a profound effect on the length of defendant's incarceration.  Ensuring our ability to engage in meaningful review of those findings is essential.  So while we have found that a sentencing court can comply with section 3553(c) by adopting findings from the PSR, see, e.g., United States v. Savoie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 618 (1st Cir.1993), this technique cannot be employed when the PSR itself is unclear or inherently contradictory.  Moreover, we have repeatedly urged district courts, in the interests of buttressing sentencing calculations and facilitating appellate review, to make certain that the bases of the calculations are clearly set forth.  See United States v. Van, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196815\"><a href=\"/opinion/196815/united-states-v-van/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2-3 (1st Cir.1996) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district judge made few findings at the sentencing hearing.  In his judgment, he simply adopted the PSR, in toto.  There is a problem with that procedure in this case:  The PSR, as best we can decipher it, judged Miranda-Santiago a minor participant in the conspiracy.  It was merely in calculating the sentence that this finding did not translate into a two-level downward adjustment.  The record therefore does not provide an adequate factual basis for the district court's determination with respect to Miranda-Santiago's role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This error is clear, obvious, and potentially affects the appellant's substantial rights.  Accordingly, we vacate this sentence and remand this case to the district court for the purpose of having the court file supplemental findings with respect to appellant Miranda-Santiago's role in the offense.  In the event that the district court finds its computation in error, the court should include such a determination in its findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The convictions of all appellants are affirmed.

She conceded that other co-defendants used Pacheco-Rijos' home as a place to pack controlled substances, that she knew generally of these activities and that she did little to stop it.  She denied ever handling money or drugs in the illegal operation and ever being at all involved in the possession or concealment of firearms.  Further, while Pacheco-Rijos lived with three of the co-defendants in this case, Luis Antonio Garca, Agustin Aponte-Merced and Juan Jose Miranda-Santiago, she vowed to having no other knowledge of their illegal acts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Here again, the sentencing court focused on the plea agreement in a way that suggested he believed it to have been binding:  \"I'm going to leave it as it was in the plea agreement.  I will not honor that adjustment.  And we're going to leave it at 25....  This Court understands that the defendant is not entitled to a minor participant adjustment under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b).\"</p>\n        <p>This conclusion is at odds with the district court's own judgment in this case, in which the court states that it adopts the findings and sentence calculations of the PSR without exception.

The provision addressed the following irony:  Mandatory minimums had, and have, little real impact on the sentences received by serious repeat offenders, where the guideline calculation arrives at a base offense level higher than the mandatory minimum, and where mitigating factors may therefore be considered.  Prior to passage of the section 3553(f), however, for the least culpable offenders, mandatory minimums operated to block sentences from reflecting the very mitigating factors that could ease sentences of the more culpable.  Ironically, courts were obliged to impose upon the least culpable defendants sentences similar to those imposed on more culpable counterparts.  As a House Report noted, the safety valve provision was designed to \"permit ... greater integration between sentencing guideline mitigating factors and mandatory minimums ...\" H.R.Rep.

Nor has the government contended that she used threats of violence in carrying out her role.  The disputes arose in the context of sections 3553(f)(3) &amp; (5).  At sentencing, the government contended that:  (1) the offense to which she pled guilty involved serious bodily injury or death;  and (2) that Pacheco-Rijos failed to meet the final requirement of the safety valve provision, namely, that she fully disclose her involvement in the offense.  As noted above, the court addressed only the government's second argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> The fact that a full debriefing is not statutorily required does not provide a full answer to the question.  The Montanez Court noted:  \"[A]s a practical matter, a defendant who declines to offer himself for a debriefing takes a very dangerous course.\"  Montanez, 82 F.3d at 523</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> By this analysis, we do not suggest any change in the defendant's ultimate burden of proof under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.  The defendant plainly has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, entitlement to relief under section 3553(f).  However, where a defendant in her submissions credibly demonstrates that she has provided the government with all the information she reasonably was expected to possess, Montanez 82 F.3d at 523, in order to defeat her claim, the government must at least come forward with some sound reason to suggest otherwise</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn26\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26_ref\">26</a>\n        <p> One co-defendant apparently shared a somewhat independent living quarters with Pacheco-Rijos' daughter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> We note one other strong inference from the record:  that the district court did not apply this provision out of deference to the plea agreement into which the parties had entered and which he erroneously believed would be completely voided unless he accepted the sentencing terms.  This was not the case.  In any event, a plea agreement--even a binding one--does not replace the independent determination of the district court as to whether this provision applies.  See Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 87;  U.S.S.G. &#167; 6B1.2(c) &amp; commentary</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> The remaining argument made by the government below--that the offense involved serious bodily injury or death thereby disqualifying Pacheco-Rijos from the benefits of the safety valve provision--lacks merit.  It therefore does not provide an alternative reason to affirm the district court's decision.  Indeed, the government has all but abandoned the argument in this forum</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> The parties had recommended that, for sentencing purposes, the defendant be held accountable for at least 3.5 but no more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.  Accordingly, the base offense level in this case was set at 30.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1.  The defendant faced a mandatory minimum five year term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> The district judge asked the defendant's counsel if there were any objections to the PSR.  He reported that there were none and did not ask the district court judge to make specific role-in-the-offense findings.  The judge also asked the defendant if he had reviewed the PSR with his attorney and if he any objections to it.  Miranda-Santiago responded that he had discussed the report with counsel and that he had no objections to it</p>\n        <p>Before this Court, appellant argues that he nor his counsel noticed the inconsistency within the report.  Defendant's counsel notes that Miranda-Santiago is illiterate, having only stayed in school through the sixth grade and that since he is Spanish-speaking and does not understand English, his only review of the PSR came through an oral translation of its nineteen pages.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> The plain error standard requires that the appellant demonstrate that:  (1) there was an \"error;\"  (2) it was \"plain;\"  and (3) it affected \"the substantial rights\" of the defendant.  E.g., United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. at 1777.   Even if a defendant meets the standard established by the Olano Court, appellate courts maintain discretion to recognize the error and are directed to consider whether the error affects \"the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Id. at 732, 735, 113 S.Ct. at 1776, 1778</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> Minimal participation merits a four-level decrease;  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2(a);  minor participation merits a two-level decrease, U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2(b)</p>\n        <p>The appellant contends--and the government initially agreed--that Miranda-Santiago was a minor participant in the criminal enterprise.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> The defendant carries the burden of proving that he was a minor participant entitled to a two-level decrease under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2.
