It   serves  twenty-five  to   thirty  clients,\r\n\nincluding  six  in  a   residential  program  in   Mansfield,\r\n\nMassachusetts,  where  Ann Marie Guglielmi  was employed as a\r\n\nTeam Leader.   The Team  Leader position required  her to  be\r\n\nresponsible for the care of these disabled clients, including\r\n\nthe  responsibility  of  administering vital  medications  to\r\n\nthem.  After an  unresolved investigation of improprieties in\r\n\nthe  administering of  medication  to patients  at a  related\r\n\nfacility, Amego  learned that other staff  felt Guglielmi was\r\n\nnot performing her job adequately and was putting patients at\r\n\nrisk.    Amego also  learned  that  Ms. Guglielmi  had  twice\r\n\nattempted to commit suicide within the previous six  weeks by\r\n\noverdosing on  medications.  This, Amego  decided, meant that\r\n\nGuglielmi could not safely dispense medications, an essential\r\n\njob function,  and that  there was  no  other job  reasonably\r\n\navailable to her.  Her employment was thus terminated. \r\n\n          The   Equal   Employment   Opportunity   Commission\r\n\n(\"EEOC\")  sued  Amego  on   behalf  of  Guglielmi  under  the\r\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.   12101 et\r                                                                         \r\n\nseq.  The district court entered summary judgment against the\r                \r\n\nEEOC, holding  that the EEOC had  not made out  a prima facie\r\n\ncase  that Guglielmi was an otherwise \"qualified\" individual,\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthat  an accommodation  could  be reasonably  made, and  that\r\n\nthere was discrimination \"because of\" her disability. \r\n\n           The EEOC  appeals and argues that  the question of\r\n\nwhether  an  employee  poses  a  significant  risk  to  other\r\n\nindividuals  in the  workplace is  an affirmative  defense on\r\n\nwhich the employer bears the burden of  proof and is thus not\r\n\npart  of   the  plaintiff's  burden  that   the  employee  is\r\n\nqualified.  Those issues of qualification and  risk, the EEOC\r\n\nsays,  are matters for  the jury to resolve  at trial and may\r\n\nnot be resolved on  summary judgment.  The EEOC  also invites\r\n\nthis  court to  hold  that \"adverse  employment action  taken\r\n\nbecause of conduct  related to a disability  is tantamount to\r\n\naction taken because of a disability itself\" for purposes  of\r\n\nthe ADA. \r\n\n          We affirm the judgment of the district court.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          The following facts are undisputed.\r\n\n          Founded in 1972 by parents of autistic individuals,\r\n\nAmego receives public  funding and is  licensed by two  state\r\n\nagencies.   A condition  of licensing is  that Amego  provide\r\n\nconditions  that  ensure the  safety  and  well-being of  its\r\n\nclients.   Amego maintains a very  low client-to-staff ratio,\r\n\nusually one  staff member to  two clients.   One particularly\r\n\naggressive  client   required  supervision  by   three  staff\r\n\nmembers, eighteen hours a day. \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          Amego has a policy of not  rejecting those who seek\r\n\nits help.  Most of its clients engage in aggressive and self-\r\n\ninjuring behavior, including self-mutilation.  Many have been\r\n\nrejected  by,  or  discharged  from, other  agencies.    Most\r\n\nclients are on prescription medications, and in June of 1992,\r\n\nall  clients  at  the  Mansfield residence,  save  one,  were\r\n\nreceiving prescription medications. \r\n\n          Consistent   with   its  philosophy   of  attempted\r\n\nintegration,  Amego  provides  its  clients  with  access  to\r\n\ncommunity activities on a regular basis.  Residential clients\r\n\nare  transported daily  to the  Day Treatment  Program, where\r\n\nthey frequently  are taken  by direct  care staff  to stores,\r\n\nbowling alleys, banks, and the like. \r\n\n          In  September  1990,  Amego hired  Guglielmi  as  a\r\n\nBehavior Therapist.  She was then about 21 years old  and did\r\n\nnot represent  herself to  have any  disability.  In  January\r\n\n1991, she was diagnosed  as bulimic and clinically depressed;\r\n\nhowever, she did not tell her employer about these conditions\r\n\nuntil  after her first suicide attempt, over a year after the\r\n\ndiagnosis.   She was prescribed  Prozac in 1991,  but it only\r\n\npartially alleviated the depression.   She stopped taking the\r\n\ndrug in April.  In the fall of 1991, she  started living with\r\n\nher boyfriend, David Andrade, who worked at a different Amego\r\n\nresidence.   That  relationship  was fraught  with  problems.\r\n\nAndrade used  cocaine; Guglielmi,  however, says she  did not\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nconfirm  her suspicions  of that  until late  June 1992.   In\r\n\nearly  1992, she  started  seeing a  social worker,  Margaret\r\n\nPosever, for bimonthly therapy sessions.  \r\n\n          Earlier,  in July  1991, Guglielmi was  promoted to\r\n\nthe  position of Team Leader at the Mansfield residence.  The\r\n\nessential  functions of  that position  included: supervising\r\n\nthe   day-to-day   implementation  of   individual  clinical,\r\n\neducational, and vocational programs and  data collection for\r\n\nall programs; serving as a role model for  staff in all areas\r\n\nof  client programming,  client  services,  and  professional\r\n\npractice; assessing staff  performance, providing  additional\r\n\ntraining,  support, and  counseling as  appropriate; ensuring\r\n\nthat Amego's policies and  procedures on clients' rights were\r\n\nimplemented  and  documented;  responding   appropriately  in\r\n\ncrisis situations; and administering and  documenting the use\r\n\nof prescribed medications.\r\n\n          On March 4, 1992, Guglielmi received a  performance\r\n\nevaluation which  said she was an  \"exceptional\" Team Leader.\r\n\nThe evaluation  was based on her  performance through January\r\n\n1992.  In the spring of 1992, Guglielmi applied for promotion\r\n\nto  the position  of  Program Coordinator  for the  Mansfield\r\n\nresidence.   The  promotion  instead went  to Kristen  Stone.\r\n\nStone assumed her new responsibilities on May 4, 1992.\r\n\n          That  same  day,  Guglielmi  deliberately  took  an\r\n\noverdose  of  nonprescription sleeping  pills  which she  had\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\npurchased for that purpose.  After taking the pills, she told\r\n\nAndrade what she had done; he took her to the emergency room.\r\n\nShe was  transferred to  a psychiatric hospital  and released\r\n\nlater  that evening.  She  told health care  workers that she\r\n\nattempted suicide  because she was  upset by problems  in her\r\n\nrelationship with  her boyfriend, her failure  to receive the\r\n\npromotion, and other work-related stress.  She was readmitted\r\n\nto  the psychiatric hospital on May 6, 1992, and stayed there\r\n\nuntil  May 12 because  of concerns about her  safety.  On the\r\n\nday  of her readmission to the hospital -- two days after her\r\n\nsuicide  attempt -- Guglielmi  was not able  to \"contract for\r\n\nsafety\" with  her therapist Posever.   Guglielmi told Posever\r\n\nthat even  if she were to  so contract, her mood  was in such\r\n\nflux that  she could not be  sure she would not  hurt herself\r\n\nanyway.  A week after returning to work, and again  two weeks\r\n\nlater, she told Posever that she felt suicidal.\r\n\n          When Guglielmi returned to work on May 13, she told\r\n\nher  supervisor  only  that  she had  been  hospitalized  for\r\n\nbulimia  and  depression.   She  did  not  say  that she  had\r\n\nattempted  suicide.  She  asked her supervisor  to modify her\r\n\nwork  schedule so  that  she could  attend  therapy twice  or\r\n\nthrice weekly.  Her  supervisor agreed to this accommodation.\r\n\nHowever, Guglielmi  stopped  going to  the  therapy  sessions\r\n\nafter a few weeks. \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          On May 21, 1992, Guglielmi began seeing Dr. Kenneth\r\n\nLevin for psychopharmacological treatment.  He  diagnosed her\r\n\nas suffering  from bulimia and  major depression,  prescribed\r\n\nProzac  and  trazodone, and  saw her  to  monitor her  use of\r\n\nmedication.   Prozac  was  one of  the medications  regularly\r\n\nadministered to Amego's clients.   On June 4, 1992,  she told\r\n\nDr.  Levin  that she  had  experienced  periodic feelings  of\r\n\nincreased   depression,   including   a   period   when   she\r\n\ncontemplated overdosing.   She assured Dr. Levin that if such\r\n\nthoughts recurred, she would not act on them but would inform\r\n\nher boyfriend  or a health care  provider.  She did  not keep\r\n\nher word.\r\n\n          On June 13, Guglielmi deliberately overdosed again,\r\n\nthis  time using  her  prescription  medications, Prozac  and\r\n\ntrazadone, as  well as aspirin.   After taking  the overdose,\r\n\nshe  called  the Plainville  police,  who  took  her  to  the\r\n\nhospital.   She was released on June 15, 1992.   She told her\r\n\nhealth care  providers that she was not really depressed when\r\n\nshe  overdosed  but wanted  to  provoke a  reaction  from her\r\n\nboyfriend.  When Guglielmi  returned to work on June  17, she\r\n\nagain  did  not tell  her  employer  that she  had  attempted\r\n\nsuicide.  \r\n\n          On   the  day  Guglielmi   returned  to  work,  the\r\n\nExecutive Director of Amego, Caryn Driscoll, and the Director\r\n\nof  Administrative  Services,  Karen  Seal,  met  with  David\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nAndrade  about his  job  performance problems.   During  this\r\n\nmeeting, Andrade  mentioned  rumors that  clients were  being\r\n\ndrugged  at  the Fales  Road residence.    He worked  at that\r\n\nlocation  regularly, and Guglielmi worked there occasionally.\r\n\nAround that time, Driscoll learned  that Klonopin, one of the\r\n\nmedications prescribed for clients, was either missing or was\r\n\nbeing  used  at   an  accelerated  rate  at  the  Fales  Road\r\n\nresidence.  Some cocaine users take Klonopin  as an antidote,\r\n\nto calm them down from the effects of cocaine. \r\n\n          Amego  investigated  and  found  that  four  of the\r\n\nclients at the Fales  Road residence (two of whom  should not\r\n\nhave  had Klonopin at all) had blood levels of Klonopin which\r\n\nwere too high.   Amego asked any employees who  had pertinent\r\n\ninformation  to  step forward.    Guglielmi  did so  and  was\r\n\ninterviewed  on June  26  by Driscoll,  Amego's Human  Rights\r\n\nOfficer, and  a private investigator.   During the interview,\r\n\nGuglielmi focused  on her relationship with  Andrade, who she\r\n\nfeared might be targeted in the investigation.  She said that\r\n\nshe was  suffering from  bulimia and depression  and revealed\r\n\nfor  the first time  her two recent suicide  attempts.  In an\r\n\nattempt  to explain  Andrade's performance  issues, she  said\r\n\nthat he had helped  her when she attempted suicide  two times\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nby  overdosing  on  both  prescription  and  over-the-counter\r\n\ndrugs.1 \r\n\n          Earlier,  on  June 5,  a  shift  supervisor at  the\r\n\nMansfield residence,  Chester Millet,  had  noticed that  the\r\n\nmedication log was missing.   He conducted a thorough search,\r\n\nincluding behind the medication cabinet, and did not find it.\r\n\nGuglielmi also  helped look for it.   On the same  day of her\r\n\ninterview with Driscoll, June 26, Guglielmi reported that she\r\n\nhad found the missing medication  log.  She said the log  had\r\n\nbeen behind  the medication cabinet, between  the cabinet and\r\n\nthe wall.  Millet told Driscoll that he had previously looked\r\n\nthere  and  had  not seen  it.    Although  Driscoll did  not\r\n\ninitially consider Guglielmi under suspicion for the improper\r\n\ndrugging  of patients  at  Fales Road,  she  and other  staff\r\n\nmembers  found the discovery of  the book by  Guglielmi to be\r\n\npeculiar.  A  review of  the medication log  showed that  the\r\n\nsupply  of  drugs  on  hand at  the  Mansfield  residence was\r\n\nexcessive.  It  was not  possible to determine  from the  log\r\n\nwhether medications were missing.  \r\n\n          On  June 26,  Driscoll  spoke  with the  Plainville\r\n\npolice about her  concerns about the drugging  of patients at\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  During the interview, Guglielmi was asked whether she had\r\nobserved or  suspected that Andrade  was using cocaine.   She\r\nanswered \"no\" to both  questions.  The latter answer  was not\r\ntrue.  Discovery in this case revealed that she had spoken to\r\nher therapist about her suspicions of her boyfriend's cocaine\r\nuse as early as May 27, 1992.  \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nFales  Road.  The police told Driscoll that they found pills,\r\n\ninitially thought to be Klonopin, in Guglielmi's apartment on\r\n\nthe night they responded to her suicide call. \r\n\n          Around June  28,  Driscoll  received  a  call  from\r\n\nCarlos  Andrade,   an  Amego  employee  and  David  Andrade's\r\n\nbrother.  He told her that staff members felt Guglielmi's job\r\n\nperformance  was suffering and had  asked him to do something\r\n\nabout it.  He reported that staff  members were uncomfortable\r\n\nwith her job performance,  that she was erratic in  behavior,\r\n\nhad  mood  swings,  seemed to  be  focussed  on her  personal\r\n\nproblems,  that she was seen walking outside and crying, that\r\n\nshe was heard fighting  on the phone with David  Andrade, and\r\n\nthat she  was self-absorbed and unable to  concentrate on her\r\n\njob.  \r\n\n          Carlos  Andrade  also passed  on  that  Millet, the\r\n\nshift  supervisor and one of the most senior staff members at\r\n\nthe  Mansfield residence,  was  concerned that  Guglielmi had\r\n\nsuddenly handed him the  drug log, saying that she  had found\r\n\nit in the residence  when he had searched everywhere  for it.\r\n\nDriscoll confirmed  Carlos Andrade's report with  Millet, who\r\n\nhad never  before complained about another  employee.  Carlos\r\n\nAndrade felt that Guglielmi was not performing her job safely\r\n\nand was putting clients at risk.  Driscoll knew  there was no\r\n\nway  to prevent  Guglielmi from  having access  to medication\r\n\nwhile she worked at Amego.  \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          A  few days  later,  on July  1, Driscoll  informed\r\n\nGuglielmi in  writing that  she was temporarily  removed from\r\n\nher  position  as Team  Leader  and  would be  reassigned  to\r\n\nperform clerical  and other light duties.   The letter stated\r\n\nthat the fact that  Guglielmi's recent hospitalizations  were\r\n\nthe   result   of   deliberate  overdoses   of   prescription\r\n\nmedications raised  \"concerns about [her] ability  to perform\r\n\n[her]  present job  functions including  medication ordering,\r\n\ndispensing and shift supervision.\"  The letter also indicated\r\n\nthat Amego's Safety Committee would meet to determine whether\r\n\nGuglielmi could  perform her  job, or another  available job,\r\n\nwith  or  without accommodations.    Driscoll  said that  the\r\n\nCommittee  should seek  medical information  from Guglielmi's\r\n\ntreating physician.\r\n\n          In an  attempt to obtain a  professional opinion on\r\n\nGuglielmi's  ability to  resume her  duties, Driscoll  sent a\r\n\nletter  to Posever on  July 1 asking  whether Guglielmi could\r\n\nperform  eleven  duties  that a  Team  Leader  would  need to\r\n\nperform,  set forth on a checklist.   The letter came back to\r\n\nAmego on July 8 with a check in the \"yes\" column for each job\r\n\nduty.  Only Guglielmi had signed the bottom of the checklist.\r\n\n          Driscoll  called  Posever to  ask if  the checklist\r\n\naccurately  reflected Posever's opinion  that Guglielmi could\r\n\ncomplete  the duties  or  whether the  list merely  reflected\r\n\nGuglielmi's own opinion.  Posever told Driscoll she was not a\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nmedical  doctor,  that  the  checklist did  not  represent  a\r\n\nmedical competency  evaluation as to each  specific job duty,\r\n\nnor was  it a guarantee regarding  each duty.  It  was rather\r\n\nthat,  based  on  her  discussions  with  Guglielmi  and  her\r\n\nknowledge of her  work and treatment history,  Posever had no\r\n\nreason  to think  Guglielmi could  not perform  those duties.\r\n\nPosever's  checking \"yes\"  was based  on her  observations of\r\n\nGuglielmi's demeanor and  on Guglielmi's  statement that  she\r\n\nfelt comfortable giving out psychotropic medications at work,\r\n\neven in light  of her  suicide attempts.   Driscoll  appeared\r\n\ndissatisfied  with  the  response  and  pressed  for  a  more\r\n\ndefinitive opinion,  which Posever declined to  give.  Later,\r\n\nDriscoll   told   Guglielmi  that   Posever's   response  was\r\n\ninadequate. \r\n\n          On  July  22,  Driscoll  sent Dr.  Levin  a  letter\r\n\nrequesting his opinion as  to whether Guglielmi could perform\r\n\nthe eleven functions of her job and  enclosing the checklist.\r\n\nIn  a  letter  dated July  27,  1992,  Dr.  Levin wrote  that\r\n\nGuglielmi  was  no longer  on  prescription  medication.   He\r\n\nconcluded:  \"My understanding  is that  she has  consistently\r\n\nperformed  her  regular job  responsibilities conscientiously\r\n\nand I see  no difficulty  with her returning  to her  regular\r\n\nposition.\"   There  was no  checklist with  the letter  Amego\r\n\nreceived.   Driscoll  viewed  Dr.   Levin's  conclusions   as\r\n\nlargely being based on  what Guglielmi said she could  do and\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nher representation that she had no performance problems.  But\r\n\nDriscoll  knew from  staff  complaints that  Guglielmi had  a\r\n\nrange of performance  problems.  And Driscoll  knew Dr. Levin\r\n\nhad not checked with anyone at Amego about whether  Guglielmi\r\n\nwas in  fact performing well.   Driscoll told  Guglielmi that\r\n\nDr.  Levin's letter  did  not adequately  deal  with the  job\r\n\nfunctions issue.  \r\n\n          Driscoll  was  also concerned  that the  parents of\r\n\nAmego's charges would feel  that their children would be  put\r\n\nat   risk  by  being  in  the  care  of  someone  who  abused\r\n\nprescription drugs.  The parents, she felt, would contact one\r\n\nof the state agencies which licensed Amego.  \r\n\n          On  July  21,  the   Safety  Committee  met.    The\r\n\nCommittee  was comprised  of four  administrators: Seal,  the\r\n\nDirector   of   Administrative   Services;   Amego's   Health\r\n\nCoordinator,   who  was  a   nurse;  the   Staff  Development\r\n\nCoordinator;   and   the  Administrative   Assistant/Workers'\r\n\nCompensation Coordinator.  The Committee found that Guglielmi\r\n\nwas not in fact performing her  job duties conscientiously or\r\n\nperforming them well.  The Committee concluded that Guglielmi\r\n\ncould not  safely perform the  Team Leader position  and that\r\n\nthere  was  no  Amego  position  that  could  be  modified to\r\n\naccommodate her.\r\n\n          On July  27, 1992,  Amego's Board of  Directors was\r\n\ninformed of  the recommendation of the  Safety Committee and,\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nafter  additional  discussion, concluded  that  there  was no\r\n\nalternative  position that could  accommodate Guglielmi.  The\r\n\nfollowing day Driscoll informed Guglielmi that her employment\r\n\nwas  terminated.    Amego  says  its  core  concern  was that\r\n\nGuglielmi  could  not  meet  the essential  job  function  of\r\n\nhandling prescription medication. \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The district  court  entered summary  judgment  for\r\n\nAmego,  finding that the EEOC  had failed to  meet its burden\r\n\nunder the ADA of showing that Guglielmi was qualified for the\r\n\nposition  of Team  Leader and  that Amego  could have  made a\r\n\nreasonable accommodation.  The district court also found that\r\n\nthe EEOC  had failed to meet its burden of showing that Amego\r\n\nhad   discriminated   against   Guglielmi   \"because   of\"  a\r\n\ndisability. \r\n\n          The scope  of appellate review of  entry of summary\r\n\njudgment in ADA cases, as in all others, is de novo.  Soileau\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Guilford, 105 F.3d 12, 14  (1st Cir. 1997).  The EEOC bore\r                       \r\n\nthe  burden  of  showing  that  Guglielmi  was  qualified  to\r\n\nperform, either with or without reasonable accommodation, the\r\n\nessential  functions of  her job.   See  Jacques v.  Clean-Up\r                                                                         \r\n\nGroup, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 511 (1st Cir. 1996).2\r                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  To  establish a  claim under  the ADA,  a plaintiff  must\r\nprove  by a preponderance of  the evidence: (1)  that she was\r\ndisabled within the  meaning of  the ADA; (2)  that, with  or\r\nwithout reasonable accommodation, she was able to perform the\r\nessential  functions of her job (in other words, that she was\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          For summary judgment  purposes, the parties do  not\r\n\ndispute  that  Guglielmi was  a  disabled  person within  the\r\n\nmeaning of the ADA.  It  is also undisputed that an essential\r\n\nfunction  of the  Team Leader position  is to  administer and\r\n\nmonitor the medication  of Amego's clients.   The written job\r\n\ndescription provides that this  is an essential job function,\r\n\nand the EEOC concedes that Team Leaders have access to locked\r\n\nmedicine cabinets containing  large quantities  of drugs  and\r\n\nare expected to administer medications to clients.\r\n\n           This case initially turns  on whether the EEOC has\r\n\nmet  its burden of  showing that Guglielmi  was a \"qualified\"\r\n\nperson.   Amego's position is that  it terminated Guglielmi's\r\n\nemployment because  she showed by her conduct  -- by behavior\r\n\nleading co-workers to  have concerns about whether  she was a\r\n\nrisk to clients  and by  her two attempts  to commit  suicide\r\n\nusing prescription  and  non-prescription drugs  -- that  she\r\n\ncould not reasonably be  trusted to meet her responsibilities\r\n\nas to medications.  Although the qualification analysis could\r\n\nbe   understood  to   subsume  the   concept   of  reasonable\r\n\naccommodation, we think it  analytically sounder to treat the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n\"qualified\");  and (3)  that the  employer discharged  her in\r\nwhole or  in part because of her disability.

At\r\n\nits core, Title I of the ADA is about protecting the disabled\r\n\nfrom  discriminatory employment  action based  on stereotypes\r\n\nand fear.   See H.R. Rep.  No. 101-485, pt. 3,  at 45 (1990),\r                           \r\n\nreprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 468; see also Jacques, 96\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 511.   The prima facie case establishes  that because\r\n\nan  individual  with  a  disability  is  qualified,  yet  has\r\n\nsuffered   adverse   employment   action  because   of   that\r\n\ndisability,  the employer  may have  engaged in  the  type of\r\n\ndiscrimination  the ADA is  designed to  prevent.   Here, the\r\n\nplaintiff has failed to  establish a prima facie case:  there\r\n\nis  no evidence  suggesting the  presence of  any disability-\r\n\nbased discrimination. \r\n\n          The general  rule of  the ADA  is that  an employer\r\n\nshall not \"discriminate against a qualified individual with a\r\n\ndisability because  of the disability .  . . .\"   42 U.S.C.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  As    explained    below,   caselaw    interpreting   the\r\nRehabilitation  Act of 1973 is applicable to the ADA.  See 29\r                                                                      \r\nU.S.C.   794(d).\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n12112(a).  It is generally accepted that, in a  Title I case,\r\n\nthe  plaintiff  bears   the  burden  of  showing  she   is  a\r\n\n\"qualified\" individual.  See Jacques, 96 F.3d at 511.  \r                                                \r\n\n          A qualified  individual is one who  can perform the\r\n\nessential  functions  of  the job  held.    See  29 C.F.R.   \r                                                           \r\n\n1630.2(m).     The   statute   also  says   that  \"the   term\r\n\n'qualification standards'  may include a requirement  that an\r\n\nindividual  shall not pose a  direct threat to  the health or\r\n\nsafety of other individuals  in the workplace.\"  42  U.S.C.  \r\n\n12113(b).     It  defines  \"direct  threat\"   as  meaning  \"a\r\n\nsignificant risk  to  the health  or  safety of  others  that\r\n\ncannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\"  42 U.S.C.\r\n\n   12111(3).     The   rub   is  that   the  language   about\r\n\n\"qualification standards\" under Title  I appears in a section\r\n\nof the  statute entitled \"Defenses.\"   42  U.S.C.    12113(a)\r\n\n(\"It may be  a defense  to a charge  of discrimination  under\r\n\n[the  ADA]  that  an  alleged  application  of  qualification\r\n\nstandards . . . has been shown to be job-related.\")  The EEOC\r\n\nargues  that the employer bears  the burden of  proof on this\r\n\naffirmative defense.  \r\n\n          The EEOC  argues further that whenever  an issue of\r\n\nthreats to  the safety or health  of others is involved  in a\r\n\nTitle I case, it  must be analyzed under the  \"direct threat\"\r\n\nprovision   of      12113(b)   as  an   affirmative  defense.\r\n\nSpecifically, the EEOC contends that the   12113(b) provision\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nthat qualification standards  may include a requirement  that\r\n\nan  individual not be  a direct threat  is to be  read in the\r\n\ncontext  of the  defense set  out in    12113(a).   The  EEOC\r\n\nsupports  its position  by noting that    12113  is captioned\r\n\n\"Defenses.\"4  Thus,  the EEOC says, the  district court erred\r\n\nin considering the matter of whether Guglielmi posed a threat\r\n\nto   the  safety   of  Amego's   clients  as   a   matter  of\r\n\n\"qualification,\" on which plaintiff  bears the burden.  Amego\r\n\ncontends  that the risks posed to others may be considered as\r\n\npart  of  the qualified  individual  analysis,  and that  the\r\n\nspecific discussion  of a  direct threat defense  in    12113\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The  confusion   on  this  point  is   reflected  in  the\r\nlegislative    history.   During    congressional   hearings,\r\nRepresentative   Dannemeyer   asked   a  witness,   who   had\r\ncontributed to the drafting of the ADA, who had the burden of\r\nproof on the direct threat issue  in the communicable disease\r\ncontext.

The  witness\r                             \r\nreplied  that the plaintiff, as part of his prima facie case,\r\nwould have to put on  evidence that his communicable  disease\r\nwould not pose a direct threat to others.

Arguably,  in  Arline, the  question  of\r                                                      \r\n\nwhether the plaintiff  could perform the core  functions of a\r\n\nschool  teacher's  job  was  separate from  the  question  of\r\n\nwhether  she   nonetheless  posed  a  risk   because  of  her\r\n\ncommunicable disease.  Here,  the questions are not separate:\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nthe issue of risk posed to others arises in the  context of a\r\n\ncore function of the job.\r\n\n          The  EEOC correctly  points  out that,  unlike  the\r\n\nRehabilitation   Act,  the  ADA's  definition  of  \"qualified\r\n\nindividual\" does not address risk posed to others.   While it\r\n\nis  true   that  the   implementing  regulations   under  the\r\n\nRehabilitation   Act   define   \"qualified  individual   with\r\n\nhandicaps\"  specifically to include  \"without endangering the\r\n\nhealth and safety of  the individual or others,\" 29  C.F.R.  \r\n\n1614.203(6),   Congress  intended  the  ADA's  definition  of\r\n\n\"qualified individual with a disability\" to be \"comparable to\r\n\nthe definition used in  regulations implementing section  501\r\n\nand section 504  of the  Rehabilitation Act of  1973.\"   H.R.\r\n\nRep. 101-485, pt. 2, at 55, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 337.\r\n\n          The EEOC  stakes out a  position which  is far  too\r\n\nbroad.  This is not a case where a person who can perform all\r\n\nessential job  functions nonetheless poses a  risk to others.\r\n\nThe  district court  did  not, we  believe,  commit error  in\r\n\nconsidering  risk  posed  to  others under  the  category  of\r\n\n\"qualification,\" where the risk  is expressly associated with\r\n\nperformance of an essential job function.\r\n\n           The  precise  issue here  concerns  the employer's\r\n\njudgment that  Guglielmi could not  be trusted to  handle the\r\n\nmedication-related functions  of her job.   In  this case,  a\r\n\nfailure to  perform an  essential function --  overseeing and\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nadministering medication --  would necessarily create a  risk\r\n\nto  others.   That  a  failure  to  perform  a  job  function\r\n\ncorrectly  creates a  risk to  others does  not preclude  the\r\n\nability   to  perform   that  function   from  being   a  job\r\n\nqualification.  The position argued by the EEOC would lead to\r\n\nthe anomalous result that there is a lesser burden of proving\r\n\nqualifications on a plaintiff where the job involves the care\r\n\nof others, and necessarily entails risk to  others, than when\r\n\nthe  job does not.   We do  not believe  Congress intended to\r\n\nweaken the burden on plaintiffs to show they are qualified in\r\n\nsuch circumstances.\r\n\n          In such  cases, where  the employee is  responsible\r\n\nfor ensuring the  safety of  others entrusted to  his or  her\r\n\ncare, other courts, without discussion  of the point the EEOC\r\n\nraises,  have simply considered the risk  question to be part\r\n\nof the \"qualified\" analysis.  See, e.g., Doe v. University of\r                                                                         \r\n\nMaryland Med. Sys.

Mich. 1995).  \r\n\n          We  hold that,  in a  Title I ADA  case, it  is the\r\n\nplaintiff's burden to  show that  he or she  can perform  the\r\n\nessential functions of the job, and is therefore \"qualified.\"\r\n\nWhere those essential job functions necessarily implicate the\r\n\nsafety  of others,  plaintiff must  demonstrate that  she can\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nperform  those  functions in  a  way that  does  not endanger\r\n\nothers.  There may  be other  cases under  Title I  where the\r\n\nissue of direct threat is not  tied to the issue of essential\r\n\njob functions but is purely a matter of defense, on which the\r\n\ndefendant would bear the burden.  This case does not raise or\r\n\nresolve  issues of  the  role of  \"direct threat\"  provisions\r\n\nunder  other   parts  of   the  ADA,   such  as  the   public\r\n\naccommodation title.   Cf. Abbott,  1997 WL 85096.   For  the\r                                             \r\n\nreasons which follow, we  conclude plaintiff's burden was not\r\n\nmet.\r\n\nAppropriateness of Summary Judgment\r                                               \r\n\n          The EEOC argues that  a jury question is presented,\r\n\nin any event, as to whether the evidence showed Guglielmi was\r\n\nqualified.  This is not, we think, a close question.\r\n\n          We set  the context.   Guglielmi did  not meet  her\r\n\nburden of demonstrating that  she is qualified.  There  is in\r\n\nthis record no suggestion that  the employer has applied  its\r\n\nstandards differentially.  The EEOC presents no evidence that\r\n\nthe employer has ever found a  similarly situated employee to\r\n\nbe  qualified to  handle the  essential medication  function.\r\n\nInstead, the  EEOC attempts  to derive from  its disagreement\r\n\nwith Amego  over whether Guglielmi is  qualified an inference\r\n\nthat   the  employer's  different   assessment  is  based  on\r\n\ndisability  discrimination.    However,  where,  as  here, no\r\n\nevidence  of animus  is present,  courts may  give reasonable\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\ndeference to  the employer's assessment of  what the position\r\n\ndemands.

The  ADA is interpreted in a manner similar to Title VII,\r\nSoileau, 105  F.3d at 16, and courts  have frequently invoked\r                   \r\nthe familiar burden-shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas in\r                                                                      \r\nADA cases.  The  qualification prong of the prima  facie case\r\nis frequently met  by a showing  that the employee  satisfied\r\nthe  prerequisites for the position and  that she can perform\r\nthe essential functions of the position held or desired.  See\r                                                                         \r\n42 U.S.C.   12111(8); 29 C.F.R.   1630.2(m).\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n124, 129 (1st  Cir. 1991).   Thus, plaintiffs  who have  been\r\n\ndenied  tenure must  show  that their  qualifications are  at\r\n\nleast  comparable  to those  of  a  \"middle group  of  tenure\r\n\ncandidates as to whom both a decision  granting tenure  and a\r\n\ndecision denying  tenure could  be justified as  a reasonable\r\n\nexercise of  discretion by the tenure-decision  making body.\"\r\n\nBanerjee  v.

Aware of the fine balance of competing considerations\r\n\nthat  preserve academic  freedom, this  court has  noted that\r\n\n\"[i]n tenure cases, courts must take special care to preserve\r\n\nthe University's autonomy in making lawful tenure decisions.\"\r\n\nBrown v. Trustees  of Boston  Univ., 891 F.2d  337, 346  (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1989).  \r\n\n          Similar care is required here.  Where the plaintiff\r\n\nhas presented no  evidence of discriminatory intent,  animus,\r\n\nor even pretext, we think there should be special sensitivity\r\n\nto  the  danger  of  the court  becoming  a  super-employment\r\n\ncommittee.   Unlike the  academic institutions in  the above-\r\n\ncited  cases,  Amego is  a small  employer.   Its  history of\r\n\nemployment decisions is neither  lengthy nor detailed, making\r\n\nit difficult to assume, without help from plaintiff, that the\r\n\nqualification   standards  it   asserts  for   Guglielmi  are\r\n\ndifferent from those required  of other employees.  Plaintiff\r\n\nhas failed to provide such help.   It is in this context that\r\n\nwe  review the  facts.   We are  also mindful  of the  Arline\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nfactors for assessing whether an employee poses a significant\r\n\nrisk to others.  Cf. Arline, 480 U.S. at 288.8\r                                       \r\n\n          It  was  eminently  reasonable  for  Amego  to   be\r\n\nconcerned    about   whether   Guglielmi   could   meet   her\r\n\nresponsibilities, and also reasonable for it to conclude that\r\n\nthe risk was too great to run.   The employer's judgment here\r\n\nabout the risks of future behavior by an employee is based on\r\n\npast behavior and reasonable indicia of future behavior.  \r\n\n          First,  the nature of the risk was such that it was\r\n\nextremely  difficult  to guard  against.    The clients  were\r\n\nparticularly vulnerable to abuse  or neglect.  The mechanisms\r\n\nto  insure that  they were  properly treated  with regard  to\r\n\ntheir medications, other than  having trustworthy staff, were\r\n\nnot obvious.  Amego had just learned that, despite its normal\r\n\nprocedures, four  patients at  the Fales Road  residence were\r\n\noverly medicated and  that it could not determine whether any\r\n\nmedications  were missing.    Testing the  clients' blood  to\r\n\ndetermine whether they had received the correct dosage level,\r\n\nor  indeed  the  correct  drugs,  has  to  be  considered  an\r\n\nextraordinary step, and not a safeguard which could routinely\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  In  determining whether  an individual  poses significant\r\nhealth  and safety risk  to others in  the contagious disease\r\ncontext, the Arline Court  suggested the consideration of the\r                               \r\nfollowing factors:  the nature of  the risk; the  duration of\r\nthe  risk; the  severity of  the risk  (potential of  harm to\r\nthird  parties), and  the probabilities  the disease  will be\r\ntransmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm.  Id.   We\r                                                                    \r\nconduct  our analysis of  the safety risk  Guglielmi poses to\r\nAmego clients against this backdrop.\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nbe  taken.  Additionally, the severity of the risk, i.e., the\r                                                                    \r\n\npotential  harm to third parties, Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, is\r                                                    \r\n\ngreat.   The  potential outcomes  of administering  the wrong\r\n\nmedication to a client are obvious and extreme.\r\n\n          Second,   there   were  performance   issues  which\r\n\nenhanced  the likelihood  that  the clients  could be  harmed\r\n\nunless  steps were  taken.   Amego received  complaints, from\r\n\nother  staff members, that  Guglielmi was unable  to focus on\r\n\nher job  and  was a  risk  to patients.   The  situation  was\r\n\nserious  enough  that  staff  members  sent  an  emissary  to\r\n\nmanagement, asking  that something be done.   The peculiarity\r\n\nof Guglielmi  finding the missing  medication log at  a place\r\n\nwhich had  been searched earlier would  reasonably give Amego\r\n\npause.   Amego had reason  to fear that  Guglielmi would take\r\n\nmedications  from  Amego.    When  the  police  came  to  her\r\n\napartment on the  night of her  second suicide attempt,  they\r\n\nfound  pills they believed to be Klonopin.  Klonopin is taken\r\n\nby cocaine  users, and management suspected the man with whom\r\n\nGuglielmi lived of being a cocaine user and of drugging Amego\r\n\nclients.9\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  Amego  did  not  learn  until after  it  had  decided  to\r\nterminate Guglielmi's  employment that Guglielmi had  lied to\r\nthem about  whether she  suspected Andrade of  using cocaine.\r\nBecause  it is unnecessary to the decision, we do not address\r\nthe issue  of whether this after-acquired  evidence could, in\r\nthe context of the ADA, be used for purposes other  than as a\r\nrationale for  terminating her employment, e.g.,  to buttress\r                                                           \r\nthe  employer's  judgment that  Guglielmi's untrustworthiness\r\naffected her  ability to  perform an essential  job function.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          Third, other measures  had not eliminated the  risk\r\n\nof  Guglielmi  mishandling  medication.    Amego  knew  that,\r\n\ndespite counselling  and medication, Guglielmi  had attempted\r\n\nsuicide  a second  time using medication  and that  she would\r\n\nhave access  to Prozac at work, one of the drugs used in this\r\n\nsecond attempt.   The EEOC  says that Amego  should have  had\r\n\ngreater  confidence in Guglielmi because  she no longer had a\r\n\nprescription  for drugs after  the second attempt.   There is\r\n\ncold comfort in that: this fact increased the likelihood that\r\n\nGuglielmi  would use the drugs available to her at work for a\r\n\nthird attempt.  Amego also knew that despite its provision of\r\n\na work schedule accommodation,  Guglielmi soon stopped  going\r\n\nto the therapy sessions  she said she wanted to  attend after\r\n\nher first suicide attempt.  Amego knew that by concealing her\r\n\nsuicide attempts  Guglielmi had misled them  about the nature\r\n\nof her previous absences from work. \r\n\n          Fourth,   when   Amego   sought  reassurance   from\r\n\nGuglielmi's health  care providers,  the  responses were  not\r\n\nconfidence-building.    Posever, the  social  worker, neither\r\n\nresponded to the substance of the request for information nor\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nCf.  Mantolete  v.

But  cf. McKennon  v. Nashville\r                                                                         \r\nBanner  Publ'g Co., 115 S.

After receiving  the\r\n\nchecklist,  Driscoll telephoned Posever.   Posever explicitly\r\n\ndeclined to give  a psychiatric medical opinion.   Dr. Levin,\r\n\nthe psychopharmacologist, gave  a brief response  which Amego\r\n\ncould  reasonably   understand  to  be  unresponsive  to  its\r\n\nconcerns and to be based on Guglielmi's own assessment of her\r\n\nability to do the work.\r\n\n          We also  credit  the deliberative  process  through\r\n\nwhich Amego made its decision.10  It sought additional input,\r\n\nincluding  that  from   Guglielmi's  medical  advisors,   and\r\n\nconsidered  other information  before reaching  its decision.\r\n\nThis  deliberative process  undercuts any  argument  that the\r\n\nemployer  based   its  decision   as  to   qualifications  on\r\n\nstereotypes about disability.  There  can be no serious claim\r\n\nthat Amego, which  had considerable  experience dealing  with\r\n\nmentally  handicapped persons and  integrating them  into the\r\n\ncommunity,  acted on the  basis of the  stereotypes and fears\r\n\nwhich  Congress wished to counteract in the ADA.  Also, Amego\r\n\nhad  earlier made  accommodations.   It  modified Guglielmi's\r\n\nschedule  so  that  she   could  receive  treatment  and  was\r\n\nsupportive  of her efforts to  deal with her  condition.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nSoileau, 105 F.3d at 17.\r                   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  As the district court noted, the irony is that, if Amego\r\nhad acted with less deliberation, the employment action would\r\nhave  been taken before the  effective date of  the ADA.  The\r\nADA became effective a few days before Guglielmi's discharge.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n          Amego also operated in a context which added weight\r\n\nto the risks it  thought Guglielmi posed.  Amego  is licensed\r\n\nby two state agencies and is required to take steps to assure\r\n\nthe  safety of  its patients.   If a  single client  had been\r\n\nharmed from misuse  of medication, then Amego  stood the risk\r\n\nof losing its licenses and its ability to care for any of its\r\n\nclients.11 \r\n\n          Under these  circumstances,  where no  evidence  of\r\n\ndifferential  treatment,  discrimination, or  stereotyping is\r\n\nproffered,  the  employer's  judgment  is  entitled  to  some\r\n\nweight.    The  EEOC's  \"Interpretive Guidance\"  to  its  ADA\r\n\nregulations notes that the  inquiry into essential  functions\r\n\nis  not  intended  to  second-guess  an  employer's  business\r\n\njudgment regarding production standards,  whether qualitative\r\n\nor  quantitative.  EEOC, Interpretive Guidance  on Title I of\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  In Arline, the Supreme Court noted that deference should\r                          \r\nbe  given to the judgments  of public health  officials as to\r\nthe  analysis   of  whether  an  individual  is  \"qualified.\"\r\nArline, 480  U.S. at 288;  cf. Abbott,  1997 WL 85096,  at *9\r                                                 \r\n(reasoning that deference of \"prima facie force is due public\r\nhealth officials\").   No  such direct evidence  was presented\r\nhere.   But it  is noteworthy that  Amego was subject  to the\r\nregulatory  requirements  of  two  public  agencies.    As  a\r\ncondition of  receipt of public funds, Amego must be licensed\r\nto  operate  by  the   Massachusetts  Department  of   Mental\r\nRetardation and  the Massachusetts Office for  Children.  One\r\nof  the  requirements  for licensure  included  ensuring  the\r\nsafety  and well-being  of the  clients entrusted  to Amego's\r\ncare. \r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nthe Americans with  Disabilities Act, app.  to 29 C.F.R.  pt.\r                                                \r\n\n1630.12\r\n\n          In somewhat similar  factual settings, other courts\r\n\nhave affirmed summary judgment on the issue of qualification.\r\n\nIn Doe  v. University  of Maryland  Medical System  Corp., 50\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  at 1261,  the defendant  medical center  terminated the\r\n\nemployment  of an  HIV-positive doctor.   The  court affirmed\r\n\nsummary  judgment on the grounds  that the doctor  was not an\r\n\n\"otherwise   qualified\"  individual   because   he  posed   a\r\n\nsignificant  risk to  patients that  could not  be eliminated\r\n\nthrough  reasonable accommodation.   Id. at 1266.   The court\r                                                    \r\n\nrejected the doctor's argument  that the risk of transmission\r\n\nwas  so  infinitesimal  that   it  could  not  be  considered\r\n\nsignificant.  Id. The  employer had relied on recommendations\r                             \r\n\nfrom the Center for Disease Control in analyzing  whether the\r\n\ndoctor's  job functions fit  the definition of exposure-prone\r\n\nprocedures.  Id. at 1264.  The court expressed its reluctance\r                            \r\n\nto substitute  its judgment for  that of the  medical center.\r\n\nId. at 1266.  In Bradley v. University of Texas M.D. Anderson\r                                                                         \r\n\nCancer  Center, 3 F.3d 922 (5th Cir. 1993), the Fifth Circuit\r                          \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

This not such a case.   Rather,\r                                       \r\nAmego based its determination on Guglielmi's capabilities \"at\r\nthe  time  of  the  employment  decision,\"  as  the  Guidance\r\nsuggests is appropriate.

If the\r\n\nBehavior Therapist  position required no  responsibility with\r\n\nrespect  to  medication, there  would  be more  force  to the\r\n\nEEOC's position.   See Hurley-Bardige v. Brown, 900  F. Supp.\r                                                          \r\n\n567, 570 (D.  Mass. 1995)(finding  that there is  \"no per  se\r\n\nrule against transfers  as reasonable accommodations\").   But\r\n\nthe position did entail that responsibility. \r\n\n          Although   medication-related    duties   are   not\r\n\nspecifically   mentioned  in   the  Behavior   Therapist  job\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\ndescription, the ability to handle,  administer, and document\r\n\nmedication  was inherently part  of the  Behavior Therapist's\r\n\nfunction,   as  listed   in   Amego's  job   description,  of\r\n\n\"implementing individual clinical and  educational programs.\"\r\n\n13 \r\n\n          All  Behavior Therapists  receive  training in  the\r\n\nadministration of medications.  Behavior Therapists accompany\r\n\nclients  on frequent  off-site trips  into the  community and\r\n\nmust dispense  medications  to clients  at appropriate  times\r\n\nwithout  supervision.   When  no  Shift  Supervisors or  Team\r\n\nLeaders  are present,  the Behavior Therapists  must dispense\r\n\nmedications  at  the  residences.   Behavior  Therapists also\r\n\naccept   deliveries  of   client   medications   in   Amego's\r\n\nfacilities.    Keys  to   the  medicine  cabinet  are  easily\r\n\naccessible to Behavior Therapists. \r\n\n          There is  no  material factual  dispute;  only  the\r\n\nlegal  implications  of  these  facts are  in  true  dispute.\r\n\nMedication-related duties of  the Behavior Therapist position\r\n\nare  essential, and not marginal, to the position.  While the\r\n\namount  of  time  a   Behavior  Therapist  spends  dispensing\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  Evidence of whether  a particular function  is essential\r\nincludes, but  is not  limited to, written  job descriptions;\r\nthe employer's judgment as  to which functions are essential;\r\nthe  amount of time spent on the job performing the function;\r\nthe consequences  of not  requiring the plaintiff  to perform\r\nthe  function; and the work experience of those who are doing\r\nor have done similar jobs.  29 C.F.R.   1630.2(n).  \r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nmedication is not great, the consequences of getting it wrong\r\n\nare quite great indeed.  \r\n\n          There was no accommodation that Amego could make to\r\n\nthe Behavior Therapist position that would not cause it undue\r\n\nhardship.  See  42 U.S.C.    12112(b)(5)(A),  12111(9).14  To\r                          \r\n\nretain  Guglielmi   while  eliminating  all   of  Guglielmi's\r\n\nmedication-related duties,  it would  have been  necessary to\r\n\nhire another  Behavior  Therapist to  be paired  with her  to\r\n\nensure that she would never  be left alone with a client  who\r\n\nneeded  medication.     Amego  might  also   have  needed  an\r\n\nadditional supervisor  to ensure that Guglielmi  did not have\r\n\naccess to  client medications.   The expense of  hiring these\r\n\nadditional  staff would  be too great  for a  small nonprofit\r\n\nlike  Amego to be reasonably  expected to bear.15   See Vande\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  In determining whether an accommodation  would impose an\r\nundue hardship under  the ADA, the  factors to be  considered\r\ninclude:  the  nature  and  cost of  the  accommodation;  the\r\noverall financial  resources of  the facility; the  number of\r\npersons employed at the facility; the effect on expenses  and\r\nresources, or the impact otherwise of such accommodation upon\r\nthe  operation  of   the  facility;  the   overall  financial\r\nresources  of  the covered  entity; the  overall size  of the\r\nbusiness of a covered entity; the number, type,  and location\r\nof  its facilities; and the type of operations of the covered\r\nentity including the composition, structure, and functions of\r\nthe workforce  of such entity;  the geographic  separateness,\r\nadministrative,  or fiscal  relationship of  the facility  in\r\nquestion to the covered entity.  42 U.S.C.   12111(10)(B).\r\n\n15.  The  cost  of  an  additional  Behavior  Therapist,  for\r\nexample, would be approximately $20,000 (base  wages annually\r\nwith benefits).  Given that Amego ended the fiscal years 1992\r\nand  1993 with a deficit, this would require additional funds\r\nwhich Amego does not have. \r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nZande v.

Assigning\r\n\nGuglielmi to  that one  client would disrupt  Amego's crucial\r\n\none-staff-member-to-two-clients  ratio,16  or  result in  the\r\n\nneed  for an  additional  Behavior Therapist.   Both  options\r\n\nwould alter the basic  operations of Amego and go  beyond the\r\n\nscope of  a reasonable accommodation.   See Reigel  v.

To do what the EEOC asks would be to alter the\r\n\nvery  nature  of  the  Behavior Therapist  position.    \"Such\r\n\nredefinition exceeds  reasonable accommodation.\"   Bradley, 3\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d at 925.  \r\n\n \"Because Of\" and the Conduct/Disability Distinction\r                                                                \r\n\n          The EEOC argues that it met its burden on causation\r\n\nbecause, it says, the ADA prohibits adverse employment action\r\n\nthat is based on conduct related  to a disability to the same\r\n\nextent that  it prohibits adverse employment  action based on\r\n\nthe  underlying  disability  itself.    It  says  that  Amego\r\n\nterminated Guglielmi because of her suicide attempts and that\r\n\nthe  termination was, therefore, \"because of\" her disability.\r\n\nEven if Amego terminated  Guglielmi for misusing  medication,\r\n\nrather  than  for  attempting  suicide,  the  EEOC  says  the\r\n\ntermination decision was still \"because of\" her disability.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n17.  Amego's  philosophy  of   maximizing  community   access\r\nopportunities is  incorporated into its funding contracts and\r\ninto clients'  individualized  programs.   Amego  would  have\r\nviolated  those   agreements  if  it  were   to  diminish  or\r\nartificially  restrict  community  access  opportunities  for\r\neither Guglielmi's or another employee's clients. \r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\n          To the extent that the EEOC is arguing that conduct\r\n\nconnected to  a disability  always must be  considered to  be\r\n\naction  \"because  of\"  a  disability, that  is  too  broad  a\r\n\nformulation.  While one may hypothesize certain conduct which\r\n\nis in  fact more  closely compelled  by the  disability (e.g.\r                                                                         \r\n\nprofanity from Tourette's Syndrome sufferers), this case does\r\n\nnot provide the occasion to explore what merit there might be\r\n\nto  a more refined formulation  of the EEOC's  position.  The\r\n\nsyllogism which the EEOC presents -- Guglielmi was depressed,\r\n\ntherefore Guglielmi attempted suicide, therefore any response\r\n\nto  the attempted suicide  is \"because of\"  her disability --\r\n\nbreaks down.  Apart from the evidence that staff believed she\r\n\nwas  a threat to clients based on her at-work behavior alone,\r\n\nAmego has  been clear, for  purposes of the  summary judgment\r\n\nmotion, that it was the manner of the suicide attempts -- use\r\n\nof  medications, including  prescription medications  -- that\r\n\nmotivated its decision.18\r\n\n          There  is  simply   no  evidence  that  Guglielmi's\r\n\ndepression  compelled her  to  overdose  on  medications,  as\r\n\nopposed to  other methods  of attempting suicide.   At  best,\r\n\nEEOC's evidence  was that individuals suffering  from bulimia\r\n\nand depression sometimes  have suicidal  thoughts or  attempt\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.  Amego,  through  its Safety  Committee,  determined that\r\nGuglielmi  could  not  safely   perform  any  of  the  eleven\r\nresponsibilities  of the  Team  Leader position  but did  not\r\nraise this argument on summary judgment. \r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nsuicide.

It serves twenty-five to thirty clients, including six in a residential program in Mansfield, Massachusetts, where Ann Marie Guglielmi was employed as a Team Leader.  The Team Leader position required her to be responsible for the care of these disabled clients, including the responsibility of administering vital medications to them.  After an unresolved investigation of improprieties in the administering of medication to patients at a related facility, Amego learned that other staff felt Guglielmi was not performing her job adequately and was putting patients at risk.  Amego also learned that Ms. Guglielmi had twice attempted to commit suicide within the previous six weeks by overdosing on medications.  This, Amego decided, meant that Guglielmi could not safely dispense medications, an essential job function, and that there was no other job reasonably available to her.  Her employment was thus terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") sued Amego on behalf of Guglielmi under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.   The district court entered summary judgment against the EEOC, holding that the EEOC had not made out a prima facie case that Guglielmi was an otherwise \"qualified\" individual, that an accommodation could be reasonably made, and that there was discrimination \"because of\" her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC appeals and argues that the question of whether an employee poses a significant risk to other individuals in the workplace is an affirmative defense on which the employer bears the burden of proof and is thus not part of the plaintiff's burden that the employee is qualified.  Those issues of qualification and risk, the EEOC says, are matters for the jury to resolve at trial and may not be resolved on summary judgment.  The EEOC also invites this court to hold that \"adverse employment action taken because of conduct related to a disability is tantamount to action taken because of a disability itself\" for purposes of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Founded in 1972 by parents of autistic individuals, Amego receives public funding and is licensed by two state agencies.  A condition of licensing is that Amego provide conditions that ensure the safety and well-being of its clients.  Amego maintains a very low client-to-staff ratio, usually one staff member to two clients.  One particularly aggressive client required supervision by three staff members, eighteen hours a day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amego has a policy of not rejecting those who seek its help.  Most of its clients engage in aggressive and self-injuring behavior, including self-mutilation.  Many have been rejected by, or discharged from, other agencies.  Most clients are on prescription medications, and in June of 1992, all clients at the Mansfield residence, save one, were receiving prescription medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with its philosophy of attempted integration, Amego provides its clients with access to community activities on a regular basis.  Residential clients are transported daily to the Day Treatment Program, where they frequently are taken by direct care staff to stores, bowling alleys, banks, and the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, Amego hired Guglielmi as a Behavior Therapist.  She was then about 21 years old and did not represent herself to have any disability.  In January 1991, she was diagnosed as bulimic and clinically depressed;  however, she did not tell her employer about these conditions until after her first suicide attempt, over a year after the diagnosis.  She was prescribed Prozac in 1991, but it only partially alleviated the depression.  She stopped taking the drug in April.  In the fall of 1991, she started living with her boyfriend, David Andrade, who worked at a different Amego residence.  That relationship was fraught with problems.  Andrade used cocaine;  Guglielmi, however, says she did not confirm her suspicions of that until late June 1992.  In early 1992, she started seeing a social worker, Margaret Posever, for bimonthly therapy sessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier, in July 1991, Guglielmi was promoted to the position of Team Leader at the Mansfield residence.  The essential functions of that position included:  supervising the day-to-day implementation of individual clinical, educational, and vocational programs and data collection for all programs;  serving as a role model for staff in all areas of client programming, client services, and professional practice;  assessing staff performance, providing additional training, support, and counseling as appropriate;  ensuring that Amego's policies and procedures on clients' rights were implemented and documented;  responding appropriately in crisis situations;  and administering and documenting the use of prescribed medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1992, Guglielmi received a performance evaluation which said she was an \"exceptional\" Team Leader.  The evaluation was based on her performance through January 1992.  In the spring of 1992, Guglielmi applied for promotion to the position of Program Coordinator for the Mansfield residence.  The promotion instead went to Kristen Stone.  Stone assumed her new responsibilities on May 4, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same day, Guglielmi deliberately took an overdose of nonprescription sleeping pills which she had purchased for that purpose.  After taking the pills, she told Andrade what she had done;  he took her to the emergency room.  She was transferred to a psychiatric hospital and released later that evening.  She told health care workers that she attempted suicide because she was upset by problems in her relationship with her boyfriend, her failure to receive the promotion, and other work-related stress.  She was readmitted to the psychiatric hospital on May 6, 1992, and stayed there until May 12 because of concerns about her safety.  On the day of her readmission to the hospital--two days after her suicide attempt--Guglielmi was not able to \"contract for safety\" with her therapist Posever.  Guglielmi told Posever that even if she were to so contract, her mood was in such flux that she could not be sure she would not hurt herself anyway.  A week after returning to work, and again two weeks later, she told Posever that she felt suicidal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Guglielmi returned to work on May 13, she told her supervisor only that she had been hospitalized for bulimia and depression.  She did not say that she had attempted suicide.  She asked her supervisor to modify her work schedule so that she could attend therapy twice or thrice weekly.  Her supervisor agreed to this accommodation.  However, Guglielmi stopped going to the therapy sessions after a few weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1992, Guglielmi began seeing Dr. Kenneth Levin for psychopharmacological treatment.  He diagnosed her as suffering from bulimia and major depression, prescribed Prozac and trazodone, and saw her to monitor her use of medication.  Prozac was one of the medications regularly administered to Amego's clients.  On June 4, 1992, she told Dr. Levin that she had experienced periodic feelings of increased depression, including a period when she contemplated overdosing.  She assured Dr. Levin that if such thoughts recurred, she would not act on them but would inform her boyfriend or a health care provider.  She did not keep her word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, Guglielmi deliberately overdosed again, this time using her prescription medications, Prozac and trazadone, as well as aspirin.  After taking the overdose, she called the Plainville police, who took her to the hospital.  She was released on June 15, 1992.  She told her health care providers that she was not really depressed when she overdosed but wanted to provoke a reaction from her boyfriend.  When Guglielmi returned to work on June 17, she again did not tell her employer that she had attempted suicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day Guglielmi returned to work, the Executive Director of Amego, Caryn Driscoll, and the Director of Administrative Services, Karen Seal, met with David Andrade about his job performance problems.  During this meeting, Andrade mentioned rumors that clients were being drugged at the Fales Road residence.  He worked at that location regularly, and Guglielmi worked there occasionally.  Around that time, Driscoll learned that Klonopin, one of the medications prescribed for clients, was either missing or was being used at an accelerated rate at the Fales Road residence.  Some cocaine users take Klonopin as an antidote, to calm them down from the effects of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amego investigated and found that four of the clients at the Fales Road residence (two of whom should not have had Klonopin at all) had blood levels of Klonopin which were too high.  Amego asked any employees who had pertinent information to step forward.  Guglielmi did so and was interviewed on June 26 by Driscoll, Amego's Human Rights Officer, and a private investigator.  During the interview, Guglielmi focused on her relationship with Andrade, who she feared might be targeted in the investigation.  She said that she was suffering from bulimia and depression and revealed for the first time her two recent suicide attempts.  In an attempt to explain Andrade's performance issues, she said that he had helped her when she attempted suicide two times by overdosing on both prescription and over-the-counter drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier, on June 5, a shift supervisor at the Mansfield residence, Chester Millet, had noticed that the medication log was missing.  He conducted a thorough search, including behind the medication cabinet, and did not find it.  Guglielmi also helped look for it.  On the same day of her interview with Driscoll, June 26, Guglielmi reported that she had found the missing medication log.  She said the log had been behind the medication cabinet, between the cabinet and the wall.  Millet told Driscoll that he had previously looked there and had not seen it.  Although Driscoll did not initially consider Guglielmi under suspicion for the improper drugging of patients at Fales Road, she and other staff members found the discovery of the book by Guglielmi to be peculiar.  A review of the medication log showed that the supply of drugs on hand at the Mansfield residence was excessive.  It was not possible to determine from the log whether medications were missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, Driscoll spoke with the Plainville police about her concerns about the drugging of patients at Fales Road.  The police told Driscoll that they found pills, initially thought to be Klonopin, in Guglielmi's apartment on the night they responded to her suicide call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around June 28, Driscoll received a call from Carlos Andrade, an Amego employee and David Andrade's brother.  He told her that staff members felt Guglielmi's job performance was suffering and had asked him to do something about it.  He reported that staff members were uncomfortable with her job performance, that she was erratic in behavior, had mood swings, seemed to be focussed on her personal problems, that she was seen walking outside and crying, that she was heard fighting on the phone with David Andrade, and that she was self-absorbed and unable to concentrate on her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carlos Andrade also passed on that Millet, the shift supervisor and one of the most senior staff members at the Mansfield residence, was concerned that Guglielmi had suddenly handed him the drug log, saying that she had found it in the residence when he had searched everywhere for it.  Driscoll confirmed Carlos Andrade's report with Millet, who had never before complained about another employee.  Carlos Andrade felt that Guglielmi was not performing her job safely and was putting clients at risk.  Driscoll knew there was no way to prevent Guglielmi from having access to medication while she worked at Amego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, on July 1, Driscoll informed Guglielmi in writing that she was temporarily removed from her position as Team Leader and would be reassigned to perform clerical and other light duties.  The letter stated that the fact that Guglielmi's recent hospitalizations were the result of deliberate overdoses of prescription medications raised \"concerns about [her] ability to perform [her] present job functions including medication ordering, dispensing and shift supervision.\"   The letter also indicated that Amego's Safety Committee would meet to determine whether Guglielmi could perform her job, or another available job, with or without accommodations.  Driscoll said that the Committee should seek medical information from Guglielmi's treating physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to obtain a professional opinion on Guglielmi's ability to resume her duties, Driscoll sent a letter to Posever on July 1 asking whether Guglielmi could perform eleven duties that a Team Leader would need to perform, set forth on a checklist.  The letter came back to Amego on July 8 with a check in the \"yes\" column for each job duty.  Only Guglielmi had signed the bottom of the checklist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Driscoll called Posever to ask if the checklist accurately reflected Posever's opinion that Guglielmi could complete the duties or whether the list merely reflected Guglielmi's own opinion.  Posever told Driscoll she was not a medical doctor, that the checklist did not represent a medical competency evaluation as to each specific job duty, nor was it a guarantee regarding each duty.  It was rather that, based on her discussions with Guglielmi and her knowledge of her work and treatment history, Posever had no reason to think Guglielmi could not perform those duties.  Posever's checking \"yes\" was based on her observations of Guglielmi's demeanor and on Guglielmi's statement that she felt comfortable giving out psychotropic medications at work, even in light of her suicide attempts.  Driscoll appeared dissatisfied with the response and pressed for a more definitive opinion, which Posever declined to give.  Later, Driscoll told Guglielmi that Posever's response was inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 22, Driscoll sent Dr. Levin a letter requesting his opinion as to whether Guglielmi could perform the eleven functions of her job and enclosing the checklist.  In a letter dated July 27, 1992, Dr. Levin wrote that Guglielmi was no longer on prescription medication.  He concluded:  \"My understanding is that she has consistently performed her regular job responsibilities conscientiously and I see no difficulty with her returning to her regular position.\"   There was no checklist with the letter Amego received.  Driscoll viewed Dr. Levin's conclusions as largely being based on what Guglielmi said she could do and her representation that she had no performance problems.  But Driscoll knew from staff complaints that Guglielmi had a range of performance problems.  And Driscoll knew Dr. Levin had not checked with anyone at Amego about whether Guglielmi was in fact performing well.  Driscoll told Guglielmi that Dr. Levin's letter did not adequately deal with the job functions issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Driscoll was also concerned that the parents of Amego's charges would feel that their children would be put at risk by being in the care of someone who abused prescription drugs.  The parents, she felt, would contact one of the state agencies which licensed Amego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, the Safety Committee met.  The Committee was comprised of four administrators:  Seal, the Director of Administrative Services;  Amego's Health Coordinator, who was a nurse;  the Staff Development Coordinator;  and the Administrative Assistant/Workers' Compensation Coordinator.  The Committee found that Guglielmi was not in fact performing her job duties conscientiously or performing them well.  The Committee concluded that Guglielmi could not safely perform the Team Leader position and that there was no Amego position that could be modified to accommodate her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1992, Amego's Board of Directors was informed of the recommendation of the Safety Committee and, after additional discussion, concluded that there was no alternative position that could accommodate Guglielmi.  The following day Driscoll informed Guglielmi that her employment was terminated.  Amego says its core concern was that Guglielmi could not meet the essential job function of handling prescription medication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered summary judgment for Amego, finding that the EEOC had failed to meet its burden under the ADA of showing that Guglielmi was qualified for the position of Team Leader and that Amego could have made a reasonable accommodation.  The district court also found that the EEOC had failed to meet its burden of showing that Amego had discriminated against Guglielmi \"because of\" a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of appellate review of entry of summary judgment in ADA cases, as in all others, is de novo.  Soileau v. Guilford, 105 F.3d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1997).  The EEOC bore the burden of showing that Guglielmi was qualified to perform, either with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of her job.  See Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 511 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For summary judgment purposes, the parties do not dispute that Guglielmi was a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA.  It is also undisputed that an essential function of the Team Leader position is to administer and monitor the medication of Amego's clients.  The written job description provides that this is an essential job function, and the EEOC concedes that Team Leaders have access to locked medicine cabinets containing large quantities of drugs and are expected to administer medications to clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case initially turns on whether the EEOC has met its burden of showing that Guglielmi was a \"qualified\" person.  Amego's position is that it terminated Guglielmi's employment because she showed by her conduct--by behavior leading co-workers to have concerns about whether she was a risk to clients and by her two attempts to commit suicide using prescription and non-prescription drugs--that she could not reasonably be trusted to meet her responsibilities as to medications.  Although the qualification analysis could be understood to subsume the concept of reasonable accommodation, we think it analytically sounder to treat the two topics separately.  Cf. Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979)(\"An otherwise qualified person [under the Rehabilitation Act] is one who is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his handicap.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>Qualification/Direct Threat Under Title I of the ADA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand the EEOC's burden of proof argument, it is necessary to understand the ADA statutory scheme.  At its core, Title I of the ADA is about protecting the disabled from discriminatory employment action based on stereotypes and fear.  See H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 45 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 468;  see also Jacques, 96 F.3d at 511.   The prima facie case establishes that because an individual with a disability is qualified, yet has suffered adverse employment action because of that disability, the employer may have engaged in the type of discrimination the ADA is designed to prevent.  Here, the plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case:  there is no evidence suggesting the presence of any disability-based discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule of the ADA is that an employer shall not \"discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability....\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).  It is generally accepted that, in a Title I case, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing she is a \"qualified\" individual.  See Jacques, 96 F.3d at 511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A qualified individual is one who can perform the essential functions of the job held.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(m).  The statute also says that \"the term 'qualification standards' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12113(b).  It defines \"direct threat\" as meaning \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(3).  The rub is that the language about \"qualification standards\" under Title I appears in a section of the statute entitled \"Defenses.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12113(a) (\"It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under [the ADA] that an alleged application of qualification standards ... has been shown to be job-related.\")   The EEOC argues that the employer bears the burden of proof on this affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC argues further that whenever an issue of threats to the safety or health of others is involved in a Title I case, it must be analyzed under the \"direct threat\" provision of &#167; 12113(b) as an affirmative defense.  Specifically, the EEOC contends that the &#167; 12113(b) provision that qualification standards may include a requirement that an individual not be a direct threat is to be read in the context of the defense set out in &#167; 12113(a).  The EEOC supports its position by noting that &#167; 12113 is captioned \"Defenses.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, the EEOC says, the district court erred in considering the matter of whether Guglielmi posed a threat to the safety of Amego's clients as a matter of \"qualification,\" on which plaintiff bears the burden.  Amego contends that the risks posed to others may be considered as part of the qualified individual analysis, and that the specific discussion of a direct threat defense in &#167;   12113 does not preclude the consideration of safety risks in other prongs of the ADA analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the statutory scheme does not clearly resolve this debate, we look to the legislative history to determine whether risks posed to others may only be considered in the direct threat defense context.  See United States v. Charter Int'l Oil Co., 83 F.3d 510, 517 (1st Cir.1996).  Upon such review, we discern no congressional intent to preclude the consideration of essential job functions that implicate the safety of others as part of the \"qualifications\" analysis, particularly where the essential functions of a job involve the care of others unable to care for themselves.  The House Report<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> said that, in the definition of \"direct threat,\" \"[t]he Committee intends to codify the direct threat standard used by the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 34 (1990), 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 457.   The House Report goes on to say that, \"[i]f the applicant is otherwise qualified for the job, he or she cannot be disqualified on the basis of a physical or mental condition unless the employer can demonstrate that the applicant's disability poses a direct threat to others in the workplace....  The plaintiff is not required to prove that he or she poses no risk.\"  Id. at 46, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 469.   The intent to codify Arline suggests that the burden is on plaintiff to show that he or she is qualified in the sense of not posing a direct threat.  Arline considered that issue to be part of the \"qualification\" analysis under &#167; 504 as to which plaintiff bears the burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Arline, 480 U.S. at 287-88, 107 S.Ct. at 1130-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA also contains a directive that it be enforced in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12117(b).  Courts therefore use caselaw under &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, for guidance in interpreting the ADA.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(d)(\"The standards used to determine whether this section [&#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act] has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under Title I of the [ADA].\");  Katz v. City Metal Co., Inc., 87 F.3d 26, 31 n. 4 (1st Cir.1996) (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \"is interpreted substantially identically to the ADA.\").  Under &#167; 504, it is clear that the question of whether the employment of the plaintiff poses risks to the health of others is analyzed as a matter of whether the person is \"otherwise qualified.\"  Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130;  see also Abbott v. Bragdon, 107 F.3d 934, 943 (1st Cir.1997) (\"A court's goal in conducting a direct threat analysis under the ADA is to achieve a reasonable balance, protecting service providers ... from enforced exposure to unacceptable health and safety risks\" while protecting the disabled from discrimination.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Arline, the Court held that the issue of the threat to others posed by an employee with a communicable disease was properly analyzed as a question of whether the employee was \"otherwise qualified.\"  Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130.   The Court noted that a \"person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk.\"  Id. at 287 n. 16, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 n. 16.  Arguably, in Arline, the question of whether the plaintiff could perform the core functions of a school teacher's job was separate from the question of whether she nonetheless posed a risk because of her communicable disease.  Here, the questions are not separate:  the issue of risk posed to others arises in the context of a core function of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC correctly points out that, unlike the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA's definition of \"qualified individual\" does not address risk posed to others.  While it is true that the implementing regulations under the Rehabilitation Act define \"qualified individual with handicaps\" specifically to include \"without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.203(6), Congress intended the ADA's definition of \"qualified individual with a disability\" to be \"comparable to the definition used in regulations implementing section 501 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\"   H.R. Rep. 101-485, pt. 2, at 55, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 337.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC stakes out a position which is far too broad.  This is not a case where a person who can perform all essential job functions nonetheless poses a risk to others.  The district court did not, we believe, commit error in considering risk posed to others under the category of \"qualification,\" where the risk is expressly associated with performance of an essential job function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise issue here concerns the employer's judgment that Guglielmi could not be trusted to handle the medication-related functions of her job.  In this case, a failure to perform an essential function--overseeing and administering medication--would necessarily create a risk to others.  That a failure to perform a job function correctly creates a risk to others does not preclude the ability to perform that function from being a job qualification.  The position argued by the EEOC would lead to the anomalous result that there is a lesser burden of proving qualifications on a plaintiff where the job involves the care of others, and necessarily entails risk to others, than when the job does not.  We do not believe Congress intended to weaken the burden on plaintiffs to show they are qualified in such circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In such cases, where the employee is responsible for ensuring the safety of others entrusted to his or her care, other courts, without discussion of the point the EEOC raises, have simply considered the risk question to be part of the \"qualified\" analysis.  See, e.g., Doe v. University of Maryland Med.  Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1265 (4th Cir.1995);  Altman v. New York City Health and Hosp. Corp., 903 F.Supp. 503, 509-10 (S.D.N.Y.1995);  Mauro v. Borgess Med.  Ctr., 886 F.Supp. 1349, 1352-53 (W.D.Mich.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that, in a Title I ADA case, it is the plaintiff's burden to show that he or she can perform the essential functions of the job, and is therefore \"qualified.\"   Where those essential job functions necessarily implicate the safety of others, plaintiff must demonstrate that she can perform those functions in a way that does not endanger others.  There may be other cases under Title I where the issue of direct threat is not tied to the issue of essential job functions but is purely a matter of defense, on which the defendant would bear the burden.  This case does not raise or resolve issues of the role of \"direct threat\" provisions under other parts of the ADA, such as the public accommodation title.  Cf. Abbott, 107 F.3d 934.   For the reasons which follow, we conclude plaintiff's burden was not met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Appropriateness of Summary Judgment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC argues that a jury question is presented, in any event, as to whether the evidence showed Guglielmi was qualified.  This is not, we think, a close question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the context.  Guglielmi did not meet her burden of demonstrating that she is qualified.  There is in this record no suggestion that the employer has applied its standards differentially.  The EEOC presents no evidence that the employer has ever found a similarly situated employee to be qualified to handle the essential medication function.  Instead, the EEOC attempts to derive from its disagreement with Amego over whether Guglielmi is qualified an inference that the employer's different assessment is based on disability discrimination.  However, where, as here, no evidence of animus is present, courts may give reasonable deference to the employer's assessment of what the position demands.  See Doe v. New York Univ., 666 F.2d 761, 776 (2d Cir.1981)(finding that, in case involving mentally ill applicant to medical school, \"considerable judicial deference must be paid to the evaluation made by the institution itself, absent proof that its standards and its application of them serve no purpose other than to deny an education to handicapped persons\");  cf.  Southeastern Community College, 442 U.S. at 406, 99 S.Ct. at 2367 (supporting reasonable deference to the decisions made by administrators of federally funded programs so long as no evidence is presented of discriminatory intent with regard to the handicapped person).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement of showing \"qualifications\" has substance, notwithstanding the frequent leapfrogging of that analysis to get to the pretext issue under McDonnell Douglas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In the context of academic tenure cases, this court has been attentive to the need to balance the right of a plaintiff to be free from discrimination against the undesirable result of having the court sit as a \"super-tenure committee.\"   See Villanueva v. Wellesley College, 930 F.2d 124, 129 (1st Cir.1991).  Thus, plaintiffs who have been denied tenure must show that their qualifications are at least comparable to those of a \"middle group of tenure candidates as to whom both a decision granting tenure and a decision denying tenure could be justified as a reasonable exercise of discretion by the tenure-decision making body.\"  Banerjee v. Board of Trustees, 648 F.2d 61, 63 (1st Cir.1981).  Aware of the fine balance of competing considerations that preserve academic freedom, this court has noted that \"[i]n tenure cases, courts must take special care to preserve the University's autonomy in making lawful tenure decisions.\"  Brown v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d 337, 346 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar care is required here.  Where the plaintiff has presented no evidence of discriminatory intent, animus, or even pretext, we think there should be special sensitivity to the danger of the court becoming a super-employment committee.  Unlike the academic institutions in the above-cited cases, Amego is a small employer.  Its history of employment decisions is neither lengthy nor detailed, making it difficult to assume, without help from plaintiff, that the qualification standards it asserts for Guglielmi are different from those required of other employees.  Plaintiff has failed to provide such help.  It is in this context that we review the facts.  We are also mindful of the Arline factors for assessing whether an employee poses a significant risk to others.  Cf. Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was eminently reasonable for Amego to be concerned about whether Guglielmi could meet her responsibilities, and also reasonable for it to conclude that the risk was too great to run.  The employer's judgment here about the risks of future behavior by an employee is based on past behavior and reasonable indicia of future behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the nature of the risk was such that it was extremely difficult to guard against.  The clients were particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect.  The mechanisms to insure that they were properly treated with regard to their medications, other than having trustworthy staff, were not obvious.  Amego had just learned that, despite its normal procedures, four patients at the Fales Road residence were overly medicated and that it could not determine whether any medications were missing.  Testing the clients' blood to determine whether they had received the correct dosage level, or indeed the correct drugs, has to be considered an extraordinary step, and not a safeguard which could routinely be taken.  Additionally, the severity of the risk, i.e., the potential harm to third parties, Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131, is great.  The potential outcomes of administering the wrong medication to a client are obvious and extreme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there were performance issues which enhanced the likelihood that the clients could be harmed unless steps were taken.  Amego received complaints, from other staff members, that Guglielmi was unable to focus on her job and was a risk to patients.  The situation was serious enough that staff members sent an emissary to management, asking that something be done.  The peculiarity of Guglielmi finding the missing medication log at a place which had been searched earlier would reasonably give Amego pause.  Amego had reason to fear that Guglielmi would take medications from Amego.  When the police came to her apartment on the night of her second suicide attempt, they found pills they believed to be Klonopin.  Klonopin is taken by cocaine users, and management suspected the man with whom Guglielmi lived of being a cocaine user and of drugging Amego clients.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, other measures had not eliminated the risk of Guglielmi mishandling medication.  Amego knew that, despite counselling and medication, Guglielmi had attempted suicide a second time using medication and that she would have access to Prozac at work, one of the drugs used in this second attempt.  The EEOC says that Amego should have had greater confidence in Guglielmi because she no longer had a prescription for drugs after the second attempt.  There is cold comfort in that:  this fact increased the likelihood that Guglielmi would use the drugs available to her at work for a third attempt.  Amego also knew that despite its provision of a work schedule accommodation, Guglielmi soon stopped going to the therapy sessions she said she wanted to attend after her first suicide attempt.  Amego knew that by concealing her suicide attempts Guglielmi had misled them about the nature of her previous absences from work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, when Amego sought reassurance from Guglielmi's health care providers, the responses were not confidence-building.  Posever, the social worker, neither responded to the substance of the request for information nor signed her name to the checklist.  After receiving the checklist, Driscoll telephoned Posever.  Posever explicitly declined to give a psychiatric medical opinion.  Dr. Levin, the psychopharmacologist, gave a brief response which Amego could reasonably understand to be unresponsive to its concerns and to be based on Guglielmi's own assessment of her ability to do the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also credit the deliberative process through which Amego made its decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  It sought additional input, including that from Guglielmi's medical advisors, and considered other information before reaching its decision.  This deliberative process undercuts any argument that the employer based its decision as to qualifications on stereotypes about disability.  There can be no serious claim that Amego, which had considerable experience dealing with mentally handicapped persons and integrating them into the community, acted on the basis of the stereotypes and fears which Congress wished to counteract in the ADA.  Also, Amego had earlier made accommodations.  It modified Guglielmi's schedule so that she could receive treatment and was supportive of her efforts to deal with her condition.  See Soileau, 105 F.3d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amego also operated in a context which added weight to the risks it thought Guglielmi posed.  Amego is licensed by two state agencies and is required to take steps to assure the safety of its patients.  If a single client had been harmed from misuse of medication, then Amego stood the risk of losing its licenses and its ability to care for any of its clients.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, where no evidence of differential treatment, discrimination, or stereotyping is proffered, the employer's judgment is entitled to some weight.  The EEOC's \"Interpretive Guidance\" to its ADA regulations notes that the inquiry into essential functions is not intended to second-guess an employer's business judgment regarding production standards, whether qualitative or quantitative.  EEOC, Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, app. to 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In somewhat similar factual settings, other courts have affirmed summary judgment on the issue of qualification.  In Doe v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp., 50 F.3d at 1261, the defendant medical center terminated the employment of an HIV-positive doctor.  The court affirmed summary judgment on the grounds that the doctor was not an \"otherwise qualified\" individual because he posed a significant risk to patients that could not be eliminated through reasonable accommodation.  Id. at 1266.   The court rejected the doctor's argument that the risk of transmission was so infinitesimal that it could not be considered significant.  Id. The employer had relied on recommendations from the Center for Disease Control in analyzing whether the doctor's job functions fit the definition of exposure-prone procedures.  Id. at 1264.   The court expressed its reluctance to substitute its judgment for that of the medical center.  Id. at 1266.   In Bradley v. University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 3 F.3d 922 (5th Cir.1993), the Fifth Circuit affirmed entry of summary judgment for the employer on a Rehabilitation Act claim with similar facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Fourth Circuit in Martinson v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 104 F.3d 683 (4th Cir.1997), affirmed summary judgment on the ground that an epileptic employee was not qualified to perform an essential job function of his salesperson's job at a retail store, which entailed maintaining store security.  See also Kohl v. Woodhaven Learning Ctr., 865 F.2d 930 (8th Cir.1989) (finding that a Hepatitis--B carrier patient who displayed aggressive behavior would pose an unreasonable risk of transmitting the disease to other patients and staff);  cf.  Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Reasonable Accommodation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC argues that Amego was required to move Guglielmi from the Team Leader position to a Behavior Therapist position as a reasonable accommodation.  If the Behavior Therapist position required no responsibility with respect to medication, there would be more force to the EEOC's position.  See Hurley-Bardige v. Brown, 900 F.Supp. 567, 570 (D.Mass.1995)(finding that there is \"no per se rule against transfers as reasonable accommodations\").  But the position did entail that responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although medication-related duties are not specifically mentioned in the Behavior Therapist job description, the ability to handle, administer, and document medication was inherently part of the Behavior Therapist's function, as listed in Amego's job description, of \"implementing individual clinical and educational programs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All Behavior Therapists receive training in the administration of medications.  Behavior Therapists accompany clients on frequent off-site trips into the community and must dispense medications to clients at appropriate times without supervision.  When no Shift Supervisors or Team Leaders are present, the Behavior Therapists must dispense medications at the residences.  Behavior Therapists also accept deliveries of client medications in Amego's facilities.  Keys to the medicine cabinet are easily accessible to Behavior Therapists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no material factual dispute;  only the legal implications of these facts are in true dispute.  Medication-related duties of the Behavior Therapist position are essential, and not marginal, to the position.  While the amount of time a Behavior Therapist spends dispensing medication is not great, the consequences of getting it wrong are quite great indeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no accommodation that Amego could make to the Behavior Therapist position that would not cause it undue hardship.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A), 12111(9).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  To retain Guglielmi while eliminating all of Guglielmi's medication-related duties, it would have been necessary to hire another Behavior Therapist to be paired with her to ensure that she would never be left alone with a client who needed medication.  Amego might also have needed an additional supervisor to ensure that Guglielmi did not have access to client medications.  The expense of hiring these additional staff would be too great for a small nonprofit like Amego to be reasonably expected to bear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  See Vande Zande v. Wisconsin Dep't of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 542 (7th Cir.1995)(holding that employer may prove undue hardship by establishing that the costs of the proposed accommodation are excessive in relation either to its benefits or to the employer's financial health or survival).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another possible option, rearranging Guglielmi's assignment to clients so that she was never with a client who required medication, would obviously be difficult since, at the time of Guglielmi's employment, only one client at the Mansfield residence did not take medication.  Assigning Guglielmi to that one client would disrupt Amego's crucial one-staff-member-to-two-clients ratio,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> or result in the need for an additional Behavior Therapist.  Both options would alter the basic operations of Amego and go beyond the scope of a reasonable accommodation.  See Reigel v. Kaiser Found.  Health Plan, 859 F.Supp. 963, 973 (E.D.N.C.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deploying another Behavior Therapist to Guglielmi's location and shift or changing Guglielmi's clients' programming to ensure that they were on site, near other staff members, whenever they needed to take medication would have an equally disruptive effect on Amego's clients and staff as well as interfere with Amego's funding requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  See Ricks v. Xerox Corp., 877 F.Supp. 1468, 1477 (D.Kan.1995)(holding that the ADA does not require an employer to hire a full-time helper to assist a disabled employee as a reasonable accommodation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Amego cannot make a reasonable accommodation.  To do what the EEOC asks would be to alter the very nature of the Behavior Therapist position.  \"Such redefinition exceeds reasonable accommodation.\"  Bradley, 3 F.3d at 925.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>\"Because Of\" and the Conduct/Disability Distinction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC argues that it met its burden on causation because, it says, the ADA prohibits adverse employment action that is based on conduct related to a disability to the same extent that it prohibits adverse employment action based on the underlying disability itself.  It says that Amego terminated Guglielmi because of her suicide attempts and that the termination was, therefore, \"because of\" her disability.  Even if Amego terminated Guglielmi for misusing medication, rather than for attempting suicide, the EEOC says the termination decision was still \"because of\" her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the EEOC is arguing that conduct connected to a disability always must be considered to be action \"because of\" a disability, that is too broad a formulation.  While one may hypothesize certain conduct which is in fact more closely compelled by the disability (e.g. profanity from Tourette's Syndrome sufferers), this case does not provide the occasion to explore what merit there might be to a more refined formulation of the EEOC's position.  The syllogism which the EEOC presents--Guglielmi was depressed, therefore Guglielmi attempted suicide, therefore any response to the attempted suicide is \"because of\" her disability--breaks down.  Apart from the evidence that staff believed she was a threat to clients based on her at-work behavior alone, Amego has been clear, for purposes of the summary judgment motion, that it was the manner of the suicide attempts--use of medications, including prescription medications--that motivated its decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is simply no evidence that Guglielmi's depression compelled her to overdose on medications, as opposed to other methods of attempting suicide.  At best, EEOC's evidence was that individuals suffering from bulimia and depression sometimes have suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Taub v. Frank, 957 F.2d 8 (1st Cir.1992), this court held that a plaintiff could not show under the Rehabilitation Act that he was discharged by reason of his handicap, drug addiction, because his heroin addiction was \"simply too attenuated when extended to encompass an addiction-related possession of heroin for distribution.\"  Id. at 11.   Similarly, in Leary v. Dalton, another Rehabilitation Act case, this court found that where the discharge from employment was for absenteeism resulting from incarceration for driving under the influence, the plaintiff's disability of alcoholism was not the sole reason for his termination.  58 F.3d 748, 752 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case do not present the disability and conduct connection the EEOC suggests.  Accordingly, there was no error in the district court's determination that the EEOC also has not met its burden of showing the job action was \"because of\" Guglielmi's disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entry of summary judgment for Amego, Inc., is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> During the interview, Guglielmi was asked whether she had observed or suspected that Andrade was using cocaine.

It serves twenty-five to thirty clients, including six in a residential program in Mansfield, Massachusetts, where Ann Marie Guglielmi was employed as a Team Leader.  The Team Leader position required her to be responsible for the care of these disabled clients, including the responsibility of administering vital medications to them.  After an unresolved investigation of improprieties in the administering of medication to patients at a related facility, Amego learned that other staff felt Guglielmi was not performing her job adequately and was putting patients at risk.  Amego also learned that Ms. Guglielmi had twice attempted to commit suicide within the previous six weeks by overdosing on medications.  This, Amego decided, meant that Guglielmi could not safely dispense medications, an essential job function, and that there was no other job reasonably available to her.  Her employment was thus terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") sued Amego on behalf of Guglielmi under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101 et seq.   The district court entered summary judgment against the EEOC, holding that the EEOC had not made out a prima facie case that Guglielmi was an otherwise \"qualified\" individual, that an accommodation could be reasonably made, and that there was discrimination \"because of\" her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC appeals and argues that the question of whether an employee poses a significant risk to other individuals in the workplace is an affirmative defense on which the employer bears the burden of proof and is thus not part of the plaintiff's burden that the employee is qualified.  Those issues of qualification and risk, the EEOC says, are matters for the jury to resolve at trial and may not be resolved on summary judgment.  The EEOC also invites this court to hold that \"adverse employment action taken because of conduct related to a disability is tantamount to action taken because of a disability itself\" for purposes of the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Founded in 1972 by parents of autistic individuals, Amego receives public funding and is licensed by two state agencies.  A condition of licensing is that Amego provide conditions that ensure the safety and well-being of its clients.  Amego maintains a very low client-to-staff ratio, usually one staff member to two clients.  One particularly aggressive client required supervision by three staff members, eighteen hours a day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amego has a policy of not rejecting those who seek its help.  Most of its clients engage in aggressive and self-injuring behavior, including self-mutilation.  Many have been rejected by, or discharged from, other agencies.  Most clients are on prescription medications, and in June of 1992, all clients at the Mansfield residence, save one, were receiving prescription medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with its philosophy of attempted integration, Amego provides its clients with access to community activities on a regular basis.  Residential clients are transported daily to the Day Treatment Program, where they frequently are taken by direct care staff to stores, bowling alleys, banks, and the like.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1990, Amego hired Guglielmi as a Behavior Therapist.  She was then about 21 years old and did not represent herself to have any disability.  In January 1991, she was diagnosed as bulimic and clinically depressed;  however, she did not tell her employer about these conditions until after her first suicide attempt, over a year after the diagnosis.  She was prescribed Prozac in 1991, but it only partially alleviated the depression.  She stopped taking the drug in April.  In the fall of 1991, she started living with her boyfriend, David Andrade, who worked at a different Amego residence.  That relationship was fraught with problems.  Andrade used cocaine;  Guglielmi, however, says she did not confirm her suspicions of that until late June 1992.  In early 1992, she started seeing a social worker, Margaret Posever, for bimonthly therapy sessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier, in July 1991, Guglielmi was promoted to the position of Team Leader at the Mansfield residence.  The essential functions of that position included:  supervising the day-to-day implementation of individual clinical, educational, and vocational programs and data collection for all programs;  serving as a role model for staff in all areas of client programming, client services, and professional practice;  assessing staff performance, providing additional training, support, and counseling as appropriate;  ensuring that Amego's policies and procedures on clients' rights were implemented and documented;  responding appropriately in crisis situations;  and administering and documenting the use of prescribed medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1992, Guglielmi received a performance evaluation which said she was an \"exceptional\" Team Leader.  The evaluation was based on her performance through January 1992.  In the spring of 1992, Guglielmi applied for promotion to the position of Program Coordinator for the Mansfield residence.  The promotion instead went to Kristen Stone.  Stone assumed her new responsibilities on May 4, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That same day, Guglielmi deliberately took an overdose of nonprescription sleeping pills which she had purchased for that purpose.  After taking the pills, she told Andrade what she had done;  he took her to the emergency room.  She was transferred to a psychiatric hospital and released later that evening.  She told health care workers that she attempted suicide because she was upset by problems in her relationship with her boyfriend, her failure to receive the promotion, and other work-related stress.  She was readmitted to the psychiatric hospital on May 6, 1992, and stayed there until May 12 because of concerns about her safety.  On the day of her readmission to the hospital--two days after her suicide attempt--Guglielmi was not able to \"contract for safety\" with her therapist Posever.  Guglielmi told Posever that even if she were to so contract, her mood was in such flux that she could not be sure she would not hurt herself anyway.  A week after returning to work, and again two weeks later, she told Posever that she felt suicidal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Guglielmi returned to work on May 13, she told her supervisor only that she had been hospitalized for bulimia and depression.  She did not say that she had attempted suicide.  She asked her supervisor to modify her work schedule so that she could attend therapy twice or thrice weekly.  Her supervisor agreed to this accommodation.  However, Guglielmi stopped going to the therapy sessions after a few weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 21, 1992, Guglielmi began seeing Dr. Kenneth Levin for psychopharmacological treatment.  He diagnosed her as suffering from bulimia and major depression, prescribed Prozac and trazodone, and saw her to monitor her use of medication.  Prozac was one of the medications regularly administered to Amego's clients.  On June 4, 1992, she told Dr. Levin that she had experienced periodic feelings of increased depression, including a period when she contemplated overdosing.  She assured Dr. Levin that if such thoughts recurred, she would not act on them but would inform her boyfriend or a health care provider.  She did not keep her word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, Guglielmi deliberately overdosed again, this time using her prescription medications, Prozac and trazadone, as well as aspirin.  After taking the overdose, she called the Plainville police, who took her to the hospital.  She was released on June 15, 1992.  She told her health care providers that she was not really depressed when she overdosed but wanted to provoke a reaction from her boyfriend.  When Guglielmi returned to work on June 17, she again did not tell her employer that she had attempted suicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day Guglielmi returned to work, the Executive Director of Amego, Caryn Driscoll, and the Director of Administrative Services, Karen Seal, met with David Andrade about his job performance problems.  During this meeting, Andrade mentioned rumors that clients were being drugged at the Fales Road residence.  He worked at that location regularly, and Guglielmi worked there occasionally.  Around that time, Driscoll learned that Klonopin, one of the medications prescribed for clients, was either missing or was being used at an accelerated rate at the Fales Road residence.  Some cocaine users take Klonopin as an antidote, to calm them down from the effects of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amego investigated and found that four of the clients at the Fales Road residence (two of whom should not have had Klonopin at all) had blood levels of Klonopin which were too high.  Amego asked any employees who had pertinent information to step forward.  Guglielmi did so and was interviewed on June 26 by Driscoll, Amego's Human Rights Officer, and a private investigator.  During the interview, Guglielmi focused on her relationship with Andrade, who she feared might be targeted in the investigation.  She said that she was suffering from bulimia and depression and revealed for the first time her two recent suicide attempts.  In an attempt to explain Andrade's performance issues, she said that he had helped her when she attempted suicide two times by overdosing on both prescription and over-the-counter drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier, on June 5, a shift supervisor at the Mansfield residence, Chester Millet, had noticed that the medication log was missing.  He conducted a thorough search, including behind the medication cabinet, and did not find it.  Guglielmi also helped look for it.  On the same day of her interview with Driscoll, June 26, Guglielmi reported that she had found the missing medication log.  She said the log had been behind the medication cabinet, between the cabinet and the wall.  Millet told Driscoll that he had previously looked there and had not seen it.  Although Driscoll did not initially consider Guglielmi under suspicion for the improper drugging of patients at Fales Road, she and other staff members found the discovery of the book by Guglielmi to be peculiar.  A review of the medication log showed that the supply of drugs on hand at the Mansfield residence was excessive.  It was not possible to determine from the log whether medications were missing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, Driscoll spoke with the Plainville police about her concerns about the drugging of patients at Fales Road.  The police told Driscoll that they found pills, initially thought to be Klonopin, in Guglielmi's apartment on the night they responded to her suicide call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around June 28, Driscoll received a call from Carlos Andrade, an Amego employee and David Andrade's brother.  He told her that staff members felt Guglielmi's job performance was suffering and had asked him to do something about it.  He reported that staff members were uncomfortable with her job performance, that she was erratic in behavior, had mood swings, seemed to be focussed on her personal problems, that she was seen walking outside and crying, that she was heard fighting on the phone with David Andrade, and that she was self-absorbed and unable to concentrate on her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carlos Andrade also passed on that Millet, the shift supervisor and one of the most senior staff members at the Mansfield residence, was concerned that Guglielmi had suddenly handed him the drug log, saying that she had found it in the residence when he had searched everywhere for it.  Driscoll confirmed Carlos Andrade's report with Millet, who had never before complained about another employee.  Carlos Andrade felt that Guglielmi was not performing her job safely and was putting clients at risk.  Driscoll knew there was no way to prevent Guglielmi from having access to medication while she worked at Amego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, on July 1, Driscoll informed Guglielmi in writing that she was temporarily removed from her position as Team Leader and would be reassigned to perform clerical and other light duties.  The letter stated that the fact that Guglielmi's recent hospitalizations were the result of deliberate overdoses of prescription medications raised \"concerns about [her] ability to perform [her] present job functions including medication ordering, dispensing and shift supervision.\"   The letter also indicated that Amego's Safety Committee would meet to determine whether Guglielmi could perform her job, or another available job, with or without accommodations.  Driscoll said that the Committee should seek medical information from Guglielmi's treating physician.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to obtain a professional opinion on Guglielmi's ability to resume her duties, Driscoll sent a letter to Posever on July 1 asking whether Guglielmi could perform eleven duties that a Team Leader would need to perform, set forth on a checklist.  The letter came back to Amego on July 8 with a check in the \"yes\" column for each job duty.  Only Guglielmi had signed the bottom of the checklist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Driscoll called Posever to ask if the checklist accurately reflected Posever's opinion that Guglielmi could complete the duties or whether the list merely reflected Guglielmi's own opinion.  Posever told Driscoll she was not a medical doctor, that the checklist did not represent a medical competency evaluation as to each specific job duty, nor was it a guarantee regarding each duty.  It was rather that, based on her discussions with Guglielmi and her knowledge of her work and treatment history, Posever had no reason to think Guglielmi could not perform those duties.  Posever's checking \"yes\" was based on her observations of Guglielmi's demeanor and on Guglielmi's statement that she felt comfortable giving out psychotropic medications at work, even in light of her suicide attempts.  Driscoll appeared dissatisfied with the response and pressed for a more definitive opinion, which Posever declined to give.  Later, Driscoll told Guglielmi that Posever's response was inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 22, Driscoll sent Dr. Levin a letter requesting his opinion as to whether Guglielmi could perform the eleven functions of her job and enclosing the checklist.  In a letter dated July 27, 1992, Dr. Levin wrote that Guglielmi was no longer on prescription medication.  He concluded:  \"My understanding is that she has consistently performed her regular job responsibilities conscientiously and I see no difficulty with her returning to her regular position.\"   There was no checklist with the letter Amego received.  Driscoll viewed Dr. Levin's conclusions as largely being based on what Guglielmi said she could do and her representation that she had no performance problems.  But Driscoll knew from staff complaints that Guglielmi had a range of performance problems.  And Driscoll knew Dr. Levin had not checked with anyone at Amego about whether Guglielmi was in fact performing well.  Driscoll told Guglielmi that Dr. Levin's letter did not adequately deal with the job functions issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Driscoll was also concerned that the parents of Amego's charges would feel that their children would be put at risk by being in the care of someone who abused prescription drugs.  The parents, she felt, would contact one of the state agencies which licensed Amego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 21, the Safety Committee met.  The Committee was comprised of four administrators:  Seal, the Director of Administrative Services;  Amego's Health Coordinator, who was a nurse;  the Staff Development Coordinator;  and the Administrative Assistant/Workers' Compensation Coordinator.  The Committee found that Guglielmi was not in fact performing her job duties conscientiously or performing them well.  The Committee concluded that Guglielmi could not safely perform the Team Leader position and that there was no Amego position that could be modified to accommodate her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 1992, Amego's Board of Directors was informed of the recommendation of the Safety Committee and, after additional discussion, concluded that there was no alternative position that could accommodate Guglielmi.  The following day Driscoll informed Guglielmi that her employment was terminated.  Amego says its core concern was that Guglielmi could not meet the essential job function of handling prescription medication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered summary judgment for Amego, finding that the EEOC had failed to meet its burden under the ADA of showing that Guglielmi was qualified for the position of Team Leader and that Amego could have made a reasonable accommodation.  The district court also found that the EEOC had failed to meet its burden of showing that Amego had discriminated against Guglielmi \"because of\" a disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of appellate review of entry of summary judgment in ADA cases, as in all others, is de novo.  Soileau v. Guilford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197175\"><a href=\"/opinion/197175/soileau-v-guilford-of-me/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1997).  The EEOC bore the burden of showing that Guglielmi was qualified to perform, either with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of her job.  See Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726664\"><a href=\"/opinion/726664/richard-jacques-v-clean-up-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 511 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For summary judgment purposes, the parties do not dispute that Guglielmi was a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA.  It is also undisputed that an essential function of the Team Leader position is to administer and monitor the medication of Amego's clients.  The written job description provides that this is an essential job function, and the EEOC concedes that Team Leaders have access to locked medicine cabinets containing large quantities of drugs and are expected to administer medications to clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case initially turns on whether the EEOC has met its burden of showing that Guglielmi was a \"qualified\" person.  Amego's position is that it terminated Guglielmi's employment because she showed by her conduct--by behavior leading co-workers to have concerns about whether she was a risk to clients and by her two attempts to commit suicide using prescription and non-prescription drugs--that she could not reasonably be trusted to meet her responsibilities as to medications.  Although the qualification analysis could be understood to subsume the concept of reasonable accommodation, we think it analytically sounder to treat the two topics separately.  Cf.

Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110104\"><a href=\"/opinion/110104/southeastern-community-college-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 406, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110104\"><a href=\"/opinion/110104/southeastern-community-college-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At its core, Title I of the ADA is about protecting the disabled from discriminatory employment action based on stereotypes and fear.  See H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 45 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 468;  see also Jacques, 96 F.3d at 511.   The prima facie case establishes that because an individual with a disability is qualified, yet has suffered adverse employment action because of that disability, the employer may have engaged in the type of discrimination the ADA is designed to prevent.  Here, the plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case:  there is no evidence suggesting the presence of any disability-based discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule of the ADA is that an employer shall not \"discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability....\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).  It is generally accepted that, in a Title I case, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing she is a \"qualified\" individual.  See Jacques, 96 F.3d at 511.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A qualified individual is one who can perform the essential functions of the job held.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(m).  The statute also says that \"the term 'qualification standards' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12113(b).  It defines \"direct threat\" as meaning \"a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(3).  The rub is that the language about \"qualification standards\" under Title I appears in a section of the statute entitled \"Defenses.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12113(a) (\"It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under [the ADA] that an alleged application of qualification standards ... has been shown to be job-related.\")   The EEOC argues that the employer bears the burden of proof on this affirmative defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC argues further that whenever an issue of threats to the safety or health of others is involved in a Title I case, it must be analyzed under the \"direct threat\" provision of &#167; 12113(b) as an affirmative defense.  Specifically, the EEOC contends that the &#167; 12113(b) provision that qualification standards may include a requirement that an individual not be a direct threat is to be read in the context of the defense set out in &#167; 12113(a).  The EEOC supports its position by noting that &#167; 12113 is captioned \"Defenses.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, the EEOC says, the district court erred in considering the matter of whether Guglielmi posed a threat to the safety of Amego's clients as a matter of \"qualification,\" on which plaintiff bears the burden.  Amego contends that the risks posed to others may be considered as part of the qualified individual analysis, and that the specific discussion of a direct threat defense in &#167;   12113 does not preclude the consideration of safety risks in other prongs of the ADA analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the statutory scheme does not clearly resolve this debate, we look to the legislative history to determine whether risks posed to others may only be considered in the direct threat defense context.  See United States v. Charter Int'l Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718190\"><a href=\"/opinion/718190/united-states-v-charter-international-oil-company-acushnet-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 517 (1st Cir.1996).  Upon such review, we discern no congressional intent to preclude the consideration of essential job functions that implicate the safety of others as part of the \"qualifications\" analysis, particularly where the essential functions of a job involve the care of others unable to care for themselves.  The House Report<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> said that, in the definition of \"direct threat,\" \"[t]he Committee intends to codify the direct threat standard used by the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 34 (1990), 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 457.   The House Report goes on to say that, \"[i]f the applicant is otherwise qualified for the job, he or she cannot be disqualified on the basis of a physical or mental condition unless the employer can demonstrate that the applicant's disability poses a direct threat to others in the workplace....  The plaintiff is not required to prove that he or she poses no risk.\"  Id. at 46, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 469.   The intent to codify Arline suggests that the burden is on plaintiff to show that he or she is qualified in the sense of not posing a direct threat.  Arline considered that issue to be part of the \"qualification\" analysis under &#167; 504 as to which plaintiff bears the burden.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See Arline, 480 U.S. at 287-88, 107 S.Ct. at 1130-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA also contains a directive that it be enforced in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12117(b).  Courts therefore use caselaw under &#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, for guidance in interpreting the ADA.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794(d)(\"The standards used to determine whether this section [&#167; 504 of the Rehabilitation Act] has been violated in a complaint alleging employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under Title I of the [ADA].\");  Katz v.

Under &#167; 504, it is clear that the question of whether the employment of the plaintiff poses risks to the health of others is analyzed as a matter of whether the person is \"otherwise qualified.\"  Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130;  see also Abbott v. Bragdon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736905\"><a href=\"/opinion/736905/sidney-abbott-v-randon-bragdon-dmd/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span>, 943 (1st Cir.1997) (\"A court's goal in conducting a direct threat analysis under the ADA is to achieve a reasonable balance, protecting service providers ... from enforced exposure to unacceptable health and safety risks\" while protecting the disabled from discrimination.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Arline, the Court held that the issue of the threat to others posed by an employee with a communicable disease was properly analyzed as a question of whether the employee was \"otherwise qualified.\"  Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, 107 S.Ct. at 1130.   The Court noted that a \"person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk.\"  Id. at 287 n. 16, 107 S.Ct. at 1131 n. 16.  Arguably, in Arline, the question of whether the plaintiff could perform the core functions of a school teacher's job was separate from the question of whether she nonetheless posed a risk because of her communicable disease.  Here, the questions are not separate:  the issue of risk posed to others arises in the context of a core function of the job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC correctly points out that, unlike the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA's definition of \"qualified individual\" does not address risk posed to others.  While it is true that the implementing regulations under the Rehabilitation Act define \"qualified individual with handicaps\" specifically to include \"without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1614.203(6), Congress intended the ADA's definition of \"qualified individual with a disability\" to be \"comparable to the definition used in regulations implementing section 501 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\"   H.R. Rep. 101-485, pt. 2, at 55, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 337.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC stakes out a position which is far too broad.  This is not a case where a person who can perform all essential job functions nonetheless poses a risk to others.  The district court did not, we believe, commit error in considering risk posed to others under the category of \"qualification,\" where the risk is expressly associated with performance of an essential job function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise issue here concerns the employer's judgment that Guglielmi could not be trusted to handle the medication-related functions of her job.  In this case, a failure to perform an essential function--overseeing and administering medication--would necessarily create a risk to others.  That a failure to perform a job function correctly creates a risk to others does not preclude the ability to perform that function from being a job qualification.  The position argued by the EEOC would lead to the anomalous result that there is a lesser burden of proving qualifications on a plaintiff where the job involves the care of others, and necessarily entails risk to others, than when the job does not.  We do not believe Congress intended to weaken the burden on plaintiffs to show they are qualified in such circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In such cases, where the employee is responsible for ensuring the safety of others entrusted to his or her care, other courts, without discussion of the point the EEOC raises, have simply considered the risk question to be part of the \"qualified\" analysis.

There may be other cases under Title I where the issue of direct threat is not tied to the issue of essential job functions but is purely a matter of defense, on which the defendant would bear the burden.  This case does not raise or resolve issues of the role of \"direct threat\" provisions under other parts of the ADA, such as the public accommodation title.  Cf. Abbott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736905\"><a href=\"/opinion/736905/sidney-abbott-v-randon-bragdon-dmd/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span>.

Guglielmi did not meet her burden of demonstrating that she is qualified.  There is in this record no suggestion that the employer has applied its standards differentially.  The EEOC presents no evidence that the employer has ever found a similarly situated employee to be qualified to handle the essential medication function.  Instead, the EEOC attempts to derive from its disagreement with Amego over whether Guglielmi is qualified an inference that the employer's different assessment is based on disability discrimination.  However, where, as here, no evidence of animus is present, courts may give reasonable deference to the employer's assessment of what the position demands.  See Doe v. New York Univ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398023\"><a href=\"/opinion/398023/jane-doe-v-new-york-university-john-sawhill-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 776 (2d Cir.1981)(finding that, in case involving mentally ill applicant to medical school, \"considerable judicial deference must be paid to the evaluation made by the institution itself, absent proof that its standards and its application of them serve no purpose other than to deny an education to handicapped persons\");  cf.  Southeastern Community College, 442 U.S. at 406, 99 S.Ct. at 2367 (supporting reasonable deference to the decisions made by administrators of federally funded programs so long as no evidence is presented of discriminatory intent with regard to the handicapped person).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement of showing \"qualifications\" has substance, notwithstanding the frequent leapfrogging of that analysis to get to the pretext issue under McDonnell Douglas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In the context of academic tenure cases, this court has been attentive to the need to balance the right of a plaintiff to be free from discrimination against the undesirable result of having the court sit as a \"super-tenure committee.\"   See Villanueva v.

Thus, plaintiffs who have been denied tenure must show that their qualifications are at least comparable to those of a \"middle group of tenure candidates as to whom both a decision granting tenure and a decision denying tenure could be justified as a reasonable exercise of discretion by the tenure-decision making body.\"  Banerjee v.

Aware of the fine balance of competing considerations that preserve academic freedom, this court has noted that \"[i]n tenure cases, courts must take special care to preserve the University's autonomy in making lawful tenure decisions.\"  Brown v.

Where the plaintiff has presented no evidence of discriminatory intent, animus, or even pretext, we think there should be special sensitivity to the danger of the court becoming a super-employment committee.  Unlike the academic institutions in the above-cited cases, Amego is a small employer.  Its history of employment decisions is neither lengthy nor detailed, making it difficult to assume, without help from plaintiff, that the qualification standards it asserts for Guglielmi are different from those required of other employees.  Plaintiff has failed to provide such help.  It is in this context that we review the facts.  We are also mindful of the Arline factors for assessing whether an employee poses a significant risk to others.  Cf. Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was eminently reasonable for Amego to be concerned about whether Guglielmi could meet her responsibilities, and also reasonable for it to conclude that the risk was too great to run.  The employer's judgment here about the risks of future behavior by an employee is based on past behavior and reasonable indicia of future behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the nature of the risk was such that it was extremely difficult to guard against.  The clients were particularly vulnerable to abuse or neglect.  The mechanisms to insure that they were properly treated with regard to their medications, other than having trustworthy staff, were not obvious.  Amego had just learned that, despite its normal procedures, four patients at the Fales Road residence were overly medicated and that it could not determine whether any medications were missing.  Testing the clients' blood to determine whether they had received the correct dosage level, or indeed the correct drugs, has to be considered an extraordinary step, and not a safeguard which could routinely be taken.  Additionally, the severity of the risk, i.e., the potential harm to third parties, Arline, 480 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. at 1131, is great.  The potential outcomes of administering the wrong medication to a client are obvious and extreme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there were performance issues which enhanced the likelihood that the clients could be harmed unless steps were taken.  Amego received complaints, from other staff members, that Guglielmi was unable to focus on her job and was a risk to patients.  The situation was serious enough that staff members sent an emissary to management, asking that something be done.  The peculiarity of Guglielmi finding the missing medication log at a place which had been searched earlier would reasonably give Amego pause.  Amego had reason to fear that Guglielmi would take medications from Amego.  When the police came to her apartment on the night of her second suicide attempt, they found pills they believed to be Klonopin.  Klonopin is taken by cocaine users, and management suspected the man with whom Guglielmi lived of being a cocaine user and of drugging Amego clients.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, other measures had not eliminated the risk of Guglielmi mishandling medication.  Amego knew that, despite counselling and medication, Guglielmi had attempted suicide a second time using medication and that she would have access to Prozac at work, one of the drugs used in this second attempt.  The EEOC says that Amego should have had greater confidence in Guglielmi because she no longer had a prescription for drugs after the second attempt.  There is cold comfort in that:  this fact increased the likelihood that Guglielmi would use the drugs available to her at work for a third attempt.  Amego also knew that despite its provision of a work schedule accommodation, Guglielmi soon stopped going to the therapy sessions she said she wanted to attend after her first suicide attempt.  Amego knew that by concealing her suicide attempts Guglielmi had misled them about the nature of her previous absences from work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, when Amego sought reassurance from Guglielmi's health care providers, the responses were not confidence-building.  Posever, the social worker, neither responded to the substance of the request for information nor signed her name to the checklist.  After receiving the checklist, Driscoll telephoned Posever.  Posever explicitly declined to give a psychiatric medical opinion.  Dr. Levin, the psychopharmacologist, gave a brief response which Amego could reasonably understand to be unresponsive to its concerns and to be based on Guglielmi's own assessment of her ability to do the work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also credit the deliberative process through which Amego made its decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  It sought additional input, including that from Guglielmi's medical advisors, and considered other information before reaching its decision.  This deliberative process undercuts any argument that the employer based its decision as to qualifications on stereotypes about disability.  There can be no serious claim that Amego, which had considerable experience dealing with mentally handicapped persons and integrating them into the community, acted on the basis of the stereotypes and fears which Congress wished to counteract in the ADA.  Also, Amego had earlier made accommodations.  It modified Guglielmi's schedule so that she could receive treatment and was supportive of her efforts to deal with her condition.  See Soileau, 105 F.3d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amego also operated in a context which added weight to the risks it thought Guglielmi posed.  Amego is licensed by two state agencies and is required to take steps to assure the safety of its patients.  If a single client had been harmed from misuse of medication, then Amego stood the risk of losing its licenses and its ability to care for any of its clients.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, where no evidence of differential treatment, discrimination, or stereotyping is proffered, the employer's judgment is entitled to some weight.  The EEOC's \"Interpretive Guidance\" to its ADA regulations notes that the inquiry into essential functions is not intended to second-guess an employer's business judgment regarding production standards, whether qualitative or quantitative.  EEOC, Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, app. to 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In somewhat similar factual settings, other courts have affirmed summary judgment on the issue of qualification.  In Doe v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp., 50 F.3d at 1261, the defendant medical center terminated the employment of an HIV-positive doctor.  The court affirmed summary judgment on the grounds that the doctor was not an \"otherwise qualified\" individual because he posed a significant risk to patients that could not be eliminated through reasonable accommodation.  Id. at 1266.   The court rejected the doctor's argument that the risk of transmission was so infinitesimal that it could not be considered significant.  Id. The employer had relied on recommendations from the Center for Disease Control in analyzing whether the doctor's job functions fit the definition of exposure-prone procedures.  Id. at 1264.   The court expressed its reluctance to substitute its judgment for that of the medical center.  Id. at 1266.   In Bradley v. University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5987\"><a href=\"/opinion/5987/bradley-v-university-of-texas-md-anderson-cancer-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1993), the Fifth Circuit affirmed entry of summary judgment for the employer on a Rehabilitation Act claim with similar facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the Fourth Circuit in Martinson v.

If the Behavior Therapist position required no responsibility with respect to medication, there would be more force to the EEOC's position.  See Hurley-Bardige v. Brown, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></span>, 570 (D.Mass.1995)(finding that there is \"no per se rule against transfers as reasonable accommodations\").  But the position did entail that responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although medication-related duties are not specifically mentioned in the Behavior Therapist job description, the ability to handle, administer, and document medication was inherently part of the Behavior Therapist's function, as listed in Amego's job description, of \"implementing individual clinical and educational programs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All Behavior Therapists receive training in the administration of medications.  Behavior Therapists accompany clients on frequent off-site trips into the community and must dispense medications to clients at appropriate times without supervision.  When no Shift Supervisors or Team Leaders are present, the Behavior Therapists must dispense medications at the residences.  Behavior Therapists also accept deliveries of client medications in Amego's facilities.  Keys to the medicine cabinet are easily accessible to Behavior Therapists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no material factual dispute;  only the legal implications of these facts are in true dispute.  Medication-related duties of the Behavior Therapist position are essential, and not marginal, to the position.  While the amount of time a Behavior Therapist spends dispensing medication is not great, the consequences of getting it wrong are quite great indeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no accommodation that Amego could make to the Behavior Therapist position that would not cause it undue hardship.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A), 12111(9).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  To retain Guglielmi while eliminating all of Guglielmi's medication-related duties, it would have been necessary to hire another Behavior Therapist to be paired with her to ensure that she would never be left alone with a client who needed medication.  Amego might also have needed an additional supervisor to ensure that Guglielmi did not have access to client medications.  The expense of hiring these additional staff would be too great for a small nonprofit like Amego to be reasonably expected to bear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  See Vande Zande v. Wisconsin Dep't of Admin., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686498\"><a href=\"/opinion/686498/lori-l-vande-zande-v-state-of-wisconsin-department-of-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 542 (7th Cir.1995)(holding that employer may prove undue hardship by establishing that the costs of the proposed accommodation are excessive in relation either to its benefits or to the employer's financial health or survival).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another possible option, rearranging Guglielmi's assignment to clients so that she was never with a client who required medication, would obviously be difficult since, at the time of Guglielmi's employment, only one client at the Mansfield residence did not take medication.  Assigning Guglielmi to that one client would disrupt Amego's crucial one-staff-member-to-two-clients ratio,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> or result in the need for an additional Behavior Therapist.  Both options would alter the basic operations of Amego and go beyond the scope of a reasonable accommodation.  See Reigel v. Kaiser Found.

To do what the EEOC asks would be to alter the very nature of the Behavior Therapist position.  \"Such redefinition exceeds reasonable accommodation.\"  Bradley, 3 F.3d at 925.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>\"Because Of\" and the Conduct/Disability Distinction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC argues that it met its burden on causation because, it says, the ADA prohibits adverse employment action that is based on conduct related to a disability to the same extent that it prohibits adverse employment action based on the underlying disability itself.  It says that Amego terminated Guglielmi because of her suicide attempts and that the termination was, therefore, \"because of\" her disability.  Even if Amego terminated Guglielmi for misusing medication, rather than for attempting suicide, the EEOC says the termination decision was still \"because of\" her disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the EEOC is arguing that conduct connected to a disability always must be considered to be action \"because of\" a disability, that is too broad a formulation.  While one may hypothesize certain conduct which is in fact more closely compelled by the disability (e.g. profanity from Tourette's Syndrome sufferers), this case does not provide the occasion to explore what merit there might be to a more refined formulation of the EEOC's position.  The syllogism which the EEOC presents--Guglielmi was depressed, therefore Guglielmi attempted suicide, therefore any response to the attempted suicide is \"because of\" her disability--breaks down.  Apart from the evidence that staff believed she was a threat to clients based on her at-work behavior alone, Amego has been clear, for purposes of the summary judgment motion, that it was the manner of the suicide attempts--use of medications, including prescription medications--that motivated its decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is simply no evidence that Guglielmi's depression compelled her to overdose on medications, as opposed to other methods of attempting suicide.

Because it is unnecessary to the decision, we do not address the issue of whether this after-acquired evidence could, in the context of the ADA, be used for purposes other than as a rationale for terminating her employment, e.g., to buttress the employer's judgment that Guglielmi's untrustworthiness affected her ability to perform an essential job function.
