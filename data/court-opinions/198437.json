OF EDUCATION, ET AL.,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees,\r\n                                         \r\n\n                      ANGEL RUIZ RIVERA,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n        [Hon. Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Angel Ruiz Rivera on brief pro se.\r\n   Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney General, Guillermo Gil,\r\nUnited States Attorney, and Barbara C. Biddle, Attorney, Appellate\r\nStaff, on brief for appellees.\r\n\nAPRIL 21, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.    Upon careful review of the record and\r\nthe briefs, it clearly appears that this appeal presents no\r\nsubstantial issue.  Given that the district court fees already\r\nhad been paid and that appellant's motion for in forma pauperis\r\nstatus did not refer to any appeal, nor was there any\r\nappealable order at that time, the motion was frivolous.  This\r\nappeal is likewise frivolous.  \r\n          The order is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed. \r\nSee 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                           -2-\n",
