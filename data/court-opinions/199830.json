Defendant-appellant Paul R.\n\nWhooten pled guilty to two counts of unarmed bank robbery and three\n\ncounts of interference with commerce by bank robbery.                              He was\n\nsentenced to 140 months' imprisonment, based on an offense level\n\nthat the district court adjusted upward after finding that an\n\nabduction     had     occurred    during      the      commission      of   the    crime.\n\nDefendant appeals his sentence, claiming that it violates Apprendi\n\nv.    New   Jersey,      530   U.S.   466    (2000),      and   that    the   abduction\n\nenhancement was inapplicable to the facts of his case.                        Because we\n\nfind no error in the district court's sentence, we affirm.\n\n                                            I.\n\n             On August 1, 1999, Paul Whooten and James Travis robbed\na Bread & Circus store in Wayland, Massachusetts.                       After forcing\n\nthe store clerks to turn over more than $10,000 in cash, Whooten\nplaced the money into a paper bag.                Then, putting a hand on the gun\nlocated in his waistband,1 he said to one of the store clerks,\n\nMarie Mee, \"We're gonna go outside now and you're coming with me.\"\nWhooten threatened to kill her if she did not cooperate.\n             Whooten and Travis exited the store, with Whooten walking\nbehind Mee.      Whooten directed Travis to run and start the car.\n\nMeanwhile, Whooten continued to walk behind Mee until they were\n\napproximately       65    feet   east   of       the   store    entrance.         He   then\n\ninstructed Mee to turn around and walk back to the store.                         Whooten\n\n\n\n\n1\n     The gun was later determined to be a toy gun.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fran to the car, which was parked about 153 feet east of the store\n\nentrance, and drove off with Travis.\n\n          On August 2, 2000, appellant pled guilty to a five-count\ninformation, charging two counts of unarmed bank robbery, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a), and three counts of interference\n\nwith commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).2\nUnder the rules for sentencing on multiple counts, as set forth in\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3D1.4, the district court calculated the total offense\n\nlevel by determining the count carrying the highest adjusted\n\noffense level, then adding points for the other counts.\n\n          In this case, the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") determined\n\nthat Count Three, which charged \"interference with commerce by\n\nrobbery\" at the Wayland Bread & Circus store, had the highest\nadjusted offense level of 28.   The robbery carried a base offense\n\nlevel of 20, which was increased by three levels for the display of\n\na dangerous weapon during the commission of the crime and by one\nlevel because Whooten stole between $10,000 and $50,000.       See\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), 2B3.1(b)(7).     In addition, the PSR\n\nincreased the offense level by four steps, pursuant to § 2B3.1(b)\n\n(4)(A), because Whooten abducted an individual to \"facilitate\n\ncommission of the offense or to facilitate escape.\"        To this\n\nadjusted offense level of 28, the PSR added four levels for the\n\nother counts, pursuant to § 3D1.4, and then subtracted three levels\n\nfor early acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total\n\n\n2\n   Four of the counts relate to separate robbery incidents, the\ndetails of which are unnecessary to this appeal.\n\n                                -3-\n\foffense level of 29.       With Whooten's criminal history category of\n\nV, this offense level produced a sentence range of 140 to 175\n\nmonths' imprisonment.\n             Defendant     objected     to      the     four-level         abduction\n\nenhancement, claiming that it violated Apprendi v. New Jersey and\n\nthat it was not supported by the facts.                    The district court\noverruled Whooten's objections and sentenced him to 140 months'\n\nimprisonment.     On appeal, defendant renews the objections that he\n\nraised below.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             Whooten claims that Apprendi v. New Jersey bars the four-\n\nlevel   abduction    enhancement      because    the     facts    supporting       the\nenhancement were neither alleged in the information nor proved\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.        Apprendi, however, is inapplicable to\n\nthis case.\n           In Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that \"[o]ther than\n\nthe fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty\n\nfor a   crime    beyond    the   prescribed     statutory        maximum    must   be\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"                        530\nU.S. at 490.        Thus, Apprendi only applies when a defendant's\n\nsentence exceeds the statutory maximum.               See id.; United States v.\nCaba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001).           Apprendi does not prevent\na sentencing judge from making factual findings that increase a\n\ndefendant's sentence, as long as such an increase falls within the\nstatutory maximum.        See Caba, 241 F.3d at 101.\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            In this case, the statutory maximum for each count to\n\nwhich defendant pled guilty was twenty years' imprisonment. See 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1951(a) (authorizing a term of not more than twenty\nyears), 2113(a) (same).           Therefore, defendant's sentence of 140\n\nmonths does not exceed the statutory maximum, and Apprendi is\n\ninapplicable.          The district court acted within its discretion in\ndetermining that an abduction occurred for purposes of enhancing\n\ndefendant's sentence.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            Defendant argues that even if the abduction enhancement\nis permissible under Apprendi, the facts found by the district\n\ncourt in this case are insufficient to trigger application of the\nsentencing guidelines' abduction enhancement.             Although we review\nthe district court's factual findings for clear error, we review de\n\nnovo a district court's interpretation of a sentencing guideline.\nSee United States v. LaFortune, 192 F.3d 157, 160 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            The    sentencing      guidelines   provide      for    a    four-level\n\nincrease in the offense level \"[i]f any person was abducted to\nfacilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate escape.\"\nU.S.S.G.    §    2B3.1(b)(4)(A).       The   background      note       to   §   2B3.1\n\nindicates       that    \"[t]he   guideline   provides   an    enhancement         for\nrobberies where a victim was forced to accompany the defendant to\nanother location. . . .\"           U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1, comment. (backg'd.).\n\nSection 2B3.1 also references definitions of general application in\n§ 1B1.1.        See U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1, comment. (n.1).               Section 1B1.1\n\nstates: \"'Abducted' means that a victim was forced to accompany an\n\n                                       -5-\n\foffender to a different location.        For example, a bank robber's\n\nforcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would\n\nconstitute an abduction.\"     U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, comment. (n.1(a)).\n             Defendant argues that, as a matter of law, forcing Mee to\n\nwalk 65 feet from the store's entrance does not amount to forcing\n\nthe victim \"to a different location,\" and is dissimilar from the\ncommentary's example of forcing a bank teller into a getaway car.\n\nBecause Whooten released Mee when he was still 90 feet from the\n\ngetaway car, he claims that her presence did not facilitate the\n\ncommission of the offense or the defendant's escape.         As a result,\n\nWhooten contends that his acts do not qualify as an abduction under\n\nthe guidelines.     We disagree.\n\n             The facts, which defendant does not dispute, indicate\nthat Whooten forced Mee, at gunpoint and while threatening to kill\n\nher, outside of the store and 65 feet into the parking lot.             We\n\nhave no difficulty finding that this was a forced movement \"to a\ndifferent location.\"      See United States v. Hickman, 151 F.3d 446,\n\n462 (5th Cir. 1998) (noting that \"[t]he term 'a different location'\n\nmust be interpreted on a case by case basis, considering the\n\nparticular facts under scrutiny, not mechanically, based on the\n\npresence or absence of doorways, lot lines, thresholds, and the\n\nlike\"), reh'g granted and opinion vacated, 165 F.3d 1020 (1999),\n\naff'd by an equally divided court, 179 F.3d 230 (1999) (per\n\ncuriam); United States v. Taylor, 128 F.3d 1105 (7th Cir. 1997)\n\n(affirming    abduction   enhancement    where   defendant   forced   bank\n\nemployee at gunpoint to go from parking lot into bank); United\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fStates v. Davis, 48 F.3d 277 (7th Cir. 1995) (same); United States\n\nv. Hawkins, 87 F.3d 722 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (affirming\n\nabduction enhancement where defendants forced victims to move about\n40 to 60 feet in a parking area towards a van, because \"a different\n\nlocation\" is a \"flexible\" term); United States v. Nale, 101 F.3d\n\n1000 (4th Cir. 1996) (affirming enhancement on grounds that \"even\na temporary abduction can constitute an abduction\" under sentencing\n\nguidelines); United States v. Elkins, 16 F.3d 952 (8th Cir. 1994)\n\n(affirming    abduction   enhancement     where   defendant    forced   bank\n\npatron, at knife-point, out of bank and into parking lot).\n\n             Moreover, such abduction, even if terminated before\n\ndefendant reached the getaway car, nonetheless facilitated his\n\nescape within the meaning of § 2B3.1(b)(4)(A).            By forcing Mee to\nwalk in front of him as he exited the store, Whooten shielded\n\nhimself   from   detection,   as   well   as   provided    himself   with   a\n\npotential hostage until Travis had sufficient time to start the\ncar.     See Nale, 101 F.3d at 1003 (finding temporary abduction\n\nfacilitated offense because it delayed police notification and\n\nallowed defendant to make a speedier escape).\n\n            This Court has observed that the abduction enhancement is\n\nintended, at least in part, to protect victims against additional\n\nharm that may result from the victim's isolation, and thus applies\n\nwhether the abduction is carried out by threat or by physical\n\nforce.    See United States v. Cunningham, 201 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). Regardless of whether Mee was forced at gunpoint to walk 65\n\nfeet towards the getaway car, or the entire 153 feet to reach the\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fcar, Mee faced \"the same dangerous consequences\" of isolation. Id.\n\nat 28 (noting that isolation increases likelihood that victim will\n\nbe harmed).    Because Whooten unquestionably placed Mee at risk of\nharm, which the abduction enhancement is designed to deter, we are\n\neven more convinced that application of the abduction enhancement\n\nis appropriate in this case.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n            Because we find that the facts support application of the\n\nabduction   enhancement   and   that   defendant's   sentence   does   not\n\nviolate Apprendi, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

After forcing\n\nthe store clerks to turn over more than $10,000 in cash, Whooten\nplaced the money into a paper bag.

The robbery carried a base offense\n\nlevel of 20, which was increased by three levels for the display of\n\na dangerous weapon during the commission of the crime and by one\nlevel because Whooten stole between $10,000 and $50,000.       See\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), 2B3.1(b)(7).

With Whooten's criminal history category of\n\nV, this offense level produced a sentence range of 140 to 175\n\nmonths' imprisonment.\n             Defendant     objected     to      the     four-level         abduction\n\nenhancement, claiming that it violated Apprendi v. New Jersey and\n\nthat it was not supported by the facts.                    The district court\noverruled Whooten's objections and sentenced him to 140 months'\n\nimprisonment.     On appeal, defendant renews the objections that he\n\nraised below.\n\n                                      II.\n\n             Whooten claims that Apprendi v.

See Caba, 241 F.3d at 101.\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            In this case, the statutory maximum for each count to\n\nwhich defendant pled guilty was twenty years' imprisonment. See 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1951(a) (authorizing a term of not more than twenty\nyears), 2113(a) (same).           Therefore, defendant's sentence of 140\n\nmonths does not exceed the statutory maximum, and Apprendi is\n\ninapplicable.          The district court acted within its discretion in\ndetermining that an abduction occurred for purposes of enhancing\n\ndefendant's sentence.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            Defendant argues that even if the abduction enhancement\nis permissible under Apprendi, the facts found by the district\n\ncourt in this case are insufficient to trigger application of the\nsentencing guidelines' abduction enhancement.             Although we review\nthe district court's factual findings for clear error, we review de\n\nnovo a district court's interpretation of a sentencing guideline.\nSee United States v. LaFortune, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198642\"><a href=\"/opinion/198642/united-states-v-lafortune/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            The    sentencing      guidelines   provide      for    a    four-level\n\nincrease in the offense level \"[i]f any person was abducted to\nfacilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate escape.\"\nU.S.S.G.    §    2B3.1(b)(4)(A).       The   background      note       to   §   2B3.1\n\nindicates       that    \"[t]he   guideline   provides   an    enhancement         for\nrobberies where a victim was forced to accompany the defendant to\nanother location. . . .\"           U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1, comment. (backg'd.).\n\nSection 2B3.1 also references definitions of general application in\n§ 1B1.1.        See U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1, comment. (n.1).               Section 1B1.1\n\nstates: \"'Abducted' means that a victim was forced to accompany an\n\n                                       -5-\n\foffender to a different location.        For example, a bank robber's\n\nforcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would\n\nconstitute an abduction.\"     U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, comment. (n.1(a)).\n             Defendant argues that, as a matter of law, forcing Mee to\n\nwalk 65 feet from the store's entrance does not amount to forcing\n\nthe victim \"to a different location,\" and is dissimilar from the\ncommentary's example of forcing a bank teller into a getaway car.\n\nBecause Whooten released Mee when he was still 90 feet from the\n\ngetaway car, he claims that her presence did not facilitate the\n\ncommission of the offense or the defendant's escape.         As a result,\n\nWhooten contends that his acts do not qualify as an abduction under\n\nthe guidelines.     We disagree.\n\n             The facts, which defendant does not dispute, indicate\nthat Whooten forced Mee, at gunpoint and while threatening to kill\n\nher, outside of the store and 65 feet into the parking lot.             We\n\nhave no difficulty finding that this was a forced movement \"to a\ndifferent location.\"      See United States v.

By forcing Mee to\nwalk in front of him as he exited the store, Whooten shielded\n\nhimself   from   detection,   as   well   as   provided    himself   with   a\n\npotential hostage until Travis had sufficient time to start the\ncar.     See Nale, 101 F.3d at 1003 (finding temporary abduction\n\nfacilitated offense because it delayed police notification and\n\nallowed defendant to make a speedier escape).\n\n            This Court has observed that the abduction enhancement is\n\nintended, at least in part, to protect victims against additional\n\nharm that may result from the victim's isolation, and thus applies\n\nwhether the abduction is carried out by threat or by physical\n\nforce.    See United States v.
