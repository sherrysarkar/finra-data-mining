CHATER,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Francis X. Quinn, Jr., Benjamin T. King and Boynton, Waldron,\r\nDoleac, Woodman &amp; Scott, P.A. on brief for appellant.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney and Christopher M.\r\nTauro, Assistant U.S. Attorney on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 14, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Claimant Linda J. Keating appeals from\r\nthe judgment of the district court which affirmed the decision\r\nof the Commissioner of Social Security that she was not\r\nentitled to Social Security disability benefits.  On appeal,\r\nclaimant argues that the determination of the administrative\r\nlaw judge (ALJ) that her impairments did not prevent her from\r\nperforming the full range of sedentary work was not supported\r\nby substantial evidence.  However, in support of this\r\ncontention, claimant raises on appeal arguments that were not\r\npresented, in the first instance, to the district court. \r\n\"Ordinarily, an appellant who has not proffered a particular\r\nclaim or defense in the district court may not unveil it in the\r\ncourt of appeals.\"  National Ass'n of Social Workers v.\r\nHarwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation\r\nmarks and citation omitted).  We nonetheless briefly address,\r\nand reject, these new arguments.\r\n          1.  Claimant's argument that her alleged inability to\r\nwork full-time precludes a finding that she retained the\r\ncapacity for the full range of sedentary work is based on the\r\nreport of the physical therapist.  However, contrary to\r\nclaimant's assertion, this report is not uncontradicted.  In\r\nparticular, Dr. Marini did not limit claimant to part-time work\r\nwhen he opined that she was a candidate for retraining for a\r\nsedentary job and the RFC assessment completed by the\r\nconsulting physician assumed that claimant could work full-\r\ntime.   These reports provide substantial evidence to support\r\n                              -2-\r\nthe ALJ's use of the grid based on her decision that claimant\r\nhad the ability to perform a wide range of sedentary work.  SeeRodriguez Pagan v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 819\r\nF.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (holding that the\r\nSecretary did not act unreasonably in crediting the RFC\r\nassessment of a consulting physician which established that\r\nclaimant could perform sedentary work, rather than the\r\nconflicting reports of two of claimant's treating physicians;\r\nalso affirming the Secretary's use of the grid).\r\n          2.  Claimant next contends that the uncontradicted\r\nevidence in the record shows that the limitations on the use of\r\nher right hand prevent her from being able to perform the full\r\nrange of sedentary work.  This argument fails for the simple\r\nreason that the record, in fact, contains conflicting evidence\r\nregarding the problems with claimant's right hand.  See Irlanda\r\nOrtiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 955 F.2d 765,\r\n769 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (conflicts in the evidence are\r\nfor the Commissioner, not the courts).\r\n          Significantly, the EMG conducted in March 1992\r\nrevealed no evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome or neuropathy in\r\nclaimant's hands.  Further, in his discharge summary, Dr.\r\nMarini, claimant's treating chiropractor, did not note any\r\nproblems with claimant's right hand when he opined that\r\nclaimant could perform sedentary work.  Similarly, Dr. Krutt,\r\nin September 1993, stated that claimant had no objective\r\nfindings which would prevent her from engaging in normal\r\nactivities and Dr. McCann's December 1992 physical examination\r\ndid not reveal any pathological reflexes, weakness or sensory\r\ndisturbances.  Finally, although the physical therapist\r\ndetermined that claimant had limited use of her right hand, she\r\nconcluded only that this limitation prevented claimant from\r\nperforming her past work as a chef; the physical therapist did\r\nnot state that the limitation prevented claimant from doing any\r\nother kinds of work.\r\n          3.  Claimant again relies on the report of the\r\nphysical therapist for the argument that there is\r\nuncontradicted evidence in the record that she needs to\r\nalternate positions frequently.  However, as with the\r\ncontention regarding the limitations in the use of her right\r\nhand, claimant ignores the rest of the record.  Specifically,\r\nthe residual functional capacity assessment of the consulting\r\nphysician did not state that claimant is limited by any need to\r\nalternate positions; rather, this physician opined that\r\nclaimant could sit and stand for up to six hours each in an\r\neight-hour day.  This assessment, then, provides conflicting\r\nevidence on which the ALJ was entitled to rely.  See Rodriguez\r\nPagan, supra, 819 F.2d at 2-3.\r\n          Based on the foregoing, the ALJ's reliance on the\r\ngrid was appropriate and a vocational expert was not required\r\nto testify regarding what jobs claimant could perform despite\r\nher impairments.  See Ortiz v. Secretary of Health and Human\r\nServices, 890 F.2d 520, 524-25 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam).  \r\n          The judgment of the district court is therefore\r\naffirmed. \n",
