We have carefully reviewed the record\r                                 \r\n\non  appeal and  the parties'  briefs.   The  judgment of  the\r\n\ndistrict court  is affirmed  for  the reasons  stated in  its\r\n\norder and in the report  and recommendation of the magistrate\r\n\njudge which the order adopted.  We add only two comments.  \r\n\n          1.  Claimant argues that the ALJ's finding that she\r\n\ncan  walk and sit  for an hour  each day is  not supported by\r                         \r\n\nsubstantial  evidence   because  the  Medical   Advisor  (MA)\r\n\ntestified  to  the contrary  at  the hearing.    We disagree.\r\n\nAlthough the  MA first  stated that claimant  \"must not  work\r\n\nstanding or walking,\" he later clarified this by stating that\r\n\nshe could spend, in an eight-hour day, \"[o]ne hour walking or\r\n\none hour standing.\"\r\n\n          Although confusing, it seems to us, first, that the\r\n\nMA's  bottom line is that claimant can walk and stand for one\r                                                           \r\n\nhour  during an  eight hour  day.   We think  that claimant's\r\n\nfocus on  the  use of  the word  \"or\" in  the  last quote  is\r\n\nhypertechnical.    Second,  there is  other  evidence  in the\r\n\nrecord -- the two residual functional capacity assessments --\r\n\nwhich  indicates that  claimant can  walk and  stand for  six\r                                                                         \r\n\nhours  per working  day.    Finally,  claimant  submitted  no\r\n\nevidence of her  own to show the  impact of her condition  on\r\n\nher ability to function.\r\n\n          2.  In the same vein, claimant's assertion that the\r\n\nVocational  Expert  (VE)  described  a  secretarial  job   as\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nrequiring \"indefinite\" periods of walking and standing is not\r\n\nsupported by the  record.  The VE was  describing the general\r\n\nrequirements of such work and  was not assigning times to the\r\n\nvarious activities.\r\n\n          The judgment  of the  district  court is  affirmed.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSee 1st Cir.
