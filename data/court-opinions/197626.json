Civ. P. 11  sanctions against plaintiffs'  attorneys.  We\r\n\naffirm  the   district  court's  ruling   that  statutes   of\r\n\nlimitations barred all  of plaintiffs' claims and  uphold the\r\n\ndistrict   court's  denial  of  Dime's  motion  for  Rule  11\r\n\nsanctions because that denial was not an abuse of the court's\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we\r\n\nrecite  the facts  and reasonable  inferences  raised by  the\r\n\nfacts in their  favor.  See Aybar v.  Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n10, 13 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r\n\n          Dime   is  a   federally-chartered  savings   bank.\r\n\nBetween July 1,  1986, and December  31, 1989, Dime,  through\r\n\nits wholly  owned subsidiary,  Dime Real  Estate Services  --\r\n\nMassachusetts, Inc.  (\"DRES-MA\"),  made  over  four  thousand\r\n\n(4,000) home mortgage  loans on residential homes  located in\r\n\nMassachusetts,  totalling over  six  hundred million  dollars\r\n\n($600,000,000).  DRES-MA ceased to exist in 1990.2\r\n\n          Dime  marketed  to Massachusetts  residential  home\r\n\npurchasers  an  adjustable  rate loan  product  known  as the\r\n\nImpact  Loan.  In  evaluating applications for  Impact Loans,\r\n\nDime  required only  minimal  verification of  the employment\r\n\nstatus, assets, and  income of prospective  borrowers, basing\r\n\nits lending  decisions instead on  the value of  the property\r\n\nsubject  to the  mortgage.    Moreover,  Dime  loan  officers\r\n\noperated  under  instructions  to push  Impact  Loans  to the\r\n\nvirtual exclusion  of other types  of mortgage  loans.   This\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  It is unclear from the  record whether DRES-MA was merged\r\ninto Dime or whether it was dissolved.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\neffort was part of Dime's national campaign to expand rapidly\r\n\nits home lending business.\r\n\n          A  principal feature  of  an  Impact  Loan  was  an\r\n\ninitial \"teaser\" interest  rate of 7.5 percent  for the first\r\n\nsix  months with  a cap  of 9.5  percent for  the second  six\r\n\nmonths.  Thereafter, the rate  would adjust to conform to the\r\n\nCost of  Funds Index plus three  percent, with a  cap of 13.9\r\n\npercent.  This arrangement was designed to result in negative\r\n\namortization, a situation in which monthly loan payments fall\r\n\nshort of the  actual monthly interest due  on the loan.   The\r\n\nunpaid interest, or \"deferred interest,\" is then added to the\r\n\nprincipal and begins  to accrue interest itself,  causing the\r\n\nprincipal  owed to  increase despite  the  borrower's regular\r\n\npayments.   The  terms of  the Impact  Loan provided  that no\r\n\npayments or portions of payments would apply to the principal\r\n\nuntil all \"deferred interest,\" or  negative amortization, had\r\n\nbeen paid.  Once the principal balance reached 110 percent of\r\n\nthe original  principal amount, the  loan contracts  required\r\n\nmortgagors  to  make  fully  amortizing  payments;  that  is,\r\n\nmortgagors were required to  increase their monthly  payments\r\n\nto cover the additional principal plus interest.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs  secured residential  Impact Loans  from\r\n\nDRES-MA in 1986 and 1987.  To induce plaintiffs to enter  the\r\n\nloan  contracts,  Dime downplayed  the  negative amortization\r\n\nfeature  of the Impact Loans, and discouraged plaintiffs from\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nhiring   their  own  attorneys  by  telling  them  that  Dime\r\n\nattorneys  would \"handle  things\" and  \"protect\"  them.   Six\r\n\nmonths into the loans, monthly statements  revealed increases\r\n\nin  the owed  principal, and,  in the  second year,  deferred\r\n\ninterest began  to appear on  the statements.   Although  the\r\n\ninitial loan documents contained  the information from  which\r\n\nplaintiffs  could have  discovered that  their loan  payments\r\n\nwould  increase,   plaintiffs  contend   that  teasing   this\r\n\ninformation  out  of   the  documents  would  have   required\r\n\ncomputation  skills,  computer  software,  and  a   level  of\r\n\nsophistication that  they did  not, and  could not  have been\r\n\nexpected to,  possess.   In addition,  plaintiffs argue  that\r\n\nDime  charged  them  excessive  fees  for  closing  the  loan\r\n\ncontracts,  serviced  their  loans  improperly  by  providing\r\n\nunsatisfactory  responses  to  their  queries about  negative\r\n\namortization, and altered the Saloises' loan impermissibly by\r\n\nrequesting that the Saloises sign \"corrective\" documents that\r\n\nlifted  a two  percent per  month  cap on  the interest  rate\r\n\napplicable to the loan.\r\n\n          At the time of the complaint, plaintiffs Robert and\r\n\nDiane  Salois continued to  hold their mortgage.   Plaintiffs\r\n\nDavid M. Leary and Linda Scurini-Leary had defaulted, and the\r\n\nmortgage on their home was  foreclosed on in 1991.  Plaintiff\r\n\nNinon R.  L. Freeman  paid her  loan in  full in  1993.   The\r\n\nSaloises were  alerted to  their potential  claims when  they\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nconsulted an attorney about their financial situation in late\r\n\nSeptember,   1994,  and  Ms.  Freeman  and  the  Learys  were\r\n\nsimilarly  advised  in  mid-1995.   The  Saloises  filed this\r\n\naction on  September 1, 1995,  in the United  States District\r\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts, as a  putative class\r\n\naction  on  behalf  of all  persons  who  secured residential\r\n\nmortgage loans  from Dime  in Massachusetts  between July  1,\r\n\n1986, and  December 31, 1989.   Dime responded on  October 5,\r\n\n1995, with a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely.  On\r\n\nNovember  10, 1995, Dime further moved for Rule 11 sanctions,\r\n\nalleging  that  there  was  no legal  or  factual  basis  for\r\n\nplaintiffs'  claims.  The Saloises filed an amended complaint\r\n\non February 9,  1996, which added the Learys  and Ms. Freeman\r\n\nas plaintiffs.  In a margin order dated November 6, 1996, the\r\n\ndistrict court denied the Rule 11 motion and, on November 13,\r\n\n1996,  dismissed  the complaint  on  statutes  of limitations\r\n\ngrounds.  Because the court never acted on plaintiffs' motion\r\n\nfor class certification, no class was certified.  This appeal\r\n\nand cross-appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.  Plaintiffs' Claims \r                                  \r\n\n          On  appeal,  plaintiffs contend  that  the district\r\n\ncourt  erred in  dismissing  their  actions  on  statutes  of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nlimitations grounds, arguing  that the claims are  subject to\r\n\nequitable tolling and thus are  timely.  They further contend\r\n\nthat their  claims warrant  relief on the  merits.   We begin\r\n\nwith the statutes of limitations issue because, if plaintiffs\r\n\nclaims in fact are time-barred, that finishes the case. \r\n\n          Arguing for equitable  tolling, plaintiffs draw  on\r\n\nfederal   and  Massachusetts   law   providing  that   fraud,\r\n\nfraudulent concealment,  and wrongs  resulting in  inherently\r\n\nunknowable  injuries   toll  limitations   periods,  and   on\r\n\nMassachusetts  law providing that  limitations periods may be\r\n\ntolled by  the existence of  and breach of a  fiduciary duty.\r\n\nThe   heart   of  plaintiffs'   allegations   is  that   Dime\r\n\nfraudulently  concealed  the  fact  that  their  loans  would\r\n\ndefinitely,  rather  than  only possibly,  go  into  negative\r                      \r\n\namortization and accrue deferred interest.  Plaintiffs assert\r\n\nthat  this  information  became  available  only  after  they\r\n\nconsulted a knowledgeable  attorney who was able  to decipher\r\n\nthe meaning of the facts  and figures contained in their loan\r\n\ndocuments.  Further,  plaintiffs contend that issues  of fact\r\n\nrelating  to the propriety  of tolling should  have precluded\r\n\nthe district court from dismissing their claims based on  the\r\n\npleadings alone.  We are not persuaded.\r\n\n          As an initial matter we note that plaintiffs' TILA,\r\n\nRESPA, and Parity Act claims are subject to one-year statutes\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nof limitations.3   Thus,  these claims must  have accrued  no\r\n\nearlier than  September 1,  1994.  The  claims for  breach of\r\n\nfiduciary duty; fraud,  deceit, and misrepresentation;  civil\r\n\nconspiracy; and negligent misrepresentation, negligent hiring\r\n\nand  supervision, and vicarious  liability are governed  by a\r\n\nthree-year limitations  period.4  These claims must therefore\r\n\nhave accrued no earlier than September 1,  1992.  Plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims  under RICO and the Massachusetts Consumer Credit Cost\r\n\nDisclosure  and Consumer Protection Acts are subject to four-\r\n\nyear  limitations periods.5   Thus,  these  claims must  have\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The TILA states that \"[a]ny action under this section may\r\nbe  brought  . .  .  within one  year  from the  date  of the\r\noccurrence  of the  violation.\"   15 U.S.C.    1640(e).   The\r\nRESPA  provides that \"[a]ny action pursuant to the provisions\r\nof section . . . 2607 . . . of [Title 12] may  be brought . .\r\n. within  1 year . . . from the date of the occurrence of the\r\nviolation.\"  12  U.S.C.   2614.   The Parity Act states  that\r\n\"[a]ny violation  of  this  section shall  be  treated  as  a\r\nviolation of the Truth in Lending Act.\"  12 U.S.C.   3806(c).\r\nWe  note that  one other court  of appeals has  held that the\r\nRESPA is  not subject  to tolling doctrines.   See  Hardin v.\r                                                                      \r\nCity  Title &amp;  Escrow Co.,  797  F.2d 1037,  1041 (D.C.  Cir.\r                                     \r\n1986).   We need not  address the correctness of  this ruling\r\nbecause, for reasons  we shall explain, equitable  tolling is\r\nnot warranted on the facts of this case.\r\n\n4.  Massachusetts law provides  that \"actions of  tort . .  .\r\nshall be  commenced only  within three  years next  after the\r\ncause of action accrues.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260,   2A.\r\n\n5.  Massachusetts  law provides  that  \"[a]ctions arising  on\r\naccount of violations of any  law intended for the protection\r\nof  consumers, including  but not  limited to  . .  . chapter\r\nninety-three A .  . . [and] chapter one hundred and forty D .\r\n.  .  whether for  damages,  penalties  or  other relief  and\r\nbrought  by any person .  . . shall  be commenced only within\r\nfour years  next after the  cause of action accrues.\"   Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 260,   5A.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\naccrued   no  earlier  than  September  1,  1991.    Finally,\r\n\nplaintiffs' claim  for breach  of contract  is governed  by a\r\n\nsix-year  limitations period.6   Thus, the contract  cause of\r\n\naction must have accrued no earlier than September 1, 1989. \r\n\n          A cause of action generally accrues at the  time of\r\n\nthe  plaintiff's injury,  or,  in  the case  of  a breach  of\r\n\ncontract, at the  time of the breach.

Therefore,  plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims  arose when Dime  allegedly induced them  to sign loan\r\n\ncontracts by misrepresenting and/or omitting facts about  the\r\n\nterms of the  mortgage, charged them excessive  closing fees,\r\n\nand  serviced  their  loans improperly  by  giving inadequate\r\n\nanswers to  telephone inquiries  about negative  amortization\r\n\nand by  having the  Saloises sign  corrective documents  that\r\n\nimproperly altered their loan.\r\n\n          The  district court  examined  each of  plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims and  concluded that  virtually all  federal causes  of\r\n\naction  accrued when plaintiffs entered their respective loan\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          With regard to  RICO claims, the Supreme  Court has\r\nheld that \"the federal policies  that lie behind RICO and the\r\npracticalities of RICO  litigation make the selection  of the\r\n4-year statute  of limitations  for Clayton  Act actions,  15\r\nU.S.C.    15b, the  most appropriate  limitations period  for\r\nRICO actions.\"  Agency Holding Corp.  v.

Laws ch. 260,   2.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ncontracts7  and, in any  event, no later  than mid-1988, when\r\n\nthe Saloises signed  the corrective documents.   The district\r\n\ncourt  also concluded that, with the exception of plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims  based on  Mass. Gen.  Laws ch.  167E, see  infra, the\r                                                                    \r\n\nstate claims accrued no later  than either the point at which\r\n\nthe corrective documents  were signed or  the point at  which\r\n\nplaintiffs called  Dime and were provided  inaccurate answers\r\n\nabout deferred interest.  Although  there may be a dispute as\r\n\nto  when,  exactly, some  of the  causes of  action accrued,8\r\n\nplaintiffs do not  dispute that their claims  accrued outside\r\n\nthe relevant limitations periods.  Accordingly, the viability\r\n\nof  plaintiffs'  claims  depends  on  whether  principles  of\r\n\nequitable tolling apply.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  Freemans  and  the Learys  entered  into  their loan\r\ncontracts  with Dime  no later  than November  18,  1986, and\r\nApril  15, 1987, respectively;  the Saloises executed  a note\r\nand mortgage on June 16, 1987, and  executed corrective notes\r\non  February  29,  1988,  and  June  1,  1988.     Plaintiffs\r\ntelephoned Dime  sometime in the  second year of  their loans\r\nwhen  deferred  interest  began to  appear  on  their monthly\r\nstatements.  This must have occurred  no later than mid-1989.\r\nSee infra note 8.\r                     \r\n\n8.  Although the  district court  concluded  that the  events\r\ngiving rise to  plaintiffs' claims all must  have taken place\r\nno later than mid-1988, we  conclude that the phone calls may\r\nhave taken  place as late  as mid-1989.  Construing  facts in\r\nthe light most favorable to plaintiffs, we assume that it was\r\nthe Saloises who placed the calls, and that it was the end of\r                                                                      \r\nthe \"second year of their loan\" when they did so, which means\r\nthe calls may not have been  made until June 16, 1989.   Even\r\nusing  this later date as the benchmark, however, plaintiffs'\r\ncauses of action accrued at  least six years and almost three\r\nmonths  prior to  the date  plaintiffs  filed their  original\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          1.

Indeed,  equitable tolling of a federal  statute\r\n\nof limitations is  \"appropriate only  when the  circumstances\r\n\nthat cause a plaintiff to miss  a filing deadline are out  of\r\n\nhis hands.\"  Heideman v.

For plaintiffs to be successful in\r\n\ntheir  argument, we must determine that \"(1) sufficient facts\r\n\nwere  [not] available  to  put  a  reasonable  [borrower]  in\r\n\nplaintiff[s'] position on  inquiry notice of the  possibility\r                                                                         \r\n\nof fraud,  and (2)  plaintiff[s] exercised  due diligence  in\r\n\nattempting  to  uncover  the  factual  basis  underlying this\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nalleged fraudulent conduct.\"  Maggio, 824 F.2d at 128.  Thus,\r                                                \r\n\nallegations  of  fraudulent  concealment  do not  modify  the\r\n\nrequirement that  plaintiffs must  have exercised  reasonable\r\n\ndiligence.   See Truck Drivers  &amp; Helpers Union v.  NLRB, 993\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 990, 998 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Irrespective of the extent of\r\n\nthe effort  to conceal,  the fraudulent concealment  doctrine\r\n\nwill  not save  a charging  party who  fails to  exercise due\r\n\ndiligence,  and is  thus charged  with notice of  a potential\r\n\nclaim.\").  In  simpler terms, fraud  may render reasonable  a\r\n\nplaintiff's  otherwise unreasonable  conduct,  but there  are\r\n\nlimits:  plaintiffs must still exercise reasonable  diligence\r\n\nin discovering that they have been the victims of fraud.\r\n\n          In this case, the inquiry is over before it begins.\r\n\nRegardless whether negative amortization was inevitable  with\r\n\nImpact  Loans, the documents contained all of the information\r\n\nnecessary to determine the interaction of Dime's formula with\r\n\nprevailing interest  rates.   It  was attorney  consultation,\r\n\nrather  than  newly-discovered   information,  that  prompted\r\n\nplaintiffs'  lawsuit.  Therefore, sufficient facts -- indeed,\r\n\nall  the  facts --  were  available  to place  plaintiffs  on\r               \r\n\ninquiry notice  of fraudulent conduct.  Moreover,  even if we\r\n\nregard   plaintiffs'  consultation   with   an  attorney   as\r\n\n\"discovered\"   information  that   revealed  Dime's   alleged\r\n\nconcealment,   it  cannot  be   said  that   plaintiffs  were\r\n\nreasonable in waiting until 1994 to consult an attorney, when\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nit was  clear as early as 1988 that  their loans had begun to\r\n\naccrue deferred interest.9   As the district  court observed,\r\n\n\"The loan documents notified plaintiffs of the possibility of\r\n\nnegative amortization, when it would  apply, and how it would\r\n\nwork,\"  so  that  even \"[i]f  [Dime]  had  misrepresented the\r\n\nnature of  the loans,  the loan  documents plaintiffs  signed\r\n\nwould have put them on notice of the fraud.\"  Salois  v. Dime\r                                                                         \r\n\nSavings Bank, No. 95-11967-PBS, slip op. at 14 (D. Mass. Nov.\r                        \r\n\n13, 1996).10  \r\n\n          Plaintiffs argue that  whether they were reasonably\r\n\ndiligent in ascertaining their claims  is a matter of fact to\r\n\nbe determined by  a jury.   Even  if we accept  all facts  as\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  Once deferred interest  began to accrue, after  the first\r\nyear of the  repayments, the bases of all  of the plaintiffs'\r\npresent claims  had come to  their attention.  That  they did\r\nnot seek legal advice  in 1988 (or, in any event,  before the\r\nrunning of the  relevant statutes of limitations) seems to be\r\nmore  a  matter   of  happenstance  than  lack   of  relevant\r\ninformation.   We think  the district court  stated the issue\r\nwell: \"No facts are alleged as to what prompted plaintiffs to\r\nconsult an  attorney, if not their loan documents and monthly\r\nstatements.  . .  .   If the  plaintiffs' loan  documents and\r\nstatements prompted them to  consult an attorney in  1994 and\r\n1995, unprompted  by any new  disclosure, there is  no reason\r\nthey  could  not  have consulted  an  attorney  several years\r\nearlier.\"   Salois v.

Thus, as a  matter of  Massachusetts law,\r\nplaintiffs were  on notice of  their claims when  they signed\r\ntheir loan documents in 1986 and 1987.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nplaintiffs  present  them,  however, nothing  in  the  record\r\n\nsupports the conclusion that plaintiffs exercised  reasonable\r\n\ndiligence as  a  matter of  law.

Plaintiffs  also contend that  there are issues  of fact\r\nregarding  whether Dime  was a  fiduciary  to plaintiffs  and\r\nwhether Dime fraudulently concealed information, and that the\r\nexistence of  such factual  issues precludes  dismissal.   To\r\nthis   we  note  that,   first,  simply  alleging  fraudulent\r\nconcealment  or the  existence of  a fiduciary duty  does not\r\nsuffice to avoid dismissal.   See General Builders Supply Co.\r                                                                         \r\nv.

Hurwitz, 10  Mass. App. Ct. 99,  106 (1980)).\r                                   \r\n\nHere,  an analysis  of whether  Dime  concealed the  means of\r\n\nacquiring  the  facts  giving  rise  to  their  claims  would\r\n\nparallel  a reasonable diligence  inquiry, which, as  we have\r\n\nalready concluded, plaintiffs fail.   Yet we need not rely on\r\n\nthat  analysis  because,  again, Dime  did  not  conceal from\r\n\nplaintiffs  the facts themselves and therefore cannot be said\r\n\nto  have  kept   plaintiffs  from  acquiring  the   requisite\r\n\nknowledge.\r\n\n          But plaintiffs persist, focusing on the possibility\r\n\nof a fiduciary  relationship between themselves and  Dime and\r\n\narguing that  Massachusetts  limitations  periods  should  be\r\n\ntolled because Dime's breach of an alleged fiduciary duty  to\r\n\nthem  is sufficient to constitute fraud.  Although plaintiffs\r\n\ndo  not develop  this  line  of  analysis,  presumably  their\r\n\nargument  is  that, even  if  Dime did  not  actively conceal\r\n\ninformation, it  nonetheless committed fraud  because it owed\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nplaintiffs a special  duty of disclosure.  Under  this theory\r\n\nas well,  however, \"[a]  plaintiff must be  able to  show not\r\n\nonly that  crucial facts were withheld by  defendants owing a\r\n\nduty of full disclosure, but also that he lacked the means to\r\n\nuncover  these facts.\"    Maggio,  824 F.2d  at  131.   If  a\r                                            \r\n\nplaintiff  has failed to \"undertake  even a minimal effort to\r\n\npursue  the investigative  opportunities  available to  him[,\r\n\nthen]  not even  the  combination  of  fiduciary  duties  and\r\n\nsection  12  are sufficient  to  excuse a  delay  in bringing\r\n\nsuit.\"  Id.  In this case, we need not determine whether Dime\r                       \r\n\nwas  a  fiduciary  to  plaintiffs because,  even  if  such  a\r\n\nrelationship  existed, the fact remains that no revelation of\r\n\ninformation occurred  subsequent to plaintiffs'  discovery of\r\n\nnegative  amortization in 1988.   Because plaintiffs  had the\r\n\n\"means to uncover\" the relevant  facts as early as 1988, and,\r\n\nindeed, possessed the  facts themselves in 1988,  their state\r\n\nlaw  claim based  on the  existence  of a  fiduciary duty  in\r\n\ncombination with fraudulent concealment fails.\r\n\n          Finally,  the  district   court  dismissed  one  of\r\n\nplaintiffs'  claims  based  on  the  Massachusetts   Consumer\r\n\nProtection Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 93A, on  the basis that,\r\n\nalthough Dime may  have been in violation of  Mass. Gen.

Dime,  a  federally-chartered bank,  is\r\n\nregulated  by the federal  Office of Thrift  Supervision, and\r\n\nDRES-MA,  a non-bank  subsidiary, was incorporated  under New\r\n\nYork law.   The  Massachusetts statutes  on which  plaintiffs\r\n\nrely  apply only to Massachusetts-chartered banks.  See Mass.\r                                                                   \r\n\nGen. Laws ch. 167E,   1.13\r\n\nB.  Dime's Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions\r                                                   \r\n\n          Dime  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\ndenying  its   motion  for   sanctions  against   plaintiffs'\r\n\nattorneys, and  that the  court  should have,  at a  minimum,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  The  district court noted that plaintiffs' ch. 93A claim\r\nbased on Dime's alleged violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 167E\r\n   2(B)(9) was  not time-barred if  the owed  monthly payment\r\namount  had changed  more than  once during  any of  the four\r\nyears  prior  to  the date  plaintiffs  brought  this action.\r\nPlaintiffs'  complaint did  not foreclose  this  issue.   The\r\ncourt observed as well that the claim based on Dime's alleged\r\nviolation  of Mass.  Gen. Laws  ch. 167E    2(B)(10)  was not\r\ntime-barred because the  interest rate changed five  times in\r\n1995.\r\n\n13.  Plaintiffs argue  in addition  that DRES-MA,  as a  non-\r\nbanking corporation, was prohibited under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n167,    37,  from engaging  in  banking activity,  regardless\r\nwhether DRES-MA was a foreign or  domestic corporation.  This\r\nargument  fails because DRES-MA was a real-estate subsidiary,\r                                                             \r\nnot a  banking  subsidiary.    As  such,  although  it  would\r\npresently be subject  to regulation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n255,     2, that  statute  was  not  in  force  at  the  time\r\nplaintiffs' claims arose.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nconducted  a hearing  to  determine  whether plaintiffs  made\r\n\nreasonable inquiries prior to bringing their claims.14  \r\n\n          Rule 11 calls for the imposition of sanctions on  a\r\n\nparty  \"for  making  arguments  or  filing  claims  that  are\r\n\nfrivolous, legally unreasonable,  without factual foundation,\r\n\nor asserted  for an  'improper purpose.'\"   S.

The  district court  disposed of  Dime's  motion in  two\r\nsentences:  \"While  I   agree  that  the  action   should  be\r\ndismissed, plaintiffs amended the complaint  to eliminate the\r\nfrivolous  claims.

The court  noted that plaintiffs'\r\n\nbreach of contract and Massachusetts Consumer  Protection Act\r\n\nclaims were  time-barred but nonetheless  \"colorable at least\r\n\nin part.\"  Although we reiterate that district courts  should\r\n\nprovide specific findings  in support of Rule  11 rulings, we\r\n\nconclude that, in light of the record, the court did not here\r\n\nabuse  its discretion by holding that plaintiffs' claims were\r\n\nnot without foundation in law or in fact.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n",

See Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dime is a federally-chartered savings bank.  Between July 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989, Dime, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Dime Real Estate Services--Massachusetts, Inc.  (\"DRES-MA\"), made over four thousand (4,000) home mortgage loans on residential homes located in Massachusetts, totalling over six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000).  DRES-MA ceased to exist in 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dime marketed to Massachusetts residential home purchasers an adjustable rate loan product known as the Impact Loan.  In evaluating applications for Impact Loans, Dime required only minimal verification of the employment status, assets, and income of prospective borrowers, basing its lending decisions instead on the value of the property subject to the mortgage.  Moreover, Dime loan officers operated under instructions to push Impact Loans to the virtual exclusion of other types of mortgage loans.  This effort was part of Dime's national campaign to expand rapidly its home lending business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A principal feature of an Impact Loan was an initial \"teaser\" interest rate of 7.5 percent for the first six months with a cap of 9.5 percent for the second six months.  Thereafter, the rate would adjust to conform to the Cost of Funds Index plus three percent, with a cap of 13.9 percent.  This arrangement was designed to result in negative amortization, a situation in which monthly loan payments fall short of the actual monthly interest due on the loan.  The unpaid interest, or \"deferred interest,\" is then added to the principal and begins to accrue interest itself, causing the principal owed to increase despite the borrower's regular payments.  The terms of the Impact Loan provided that no payments or portions of payments would apply to the principal until all \"deferred interest,\" or negative amortization, had been paid.  Once the principal balance reached 110 percent of the original principal amount, the loan contracts required mortgagors to make fully amortizing payments;  that is, mortgagors were required to increase their monthly payments to cover the additional principal plus interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs secured residential Impact Loans from DRES-MA in 1986 and 1987.  To induce plaintiffs to enter the loan contracts, Dime downplayed the negative amortization feature of the Impact Loans, and discouraged plaintiffs from hiring their own attorneys by telling them that Dime attorneys would \"handle things\" and \"protect\" them.  Six months into the loans, monthly statements revealed increases in the owed principal, and, in the second year, deferred interest began to appear on the statements.  Although the initial loan documents contained the information from which plaintiffs could have discovered that their loan payments would increase, plaintiffs contend that teasing this information out of the documents would have required computation skills, computer software, and a level of sophistication that they did not, and could not have been expected to, possess.  In addition, plaintiffs argue that Dime charged them excessive fees for closing the loan contracts, serviced their loans improperly by providing unsatisfactory responses to their queries about negative amortization, and altered the Saloises' loan impermissibly by requesting that the Saloises sign \"corrective\" documents that lifted a two percent per month cap on the interest rate applicable to the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the complaint, plaintiffs Robert and Diane Salois continued to hold their mortgage.  Plaintiffs David M. Leary and Linda Scurini-Leary had defaulted, and the mortgage on their home was foreclosed on in 1991.  Plaintiff Ninon R.L. Freeman paid her loan in full in 1993.  The Saloises were alerted to their potential claims when they consulted an attorney about their financial situation in late September, 1994, and Ms. Freeman and the Learys were similarly advised in mid-1995.  The Saloises filed this action on September 1, 1995, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, as a putative class action on behalf of all persons who secured residential mortgage loans from Dime in Massachusetts between July 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989.  Dime responded on October 5, 1995, with a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely.  On November 10, 1995, Dime further moved for Rule 11 sanctions, alleging that there was no legal or factual basis for plaintiffs' claims.  The Saloises filed an amended complaint on February 9, 1996, which added the Learys and Ms. Freeman as plaintiffs.  In a margin order dated November 6, 1996, the district court denied the Rule 11 motion and, on November 13, 1996, dismissed the complaint on statutes of limitations grounds.  Because the court never acted on plaintiffs' motion for class certification, no class was certified.  This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Plaintiffs' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in dismissing their actions on statutes of limitations grounds, arguing that the claims are subject to equitable tolling and thus are timely.  They further contend that their claims warrant relief on the merits.  We begin with the statutes of limitations issue because, if plaintiffs claims in fact are time-barred, that finishes the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguing for equitable tolling, plaintiffs draw on federal and Massachusetts law providing that fraud, fraudulent concealment, and wrongs resulting in inherently unknowable injuries toll limitations periods, and on Massachusetts law providing that limitations periods may be tolled by the existence of and breach of a fiduciary duty.  The heart of plaintiffs' allegations is that Dime fraudulently concealed the fact that their loans would definitely, rather than only possibly, go into negative amortization and accrue deferred interest.  Plaintiffs assert that this information became available only after they consulted a knowledgeable attorney who was able to decipher the meaning of the facts and figures contained in their loan documents.  Further, plaintiffs contend that issues of fact relating to the propriety of tolling should have precluded the district court from dismissing their claims based on the pleadings alone.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter we note that plaintiffs' TILA, RESPA, and Parity Act claims are subject to one-year statutes of limitations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Thus, these claims must have accrued no earlier than September 1, 1994.  The claims for breach of fiduciary duty;  fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation;  civil conspiracy;  and negligent misrepresentation, negligent hiring and supervision, and vicarious liability are governed by a three-year limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  These claims must therefore have accrued no earlier than September 1, 1992.  Plaintiffs' claims under RICO and the Massachusetts Consumer Credit Cost Disclosure and Consumer Protection Acts are subject to four-year limitations periods.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Thus, these claims must have accrued no earlier than September 1, 1991.  Finally, plaintiffs' claim for breach of contract is governed by a six-year limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Thus, the contract cause of action must have accrued no earlier than September 1, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A cause of action generally accrues at the time of the plaintiff's injury, or, in the case of a breach of contract, at the time of the breach.  See Cambridge Plating Co., Inc. v. Napco, Inc., 991 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir.1993) (discussing Massachusetts law).  Therefore, plaintiffs' claims arose when Dime allegedly induced them to sign loan contracts by misrepresenting and/or omitting facts about the terms of the mortgage, charged them excessive closing fees, and serviced their loans improperly by giving inadequate answers to telephone inquiries about negative amortization and by having the Saloises sign corrective documents that improperly altered their loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court examined each of plaintiffs' claims and concluded that virtually all federal causes of action accrued when plaintiffs entered their respective loan contracts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and, in any event, no later than mid-1988, when the Saloises signed the corrective documents.  The district court also concluded that, with the exception of plaintiffs' claims based on Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167E, see infra, the state claims accrued no later than either the point at which the corrective documents were signed or the point at which plaintiffs called Dime and were provided inaccurate answers about deferred interest.  Although there may be a dispute as to when, exactly, some of the causes of action accrued,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> plaintiffs do not dispute that their claims accrued outside the relevant limitations periods.  Accordingly, the viability of plaintiffs' claims depends on whether principles of equitable tolling apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Federal Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although, under federal law, equitable tolling is applied to statutes of limitations \"to prevent unjust results or to maintain the integrity of a statute,\" King v. California, 784 F.2d 910, 915 (9th Cir.1986), courts have taken a narrow view of equitable exceptions to limitations periods, see Earnhardt v. Puerto Rico, 691 F.2d 69, 71 (1st Cir.1982).  Indeed, equitable tolling of a federal statute of limitations is \"appropriate only when the circumstances that cause a plaintiff to miss a filing deadline are out of his hands.\"  Heideman v. PFL, Inc., 904 F.2d 1262, 1266 (8th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1026, 111 S.Ct. 676, 112 L.Ed.2d 668 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal doctrine of fraudulent concealment operates to toll the statute of limitations \"where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and 'remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part.' \"  Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 397, 66 S.Ct. 582, 585, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946) (quoting Bailey v. Glover, 88 U.S.  (21 Wall.) 342, 348, 22 L.Ed. 636 (1874));  see Maggio v. Gerard Freezer &amp; Ice Co., 824 F.2d 123, 127 (1st Cir.1987).  For plaintiffs to be successful in their argument, we must determine that \"(1) sufficient facts were [not] available to put a reasonable [borrower] in plaintiff[s'] position on inquiry notice of the possibility of fraud, and (2) plaintiff[s] exercised due diligence in attempting to uncover the factual basis underlying this alleged fraudulent conduct.\"  Maggio, 824 F.2d at 128.   Thus, allegations of fraudulent concealment do not modify the requirement that plaintiffs must have exercised reasonable diligence.  See Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Union v. NLRB, 993 F.2d 990, 998 (1st Cir.1993) (\"Irrespective of the extent of the effort to conceal, the fraudulent concealment doctrine will not save a charging party who fails to exercise due diligence, and is thus charged with notice of a potential claim.\").  In simpler terms, fraud may render reasonable a plaintiff's otherwise unreasonable conduct, but there are limits:  plaintiffs must still exercise reasonable diligence in discovering that they have been the victims of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the inquiry is over before it begins.  Regardless whether negative amortization was inevitable with Impact Loans, the documents contained all of the information necessary to determine the interaction of Dime's formula with prevailing interest rates.  It was attorney consultation, rather than newly-discovered information, that prompted plaintiffs' lawsuit.  Therefore, sufficient facts--indeed, all the facts--were available to place plaintiffs on inquiry notice of fraudulent conduct.  Moreover, even if we regard plaintiffs' consultation with an attorney as \"discovered\" information that revealed Dime's alleged concealment, it cannot be said that plaintiffs were reasonable in waiting until 1994 to consult an attorney, when it was clear as early as 1988 that their loans had begun to accrue deferred interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  As the district court observed, \"The loan documents notified plaintiffs of the possibility of negative amortization, when it would apply, and how it would work,\" so that even \"[i]f [Dime] had misrepresented the nature of the loans, the loan documents plaintiffs signed would have put them on notice of the fraud.\"  Salois v. Dime Savings Bank, No. 95-11967-PBS, slip op. at 14 (D.Mass. Nov. 13, 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that whether they were reasonably diligent in ascertaining their claims is a matter of fact to be determined by a jury.  Even if we accept all facts as plaintiffs present them, however, nothing in the record supports the conclusion that plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence as a matter of law.  Cf. Sleeper v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., 480 F.Supp. 1264, 1265 (D.Mass.1979) (noting that although the issue of reasonable diligence is factually based, it may be determined as a matter of law where the underlying facts are admitted or established without dispute), aff'd mem., 627 F.2d 1088 (1st Cir.1980).  Thus, the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' claims was proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. State Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing analysis likewise disposes of plaintiffs' argument for tolling on the basis of state fraudulent concealment doctrine.  Massachusetts law provides that, \"[i]f a person liable to a personal action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring it, the period prior to the discovery of his cause of action by the person so entitled shall be excluded in determining the time limited for the commencement of the action.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 12.  Specifically, a statute of limitations may be tolled \"if the wrongdoer, either through actual fraud or in breach of a fiduciary duty of full disclosure, keeps from the person injured knowledge of the facts giving rise to a cause of action and the means of acquiring knowledge of such facts.\"  Maggio, 824 F.2d at 131 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Frank Cooke, Inc. v. Hurwitz, 10 Mass.App.Ct. 99, 106, 406 N.E.2d 678 (1980)).  Here, an analysis of whether Dime concealed the means of acquiring the facts giving rise to their claims would parallel a reasonable diligence inquiry, which, as we have already concluded, plaintiffs fail.  Yet we need not rely on that analysis because, again, Dime did not conceal from plaintiffs the facts themselves and therefore cannot be said to have kept plaintiffs from acquiring the requisite knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But plaintiffs persist, focusing on the possibility of a fiduciary relationship between themselves and Dime and arguing that Massachusetts limitations periods should be tolled because Dime's breach of an alleged fiduciary duty to them is sufficient to constitute fraud.  Although plaintiffs do not develop this line of analysis, presumably their argument is that, even if Dime did not actively conceal information, it nonetheless committed fraud because it owed plaintiffs a special duty of disclosure.  Under this theory as well, however, \"[a] plaintiff must be able to show not only that crucial facts were withheld by defendants owing a duty of full disclosure, but also that he lacked the means to uncover these facts.\"  Maggio, 824 F.2d at 131.   If a plaintiff has failed to \"undertake even a minimal effort to pursue the investigative opportunities available to him[, then] not even the combination of fiduciary duties and section 12 are sufficient to excuse a delay in bringing suit.\"  Id. In this case, we need not determine whether Dime was a fiduciary to plaintiffs because, even if such a relationship existed, the fact remains that no revelation of information occurred subsequent to plaintiffs' discovery of negative amortization in 1988.  Because plaintiffs had the \"means to uncover\" the relevant facts as early as 1988, and, indeed, possessed the facts themselves in 1988, their state law claim based on the existence of a fiduciary duty in combination with fraudulent concealment fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court dismissed one of plaintiffs' claims based on the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 93A, on the basis that, although Dime may have been in violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167E, &#167;&#167; 2(B)(9) and (10)--which prohibit the alteration of a payment amount more than once a year and the alteration of the interest rate more than every six months--plaintiffs had not alleged that Dime was subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The court was correct.  Dime, a federally-chartered bank, is regulated by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, and DRES-MA, a non-bank subsidiary, was incorporated under New York law.  The Massachusetts statutes on which plaintiffs rely apply only to Massachusetts-chartered banks.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167E, &#167; 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>B.

Bravo Sys. v. Containment Tech.  Corp., 96 F.3d 1372, 1374-75 (Fed.Cir.1996) (citing Conn v. Borjorquez, 967 F.2d 1418, 1420 (9th Cir.1992)).  In reviewing the district court's denial of defendant's Rule 11 motion, we apply an abuse of discretion standard.  See Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2460-61, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).  As we have noted before, our review of denials of Rule 11 motions \"calls for somewhat more restraint than review of positive actions imposing sanctions and shifting fees.\"  Anderson v. Boston Sch. Comm., 105 F.3d 762, 769 (1st Cir.1997).  The trial judge should be accorded not only \"additional deference in the entire area of sanctions,\" but also \"extraordinary deference in denying sanctions.\"  Id. at 768.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would have been preferable for the district court to have more extensively set forth its rationale.  See Figueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria, 905 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.1990).  Nonetheless, \"although the rationale for a denial of a motion for fees or sanctions under Rule 11 ... should be unambiguously communicated, the lack of explicit findings is not fatal where the record itself, evidence or colloquy, clearly indicates one or more sufficient supporting reasons.\"  Anderson, 105 F.3d at 769.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record contains adequate rationale for the denial of the motion.  The court noted that plaintiffs' breach of contract and Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act claims were time-barred but nonetheless \"colorable at least in part.\"   Although we reiterate that district courts should provide specific findings in support of Rule 11 rulings, we conclude that, in light of the record, the court did not here abuse its discretion by holding that plaintiffs' claims were not without foundation in law or in fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The amended complaint alleges (1) violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1961-1968, (2) violation of the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1601 et seq. and Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. pt. 226, (3) violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2601-2617 and Regulation X, 24 C.F.R. pt. 3500, (4) violation of the federal Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act, 12 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3801-3806, (5) violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Credit Cost Disclosure Act, Mass.

Plaintiffs telephoned Dime sometime in the second year of their loans when deferred interest began to appear on their monthly statements.  This must have occurred no later than mid-1989.  See infra note 8</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Although the district court concluded that the events giving rise to plaintiffs' claims all must have taken place no later than mid-1988, we conclude that the phone calls may have taken place as late as mid-1989.  Construing facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, we assume that it was the Saloises who placed the calls, and that it was the end of the \"second year of their loan\" when they did so, which means the calls may not have been made until June 16, 1989.  Even using this later date as the benchmark, however, plaintiffs' causes of action accrued at least six years and almost three months prior to the date plaintiffs filed their original complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Once deferred interest began to accrue, after the first year of the repayments, the bases of all of the plaintiffs' present claims had come to their attention.  That they did not seek legal advice in 1988 (or, in any event, before the running of the relevant statutes of limitations) seems to be more a matter of happenstance than lack of relevant information.  We think the district court stated the issue well:  \"No facts are alleged as to what prompted plaintiffs to consult an attorney, if not their loan documents and monthly statements....  If the plaintiffs' loan documents and statements prompted them to consult an attorney in 1994 and 1995, unprompted by any new disclosure, there is no reason they could not have consulted an attorney several years earlier.\"  Salois v.

To this we note that, first, simply alleging fraudulent concealment or the existence of a fiduciary duty does not suffice to avoid dismissal.  See General Builders Supply Co. v. River Hill Coal Venture, 796 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir.1986).  Second, plaintiffs' claims may be dismissed without determining these issues because, even if plaintiffs' allegations regarding fraud and fiduciary duties are true, plaintiffs still fail the ultimate test, that of reasonableness in discovering and pursuing their claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The district court noted that plaintiffs' ch. 93A claim based on Dime's alleged violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167E &#167; 2(B)(9) was not time-barred if the owed monthly payment amount had changed more than once during any of the four years prior to the date plaintiffs brought this action.  Plaintiffs' complaint did not foreclose this issue.  The court observed as well that the claim based on Dime's alleged violation of Mass.  Gen.

Gen. Laws ch. 167, &#167; 37, from engaging in banking activity, regardless whether DRES-MA was a foreign or domestic corporation.  This argument fails because DRES-MA was a real-estate subsidiary, not a banking subsidiary.  As such, although it would presently be subject to regulation under Mass.  Gen.

Between July 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989, Dime, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Dime Real Estate Services--Massachusetts, Inc.  (\"DRES-MA\"), made over four thousand (4,000) home mortgage loans on residential homes located in Massachusetts, totalling over six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000).  DRES-MA ceased to exist in 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dime marketed to Massachusetts residential home purchasers an adjustable rate loan product known as the Impact Loan.  In evaluating applications for Impact Loans, Dime required only minimal verification of the employment status, assets, and income of prospective borrowers, basing its lending decisions instead on the value of the property subject to the mortgage.  Moreover, Dime loan officers operated under instructions to push Impact Loans to the virtual exclusion of other types of mortgage loans.  This effort was part of Dime's national campaign to expand rapidly its home lending business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A principal feature of an Impact Loan was an initial \"teaser\" interest rate of 7.5 percent for the first six months with a cap of 9.5 percent for the second six months.  Thereafter, the rate would adjust to conform to the Cost of Funds Index plus three percent, with a cap of 13.9 percent.  This arrangement was designed to result in negative amortization, a situation in which monthly loan payments fall short of the actual monthly interest due on the loan.  The unpaid interest, or \"deferred interest,\" is then added to the principal and begins to accrue interest itself, causing the principal owed to increase despite the borrower's regular payments.  The terms of the Impact Loan provided that no payments or portions of payments would apply to the principal until all \"deferred interest,\" or negative amortization, had been paid.  Once the principal balance reached 110 percent of the original principal amount, the loan contracts required mortgagors to make fully amortizing payments;  that is, mortgagors were required to increase their monthly payments to cover the additional principal plus interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs secured residential Impact Loans from DRES-MA in 1986 and 1987.  To induce plaintiffs to enter the loan contracts, Dime downplayed the negative amortization feature of the Impact Loans, and discouraged plaintiffs from hiring their own attorneys by telling them that Dime attorneys would \"handle things\" and \"protect\" them.  Six months into the loans, monthly statements revealed increases in the owed principal, and, in the second year, deferred interest began to appear on the statements.  Although the initial loan documents contained the information from which plaintiffs could have discovered that their loan payments would increase, plaintiffs contend that teasing this information out of the documents would have required computation skills, computer software, and a level of sophistication that they did not, and could not have been expected to, possess.  In addition, plaintiffs argue that Dime charged them excessive fees for closing the loan contracts, serviced their loans improperly by providing unsatisfactory responses to their queries about negative amortization, and altered the Saloises' loan impermissibly by requesting that the Saloises sign \"corrective\" documents that lifted a two percent per month cap on the interest rate applicable to the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the complaint, plaintiffs Robert and Diane Salois continued to hold their mortgage.  Plaintiffs David M. Leary and Linda Scurini-Leary had defaulted, and the mortgage on their home was foreclosed on in 1991.  Plaintiff Ninon R.L. Freeman paid her loan in full in 1993.  The Saloises were alerted to their potential claims when they consulted an attorney about their financial situation in late September, 1994, and Ms. Freeman and the Learys were similarly advised in mid-1995.  The Saloises filed this action on September 1, 1995, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, as a putative class action on behalf of all persons who secured residential mortgage loans from Dime in Massachusetts between July 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989.  Dime responded on October 5, 1995, with a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely.  On November 10, 1995, Dime further moved for Rule 11 sanctions, alleging that there was no legal or factual basis for plaintiffs' claims.  The Saloises filed an amended complaint on February 9, 1996, which added the Learys and Ms. Freeman as plaintiffs.  In a margin order dated November 6, 1996, the district court denied the Rule 11 motion and, on November 13, 1996, dismissed the complaint on statutes of limitations grounds.  Because the court never acted on plaintiffs' motion for class certification, no class was certified.  This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Plaintiffs' Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in dismissing their actions on statutes of limitations grounds, arguing that the claims are subject to equitable tolling and thus are timely.  They further contend that their claims warrant relief on the merits.  We begin with the statutes of limitations issue because, if plaintiffs claims in fact are time-barred, that finishes the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Arguing for equitable tolling, plaintiffs draw on federal and Massachusetts law providing that fraud, fraudulent concealment, and wrongs resulting in inherently unknowable injuries toll limitations periods, and on Massachusetts law providing that limitations periods may be tolled by the existence of and breach of a fiduciary duty.  The heart of plaintiffs' allegations is that Dime fraudulently concealed the fact that their loans would definitely, rather than only possibly, go into negative amortization and accrue deferred interest.  Plaintiffs assert that this information became available only after they consulted a knowledgeable attorney who was able to decipher the meaning of the facts and figures contained in their loan documents.

Therefore, plaintiffs' claims arose when Dime allegedly induced them to sign loan contracts by misrepresenting and/or omitting facts about the terms of the mortgage, charged them excessive closing fees, and serviced their loans improperly by giving inadequate answers to telephone inquiries about negative amortization and by having the Saloises sign corrective documents that improperly altered their loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court examined each of plaintiffs' claims and concluded that virtually all federal causes of action accrued when plaintiffs entered their respective loan contracts<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and, in any event, no later than mid-1988, when the Saloises signed the corrective documents.  The district court also concluded that, with the exception of plaintiffs' claims based on Mass.  Gen.

For plaintiffs to be successful in their argument, we must determine that \"(1) sufficient facts were [not] available to put a reasonable [borrower] in plaintiff[s'] position on inquiry notice of the possibility of fraud, and (2) plaintiff[s] exercised due diligence in attempting to uncover the factual basis underlying this alleged fraudulent conduct.\"  Maggio, 824 F.2d at 128.   Thus, allegations of fraudulent concealment do not modify the requirement that plaintiffs must have exercised reasonable diligence.  See Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Union v.

In simpler terms, fraud may render reasonable a plaintiff's otherwise unreasonable conduct, but there are limits:  plaintiffs must still exercise reasonable diligence in discovering that they have been the victims of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the inquiry is over before it begins.  Regardless whether negative amortization was inevitable with Impact Loans, the documents contained all of the information necessary to determine the interaction of Dime's formula with prevailing interest rates.  It was attorney consultation, rather than newly-discovered information, that prompted plaintiffs' lawsuit.  Therefore, sufficient facts--indeed, all the facts--were available to place plaintiffs on inquiry notice of fraudulent conduct.  Moreover, even if we regard plaintiffs' consultation with an attorney as \"discovered\" information that revealed Dime's alleged concealment, it cannot be said that plaintiffs were reasonable in waiting until 1994 to consult an attorney, when it was clear as early as 1988 that their loans had begun to accrue deferred interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  As the district court observed, \"The loan documents notified plaintiffs of the possibility of negative amortization, when it would apply, and how it would work,\" so that even \"[i]f [Dime] had misrepresented the nature of the loans, the loan documents plaintiffs signed would have put them on notice of the fraud.\"  Salois v. Dime Savings Bank, No. 95-11967-PBS, slip op. at 14 (D.Mass.

Even if we accept all facts as plaintiffs present them, however, nothing in the record supports the conclusion that plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence as a matter of law.  Cf. Sleeper v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1531892\"><a href=\"/opinion/1531892/sleeper-v-kidder-peabody-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

State Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing analysis likewise disposes of plaintiffs' argument for tolling on the basis of state fraudulent concealment doctrine.  Massachusetts law provides that, \"[i]f a person liable to a personal action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring it, the period prior to the discovery of his cause of action by the person so entitled shall be excluded in determining the time limited for the commencement of the action.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, &#167; 12.  Specifically, a statute of limitations may be tolled \"if the wrongdoer, either through actual fraud or in breach of a fiduciary duty of full disclosure, keeps from the person injured knowledge of the facts giving rise to a cause of action and the means of acquiring knowledge of such facts.\"  Maggio, 824 F.2d at 131 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Frank Cooke, Inc. v. Hurwitz, 10 Mass.App.Ct. 99, 106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2029838\"><a href=\"/opinion/2029838/frank-cooke-inc-v-hurwitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span> (1980)).  Here, an analysis of whether Dime concealed the means of acquiring the facts giving rise to their claims would parallel a reasonable diligence inquiry, which, as we have already concluded, plaintiffs fail.  Yet we need not rely on that analysis because, again, Dime did not conceal from plaintiffs the facts themselves and therefore cannot be said to have kept plaintiffs from acquiring the requisite knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But plaintiffs persist, focusing on the possibility of a fiduciary relationship between themselves and Dime and arguing that Massachusetts limitations periods should be tolled because Dime's breach of an alleged fiduciary duty to them is sufficient to constitute fraud.  Although plaintiffs do not develop this line of analysis, presumably their argument is that, even if Dime did not actively conceal information, it nonetheless committed fraud because it owed plaintiffs a special duty of disclosure.  Under this theory as well, however, \"[a] plaintiff must be able to show not only that crucial facts were withheld by defendants owing a duty of full disclosure, but also that he lacked the means to uncover these facts.\"  Maggio, 824 F.2d at 131.   If a plaintiff has failed to \"undertake even a minimal effort to pursue the investigative opportunities available to him[, then] not even the combination of fiduciary duties and section 12 are sufficient to excuse a delay in bringing suit.\"  Id. In this case, we need not determine whether Dime was a fiduciary to plaintiffs because, even if such a relationship existed, the fact remains that no revelation of information occurred subsequent to plaintiffs' discovery of negative amortization in 1988.  Because plaintiffs had the \"means to uncover\" the relevant facts as early as 1988, and, indeed, possessed the facts themselves in 1988, their state law claim based on the existence of a fiduciary duty in combination with fraudulent concealment fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court dismissed one of plaintiffs' claims based on the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.

Laws ch. 167E, &#167;&#167; 2(B)(9) and (10)--which prohibit the alteration of a payment amount more than once a year and the alteration of the interest rate more than every six months--plaintiffs had not alleged that Dime was subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The court was correct.  Dime, a federally-chartered bank, is regulated by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, and DRES-MA, a non-bank subsidiary, was incorporated under New York law.

Even using this later date as the benchmark, however, plaintiffs' causes of action accrued at least six years and almost three months prior to the date plaintiffs filed their original complaint</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Once deferred interest began to accrue, after the first year of the repayments, the bases of all of the plaintiffs' present claims had come to their attention.  That they did not seek legal advice in 1988 (or, in any event, before the running of the relevant statutes of limitations) seems to be more a matter of happenstance than lack of relevant information.  We think the district court stated the issue well:  \"No facts are alleged as to what prompted plaintiffs to consult an attorney, if not their loan documents and monthly statements....  If the plaintiffs' loan documents and statements prompted them to consult an attorney in 1994 and 1995, unprompted by any new disclosure, there is no reason they could not have consulted an attorney several years earlier.\"  Salois v. Dime Savings Bank, No. 95-11967-PBS, slip op. at 15 (D.Mass. Nov. 13, 1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In addition, we note that, under Massachusetts law, \"one who signs a writing that is designed to serve as a legal document ... is presumed to know its contents.\"  Hull v. Attleboro Savings Bank, 33 Mass.App.Ct. 18, 24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218669\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218669/hull-v-attleboro-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span> (1992);  see Lerra v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1257</span></a></span>, 1262 (D.Mass.1981);  Connecticut Jr. Republic v. Doherty, 20 Mass.App.Ct. 107, 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2248463\"><a href=\"/opinion/2248463/connecticut-junior-republic-v-doherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span> (1985).  Thus, as a matter of Massachusetts law, plaintiffs were on notice of their claims when they signed their loan documents in 1986 and 1987</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also contend that there are issues of fact regarding whether Dime was a fiduciary to plaintiffs and whether Dime fraudulently concealed information, and that the existence of such factual issues precludes dismissal.  To this we note that, first, simply alleging fraudulent concealment or the existence of a fiduciary duty does not suffice to avoid dismissal.  See General Builders Supply Co. v. River Hill Coal Venture, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473678\"><a href=\"/opinion/473678/fed-sec-l-rep-p-92816-general-builders-supply-company-v-river-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1986).  Second, plaintiffs' claims may be dismissed without determining these issues because, even if plaintiffs' allegations regarding fraud and fiduciary duties are true, plaintiffs still fail the ultimate test, that of reasonableness in discovering and pursuing their claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The district court noted that plaintiffs' ch. 93A claim based on Dime's alleged violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167E &#167; 2(B)(9) was not time-barred if the owed monthly payment amount had changed more than once during any of the four years prior to the date plaintiffs brought this action.  Plaintiffs' complaint did not foreclose this issue.  The court observed as well that the claim based on Dime's alleged violation of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167E &#167; 2(B)(10) was not time-barred because the interest rate changed five times in 1995</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs argue in addition that DRES-MA, as a non-banking corporation, was prohibited under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 167, &#167; 37, from engaging in banking activity, regardless whether DRES-MA was a foreign or domestic corporation.  This argument fails because DRES-MA was a real-estate subsidiary, not a banking subsidiary.  As such, although it would presently be subject to regulation under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 255, &#167; 2, that statute was not in force at the time plaintiffs' claims arose</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The district court disposed of Dime's motion in two sentences:  \"While I agree that the action should be dismissed, plaintiffs amended the complaint to eliminate the frivolous claims.  Moreover, while the claims are time-barred, the breach of contract claims and the [Mass.  Gen.] Laws ch. 93A claims were colorable at least in part.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
