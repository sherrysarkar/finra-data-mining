The need to  raise capital\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nand to compete in increasingly  diversified financial markets\r\n\nhas led a number of American mutual life insurance  companies\r\n\nto convert to being stock  companies.  This process, known as\r\n\n\"demutualization,\"  often involves a conversion of the mutual\r\n\npolicyholders'  ownership interest  in the  old  company into\r\n\nownership interest in the form of stock in the new company.\r\n\n          This appeal  raises important  questions about  the\r\n\nproper tax treatment of one form of demutualization:  whether\r\n\nstock and cash  distributed to policyholders in  exchange for\r\n\ntheir  mutual  ownership  interests as  part  of  a statutory\r\n\ndemutualization  constitute  \"policyholder  dividends\"  under\r\n\n  808  of the Internal Revenue Code.   If so, the insurer may\r\n\ntake   a  deduction   for   \"policyholder  dividends\"   under\r\n\n  805(a)(3).  Whether the  \"policyholder dividends\" deduction\r\n\nis available has great financial consequences for the company\r\n\nand   for  the   public  fisc.      This  question   involves\r\n\nconsideration  of the  scope  of the  \"policyholder dividend\"\r\n\nunder    808, as well as the broader relationship between the\r\n\ngeneral  corporate tax provisions  of the Code  (contained in\r\n\nSubchapter  C)  and  the   Code's  insurance  tax  provisions\r\n\n(contained in Subchapter L).  \r\n\n          In this case, UNUM Corp. (\"UNUM\"), the demutualized\r\n\nsuccessor   to  Union  Mutual   Life  Insurance  Co.  (\"Union\r\n\nMutual\"),  seeks  a  tax  refund  based  on  a  \"policyholder\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ndividends\" deduction of  over $652 million.  This  sum, which\r\n\nUNUM was required to distribute to its policyholders by state\r\n\nlaw,  represents  the  value  of  Union Mutual's  accumulated\r\n\nsurplus.   See Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 24-A,    3477 (West\r                          \r\n\n1996).  \r\n\n          UNUM's  principal  argument  is that  the  cash and\r\n\nstock  distributed  during   the  demutualization  constitute\r\n\n\"policyholder dividends\" under the plain language of   808(b)\r\n\nand thus are  deductible under    805.   UNUM further  argues\r\n\nthat,  beyond the statute's  plain language,  the legislative\r\n\nhistory and public policy behind the Code's treatment of life\r\n\ninsurance companies support this result.\r\n\n          The   IRS  argues   that   general  corporate   tax\r\n\nprovisions apply  to insurance  companies in  the absence  of\r\n\nspecific provisions to  the contrary in the  Code's insurance\r\n\ntax  section, and that, under those corporate tax provisions,\r\n\nUNUM is not entitled to any deduction for its reorganization.\r\n\nThe  IRS  argues that  nothing  in   808  or  its legislative\r\n\nhistory   indicates  that   Congress  envisioned      808  as\r\n\nencompassing    capital   transactions    such   as    UNUM's\r\n\ndemutualization.   Rather, placed in proper context,   808 is\r\n\nnot  relevant to the value-for-value exchanges for which UNUM\r\n\nseeks a deduction.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The  district   court  entered  judgment   for  the\r\n\ngovernment  in UNUM's  suit  for  a refund.    We affirm  the\r\n\njudgment of the district court.\r\n\n                              I\r                                          I\r\n\n          This  appeal  involves only  questions  of law;  we\r\n\nexercise  de  novo  review.

Background\r                          \r\n\n          Demutualization has  become increasingly  common in\r\n\nthe insurance industry.  More  than 200 mutual life insurance\r\n\ncompanies  have  demutualized  since 1930.    See  S. Preston\r                                                             \r\n\nRicardo,  The Deductibility  of Policyholder  Dividends: UNUM\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp. v.

Between\r                                  \r\n\n1954 and 1981,  the number of  mutual insurers declined  from\r\n\n171  to  135; during  the  same  time,  the number  of  stock\r\n\ninsurers increased from 661 to 1,823.

Presently,  at  least  forty-one states  have\r\n\nspecific statutes that provide for demutualization of  mutual\r\n\nlife  insurers.  Alexander M. Dye, Distributing Consideration\r                                                                         \r\n\nto Policyholders,  in Demutualization  of Life Insurers,  648\r                                                                   \r\n\nPLI/Comm 75,  78  (1993).   Only Hawaii  and Idaho  expressly\r\n\nprohibit  direct mutual  to stock  conversion, although  they\r\n\nstill permit demutualization through the  alternate method of\r\n\nbulk reinsurance conversion.   See Clinton, supra, at  673 n.\r                                                             \r\n\n116.    Every  state,  including  those  that  lack  specific\r\n\ndemutualization statutes,  permits  at  least  some  form  of\r\n\ndemutualization.  See id.  \r                                     \r\n\n          There  are three  usual types  of  mutual to  stock\r\n\nconversions:  a  statutory  conversion  whereby  the  insurer\r\n\ndirectly converts its form of  business, merger with a  stock\r\n\ninsurer,  and  bulk  reinsurance  of  the   mutual  company's\r\n\npolicies.   See id. at 660-61.   This case  only concerns the\r                               \r\n\nfirst  type of conversion: a statutory conversion, in which a\r\n\nmutual company  alters its  organizational form  to become  a\r\n\nstock insurer by redistributing all the mutual policyholder's\r\n\nownership interest in the mutual insurer into shares of stock\r\n\nin a new stock corporation.  \"This type of reorganization may\r\n\nproperly  be  regarded  as a  reorganization  of  the company\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nbecause the  policyholders are  exchanging membership  in the\r\n\nmutual for shares in the new corporation.\"  Id. at 660.\r                                                           \r\n\n          By  demutualizing,   mutual  insurers   can  obtain\r\n\ncertain  advantages  available  to  stock  insurers.    Stock\r\n\ncorporations  are better able  to raise capital  because they\r\n\nmay sell  stock on the  equity markets.  See  id. at 666-671.\r                                                             \r\n\nStock companies can more easily diversify their operations by\r\n\ncreating   upstream   holding   companies   which   can   own\r\n\nsubsidiaries engaged in other businesses.  See id. at 671-72.\r                                                              \r\n\nThey  can  also  create  incentives  for superior  management\r\n\nperformance through stock  option plans.  See  id. at 672-74.\r                                                              \r\n\nMutual  insurers can only raise capital by retaining earnings\r\n\nor charging  excess premiums,  and are  generally subject  to\r\n\ncomprehensive  regulation   by  state  authorities.     These\r\n\nlimitations can hinder  their ability to grow  and diversify.\r\n\nSee id. at 666.\r                   \r\n\n          Much is at stake in this process.  Mutual insurance\r\n\ncompanies have  historically lagged behind  stock insurers in\r\n\ngrowth of assets and capital.  Demutualization and subsequent\r\n\nstock sales may  improve a mutual insurer's  capital position\r\n\nand competitive  standing with  other insurers  and financial\r\n\ninstitutions.  Mutual  insurers naturally want to  contend in\r\n\nthe  increasingly   competitive  and   deregulated  financial\r\n\nservices   markets.       Many    mutual   insurers    regard\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndemutualization as an important  step toward bolstering their\r\n\nfinancial strength and flexibility.\r\n\nB.  Facts\r                     \r\n\n          Union  Mutual, based in  Maine, was organized  as a\r\n\nmutual  insurance company in  1848.  Union  Mutual's business\r\n\nwas  selling various types of insurance and annuity products.\r\n\nAs a  mutual company, Union Mutual had no stock and was owned\r\n\nby   its   participating   policyholders.1      Policyholders\r\n\ncontributed to Union Mutual's surplus by paying premiums that\r\n\nexceeded the actuarial cost of their policy coverage.  \r\n\n          In  1984,  Union  Mutual's  management  decided  to\r\n\nreorganize the company  as a stock  insurer.  The  management\r\n\ndecided that the  company would gain four  principal business\r\n\nadvantages from  this conversion:   an  increased ability  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Mutual life  insurance companies  do not  raise money  by\r\nissuing capital stock, but rather by charging policyholders a\r\n\"redundant  premium\"  that  exceeds  the  amount  actuarially\r\nanticipated to pay the  policy's benefits and expenses.   The\r\nexcess portions of these premiums are  accumulated, retained,\r\nand invested as \"surplus\". \r\n    A mutual insurer's  accumulated surplus is the  excess of\r\nassets over  liabilities.   Such an excess  results from  the\r\naccumulation of  redundant premiums  and investment  earnings\r\nover the life  of the company.  Surplus  generally belongs to\r\nthe  mutual   insurer's  members   in  proportion  to   their\r\ncontributions,  and  is generally  returned  to policyholders\r\nthrough policyholder dividends. \r\n    Mutual insurers  are thus owned  by their  policyholders.\r\nPolicyholders in mutual  companies are denominated  \"members\"\r\nof the  company; their ownership  rights in  the company  are\r\ntheir \"membership interests\".   Members  of mutual  insurance\r\ncompanies have  many of  the same  rights as stockholders  in\r\ncorporations, including  the right to  vote and the  right to\r\nresidual surplus upon liquidation. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nraise  capital, greater  flexibility  to  diversify into  new\r\n\nmarkets, an increased accountability for company  performance\r\n\nby management, and an enhanced ability to attract and  retain\r\n\nkey personnel.\r\n\n          Under  Maine law, Union Mutual was not permitted to\r\n\nimplement its conversion  plan until the plan was approved by\r\n\nthe  Maine Superintendent of  Insurance.  See  Me. Rev. Stat.\r                                                         \r\n\nAnn.  tit.  24-A,    3477 (West  1996).    Maine  law imposes\r\n\nseveral conditions that  a demutualization plan must  satisfy\r\n\nin  order to receive  approval by the  Superintendent.  These\r\n\ninclude, inter alia, (1) that the company pay policyholders a\r                               \r\n\n\"fair  and equitable\" amount for their ownership interests in\r\n\nthe company, (2) that the \"equity share\" of each policyholder\r\n\nbe determined under a fair and reasonable formula  based upon\r\n\nthe  insurer's  entire  surplus  as  stated  in  a  financial\r\n\nstatement  filed  with  the  Superintendent,   (3)  that  the\r\n\nconversion plan give each member of the demutualizing insurer\r\n\na preemptive right to  acquire his or her  proportionate part\r\n\nof the proposed  capital stock of the new  stock company, (4)\r\n\nthat the plan  provide for payment  to each member of  his or\r\n\nher entire equity  share in the insurer, with  the payment to\r\n\nbe made  in cash or stock of the  stock company, and (5) that\r\n\npolicyholders entitled to  receive stock or cash  include all\r\n\npolicyholders  within three years prior  to the date the plan\r\n\nwas submitted for approval to the Superintendent.  See id.  \r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          On December 14, 1984, Union Mutual submitted a plan\r\n\nof  recapitalization and  conversion  to the  Superintendent.\r\n\nUnion Mutual amended  the plan several  times in response  to\r\n\nrulings  by the  Superintendent.   On  July  11, 1986,  Union\r\n\nMutual submitted its fourth and final amended plan, which was\r\n\napproved by the Superintendent on August 8, 1986.\r\n\n          The approved  plan of  conversion may  be generally\r\n\ndescribed as  follows.  A  holding company was formed  to own\r\n\nall the  stock of  the  new stock  company.   Those who  were\r\n\n\"eligible  policyholders\"2   transferred  their   \"membership\r\n\ninterests\" in Union Mutual to the holding company in exchange\r\n\nfor stock  in the  holding company.   \"Membership  interests\"\r\n\nwere defined in the conversion plan as: \r\n\n          [A]ll  the rights  or  interests of  each\r\n          policy  and  contract   holder  of  Union\r\n          Mutual including, but not limited to, any\r\n          right to vote, any rights which may exist\r\n          with  regard  to  the  surplus  of  Union\r\n          Mutual not apportioned  by the Board  for\r\n          policyholder dividends, and any rights in\r\n          liquidation  or  reorganization  of Union\r\n          Mutual, but shall  not include any  other\r\n          right    expressly    conferred    by   a\r\n          policyholder's   insurance    policy   or\r\n          contract.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  \"Eligible policyholders\"  were generally  defined in  the\r\nconversion  plan as all Union Mutual policyholders during the\r\nthree years prior to December 31, 1984. \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          Eligible  policyholders  who   qualified  as  \"cash\r\n\noption eligible policyholders\"3 could elect to exchange their\r\n\nmembership interests for cash instead of stock.  The  holding\r\n\ncompany,  after obtaining 100% of the membership interests in\r\n\nUnion  Mutual, exchanged the membership interests for 100% of\r\n\nthe shares  of the newly  formed stock insurer.   The holding\r\n\ncompany  sold stock not  issued to policyholders  to insiders\r\n\nand the general public.  At  the conclusion of the Plan, UNUM\r\n\nLife Insurance Co. (\"UNUM Life\"), the  new stock company, was\r\n\na wholly owned subsidiary of UNUM, the holding company.  UNUM\r\n\nwas  in  turn  owned by  former  Union  Mutual policyholders,\r\n\ninsiders, and members of the general public.\r\n\n          The approved plan included an actuarial formula for\r\n\ncalculating the consideration to be paid to each policyholder\r\n\nin  exchange  for his  or  her membership  interest  in Union\r\n\nMutual.  This figure, denominated each policyholder's \"equity\r\n\nshare\" in Union Mutual, was  defined as \"the dollar amount of\r\n\nthat part of Union Mutual's Adjusted Surplus attributable to\"\r\n\nthe  particular policyholder.    Each policyholder's  \"equity\r\n\nshare\"  comprised two components:   a \"minimum  equity share\"\r\n\nand the individual's \"contribution to statutory surplus\".  On\r\n\nDecember  31,  1985,  the  day  Union  Mutual  presented  its\r\n\nconsolidated   balance   sheet  for   final  review   by  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  \"Cash  option  eligible   policyholders\"  were  generally\r\ndefined in the  conversion plan as policyholders  with equity\r\nof less than $2,500 in Union Mutual. \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nSuperintendent,   Union   Mutual's   adjusted   surplus   was\r\n\n$652,050,097.4    Based   on  that  figure,  Union   Mutual's\r\n\nmanagement determined that each policyholder should receive a\r\n\nper capita amount  of $612.25 as the  \"minimum equity share\".\r\n\nThe  \"contribution to statutory surplus\" varied by individual\r\n\npolicyholder.   The  formula for  computing  a policyholder's\r\n\n\"equity share\" that is referred  to in the plan of conversion\r\n\nreveals this two-component scheme.\r\n\n          The plan of  conversion also provided for  creation\r\n\nof  an accounting  mechanism known  as  a Participation  Fund\r\n\nAccount (\"PFA\").   The PFA created the  functional equivalent\r\n\nof a  closed block5 and was allocated  assets which, together\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Surplus can be  measured by  either statutory  accounting\r\nprinciples  or   generally  accepted   accounting  principles\r\n(\"GAAP\").     The  difference  between  the  two  methods  is\r\nprimarily one of  timing:  the costs of  selling policies are\r\nfully  charged  when  incurred   under  statutory  accounting\r\nprinciples, but are  amortized over the expected  life of the\r\npolicies   under  GAAP.     UNUM's  accumulated   surplus  of\r\n$652,050,097 was calculated under GAAP. \r\n    In UNUM's  demutualization plan, \"surplus\" was defined as\r\n\"the  amount of the  surplus of Union Mutual  as shown by its\r\nfinancial  statement  as  of   the  Computation  Record  Date\r\n(December 31, 1985) filed with the Superintendent, as  may be\r\nconfirmed or adjusted  in the event of an  examination by the\r\nSuperintendent, including all voluntary  reserves but without\r\ntaking into  account the  value of  nonadmitted assets  or of\r\ninsurance business in force.\"  \r\n\n5.  Some states protect the policyholders by requiring that a\r\nmutual insurer  establish a \"closed  block\" of business  as a\r\ncondition of  demutualization.   See N.Y.  Ins. Laws.    7312\r                                                \r\n(West 1997);  40 Pa. Cons.  Stat. Ann.    915-A (West  1997).\r\nSuch statutes generally require the mutual insurer's policies\r\nand contracts in  force at the time of  the reorganization be\r\nplaced by the reorganized insurer  into a \"closed block\" into\r\nwhich  the insurer must  allocate assets that,  together with\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nwith   premiums  from   the   participating  policies,   were\r\n\nactuarially sufficient to pay policy  claims and policyholder\r\n\ndividends.   Under the  conversion  plan, the  amount of  the\r\n\nassets in the PFA could not be distributed to stockholders of\r\n\nthe demutualized insurer.  As with  a closed block, it had to\r\n\nbe  invested  and used  for  the  exclusive  benefit  of  the\r\n\npolicyholders.  The PFA was  designed with the aim that Union\r\n\nMutual's policyholders would continue to receive policyholder\r\n\ndividends  after the  demutualization at  the  same level  as\r\n\nbefore, even though policyholders and stockholders would have\r\n\ncompeting claims on  the earning and profits  of the company.\r\n\nThe  PFA thus  was meant to  assure policyholders  that their\r\n\nreasonable expectations about the  investment value of  their\r\n\npolicies would continue to be met. \r\n\n          The   creation  of   the  PFA   was  an   important\r\n\nconsideration in the Superintendent's decision to approve the\r\n\ndemutualization plan.  In  his Final Decision and Order,  the\r\n\nSuperintendent discussed  the PFA at  some length,  observing\r\n\nthat Union  Mutual policyholders  had  bought their  policies\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nrevenue, are sufficient to pay policy claims and policyholder\r\ndividends.   Thereafter, the  insurer may not  distribute any\r\nearnings   or  proceeds  developed   within  that   block  to\r\nstockholders.   The closed  block must  be  operated for  the\r\nexclusive  benefit of  the  included policies  and contracts,\r\ndistributions being for policyholder  dividend purposes only.\r\nSee id.; Dye, supra at 115-116.  \r                               \r\n    A PFA may  be required as a condition  of demutualization\r\nin states  which do not  require a closed  block.  The  Maine\r\ndemutualization statute does not require a closed block.  See\r                                                                         \r\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A,   3477 (West 1996).\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nwith  an understanding that policy costs would be continually\r\n\nadjusted through  dividends reflecting Union  Mutual's actual\r\n\nexperience.    The  Superintendent  also  noted   that,  when\r\n\npurchasing their policies, policyholders based their dividend\r\n\nexpectations on dividend illustrations shown to them by Union\r\n\nMutual that were  in turn based on the  dividends the company\r\n\nhad  been paying pursuant  to the dividend  scales current at\r\n\nthe time of purchase.  The Superintendent concluded:\r\n\n          Even  though  these  \"illustrations\" were\r\n          not  guarantees that  dividends would  be\r\n          paid,   Union   Mutual,    in   practice,\r\n          typically  paid  dividends  in accordance\r\n          with these  scales.    Based  upon  these\r\n          illustrations and  upon actual  practice,\r\n          policyholders  expect   that  they   will\r\n          continue  to receive  these dividends  as\r\n          long  as  their  policies are  in  force.\r\n          Therefore, I find it appropriate that the\r\n          Plan, by creating a mechanism such as the\r\n          PFA,  supports   these  expectations   of\r\n          future dividends.\r\n\nThat the PFA would maintain these expectations was, according\r\n\nto the Superintendent,  critical to the acceptability  of the\r\n\nconversion plan.\r\n\n          Union  Mutual implemented its plan of conversion on\r\n\nNovember 14, 1986.  To the 105,098 Eligible Policyholders who\r\n\nselected   the   Cash   Option,   Union  Mutual   distributed\r\n\n$129,129,082.       To   the   remaining    58,561   Eligible\r\n\nPolicyholders, Union Mutual distributed 20,489,072 shares  of\r\n\nUNUM stock.  This  stock was assessed as having a fair market\r\n\nvalue of $25.20 per share, making the total value of the UNUM\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nstock  distributed  under  the Plan  equal  to  $522,471,336.\r\n\nUnion  Mutual also distributed an additional $609,396 in cash\r\n\nto  compensate  policyholders  for  the  value of  fractional\r\n\nshares created  by the conversion  formula.  In  total, Union\r\n\nMutual distributed $652,209,814 to the Eligible Policyholders\r\n\nduring the demutualization.\r\n\n          Prior to the demutualization,  on October 12, 1984,\r\n\nUnion Mutual's  tax counsel had  asked the IRS for  a private\r\n\nletter  ruling  on  the  tax  treatment  of  the  conversion.\r\n\nContrary to the position taken by UNUM now, Union Mutual then\r\n\nsought  to convince  the IRS  that the  stock distributed  to\r\n\npolicyholders in exchange  for their membership  interests in\r\n\nUnion  Mutual would constitute tax free exchanges under   351\r\n\nof the Code.  UNUM also  sought to persuade the IRS that  the\r\n\nexchange  of the membership interests received by the holding\r\n\ncompany for  common  stock of  the  new stock  company  would\r\n\nconstitute a tax free recapitalization under   368(a)(1)(E).\r\n\n          In  support of these positions, Union Mutual made a\r\n\nsubmission to  the IRS  on March 25,  1985 stating  that \"the\r\n\nequity interest  of Union Mutual's policyholders resemble the\r\n\nrights  of stockholders in a corporation and have substantial\r\n\nvalue.\"    The  submission further  stated  that  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt, in Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated Group, 315 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n194  (1942),  had  characterized  a  recapitalization   as  a\r\n\n\"reshuffling of a  capital structure within the  framework of\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nan  existing corporation,\" Id. at 202, and argued that \"[t]he\r                                          \r\n\nexchange of evidences  of ownership interest in  Union Mutual\r                                 \r\n\nargues  for the exchange being treated as a recapitalization\"\r\n\nunder the Supreme Court's characterization.  Id. (emphasis in\r                                                            \r\n\noriginal).\r\n\n          Union  Mutual made another submission to the IRS on\r\n\nNovember  8, 1985,  discussing whether  the  exchange of  the\r\n\nmembership interests  for cash or  stock would be  treated as\r\n\nnondeductible  redemptions  of   stock  under    302  or   as\r\n\ndeductible  \"policyholder dividends\"  under   808  and   805,\r\n\nalthough UNUM did not specifically ask for a letter ruling on\r\n\nthat subject at that time.\r\n\n          On  December 16, 1986,  the IRS issued  its private\r\n\nletter  ruling to  Union  Mutual  regarding  the  proper  tax\r\n\ntreatment of the demutualization.  See Priv. Ltr. Rul. 87-11-\r                                                  \r\n\n121 (December 16,  1996).  The letter ruling  stated that the\r\n\nexchange  between   the   policyholders  and   UNUM  of   the\r\n\npolicyholders' membership interests in Union Mutual for  UNUM\r\n\nstock was  a tax-free  exchange under    351.   See id.   The\r                                                                   \r\n\nruling also  stated that the  exchange between UNUM  and UNUM\r\n\nLife, the  stock insurer that would succeed  Union Mutual, of\r\n\nthe  Union Mutual membership  interests for UNUM  Life voting\r\n\ncommon   stock   was  a   tax  free   recapitalization  under\r\n\n  368(a)(1)(E).  See id.   The ruling further stated that the\r                                    \r\n\ncash  distributed  to  policyholders  in  exchange  for their\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nmembership  interests  constituted  value-for-value transfers\r\n\nand    were,   accordingly,    properly   characterized    as\r\n\nnondeductible   redemptions  under     302,  not   deductible\r\n\n\"policyholder dividends\"  under    808 and    805.   See id.6\r                                                                        \r\n\nThe IRS  viewed the stock-for-membership  interest exchanges,\r\n\nin  contrast, as non-recognition  exchanges subject to    351\r\n\n(no gain or loss recognized to policyholders),   354 (no gain\r\n\nor   loss  recognized  to  holding  company  on  exchange  of\r\n\nmembership  interests to converted  company for stock,  and  \r\n\n1032 (no gain or loss recognized to either holding company or\r\n\nconverted company on receipt of property for stock).\r\n\n          On its 1986 consolidated federal income tax return,\r\n\nUNUM  did not claim  a \"policyholder dividend\"  deduction for\r\n\nthe  cash and stock  distributed to policyholders  during the\r\n\ndemutualization.  UNUM had entered into an agreement with the\r\n\nIRS extending  the  time period  within which  the IRS  could\r\n\naudit the  1986 return,  after which UNUM  would be  given an\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The IRS has  not always held this view  regarding the tax\r\ntreatment  of  distributions  from  surplus  made  during   a\r\ndemutualization.    In  1983, the  IRS  issued  a non-binding\r\ntechnical advice memorandum addressing the demutualization of\r\na  mutual  casualty  insurer  through  merger  with  a  stock\r\ninsurer.   Tech. Adv. Mem.  8409003 (Nov. 4, 1983).   In this\r\nmemorandum, the IRS  took the view now advanced  by UNUM that\r\ncash  distributions  paid  out of  surplus  to  policyholders\r\nduring the demutualization  were policyholder dividends under\r\nthen   822(e)(2) and   822(c)(11).  In 1989, the IRS withdrew\r\nthis memorandum  without comment.   Tech.  Adv. Mem.  9010003\r\n(Nov. 13, 1989).   Because such memoranda are  nonbinding, we\r\ndo not  base  our  conclusions upon  them.    We  nonetheless\r\nrecognize  that the IRS  has not consistently  maintained the\r\npositions it presently advances in this appeal.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nadditional six months within which to decide whether to amend\r\n\nthe return to  claim a refund.  The IRS audit, which ended in\r\n\n1991, concluded that UNUM had properly characterized the cash\r\n\ndistributions as nondeductible  stock redemptions under   302\r\n\nand   the   stock   distributions   as   made   pursuant   to\r\n\nnonrecognition exchanges  of its  stock for  property.   UNUM\r\n\nthereafter  changed its view  of the proper  tax treatment of\r\n\nthe transaction by timely  amending its 1986 return to  claim\r\n\nthe   cash  ($129,738,478),  then  the  value  of  the  stock\r\n\n($522,471,336),  as deductible  policyholder dividends  under\r\n\n  808  and    805.   UNUM sought  a refund  in excess  of $77\r\n\nmillion.  The IRS denied these claimed deductions.  \r\n\n          In 1993,  UNUM filed  suit in  the district  court,\r\n\nseeking  deductions and  a refund  of the  $77 million.   The\r\n\ndistrict court ruled in favor of the government, holding that\r\n\nthe  cash and stock  distributions could not  be construed as\r\n\n\"policyholder dividends\" under   808.  UNUM appeals.\r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n          UNUM makes a  colorable but ultimately unpersuasive\r\n\nargument that  this appeal involves  only the narrow  task of\r\n\ninterpreting   808 and   805 of the Code.  UNUM would have at\r\n\nleast  a  plausible  argument  that  it  was  entitled  to  a\r\n\n\"policyholder dividend\" deduction if those  two sections were\r\n\nthe only  potentially relevant  Code sections  to this  case.\r\n\nBut we must construe the Code as a whole.

(citation and internal quotations omitted).\r               \r\n\n          We conclude that   808 and   805 do not govern this\r\n\ncase.     UNUM's   demutualization   constitutes  a   capital\r\n\ntransaction   and  is  accordingly  subject  to  the  general\r\n\ncorporate  tax rules  under Subchapter  C  which govern  such\r\n\ntransactions.   These  rules clearly  bar  any deduction  for\r\n\namounts distributed during a capital transaction.\r\n\nA.  Structural Overview\r                                   \r\n\n          Because  this case  involves the  interplay between\r\n\ntwo Subchapters  of the  Code, we  describe  them in  general\r\n\nterms.  Subchapter  C is a broadly applicable  section of the\r\n\nCode  which contains many of the Code's general corporate tax\r\n\nprovisions.  It applies to all corporations, including mutual\r\n\nand  stock insurance companies.  See   7701(a)(3) (\"When used\r                                                \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nin this title, . . . [t]he term 'corporation' includes .  . .\r\n\ninsurance companies.\");   7701(a)(8) (\"the term 'shareholder'\r\n\nincludes a member in an . . . insurance company.\").  \r\n\n          Subchapter C governs corporate capital transactions\r\n\nand   the  taxation   of  all  corporate   distributions  and\r\n\nadjustments,   including    the   organization,    operation,\r\n\nliquidation, and reorganization  of all corporate enterprises\r\n\nand  their distributions to shareholders and associates.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n   301-85.   Many general  rules in Subchapter  C as  well as\r\n\nadditional  rules in  other  sections  of  the  Code  contain\r\n\nlanguage that, by their literal terms, bar the deduction UNUM\r\n\nseeks.    Sections 162,   311,  354,  and  1032   apply  with\r\n\nparticular force.  We explain  these sections and discuss why\r\n\nthey apply later.\r\n\n          Subchapter  L, in  contrast,  is  a highly  focused\r\n\nsection  of  the  Code  which  specifically  governs  certain\r\n\naspects  of the  taxation of  life insurance companies.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\n   801-818.     Subchapter  L  enacts  a  special  scheme  of\r\n\ndetermining  the gross income, deductions, and taxable income\r\n\nof life insurance  companies, whether of the  stock or mutual\r\n\nvariety.   It  accommodates the unique  manner by  which life\r\n\ninsurance  companies  raise  and  distribute  capital.    One\r\n\npurpose  behind this parallel system of income calculation is\r\n\nto  determine  more  accurately the  taxable  income  of life\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ninsurance companies  than general  tax rules  otherwise would\r\n\npermit. \r\n\n          While  Subchapter  L applies  specifically  to life\r\n\ninsurance companies, the  existence of Subchapter L  does not\r\n\nexempt insurance companies  from the application of  the rest\r\n\nof the Code.   Subchapter L  at times specifically  displaces\r\n\notherwise  applicable rules.    For  example, life  insurance\r\n\ncompany taxable income is defined in   801 as \"life insurance\r\n\ngross  income\"  reduced   by  \"life  insurance   deductions\".\r\n\n  801(b).   \"Life  insurance gross  income\"  is  specifically\r\n\ndefined  in   803, not the generally applicable definition of\r\n\ngross  income  provided  in     61.    And  \"life   insurance\r\n\ndeductions\" are  specifically governed  by    804 and    805,\r\n\neven though    804 and   805 incorporate many  of the general\r\n\nrules  about deductions by reference.   But Subchapter L does\r\n\nnot alter general tax rules governing subjects not within its\r\n\nambit.   Specifically, Subchapter L does not exempt insurance\r\n\ncompanies  from the general corporate tax rules of Subchapter\r\n\nC  \"[e]xcept to the extent that [Subchapter L makes] specific\r\n\nprovisions.\"   S.

See id. at 246-47.  The taxpayer argued\r                                         \r\n\nthat the ceding commissions were analogous to certain agents'\r\n\ncommissions deductible  under   809  and should  be similarly\r\n\ndeductible.  See  id. at 249-50.  The IRS  responded that the\r                                 \r\n\nceding commissions were more properly characterized as a type\r\n\nof capital  expenditure  and should,  as  is usual  for  such\r\n\nexpenditures,  be  amortized  over  their  useful  life under\r\n\n  263.   See  id. at  252-53.   The  Court ruled  against the\r                             \r\n\ntaxpayer,  holding that   809  did not expressly  provide for\r\n\nthe requested  deduction and that    263 should apply  in the\r\n\nabsence  of a specific provision to the contrary.  See id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n260.  The taxpayer's argument, the Court stated, \r\n\n          at most proves only that Congress decided\r\n          to  carve out  an  exception for  agents'\r\n          commissions,     notwithstanding    their\r\n          arguable     character     as     capital\r\n          expenditures.   We would not take it upon\r\n          ourselves  to  extend that  exception  to\r\n          other        capital        expenditures,\r\n          notwithstanding  firmly  established  tax\r\n          principles    requiring   capitalization,\r\n          where Congress  has not provided  for the\r\n          extension.\r\n\nId. at 252.\r               \r\n\n          Under  the  rule  of   Colonial  American,  general\r                                                               \r\n\ncorporate tax provisions  of Subchapter C apply  to insurance\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ncompanies unless Subchapter  L makes a specific  provision to\r\n\nthe contrary.

Analysis of UNUM's arguments\r                                            \r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n          UNUM's  principal argument  is  that  the cash  and\r\n\nstock distributions constitute \"policyholder dividends\" under\r\n\nthe  plain meaning of    808,   808(b)(1) in  particular, and\r\n\nare therefore deductible under   805(a)(3).  Bolstering  this\r\n\nposition  are   two  overlapping   contentions:     (1)   the\r\n\nlegislative history and public  policy underlying the  Code's\r\n\nscheme of  life insurance taxation demonstrate  that Congress\r\n\nintended  the term  \"policyholder  dividend\"  to include  the\r\n\ndistributions  made  during UNUM's  demutualization;  and (2)\r\n\nbecause  \"policyholder dividends\"  are  broader than  classic\r\n\ncorporate  dividends,   \"policyholder  dividends\"   need  not\r\n\npossess  the essential characteristics of a dividend -- i.e.,\r\n\nthey  are not  subject  to the  constraints  which limit  the\r\n\nclassic definition of dividends.  We reject both arguments.\r\n\n          There is  no dispute  that   805(a)(3)  allows life\r\n\ninsurance companies  to deduct \"policyholder  dividends\" from\r\n\nincome.   Section 805(a)(3) expressly states: \"there shall be\r\n\nallowed the following deductions:  . . . --The  deduction for\r\n\npolicyholder  dividends.  . .  .\"      805(a)(3).   The  real\r\n\nquestion, rather,  is whether the definition of \"policyholder\r\n\ndividend\" in   808 encompasses the cash and stock distributed\r\n\nduring UNUM's demutualization.\r\n\n          In this regard,  UNUM's principal argument is  that\r\n\nthe plain meaning of   808  entitles it to deduct the amounts\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\ndistributed during the demutualization.7  We believe that, in\r\n\norder  to make this claim successfully, UNUM must demonstrate\r\n\nthat  the distributions satisfy  both   808(a)  and   808(b).\r\n\nSection 808(a) provides that:\r\n\n          [F]or  purposes of  this  part, the  term\r\n          \"policyholder    dividend\"   means    any\r\n          dividend  or   similar  distribution   to\r\n          policyholders in their capacity as such.\r\n\n  808(a).  Under   808(b)(1), upon which UNUM hinges the main\r\n\nbody of its argument, a \"policyholder dividend\" may include:\r\n\n          any amount paid or credited (including as\r\n          an increase in benefits) where the amount\r\n          is not fixed in  the contract but depends\r\n          on the  experience of the  company or the\r\n          discretion of the management.\r\n\n  808(b).  \r\n\n          UNUM asserts that the  distributions easily satisfy\r\n\n  808(a),  which, UNUM  claims,  merely emphasizes  the broad\r\n\nscope  of \"policyholder  dividends.\"   The  source of  UNUM's\r\n\nauthority  for this  claim is  unclear.   UNUM seems  to rely\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Section 808(a) and (b) provide in full:\r\n\n     (a) Policyholder dividend defined.--for purposes of this\r\npart,  the term \"policyholder dividend\" means any dividend or\r\nsimilar distribution to  policyholders in  their capacity  as\r\nsuch.\r\n     (b)  Certain  amounts  included.--For  purposes of  this\r\npart, the term \"policyholder dividend\" includes--\r\n          (1)  any amount paid  or credited (including  as an\r\n          increase in benefits) where the amount is not fixed\r\n          in  the contract but  depends on the  experience of\r\n          the company or the discretion of the management.\r\n          (2) excess interest,\r\n          (3) premium adjustments, and\r\n          (4) experience-rated refunds.\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nprincipally on Republic Nat'l Life Ins.

Reg.   1.811-2(a) (1997),\r\n\nwhich tracks the language of   808(a), as further evidence of\r\n\nthe  broad scope  of the  \"policyholder  dividend.\"   Because\r\n\n\"policyholder dividends\"  are \"expansive\", UNUM  argues, they\r\n\nnecessarily  encompass  the  amounts  distributed during  the\r\n\ndemutualization.   We are  not persuaded by  these arguments,\r\n\nwhich attempt  to sweep  the language  of   808(a)  under the\r\n\ntable.    Rather, we  think  that   808(a)  presents  a major\r\n\nobstacle, which UNUM fails to overcome.\r\n\n          UNUM  argues  that  the real  test  is  whether the\r\n\ndistributions satisfy    808(b).  UNUM focuses  its attention\r\n\non  the text  of   808(b)(1),  arguing:   (1) Nothing  in the\r\n\ninsurance  contracts  between  UNUM  and  its   policyholders\r\n\naddressed  the  amounts   due  to  the  policyholders   in  a\r\n\ndemutualization; therefore the amounts were \"not fixed in the\r\n\ncontract\"; (2) The cash was distributed out of Union Mutual's\r\n\naccumulated  surplus,  which  represents the  fruits  of  the\r\n\ncompany's considerable  business success since  its founding;\r\n\ntherefore  the amounts \"depend[ed]  on the experience  of the\r\n\ncompany\";  (3) Union Mutual's  management, though  subject to\r\n\nthe  supervision of the Maine Superintendent of Insurance and\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nobligated  to present  \"fair  and  equitable\"  terms  to  the\r\n\npolicyholder,  decided  the amounts  within that  range which\r\n\nwould be  paid to policyholders in exchange  for their equity\r\n\ninterests;  therefore,   the  amounts  were   based  \"on  the\r\n\ndiscretion  of  management.\"     The  combination   of  these\r\n\ncircumstances,  UNUM  argues,   satisfies  the  elements   of\r\n\n  808(b)(1),  and thus  the  distributions are  \"policyholder\r\n\ndividends\" deductible  under   805(a)(3),  regardless of  the\r\n\ngeneral corporate tax provisions contained in Subchapter C.\r\n\n          While   we  recognize   that  UNUM's   argument  is\r\n\nplausible,  we nonetheless  find  it  unpersuasive.    As  we\r\n\nexplain later,   808(b) describes categories of distributions\r\n\nthat may  constitute policyholder dividends provided that the\r\n\ndefinition  of   808(a)  is  met.   But  UNUM  has failed  to\r\n\nsatisfy  us  that  the  term  \"policyholder  dividend\"  under\r\n\n  808(a) includes value-for-value exchanges that occur during\r\n\na corporate  reorganization such  as this.   UNUM's  argument\r\n\nultimately suffers from a fundamental defect: it assumes that\r\n\nCongress wished to  ignore the context in which  the cash and\r\n\nstock distributions took place.   We later explain why UNUM's\r\n\narguments that  the distributions  fit within    808(a) fail.\r\n\nWe first set the stage as to why Subchapter C applies.\r\n\nD.

UNUM in turn\r\n\nexchanged the  policyholders' membership  interests in  Union\r\n\nMutual for stock in UNUM or cash.  UNUM was financially in no\r\n\nworse a  position after  \"paying out\" $522  million worth  of\r\n\nstock to implement the demutualization than it was before the\r\n\ntransaction  occurred.     What  changed  was  the   form  of\r\n\nownership,  precisely the  topic  which capital  transactions\r\n\ntypically  involve.8  As for the  $130 million distributed in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  UNUM acknowledged  that its demutualization was a capital\r\ntransaction  subject to  general corporate  tax  law when  it\r\nsubmitted its May  22, 1985 request to the IRS  for a private\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\ncash  to redeem  certain policyholders'  interests, UNUM  was\r\n\nleft  poorer.   But the  Code disallows  deductions for  such\r\n\ndistributions made in redemption.  See   311(a).\r                                                  \r\n\n          We find  that, because UNUM's  demutualization is a\r\n\ncapital transaction, it  is subject to the  general corporate\r\n\ntax provisions of Subchapter C unless UNUM carries its burden\r\n\nof showing an exception.  These provisions clearly prohibit a\r\n\ncompany from deducting cash or the value of stock distributed\r\n\nto  its policyholders in redemption of their equity interests\r\n\nin the company.  \r\n\n          Applying  Subchapter  C,  the  Code  would  clearly\r\n\ndisallow UNUM from taking a deduction on the cash distributed\r                                                             \r\n\nduring  the  demutualization.

The IRS  treated the  demutualization as  a\r\ncapital transaction in its response,  see Priv. Ltr. Rul. 87-\r                                                     \r\n11-121  (Dec.  16,  1986),  in which  it  confirmed  that the\r\ntransaction would  be  nontaxable under  those  sections  and\r\nfurther stated that  the cash distributions would  be treated\r\nas  nondeductible redemptions  under     302  and  the  stock\r\ndistributions would be  treated as non-recognition  exchanges\r\nunder   1032.   We do not  view this as precluding  UNUM from\r\nchanging  its position, but that UNUM thought it necessary to\r\nask  the IRS for a letter ruling on the general corporate tax\r\nimplications of its demutualization reflects UNUM's awareness\r\nthat its restructuring was subject to Subchapter C.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nshareholder ordinarily may  not receive a deduction  for that\r\n\npurpose.9  Section 311(a) states:\r\n\n          no  gain or loss shall be recognized to a\r\n          corporation  on  the  distribution,  with\r\n          respect to  its stock, of  its stock  (or\r\n          rights   to   acquire  its   stock),   or\r\n          property.\r\n\n  311(a).   Congress reinforced the  strength of this rule by\r\n\nenacting    162(l) (now    162(k))  after  the Fifth  Circuit\r\n\nrecognized  a narrow exception in Five Star Manufacturing Co.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The  Code treats the  membership interests held  by Union\r\nMutual's policyholders  as \"stock\".   See    7701(a)(7) (\"the\r                                                     \r\nterm 'stock' includes shares in an . . . insurance company\").\r\nThe  Code  also  treated  Union   Mutual's  policyholders  as\r\nstockholders in a  corporation.  See   7701(a)(8)  (\"the term\r                                                \r\n'shareholder'  includes  a  member  in  an  .  .  . insurance\r\ncompany.\").\r\n\n10.  Cf.

The  reference to \"this chapter\" is  to Chapter\r\n\nOne of the  Code (I.R.C.    1-1399), which  includes both the\r\n\ngeneral  corporate tax  provisions in  Subchapter  C and  the\r\n\ninsurance  tax provisions in Subchapter L.  While   162(k)(2)\r\n\ndoes  contain some exceptions to the  general rule,11 none of\r\n\nthese apply  to insurance  companies. By  its literal  terms,\r\n\ntherefore,    162  forecloses  any  deduction  for  the  cash\r\n\ndistributed by UNUM.12\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.

The legislative history of   162 supports the conclusion\r\nthat   162(k)  forecloses a deduction for UNUM  in this case.\r\nThe Committee Report suggests that Congress intended   162(l)\r\n(now    162(k))  to  be construed  broadly  to  foreclose any\r\ndeduction for payments in connection with redemptions, except\r\nfor those specifically enumerated in the statute.\r\n\n            The conferees intend that the denial of\r\n          deductibility will apply  to amounts paid\r\n          in connection with a purchase of stock in\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\n          The  Code is equally clear that UNUM may not deduct\r\n\nthe value  of the  stock distributed  in exchange  for equity\r                                    \r\n\ninterests.  Section 354(a) provides\r\n\n          No gain  or loss shall  be recognized  if\r\n          stock or  securities in  a corporation  a\r\n          party   to  a   reorganization  are,   in\r\n          pursuance of the  plan or reorganization,\r\n          exchanged solely for  stock or securities\r\n          in   such  corporation   or  in   another\r\n          corporation     a     party     to    the\r\n          reorganization.\r\n\n  354(a).    Section 354  thus  bars  any deduction  for  the\r\n\nexchange of UNUM stock for the membership interests  of Union\r\n\nMutual  pursuant to  the  conversion  plan.    And    1032(a)\r\n\nprovides\r\n\n          No  gain or loss shall be recognized to a\r\n          corporation  on the  receipt of  money or\r\n          property in exchange for stock (including\r\n          treasury stock) of such corporation. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          a  corporation,   whether  paid   by  the\r\n          corporation directly or indirectly, e.g.,\r\n          by  a  controlling  shareholder, commonly\r\n          controlled subsidiary or related party.\r\n            The  conferees  wish to  clarify  that,\r\n          while the phrase \"in  connection with [a]\r\n          redemption\" is  intended to  be construed\r\n          broadly, the provision is not intended to\r\n          deny a deduction for otherwise deductible\r\n          amounts paid in a transaction that has no\r\n          nexus  with  the  redemption  other  than\r\n          being proximate in time or arising out of\r\n          the same general circumstances.\r\n\nH.R.

In this  case,\r                        \r\nthere  is a  clearly established  nexus  in that  the payment\r\n\"does  .  .  . represent  consideration  for  the [membership\r\ninterests] or expense related to [their[ acquisition . . . .\"\r\nId. at 4257.\r               \r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\n  1032(a).   As is  the case with    162(k) and    311, these\r\n\nCode sections do  not contain provisions excluding  insurance\r\n\ncompanies from their scope.\r\n\nE.  Section 808\r                           \r\n\n          We  find   nothing  in     808  that   specifically\r\n\noverrides  these general rules.   Indeed, that   808 does not\r\n\neven mention these rules suggests that it may have nothing to\r                        \r\n\ndo with capital transactions altogether.  Congress  has  been\r\n\nexplicit in those situations  when it wished Subchapter  L to\r\n\nmodify  Subchapter C.   See   805(b) (modifying  the interest\r                                       \r\n\ndeduction under   163, the charitable contributions deduction\r\n\nunder   170,  the rules  for amortizable  bond premium  under\r\n\n  171, the net operating loss  deduction under   172, and the\r\n\ndividends received  deductions under     243-245).   Congress\r\n\ncould have done the same with the Code sections that directly\r\n\ngovern  UNUM's demutualization.  That Congress did not choose\r\n\nto do so strongly suggest that Congress wanted those sections\r\n\nto apply with full force.\r\n\n          Our   view  that   Congress  did  not   intend  the\r\n\ndemutualization process to be exempted from these general tax\r\n\nrules  is  strengthened  when  we  examine    808(a).    UNUM\r\n\nessentially  makes a  two-step  argument regarding    808(a):\r\n\n(1)  any distribution  which  fits  the  strict  language  of\r\n\n  808(b)  is a \"policyholder dividend\" for purposes of   808,\r\n\nregardless of the language of    808(a); and (2) because  the\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\ntransaction here  is a  \"policyholder dividend\"  under   808,\r\n\nUNUM is entitled to a deduction under   805(a)(3).  We reject\r\n\nthe first prong, so the second collapses accordingly.\r\n\n          UNUM argues  that the term  \"policyholder dividend\"\r\n\nunder    808 is  not  bound by  the constraints  that usually\r\n\ncharacterize dividends,  but includes  any distribution  that\r\n\ncan fit within the language of   808(b)(1):  \"any amount paid\r\n\nor credited  .  . .  where the  amount is  not  fixed in  the\r\n\ncontract but depends on the  experience of the company or the\r\n\ndiscretion of  the management.\"   We reject  this reading  of\r\n\n  808.  \r\n\n          Basic canons of  statutory construction require  us\r\n\nto  consider the language of   808(a) in construing   808(b).\r\n\nSee United States Nat'l Bank of Or. v.

This text may  be divided into  three components.\r\n\nThe \"[f]or the purposes of this  part\" language requires that\r\n\nthe definition of \"policyholder dividend\" has no force beyond\r\n\nPart  I  of  Subchapter L,  which  specifically  involves the\r\n\ntaxation  of  life  insurance companies;  thus     808 cannot\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\ngovern  a   transaction  basically  within  the   purview  of\r\n\nSubchapter C.   The  \"any dividend  or similar  distribution\"\r\n\nlanguage requires all \"policyholder dividends\" to possess the\r\n\nessential  characteristics of a  dividend.  Finally,  the \"to\r\n\npolicyholders  in their capacity  as such\" requires  that the\r\n\ndividend-like  distributions  be  based  on  the  contractual\r\n\nrelationship  between  the  policyholder  and  insurer.    We\r\n\ninterpret the  language of   808(a)  to mean exactly  what it\r\n\nsays.  Any  distribution by an  insurer to its  policyholders\r\n\nmust accordingly  bear  the essential  characteristics  of  a\r\n\ndividend and be based on the contractual relationship between\r\n\nthe  policyholder  and  insurer  in  order  to  qualify  as a\r\n\n\"policyholder dividend\".   And if   808(a) is  not satisfied,\r\n\nthen   808(b) cannot be satisfied either.\r\n\n          UNUM attempts  to circumvent  the plain  meaning of\r\n\n  808(a) by arguing  that the language of    316 specifically\r\n\nexempts \"policyholder  dividends\" from  the constraints  that\r\n\nbind typical corporate dividends.  Section 316(a) defines the\r\n\nterm \"dividend\" as follows.\r\n\n          For the  purposes of  this subtitle,  the\r\n          term \"dividend\" means any distribution of\r\n          property  made  by a  corporation  to its\r\n          shareholders .  . . out  of its  earnings\r\n          and profits of the taxable year . . . .\r\n\n  316(a).  By its terms, this definition of dividends applies\r\n\nto  Subtitle A,  28  U.S.C.     1-1563,  which  includes  the\r\n\nportion  of  the  Code governing  income  taxation.   Section\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\n316(b)  limits  the   extent  of  the  application   of  this\r\n\ndefinition:    The  definition  in  subsection\r\n               (a) shall not apply to the term\r\n               'dividend'    as    used     in\r\n               Subchapter L in  any case where\r\n               the reference  is to  dividends\r\n               of insurance companies  paid to\r\n               policyholders as such.\r\n\n  316(b).     UNUM  argues  that  the  language  of    316(b)\r\n\ndemonstrates that \"policyholder dividends\" have broader scope\r\n\nthan  \"dividends\" as  defined  in   316(a),  so  it would  be\r\n\nerroneous to conclude  that policyholder dividends should  be\r\n\ndeemed a  type of dividend as that term  is so defined. It is\r\n\ntrue that   316(b)  means that a policyholder  dividend under\r\n\n  808 is not  limited to distributions  out of the  insurer's\r\n\nearnings  and profits and may include additional amounts from\r\n\nother  sources.   But, UNUM's  assertion notwithstanding,  it\r\n\ndoes  not follow  that because  \"policyholder dividends\"  may\r\n\ninclude   more   than   classic  corporate   dividends   then\r\n\n\"policyholder   dividends\"   may  therefore   encompass   any\r\n\ndistribution to  policyholders regardless of  its context  or\r\n\npurpose.13  As Judge Carter appropriately noted, \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.

In that case, the court was referring to the fact that\r                \r\nthe  definition  of  \"policyholder   dividend\"  is  expansive\r\nrelative  to the \"classic  dividend\" definition,  adding that\r\n\"Congress  intended   to  include  more  than   just  classic\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n          The fact that \"policyholder dividend\" is,\r\n          in  certain  respects, broader  in  scope\r\n          than \"classic dividend\"  neither implies,\r\n          nor even suggests, that Congress intended\r\n          \"policyholder dividend\"  to be  construed\r\n          broadly. \r\n\nUNUM  Corp. v.  United States,  929 F.  Supp. 15, 20  n.6 (D.\r                                         \r\n\nMaine 1996).   Indeed,  the term  \"policyholder dividend\"  is\r\n\nstill a defined category.   That it possesses a broader scope\r\n\nthan the term \"dividend\" as defined in   316(a) suggests only\r\n\nthat  policyholder  dividends  are  different  from  ordinary\r\n\ncorporate dividends, not that  they are fundamentally  unlike\r\n\nthem. \r\n\nF.  The distributions are not dividends \r                                                   \r\n\n          This analysis suggests  that the lengthy debate  as\r\n\nto whether and how policyholder dividends  are like or unlike\r\n\ncorporate  dividends  is  largely  beside  the  point.    All\r\n\ndividends,  whether   policyholder  dividends   or  corporate\r\n\ndividends,  share  certain  essential  characteristics.   The\r\n\nfocus should be  on whether the stock  and cash distributions\r\n\nbear  the essential characteristics  which qualify them  as a\r\n\ndividend  of any stripe.   We  find that  the cash  and stock\r\n\ndistributions   at  issue  in   this  case  simply   are  not\r\n\n\"policyholder  dividends\" as  that  term is  defined, because\r\n\nthey are fundamentally not dividends or distributions similar\r\n\nto dividends as   808(a) requires.   Because they do not meet\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ndividends\" within policyholder dividends.  Id.  \r                                                          \r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\nthe   definition  of     808(a),    808(b)   is  superfluous.\r\n\nMoreover,  because  the   distributions  do   not  meet   the\r\n\ndefinition of   808(a), they are still subject to the general\r\n\ncorporate tax rules of Subchapter C, under which they may not\r\n\nbe deducted.14\r\n\n          The economics  of the  demutualization compel  this\r\n\nconclusion.  A dividend, even  a policyholder dividend, is  a\r\n\nunilateral distribution by a  company to its owners (who,  in\r\n\nthe case of mutual  life insurance companies, also  happen to\r\n\nbe customers).  No matter  how large, a dividend still leaves\r\n\nintact the owner's  equity interest in the company.   But the\r\n\ncash and stock distributions for which UNUM seeks a deduction\r\n\nwere not unilateral distributions by a company to its owners.\r\n\nBoth  were made  in  exchange  for policyholders'  membership\r\n\ninterests  in the former mutual  company.  Those who received\r\n\ncash  had their  equity interests  extinguished, transactions\r\n\namounting to classic  redemptions.  Those who  received stock\r\n\nhad   their  equity  converted  from  one  form  to  another,\r\n\ntransactions  which were  classic non-recognition  exchanges.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  While the holding in this case would be the same whether\r\nor not there  was a PFA,  the existence of  the PFA is  added\r\nevidence that  the economic  reality of  this transaction  is\r\nthat the conversion  of mutual membership interests  to stock\r\nis not a  policyholder dividend.  The PFA,  a crucial element\r\nin  the decision  of  the  Maine  Insurance  Commissioner  to\r\napprove this transaction,  is an  accounting mechanism  which\r\nrecognizes  (in   the  common   sense  of   the  word)   that\r\npolicyholder  dividend expectations  may  be segregated  from\r\nother ownership interests and the two are not equivalent.\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nNo  authority exists supporting the proposition that the term\r\n\n\"dividend\" encompasses such transactions.  \r\n\n          UNUM  nevertheless  argues that  the  distributions\r\n\nshould  still be  characterized  as \"policyholder  dividends\"\r\n\nbecause,  removed  from   context,  they  can   plausibly  be\r\n\nshoehorned into the text of   808(b)(1).  Judge Carter deftly\r\n\nexplained the fallacy of UNUM's argument as follows:\r\n\n          The  fact  that  Congress  intended  life\r\n          insurers  to   be  able  to   deduct  any\r\n          dividend-like       distribution       to\r\n          policyholders  to   the  extent   of  its\r\n          capital-like  component neither  implies,\r\n          nor  even  gives rise  to  the inference,\r\n          that Congress also intended life insurers\r\n          to be able to  deduct any distribution at\r\n          all  to  policyholder   that  contains  a\r\n          capital-like component  to the  extent of\r\n          that component.\r\n\nUNUM Corp. v. United States, 929 F. Supp. at 24 n.15.\r                                       \r\n\n          UNUM's  argument  clouds   the  reason  why     316\r\n\ndistinguishes policyholder from  regular corporate dividends.\r\n\nPolicyholder dividends typically include a capital  component\r\n\nin  addition  to earnings  and Congress  wished to  provide a\r\n\ndeduction for  that  component.    See     805(a)(3);     809\r                                                  \r\n\n(limiting the  extent of the  deduction).  But the  fact that\r\n\n\"policyholder  dividends\" may  include additional  components\r\n\ndoes not  change the  fact that  they must  still essentially\r\n\nconstitute  dividends as   808(a)  expressly requires.    The\r\n\nacknowledgement  reflected  in     316(b)  that  policyholder\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\ndividends  are more expansive than classic dividends does not\r\n\nalter this conclusion.\r\n\n          As    the   district    court   observed,    UNUM's\r\n\nbootstrapping argument ignores other sources of authority  on\r\n\nwhat  constitutes a \"dividend.\"  In  Hellmich v. Hellman, 276\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 233 (1928), the Supreme Court described a dividend as \r\n\n          the recurrent  return upon stock  paid to\r\n          stock holders by  a going corporation  in\r\n          the  ordinary course  of business,  which\r\n          does not reduce  their stock holdings and\r\n          leaves them in a position to enjoy future\r\n          returns upon the same stock.\r\n\nId. at 237.  Similarly, the Supreme Court in United States v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nDavis, 397  U.S.  301 (1970),  described  a \"dividend\"  as  a\r                 \r\n\ndistribution whose \r\n\n          effect is to  transfer the property  from\r\n          the company to its shareholder without  a\r\n          change in the relative interest or rights\r\n          of the stockholders.\r\n\nId.  at  313  (emphasis  added).    A  distribution  is  \"not\r               \r\n\nessentially equivalent to a  dividend\" if it \"result[s] in  a\r\n\nmeaningful  reduction   of  the   shareholder's  proportional\r\n\ninterest  in  the  corporation.\"    Id.   In  light  of  this\r                                                   \r\n\nauthority, we do not view distributions of stock or cash by a\r\n\nmutual  insurer  in  consideration  for  the  same  value  of\r\n\nownership interest in a mutual company to be a dividend under\r\n\nany  definition  of  the  term,   including  a  \"policyholder\r\n\ndividend\" under   808.\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\n          The  cash distribution is not a dividend or similar\r\n\nto a dividend  precisely because it did reduce  (to zero) the\r\n\nownership  interest of those  policyholders who received cash\r\n\nand left them in no  position to enjoy future returns, except\r\n\nas policyholders.   Cf. Hellmich,  276 U.S.  at 237.   It was\r                                            \r\n\nthus akin to  a nondeductible distribution in redemption.  In\r\n\ncontrast,  the stock  distribution  was  not  a  dividend  or\r\n\nsimilar to a dividend because it  was not in the nature of  a\r\n\n\"recurrent return upon stock paid to  stockholders by a going\r\n\ncorporation  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.\"    Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nRather, it  effected a  conversion of one  form of  equity to\r\n\nanother through a classic non-recognition exchange.\r\n\nG.  Other reasons\r                             \r\n\n          The  fact  that   UNUM's  demutualization  occurred\r\n\nthrough  a holding  company suggests  additional reasons  why\r\n\nUNUM  is  also  not,  for   other  reasons,  entitled  to   a\r\n\n\"policyholder  dividend\"  deduction.    First,  UNUM,   which\r\n\ndistributed  its stock to policyholders in exchange for their\r\n\nmembership   interests  in  Union  Mutual,  is  not  a  \"life\r\n\ninsurance   company\"  as   defined  in     816(a);   the  tax\r\n\nconsequences  of  the  stock  distributions  are  accordingly\r\n\nsubject to  general corporation tax provisions  in Subchapter\r\n\nC,  which disallow the  deduction.  See    354(a);   1032(a).\r                                                   \r\n\nSecond,  the  term  \"amount  paid\"  in    808(b)(1)  requires\r\n\ndistributions out of the company's surplus, whereas the stock\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\ndistribution came from the holding company.  Union Mutual did\r\n\nnot actually \"pay\"  anything in making that exchange.   It is\r\n\ntrue that UNUM is the sole owner of a life insurance company,\r\n\nbut having  structured the  demutualization as  it did,  UNUM\r\n\nmust   \"accept  the  consequences  of  [its]  choice.\"    See\r                                                                         \r\n\nCommissioner v. National Alfalfa  Dehydrating &amp; Milling  Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n417 U.S. 134, 149 (1974).15\r\n\n          Even  so, our  decision does  not rely on  the fact\r\n\nthat UNUM structured  its demutualization  through a  holding\r\n\ncompany.   Sections  354(a) and  1032(a)  would apply  to the\r\n\ndemutualization  regardless of its form, even if Union Mutual\r\n\ndistributed stock in the new stock company in direct exchange\r\n\nfor the membership interests of its policyholders.\r\n\n          UNUM's  best argument may  be the analogy  it draws\r\n\nbetween   a   mutual   insurance   company  liquidation   and\r\n\ndemutualization.    When   a  mutual  insurance  company   is\r\n\nliquidated,  its assets are  distributed to the policyholders\r\n\nand  those distributions  may  be  called  dividends.    This\r\n\nreorganization, the company  says, is functionally equivalent\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  The  one  aspect of  the  demutualization  involving the\r\nstock of a life insurance company was the transaction between\r\nthe  new stock  life  insurer,  UNUM  Life, and  the  holding\r\ncompany, UNUM, in which  the stock company exchanged 100%  of\r\nits  shares for  100%  of the  membership  interest in  Union\r\nMutual.  A transaction between two  corporations can not come\r\nwithin the rubric  of   808, which involves  distributions to\r\n\"policyholders  in  their  capacity as  such.\"    Instead, it\r\nconstitutes a recapitalization  under   368(a)(1)(E), as  the\r\nIRS confirmed, in  response to UNUM's request,  in Priv. Ltr.\r\nRul. 87-11-121.\r\n\n                             -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\nto such a  liquidation because Union Mutual no  longer exists\r\n\non   completion  of  the  demutualization.    There  are  two\r\n\nresponses.  The first is that the analogy does not work.  The\r\n\nvery nature of  a demutualization fundamentally distinguishes\r\n\nit  from  a liquidation  in  that  the  insurer is  still  in\r\n\nbusiness after the  conversion is complete.   In the  present\r\n\ncase, the  policyholders continue  to be  provided insurance,\r\n\nalbeit  through  a  different form  of  company  and  under a\r\n\ndifferent name.   Indeed,  ensuring that  Union Mutual  would\r\n\ncontinue to  meet its policyholders'  reasonable expectations\r\n\non  the  investment value  of  their  policies was  the  very\r\n\npurpose  of the  PFA, which calculated  the amount  of assets\r\n\nnecessary   to  pay   policy  claims,   provide  policyholder\r\n\ndividends,  and satisfy  whatever other  benefits accrued  to\r\n\npolicyholders under their insurance  contracts.  Notably, the\r\n\nMaine  Insurance  Commissioner  gave  his   blessing  to  the\r\n\ntransaction  only  on  being  assured  there  was  sufficient\r\n\ncapital  preserved,  together  with  premiums,  to  cover the\r\n\ninsured risks  in the future.   This  does not happen  in the\r\n\nusual  liquidation  and,  indeed,  demonstrates  that  UNUM's\r\n\ndemutualization cannot properly be so characterized. \r\n\n          Secondly,  even if the analogy were apt in general,\r\n\nwe  have little reason to think  Congress intended that final\r\n\ndistributions of all  assets to be  within the definition  of\r\n\n\"policyholder  dividends\"  under    808(a).   Congress  could\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\neasily  have provided for this deduction by enacting specific\r\n\nlanguage  to that  effect.   Had Congress  wanted to  provide\r\n\ninsurance companies with a  \"policyholder dividend\" deduction\r\n\nfor  any distribution  to  policyholders  not  fixed  in  the\r\n\ncontract,  it   could  simply   have  defined   \"policyholder\r\n\ndividend\"  as referring to \"any  distribution.\"  It would not\r\n\nhave  limited   the  definition  to  \"dividends   or  similar\r\n\ndistributions\" and  then left it to the insurance industry to\r\n\ndiscover massive deductions in the shadows of the statute.\r\n\n          Although  we think the plain meaning of   808 works\r\n\nagainst, and  not for,  UNUM, and mindful  of the  usual rule\r\n\nthat resort to  legislative history is inappropriate  in such\r\n\ncircumstances,  we  do  briefly  explain  UNUM's  policy  and\r\n\nlegislative  history argument.   Our  primary  purpose in  so\r\n\ndoing is to  determine whether there  is a clearly  expressed\r\n\nlegislative  intention  which  would  cause  us  to  question\r\n\napplication of the usual  rule.

A secondary reason  is to note\r\n\nthat UNUM's policy arguments are not implausible; they simply\r\n\ndo not carry  UNUM's burden of showing  clearly that Congress\r\n\nintended such a deduction.\r\n\n          In support  of its statutory argument,  UNUM offers\r\n\nan extended  account of  the legislative  history and  public\r\n\npolicy behind  the Code's  scheme of  life insurance  company\r\n\ntaxation.  UNUM argues that Congress specifically created the\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\n\"policyholder  dividend\"   deduction  to  equalize   the  tax\r\n\ntreatment  of  mutual insurers  relative  to  stock insurers.\r\n\nUnder  general tax  rules, stock companies  are not  taxed on\r\n\ncapital raised by  selling stock, but may  not deduct amounts\r\n\npaid to redeem  that stock.  (No  tax, no deduction)   At the\r\n\nsame time,  mutual insurers  must pay  income tax on  capital\r\n\nraised  by  charging  redundant  premiums;  but,  absent  the\r\n\npolicyholder dividend deduction, they  may not deduct amounts\r\n\npaid  to  return capital  to  policyholders,  which typically\r\n\noccur   through  policyholder  dividends.     (Tax,   but  no\r\n\ncorresponding  deduction)    By  creating  the   policyholder\r\n\ndividend deduction  in   805(a)(3),  UNUM explains,  Congress\r\n\nintended  to  create  symmetry  in  the  taxation  of  mutual\r\n\ninsurers and thus provide equal tax treatment for both mutual\r\n\nand stock insurers.\r\n\n          UNUM emphasizes the  expansiveness of \"policyholder\r\n\ndividends\"  by  contrasting  them  with  a \"return  premium\".\r\n\nReturn  premiums  are refunds  that  occur when  a  policy is\r\n\ncancelled,   where  the   amount  of  the   refund  generally\r\n\nrepresents that portion  of paid premiums not  applied to the\r\n\npurchase of coverage up to  the time of cancellation.  Robert\r\n\nA.  Keeton  &amp; Alan  I.  Widiss,  Insurance  Law: A  Guide  to\r                                                                         \r\n\nFundamental   Principles,  Legal   Doctrines,  &amp;   Commercial\r                                                                         \r\n\nPractices   5.11(d)(2)  (1988).   UNUM  explains  that  these\r                     \r\n\namounts are \"fixed in the contract\" in that they are based on\r\n\n                             -44-\r                                          44\r\r\n\nthe  terms of the contract.  \"Policyholder dividends\" are, in\r\n\ncontrast, any  amounts not fixed  in the contract,  i.e., any\r\n\ndistributions  from surplus (that depend on the experience of\r\n\nthe company  or the  discretion of  management) that  are not\r\n\nreturn premiums.\r\n\n          Under Subchapter L, UNUM explains, Congress divided\r\n\namounts  returned to  policyholders  into  the categories  of\r\n\n\"return  premiums\"  and  \"policyholder  dividend\".     Return\r\n\npremiums are  deductible, because  they contain  a return  of\r\n\npremiums.    Policyholder   dividends  are  also  deductible,\r\n\nbecause, like  return premiums, they  are in part  returns of\r\n\ncapital.  Policyholder dividends are only deductible in part,\r\n\nhowever,  because they  can also  contain  earnings from  the\r\n\ninvestment  of the  premiums  which  are nondeductible  under\r\n\ngeneral tax law.\r\n\n          To account for this, UNUM  argues, Congress created\r\n\nan  expansive definition of  \"policyholder dividend\" in   808\r\n\nand enacted   809  to control  the extent  of the  deduction,\r\n\nsince the expansive language does not admit limitation.  UNUM\r\n\nclaims that   809 is the sole mechanism by which policyholder\r\n\ndividends   should   be   limited,   not   through   judicial\r\n\nconstruction  of the scope of the definition of \"policyholder\r\n\ndividend\"  under   808.  Policyholder dividends should be, in\r\n\neffect,  any  distribution  that a  mutual  insurer  makes to\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                          45\r\r\n\npolicyholders out  of surplus  for any reason,  and only  the\r\n\nterms of   809 limit the reach of the deduction. \r\n\n          UNUM  argues that the  facts that  Congress created\r\n\nthe policyholder dividend deduction to achieve a tax symmetry\r\n\nand that Congress accordingly defined \"policyholder dividend\"\r\n\nto  possess broad  scope necessarily  compels  the conclusion\r\n\nthat \"policyholder dividends\" must even include distributions\r\n\nto  policyholders that are  fundamentally not dividends.   We\r\n\nbelieve  this  conclusion  is  unsupported  by  the  text  or\r\n\npolicies  underlying the  statute.   UNUM's  analysis of  the\r\n\nlegislative  history   and  public   policy  underlying   the\r\n\ninsurance tax provisions  of the Code  suffers from the  same\r\n\nflaw  that undermines its  statutory argument.   Nothing UNUM\r\n\ncites  supports the  proposition that  Congress intended  the\r\n\nterm  \"policyholder dividends\"  to encompass  value-for-value\r\n\nexchanges  occurring   during  a   corporate  reorganization.\r\n\nUNUM's argument  fails not  because its  relies on  erroneous\r\n\nfacts, but rather because  those facts simply do  not support\r\n\nthe conclusions UNUM wishes to draw.\r\n\n          In  the  end,  the  mere  fact  that  \"policyholder\r\n\ndividends\"  are  not \"fixed\"  by  the terms  of  an insurance\r\n\ncontract does  not mean  that they  include any  distribution\r\n\nthat  a mutual  insurer  makes to  its  policyholders in  any\r\n\ncapacity.   Under   808(a),  in order  for a distribution  to\r\n\nqualify as  a \"policyholder dividend\",  the distribution must\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\noccur to policyholders  \"in their capacity as such\"  -- i.e.,\r\n\nin   their  capacity  as  policyholders,  not  owners.    The\r\n\ndistribution  must  also  fundamentally  be  a  \"dividend  or\r\n\nsimilar  distribution.\"   For the  reasons  explained in  the\r\n\nbalance of  the opinion, we  believe that the cash  and stock\r\n\ndistributions  made by UNUM were  not dividends.  Rather, the\r\n\ncash distribution constituted a nondeductible distribution in\r\n\nredemption, while the stock  distribution was part of a  non-\r\n\nrecognition exchange.  \r\n\n                             III\r                                         III\r\n\n          In  Colonial American,  the  Supreme Court  faced a\r                                           \r\n\ncase  similar to  this one.    As here,  the taxpayer  made a\r\n\ncolorable  argument   that  Subsection  L  provided  for  tax\r\n\ntreatment  that   general  tax   law  otherwise   prohibited.\r\n\nSimilarly,  the IRS  responded that  the  basic policies  and\r\n\nstructure of the Code defeated the taxpayer's  argument.  The\r\n\nSupreme Court, explaining its  decision in favor of the  IRS,\r\n\nstated:\r\n\n          It  cannot be denied that the language on\r\n          which   petitioner   relies,   taken   in\r\n          isolation, could be read to authorize the\r\n          tax treatment it seeks. .  . .  But  when\r\n          the statutory and  regulatory language is\r\n          parsed   more   carefully,   petitioner's\r\n          position  becomes dubious,  and when  the\r\n          language is  read against  the background\r\n          of  the statutory  structure, it  becomes\r\n          untenable.  \r\n\nColonial American, 491  U.S. at 257.

We do not believe  that\r                                       \r\n\nCongress intended  to conceal  in   808  a deduction  of this\r\n\nmagnitude.\r\n\n          INDOPCO  requires a taxpayer to carry the burden of\r                             \r\n\nproof that  it is entitled  to a claimed deduction.

This process, known as \"demutualization,\" often involves a conversion of the mutual policyholders' ownership interest in the old company into ownership interest in the form of stock in the new company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal raises important questions about the proper tax treatment of one form of demutualization:  whether stock and cash distributed to policyholders in exchange for their mutual ownership interests as part of a statutory demutualization constitute \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808 of the Internal Revenue Code.  If so, the insurer may take a deduction for \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 805(a)(3).  Whether the \"policyholder dividends\" deduction is available has great financial consequences for the company and for the public fisc.  This question involves consideration of the scope of the \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808, as well as the broader relationship between the general corporate tax provisions of the Code (contained in Subchapter C) and the Code's insurance tax provisions (contained in Subchapter L).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, UNUM Corp.  (\"UNUM\"), the demutualized successor to Union Mutual Life Insurance Co.  (\"Union Mutual\"), seeks a tax refund based on a \"policyholder dividends\" deduction of over $652 million.  This sum, which UNUM was required to distribute to its policyholders by state law, represents the value of Union Mutual's accumulated surplus.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit.  24-A, &#167; 3477 (West 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM's principal argument is that the cash and stock distributed during the demutualization constitute \"policyholder dividends\" under the plain language of &#167; 808(b) and thus are deductible under &#167; 805.  UNUM further argues that, beyond the statute's plain language, the legislative history and public policy behind the Code's treatment of life insurance companies support this result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS argues that general corporate tax provisions apply to insurance companies in the absence of specific provisions to the contrary in the Code's insurance tax section, and that, under those corporate tax provisions, UNUM is not entitled to any deduction for its reorganization.  The IRS argues that nothing in &#167; 808 or its legislative history indicates that Congress envisioned &#167; 808 as encompassing capital transactions such as UNUM's demutualization.  Rather, placed in proper context, &#167; 808 is not relevant to the value-for-value exchanges for which UNUM seeks a deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered judgment for the government in UNUM's suit for a refund.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Demutualization has become increasingly common in the insurance industry.  More than 200 mutual life insurance companies have demutualized since 1930.  See S. Preston Ricardo, The Deductibility of Policyholder Dividends:  UNUM Corp. v. United States, 50 Tax Law. 265, 265 (1996).  Between 1954 and 1981, the number of mutual insurers declined from 171 to 135;  during the same time, the number of stock insurers increased from 661 to 1,823.  Edward X. Clinton, The Rights of Policyholders in an Insurance Demutualization, 41 Drake L.Rev. 657, 659 n. 13 (1992).  Today, fewer than 80 mutual insurers have assets of over $100 million.  See William B. Dunham, Jr., et al., Introduction, in Demutualization of Life Insurers, 648 PLI/Comm 9, 16 (1993).  These figures suggest that mutual insurers are rapidly demutualizing, and that new insurance companies prefer the stock form at the outset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State legislatures have facilitated this demutualization process by passing statutes permitting such conversions.  Presently, at least forty-one states have specific statutes that provide for demutualization of mutual life insurers.  Alexander M. Dye, Distributing Consideration to Policyholders, in Demutualization of Life Insurers, 648 PLI/Comm 75, 78 (1993).  Only Hawaii and Idaho expressly prohibit direct mutual to stock conversion, although they still permit demutualization through the alternate method of bulk reinsurance conversion.  See Clinton, supra, at 673 n. 116.   Every state, including those that lack specific demutualization statutes, permits at least some form of demutualization.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three usual types of mutual to stock conversions:  a statutory conversion whereby the insurer directly converts its form of business, merger with a stock insurer, and bulk reinsurance of the mutual company's policies.  See id. at 660-61.   This case only concerns the first type of conversion:  a statutory conversion, in which a mutual company alters its organizational form to become a stock insurer by redistributing all the mutual policyholder's ownership interest in the mutual insurer into shares of stock in a new stock corporation.  \"This type of reorganization may properly be regarded as a reorganization of the company because the policyholders are exchanging membership in the mutual for shares in the new corporation.\"  Id. at 660.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By demutualizing, mutual insurers can obtain certain advantages available to stock insurers.  Stock corporations are better able to raise capital because they may sell stock on the equity markets.  See id. at 666-671.   Stock companies can more easily diversify their operations by creating upstream holding companies which can own subsidiaries engaged in other businesses.  See id. at 671-72.   They can also create incentives for superior management performance through stock option plans.  See id. at 672-74.   Mutual insurers can only raise capital by retaining earnings or charging excess premiums, and are generally subject to comprehensive regulation by state authorities.  These limitations can hinder their ability to grow and diversify.  See id. at 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much is at stake in this process.  Mutual insurance companies have historically lagged behind stock insurers in growth of assets and capital.  Demutualization and subsequent stock sales may improve a mutual insurer's capital position and competitive standing with other insurers and financial institutions.  Mutual insurers naturally want to contend in the increasingly competitive and deregulated financial services markets.  Many mutual insurers regard demutualization as an important step toward bolstering their financial strength and flexibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Mutual, based in Maine, was organized as a mutual insurance company in 1848.  Union Mutual's business was selling various types of insurance and annuity products.  As a mutual company, Union Mutual had no stock and was owned by its participating policyholders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Policyholders contributed to Union Mutual's surplus by paying premiums that exceeded the actuarial cost of their policy coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Union Mutual's management decided to reorganize the company as a stock insurer.  The management decided that the company would gain four principal business advantages from this conversion:  an increased ability to raise capital, greater flexibility to diversify into new markets, an increased accountability for company performance by management, and an enhanced ability to attract and retain key personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, Union Mutual was not permitted to implement its conversion plan until the plan was approved by the Maine Superintendent of Insurance.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &#167; 3477 (West 1996).  Maine law imposes several conditions that a demutualization plan must satisfy in order to receive approval by the Superintendent.  These include, inter alia, (1) that the company pay policyholders a \"fair and equitable\" amount for their ownership interests in the company, (2) that the \"equity share\" of each policyholder be determined under a fair and reasonable formula based upon the insurer's entire surplus as stated in a financial statement filed with the Superintendent, (3) that the conversion plan give each member of the demutualizing insurer a preemptive right to acquire his or her proportionate part of the proposed capital stock of the new stock company, (4) that the plan provide for payment to each member of his or her entire equity share in the insurer, with the payment to be made in cash or stock of the stock company, and (5) that policyholders entitled to receive stock or cash include all policyholders within three years prior to the date the plan was submitted for approval to the Superintendent.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 14, 1984, Union Mutual submitted a plan of recapitalization and conversion to the Superintendent.  Union Mutual amended the plan several times in response to rulings by the Superintendent.  On July 11, 1986, Union Mutual submitted its fourth and final amended plan, which was approved by the Superintendent on August 8, 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approved plan of conversion may be generally described as follows.  A holding company was formed to own all the stock of the new stock company.  Those who were \"eligible policyholders\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> transferred their \"membership interests\" in Union Mutual to the holding company in exchange for stock in the holding company.  \"Membership interests\" were defined in the conversion plan as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[A]ll the rights or interests of each policy and contract holder of Union Mutual including, but not limited to, any right to vote, any rights which may exist with regard to the surplus of Union Mutual not apportioned by the Board for policyholder dividends, and any rights in liquidation or reorganization of Union Mutual, but shall not include any other right expressly conferred by a policyholder's insurance policy or contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eligible policyholders who qualified as \"cash option eligible policyholders\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> could elect to exchange their membership interests for cash instead of stock.  The holding company, after obtaining 100% of the membership interests in Union Mutual, exchanged the membership interests for 100% of the shares of the newly formed stock insurer.  The holding company sold stock not issued to policyholders to insiders and the general public.  At the conclusion of the Plan, UNUM Life Insurance Co.  (\"UNUM Life\"), the new stock company, was a wholly owned subsidiary of UNUM, the holding company.  UNUM was in turn owned by former Union Mutual policyholders, insiders, and members of the general public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approved plan included an actuarial formula for calculating the consideration to be paid to each policyholder in exchange for his or her membership interest in Union Mutual.  This figure, denominated each policyholder's \"equity share\" in Union Mutual, was defined as \"the dollar amount of that part of Union Mutual's Adjusted Surplus attributable to\" the particular policyholder.  Each policyholder's \"equity share\" comprised two components:  a \"minimum equity share\" and the individual's \"contribution to statutory surplus\".  On December 31, 1985, the day Union Mutual presented its consolidated balance sheet for final review by the Superintendent, Union Mutual's adjusted surplus was $652,050,097.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Based on that figure, Union Mutual's management determined that each policyholder should receive a per capita amount of $612.25 as the \"minimum equity share\".  The \"contribution to statutory surplus\" varied by individual policyholder.  The formula for computing a policyholder's \"equity share\" that is referred to in the plan of conversion reveals this two-component scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan of conversion also provided for creation of an accounting mechanism known as a Participation Fund Account (\"PFA\").  The PFA created the functional equivalent of a closed block<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and was allocated assets which, together with premiums from the participating policies, were actuarially sufficient to pay policy claims and policyholder dividends.  Under the conversion plan, the amount of the assets in the PFA could not be distributed to stockholders of the demutualized insurer.  As with a closed block, it had to be invested and used for the exclusive benefit of the policyholders.  The PFA was designed with the aim that Union Mutual's policyholders would continue to receive policyholder dividends after the demutualization at the same level as before, even though policyholders and stockholders would have competing claims on the earning and profits of the company.  The PFA thus was meant to assure policyholders that their reasonable expectations about the investment value of their policies would continue to be met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The creation of the PFA was an important consideration in the Superintendent's decision to approve the demutualization plan.  In his Final Decision and Order, the Superintendent discussed the PFA at some length, observing that Union Mutual policyholders had bought their policies with an understanding that policy costs would be continually adjusted through dividends reflecting Union Mutual's actual experience.  The Superintendent also noted that, when purchasing their policies, policyholders based their dividend expectations on dividend illustrations shown to them by Union Mutual that were in turn based on the dividends the company had been paying pursuant to the dividend scales current at the time of purchase.  The Superintendent concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Even though these \"illustrations\" were not guarantees that dividends would be paid, Union Mutual, in practice, typically paid dividends in accordance with these scales.  Based upon these illustrations and upon actual practice, policyholders expect that they will continue to receive these dividends as long as their policies are in force.  Therefore, I find it appropriate that the Plan, by creating a mechanism such as the PFA, supports these expectations of future dividends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the PFA would maintain these expectations was, according to the Superintendent, critical to the acceptability of the conversion plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Mutual implemented its plan of conversion on November 14, 1986.  To the 105,098 Eligible Policyholders who selected the Cash Option, Union Mutual distributed $129,129,082.  To the remaining 58,561 Eligible Policyholders, Union Mutual distributed 20,489,072 shares of UNUM stock.  This stock was assessed as having a fair market value of $25.20 per share, making the total value of the UNUM stock distributed under the Plan equal to $522,471,336.  Union Mutual also distributed an additional $609,396 in cash to compensate policyholders for the value of fractional shares created by the conversion formula.  In total, Union Mutual distributed $652,209,814 to the Eligible Policyholders during the demutualization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the demutualization, on October 12, 1984, Union Mutual's tax counsel had asked the IRS for a private letter ruling on the tax treatment of the conversion.  Contrary to the position taken by UNUM now, Union Mutual then sought to convince the IRS that the stock distributed to policyholders in exchange for their membership interests in Union Mutual would constitute tax free exchanges under &#167; 351 of the Code.  UNUM also sought to persuade the IRS that the exchange of the membership interests received by the holding company for common stock of the new stock company would constitute a tax free recapitalization under &#167; 368(a)(1)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of these positions, Union Mutual made a submission to the IRS on March 25, 1985 stating that \"the equity interest of Union Mutual's policyholders resemble the rights of stockholders in a corporation and have substantial value.\"   The submission further stated that the Supreme Court, in Helvering v. Southwest Consolidated Corp., 315 U.S. 194, 62 S.Ct. 546, 86 L.Ed. 789 (1942), had characterized a recapitalization as a \"reshuffling of a capital structure within the framework of an existing corporation,\" Id. at 202, 62 S.Ct. at 552, and argued that \"[t]he exchange of evidences of ownership interest in Union Mutual argues for the exchange being treated as a recapitalization\" under the Supreme Court's characterization.  Id. (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Mutual made another submission to the IRS on November 8, 1985, discussing whether the exchange of the membership interests for cash or stock would be treated as nondeductible redemptions of stock under &#167; 302 or as deductible \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808 and &#167; 805, although UNUM did not specifically ask for a letter ruling on that subject at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1986, the IRS issued its private letter ruling to Union Mutual regarding the proper tax treatment of the demutualization.  See Priv.  Ltr. Rul. 87-11-121 (December 16, 1996).  The letter ruling stated that the exchange between the policyholders and UNUM of the policyholders' membership interests in Union Mutual for UNUM stock was a tax-free exchange under &#167; 351.  See id.   The ruling also stated that the exchange between UNUM and UNUM Life, the stock insurer that would succeed Union Mutual, of the Union Mutual membership interests for UNUM Life voting common stock was a tax free recapitalization under &#167; 368(a)(1)(E).  See id.   The ruling further stated that the cash distributed to policyholders in exchange for their membership interests constituted value-for-value transfers and were, accordingly, properly characterized as nondeductible redemptions under &#167; 302, not deductible \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808 and &#167; 805.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The IRS viewed the stock-for-membership interest exchanges, in contrast, as non-recognition exchanges subject to &#167; 351 (no gain or loss recognized to policyholders), &#167; 354 (no gain or loss recognized to holding company on exchange of membership interests to converted company for stock), and &#167; 1032 (no gain or loss recognized to either holding company or converted company on receipt of property for stock).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its 1986 consolidated federal income tax return, UNUM did not claim a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction for the cash and stock distributed to policyholders during the demutualization.  UNUM had entered into an agreement with the IRS extending the time period within which the IRS could audit the 1986 return, after which UNUM would be given an additional six months within which to decide whether to amend the return to claim a refund.  The IRS audit, which ended in 1991, concluded that UNUM had properly characterized the cash distributions as nondeductible stock redemptions under &#167; 302 and the stock distributions as made pursuant to nonrecognition exchanges of its stock for property.  UNUM thereafter changed its view of the proper tax treatment of the transaction by timely amending its 1986 return to claim the cash ($129,738,478), then the value of the stock ($522,471,336), as deductible policyholder dividends under &#167; 808 and &#167; 805.  UNUM sought a refund in excess of $77 million.  The IRS denied these claimed deductions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, UNUM filed suit in the district court, seeking deductions and a refund of the $77 million.  The district court ruled in favor of the government, holding that the cash and stock distributions could not be construed as \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808.  UNUM appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM makes a colorable but ultimately unpersuasive argument that this appeal involves only the narrow task of interpreting &#167; 808 and &#167; 805 of the Code.  UNUM would have at least a plausible argument that it was entitled to a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction if those two sections were the only potentially relevant Code sections to this case.  But we must construe the Code as a whole.  The Supreme Court admonished in Helvering v. N.Y. Trust Co., 292 U.S. 455, 54 S.Ct. 806, 78 L.Ed. 1361 (1934), that \"the expounding of a statutory provision strictly according to the letter without regard to other parts of the Act and legislative history [may] often defeat the object intended to be accomplished.\"  Id. at 464, 54 S.Ct. at 808-09.   Therefore, courts must</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>not look merely to a particular clause in which general words may be used, but ... take in connection with it the whole statute (or statutes on the same subject) and the objects and policy of the law, as indicated by its various provisions, and give to it such a construction as will carry into execution the will of the Legislature, as thus ascertained, according to its true intent and meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that &#167; 808 and &#167; 805 do not govern this case.  UNUM's demutualization constitutes a capital transaction and is accordingly subject to the general corporate tax rules under Subchapter C which govern such transactions.  These rules clearly bar any deduction for amounts distributed during a capital transaction.A. Structural Overview</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case involves the interplay between two Subchapters of the Code, we describe them in general terms.  Subchapter C is a broadly applicable section of the Code which contains many of the Code's general corporate tax provisions.  It applies to all corporations, including mutual and stock insurance companies.  See &#167; 7701(a)(3) (\"When used in this title, ... [t]he term 'corporation' includes ... insurance companies.\");  &#167;  7701(a)(8) (\"the term 'shareholder' includes a member in an ... insurance company.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subchapter C governs corporate capital transactions and the taxation of all corporate distributions and adjustments, including the organization, operation, liquidation, and reorganization of all corporate enterprises and their distributions to shareholders and associates.  See &#167;&#167; 301-85.  Many general rules in Subchapter C as well as additional rules in other sections of the Code contain language that, by their literal terms, bar the deduction UNUM seeks.  Sections 162, 311, 354, and 1032 apply with particular force.  We explain these sections and discuss why they apply later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subchapter L, in contrast, is a highly focused section of the Code which specifically governs certain aspects of the taxation of life insurance companies.  See &#167;&#167; 801-818.  Subchapter L enacts a special scheme of determining the gross income, deductions, and taxable income of life insurance companies, whether of the stock or mutual variety.  It accommodates the unique manner by which life insurance companies raise and distribute capital.  One purpose behind this parallel system of income calculation is to determine more accurately the taxable income of life insurance companies than general tax rules otherwise would permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Subchapter L applies specifically to life insurance companies, the existence of Subchapter L does not exempt insurance companies from the application of the rest of the Code.  Subchapter L at times specifically displaces otherwise applicable rules.  For example, life insurance company taxable income is defined in &#167; 801 as \"life insurance gross income\" reduced by \"life insurance deductions\".  &#167; 801(b).  \"Life insurance gross income\" is specifically defined in &#167; 803, not the generally applicable definition of gross income provided in &#167; 61.  And \"life insurance deductions\" are specifically governed by &#167; 804 and &#167; 805, even though &#167; 804 and &#167; 805 incorporate many of the general rules about deductions by reference.  But Subchapter L does not alter general tax rules governing subjects not within its ambit.  Specifically, Subchapter L does not exempt insurance companies from the general corporate tax rules of Subchapter C \"[e]xcept to the extent that [Subchapter L makes] specific provisions.\"   S.Rep. No. 291, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 39 (1959), reprinted in 1959-2 C.B. 770, 798.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court addressed the relationship between Subchapter C and Subchapter L in Colonial American Life Ins. Co. v. Commissioner, 491 U.S. 244, 109 S.Ct. 2408, 105 L.Ed.2d 199 (1989).  Colonial American involved the question of whether \"ceding commissions\" paid by a reinsurance company to a direct insurer under an indemnity reinsurance contract could be deducted in the year in which they were paid, or whether they had to be capitalized over the estimated life of the underlying policies.  See id. at 246-47, 109 S.Ct. at 2411.   The taxpayer argued that the ceding commissions were analogous to certain agents' commissions deductible under &#167; 809 and should be similarly deductible.  See id. at 249-50, 109 S.Ct. at 2412-13.   The IRS responded that the ceding commissions were more properly characterized as a type of capital expenditure and should, as is usual for such expenditures, be amortized over their useful life under &#167; 263.  See id. at 252-53, 109 S.Ct. at 2413-15.   The Court ruled against the taxpayer, holding that &#167; 809 did not expressly provide for the requested deduction and that &#167; 263 should apply in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary.  See id. at 260, 109 S.Ct. at 2418.   The taxpayer's argument, the Court stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>at most proves only that Congress decided to carve out an exception for agents' commissions, notwithstanding their arguable character as capital expenditures.  We would not take it upon ourselves to extend that exception to other capital expenditures, notwithstanding firmly established tax principles requiring capitalization, where Congress has not provided for the extension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 252, 109 S.Ct. at 2413-14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the rule of Colonial American, general corporate tax provisions of Subchapter C apply to insurance companies unless Subchapter L makes a specific provision to the contrary.  The question that this case poses, therefore, is whether the cash and stock distributions made by UNUM during its conversion are made specifically deductible by &#167; 808 and &#167; 805 of Subchapter L, notwithstanding the fact that they are clearly not deductible under &#167; 162, &#167; 311, &#167; 354, &#167; 1032 and other relevant provisions of the Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. UNUM's burden of proof</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a now \"familiar rule\" that an income tax deduction \" 'is a matter of legislative grace and that the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer.' \"  INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U.S. 79, 84, 112 S.Ct. 1039, 1043, 117 L.Ed.2d 226 (1992) (quoting Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 590, 593, 63 S.Ct. 1279, 1281-82, 87 L.Ed. 1607 (1943)).  Deductions must therefore be \"strictly construed\" and allowed \" 'only as there is clear provision therefor.' \"  Id. (quoting New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 435, 440, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790-91, 78 L.Ed. 1348 (1934)).  Subchapter L has been subject to narrow construction because its provisions \"give life insurance companies tax benefits over other taxpayers.\"  National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. United States, 385 F.2d 832, 833 (6th Cir.1967).  Thus it is UNUM's burden to demonstrate that the cash and stock distributed during the demutualization constitute deductible \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Analysis of UNUM's arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM's principal argument is that the cash and stock distributions constitute \"policyholder dividends\" under the plain meaning of &#167; 808, &#167; 808(b)(1) in particular, and are therefore deductible under &#167; 805(a)(3).  Bolstering this position are two overlapping contentions:  (1) the legislative history and public policy underlying the Code's scheme of life insurance taxation demonstrate that Congress intended the term \"policyholder dividend\" to include the distributions made during UNUM's demutualization;  and (2) because \"policyholder dividends\" are broader than classic corporate dividends, \"policyholder dividends\" need not possess the essential characteristics of a dividend--i.e., they are not subject to the constraints which limit the classic definition of dividends.  We reject both arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that &#167; 805(a)(3) allows life insurance companies to deduct \"policyholder dividends\" from income.  Section 805(a)(3) expressly states:  \"there shall be allowed the following deductions:  ...--The deduction for policyholder dividends ....\" &#167; 805(a)(3).  The real question, rather, is whether the definition of \"policyholder dividend\" in &#167; 808 encompasses the cash and stock distributed during UNUM's demutualization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this regard, UNUM's principal argument is that the plain meaning of &#167; 808 entitles it to deduct the amounts distributed during the demutualization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We believe that, in order to make this claim successfully, UNUM must demonstrate that the distributions satisfy both &#167; 808(a) and &#167; 808(b).  Section 808(a) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>[F]or purposes of this part, the term \"policyholder dividend\" means any dividend or similar distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167;   808(a).  Under &#167; 808(b)(1), upon which UNUM hinges the main body of its argument, a \"policyholder dividend\" may include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>any amount paid or credited (including as an increase in benefits) where the amount is not fixed in the contract but depends on the experience of the company or the discretion of the management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 808(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM asserts that the distributions easily satisfy &#167; 808(a), which, UNUM claims, merely emphasizes the broad scope of \"policyholder dividends.\"   The source of UNUM's authority for this claim is unclear.  UNUM seems to rely principally on Republic Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 594 F.2d 530 (5th Cir.1979), in which the court stated that \"policyholder dividends\" have an \"expansive definition\" and \"include more than just classic dividends.\"  Id. at 532.   UNUM seems also to rely on Treas.  Reg. &#167; 1.811-2(a) (1997), which tracks the language of &#167; 808(a), as further evidence of the broad scope of the \"policyholder dividend.\"   Because \"policyholder dividends\" are \"expansive\", UNUM argues, they necessarily encompass the amounts distributed during the demutualization.  We are not persuaded by these arguments, which attempt to sweep the language of &#167; 808(a) under the table.  Rather, we think that &#167; 808(a) presents a major obstacle, which UNUM fails to overcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM argues that the real test is whether the distributions satisfy &#167; 808(b).  UNUM focuses its attention on the text of &#167; 808(b)(1), arguing:  (1) Nothing in the insurance contracts between UNUM and its policyholders addressed the amounts due to the policyholders in a demutualization;  therefore the amounts were \"not fixed in the contract\";  (2) The cash was distributed out of Union Mutual's accumulated surplus, which represents the fruits of the company's considerable business success since its founding;  therefore the amounts \"depend[ed] on the experience of the company\";  (3) Union Mutual's management, though subject to the supervision of the Maine Superintendent of Insurance and obligated to present \"fair and equitable\" terms to the policyholder, decided the amounts within that range which would be paid to policyholders in exchange for their equity interests;  therefore, the amounts were based \"on the discretion of management.\"   The combination of these circumstances, UNUM argues, satisfies the elements of &#167; 808(b)(1), and thus the distributions are \"policyholder dividends\" deductible under &#167; 805(a)(3), regardless of the general corporate tax provisions contained in Subchapter C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we recognize that UNUM's argument is plausible, we nonetheless find it unpersuasive.  As we explain later, &#167; 808(b) describes categories of distributions that may constitute policyholder dividends provided that the definition of &#167; 808(a) is met.  But UNUM has failed to satisfy us that the term \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808(a) includes value-for-value exchanges that occur during a corporate reorganization such as this.  UNUM's argument ultimately suffers from a fundamental defect:  it assumes that Congress wished to ignore the context in which the cash and stock distributions took place.  We later explain why UNUM's arguments that the distributions fit within &#167; 808(a) fail.  We first set the stage as to why Subchapter C applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Application of Subchapter C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a paradigmatic recapitalization, the corporation is not allowed a deduction for distributions made in the course of the transaction.  See Woodward v. Commissioner, 397 U.S. 572, 579 n. 8, 90 S.Ct. 1302, 1307 n. 8, 25 L.Ed.2d 577 (1970) (\"[W]herever a capital asset is transferred to a new owner in exchange for value either agreed upon or determined by law to be a fair quid pro quo, the payment itself is a capital expenditure ...\");  United States v. Houston Pipeline Co., 37 F.3d 224, 226 (5th Cir.1994) (\"Stock redemptions, as a general rule, are characterized as capital transactions, and the purchase price of a stock redemption is not deductible.\")  (footnotes omitted);  Jim Walter Corp. v. United States, 498 F.2d 631 (5th Cir.1974) (corporation's purchase of outstanding warrants in connection with issuance of stock and bonds treated as a capital transaction);  Frederick Weisman Co. v. Commissioner, 97 T.C. 563, 572, 1991 WL 241153 (1991) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Union Mutual purchased its policyholders' equity interests and transferred them to UNUM.  UNUM in turn exchanged the policyholders' membership interests in Union Mutual for stock in UNUM or cash.  UNUM was financially in no worse a position after \"paying out\" $522 million worth of stock to implement the demutualization than it was before the transaction occurred.  What changed was the form of ownership, precisely the topic which capital transactions typically involve.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  As for the $130 million distributed in cash to redeem certain policyholders' interests, UNUM was left poorer.  But the Code disallows deductions for such distributions made in redemption.

These provisions clearly prohibit a company from deducting cash or the value of stock distributed to its policyholders in redemption of their equity interests in the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Subchapter C, the Code would clearly disallow UNUM from taking a deduction on the cash distributed during the demutualization.  Section 311 provides that a corporation that purchases shares of its stock from a shareholder ordinarily may not receive a deduction for that purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Section 311(a) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation on the distribution, with respect to its stock, of its stock (or rights to acquire its stock), or property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 311(a).  Congress reinforced the strength of this rule by enacting &#167; 162(l ) (now &#167; 162(k)) after the Fifth Circuit recognized a narrow exception in Five Star Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner, 355 F.2d 724 (5th Cir.1966) (deduction allowed when expenditures made to save the corporation from dire and threatening circumstances).  Section 162(k)(1) unreservedly prohibits corporations from taking deductions for distributions made in the course of reacquiring its stock:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>Except as provided in paragraph 2, no deduction otherwise allowable shall be allowed under this chapter for any amount paid or incurred by a corporation in connection with the reacquisition of its stock....<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 162(k)(1).  The reference to \"this chapter\" is to Chapter One of the Code (I.R.C. &#167;&#167; 1-1399), which includes both the general corporate tax provisions in Subchapter C and the insurance tax provisions in Subchapter L. While &#167; 162(k)(2) does contain some exceptions to the general rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> none of these apply to insurance companies.  By its literal terms, therefore, &#167; 162 forecloses any deduction for the cash distributed by UNUM.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Code is equally clear that UNUM may not deduct the value of the stock distributed in exchange for equity interests.  Section 354(a) provides</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan or reorganization, exchanged solely for stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 354(a).  Section 354 thus bars any deduction for the exchange of UNUM stock for the membership interests of Union Mutual pursuant to the conversion plan.  And &#167; 1032(a) provides</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation on the receipt of money or property in exchange for stock (including treasury stock) of such corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 1032(a).  As is the case with &#167; 162(k) and &#167; 311, these Code sections do not contain provisions excluding insurance companies from their scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Section 808</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find nothing in &#167; 808 that specifically overrides these general rules.  Indeed, that &#167; 808 does not even mention these rules suggests that it may have nothing to do with capital transactions altogether.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress has been explicit in those situations when it wished Subchapter L to modify Subchapter C. See &#167; 805(b) (modifying the interest deduction under &#167; 163, the charitable contributions deduction under &#167; 170, the rules for amortizable bond premium under &#167; 171, the net operating loss deduction under &#167; 172, and the dividends received deductions under &#167;&#167; 243-245).  Congress could have done the same with the Code sections that directly govern UNUM's demutualization.  That Congress did not choose to do so strongly suggest that Congress wanted those sections to apply with full force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our view that Congress did not intend the demutualization process to be exempted from these general tax rules is strengthened when we examine &#167; 808(a).  UNUM essentially makes a two-step argument regarding &#167; 808(a):  (1) any distribution which fits the strict language of &#167; 808(b) is a \"policyholder dividend\" for purposes of &#167; 808, regardless of the language of &#167; 808(a);  and (2) because the transaction here is a \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808, UNUM is entitled to a deduction under &#167; 805(a)(3).  We reject the first prong, so the second collapses accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM argues that the term \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808 is not bound by the constraints that usually characterize dividends, but includes any distribution that can fit within the language of &#167; 808(b)(1):  \"any amount paid or credited ... where the amount is not fixed in the contract but depends on the experience of the company or the discretion of the management.\"   We reject this reading of &#167; 808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Basic canons of statutory construction require us to consider the language of &#167; 808(a) in construing &#167; 808(b).  See United States Nat'l Bank of Or. v. Indep.  Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 455, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (Courts must \"at a minimum ... account for a statute's full text, language as well as punctuation, structure, and subject matter.\").  Section 808(a) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>For purposes of this part, the term \"policyholder dividend\" means any dividend or similar distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 808(a).  This text may be divided into three components.  The \"[f]or the purposes of this part\" language requires that the definition of \"policyholder dividend\" has no force beyond Part I of Subchapter L, which specifically involves the taxation of life insurance companies;  thus &#167; 808 cannot govern a transaction basically within the purview of Subchapter C. The \"any dividend or similar distribution\" language requires all \"policyholder dividends\" to possess the essential characteristics of a dividend.  Finally, the \"to policyholders in their capacity as such\" requires that the dividend-like distributions be based on the contractual relationship between the policyholder and insurer.  We interpret the language of &#167; 808(a) to mean exactly what it says.  Any distribution by an insurer to its policyholders must accordingly bear the essential characteristics of a dividend and be based on the contractual relationship between the policyholder and insurer in order to qualify as a \"policyholder dividend\".  And if &#167; 808(a) is not satisfied, then &#167; 808(b) cannot be satisfied either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM attempts to circumvent the plain meaning of &#167; 808(a) by arguing that the language of &#167; 316 specifically exempts \"policyholder dividends\" from the constraints that bind typical corporate dividends.  Section 316(a) defines the term \"dividend\" as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>For the purposes of this subtitle, the term \"dividend\" means any distribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders ... out of its earnings and profits of the taxable year....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 316(a).  By its terms, this definition of dividends applies to Subtitle A, 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1-1563, which includes the portion of the Code governing income taxation.  Section 316(b) limits the extent of the application of this definition:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>The definition in subsection (a) shall not apply to the term 'dividend' as used in Subchapter L in any case where the reference is to dividends of insurance companies paid to policyholders as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">s316(b).  UNUM argues that the language of &#167; 316(b) demonstrates that \"policyholder dividends\" have broader scope than \"dividends\" as defined in &#167; 316(a), so it would be erroneous to conclude that policyholder dividends should be deemed a type of dividend as that term is so defined.  It is true that &#167; 316(b) means that a policyholder dividend under &#167; 808 is not limited to distributions out of the insurer's earnings and profits and may include additional amounts from other sources.  But, UNUM's assertion notwithstanding, it does not follow that because \"policyholder dividends\" may include more than classic corporate dividends then \"policyholder dividends\" may therefore encompass any distribution to policyholders regardless of its context or purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  As Judge Carter appropriately noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>The fact that \"policyholder dividend\" is, in certain respects, broader in scope than \"classic dividend\" neither implies, nor even suggests, that Congress intended \"policyholder dividend\" to be construed broadly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM Corp. v. United States, 929 F.Supp. 15, 20 n. 6 (D.Maine 1996).  Indeed, the term \"policyholder dividend\" is still a defined category.  That it possesses a broader scope than the term \"dividend\" as defined in &#167; 316(a) suggests only that policyholder dividends are different from ordinary corporate dividends, not that they are fundamentally unlike them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F. The distributions are not dividends</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis suggests that the lengthy debate as to whether and how policyholder dividends are like or unlike corporate dividends is largely beside the point.  All dividends, whether policyholder dividends or corporate dividends, share certain essential characteristics.  The focus should be on whether the stock and cash distributions bear the essential characteristics which qualify them as a dividend of any stripe.  We find that the cash and stock distributions at issue in this case simply are not \"policyholder dividends\" as that term is defined, because they are fundamentally not dividends or distributions similar to dividends as &#167; 808(a) requires.  Because they do not meet the definition of &#167; 808(a), &#167; 808(b) is superfluous.  Moreover, because the distributions do not meet the definition of &#167; 808(a), they are still subject to the general corporate tax rules of Subchapter C, under which they may not be deducted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The economics of the demutualization compel this conclusion.  A dividend, even a policyholder dividend, is a unilateral distribution by a company to its owners (who, in the case of mutual life insurance companies, also happen to be customers).  No matter how large, a dividend still leaves intact the owner's equity interest in the company.  But the cash and stock distributions for which UNUM seeks a deduction were not unilateral distributions by a company to its owners.  Both were made in exchange for policyholders' membership interests in the former mutual company.  Those who received cash had their equity interests extinguished, transactions amounting to classic redemptions.  Those who received stock had their equity converted from one form to another, transactions which were classic non-recognition exchanges.  No authority exists supporting the proposition that the term \"dividend\" encompasses such transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM nevertheless argues that the distributions should still be characterized as \"policyholder dividends\" because, removed from context, they can plausibly be shoehorned into the text of &#167; 808(b)(1).  Judge Carter deftly explained the fallacy of UNUM's argument as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>The fact that Congress intended life insurers to be able to deduct any dividend-like distribution to policyholders to the extent of its capital-like component neither implies, nor even gives rise to the inference, that Congress also intended life insurers to be able to deduct any distribution at all to policyholder that contains a capital-like component to the extent of that component.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM Corp. v. United States, 929 F.Supp. at 24 n. 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM's argument clouds the reason why &#167; 316 distinguishes policyholder from regular corporate dividends.  Policyholder dividends typically include a capital component in addition to earnings and Congress wished to provide a deduction for that component.  See &#167; 805(a)(3);  &#167; 809 (limiting the extent of the deduction).  But the fact that \"policyholder dividends\" may include additional components does not change the fact that they must still essentially constitute dividends as &#167; 808(a) expressly requires.  The acknowledgement reflected in &#167; 316(b) that policyholder dividends are more expansive than classic dividends does not alter this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court observed, UNUM's bootstrapping argument ignores other sources of authority on what constitutes a \"dividend.\"   In Hellmich v. Hellman, 276 U.S. 233, 48 S.Ct. 244, 72 L.Ed. 544 (1928), the Supreme Court described a dividend as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>the recurrent return upon stock paid to stock holders by a going corporation in the ordinary course of business, which does not reduce their stock holdings and leaves them in a position to enjoy future returns upon the same stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 237, 48 S.Ct. at 245.   Similarly, the Supreme Court in United States v. Davis, 397 U.S. 301, 90 S.Ct. 1041, 25 L.Ed.2d 323 (1970), described a \"dividend\" as a distribution whose</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>effect is to transfer the property from the company to its shareholders without a change in the relative interest or rights of the stockholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 313, 90 S.Ct. at 1048 (emphasis added).  A distribution is \"not essentially equivalent to a dividend\" if it \"result[s] in a meaningful reduction of the shareholder's proportional interest in the corporation.\"  Id. In light of this authority, we do not view distributions of stock or cash by a mutual insurer in consideration for the same value of ownership interest in a mutual company to be a dividend under any definition of the term, including a \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cash distribution is not a dividend or similar to a dividend precisely because it did reduce (to zero) the ownership interest of those policyholders who received cash and left them in no position to enjoy future returns, except as policyholders.  Cf. Hellmich, 276 U.S. at 237, 48 S.Ct. at 245-46.   It was thus akin to a nondeductible distribution in redemption.  In contrast, the stock distribution was not a dividend or similar to a dividend because it was not in the nature of a \"recurrent return upon stock paid to stockholders by a going corporation in the ordinary course of business.\"  Id. Rather, it effected a conversion of one form of equity to another through a classic non-recognition exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>G. Other reasons</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that UNUM's demutualization occurred through a holding company suggests additional reasons why UNUM is also not, for other reasons, entitled to a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction.  First, UNUM, which distributed its stock to policyholders in exchange for their membership interests in Union Mutual, is not a \"life insurance company\" as defined in &#167; 816(a);  the tax consequences of the stock distributions are accordingly subject to general corporation tax provisions in Subchapter C, which disallow the deduction.  See &#167; 354(a);  &#167; 1032(a).  Second, the term \"amount paid\" in &#167; 808(b)(1) requires distributions out of the company's surplus, whereas the stock distribution came from the holding company.  Union Mutual did not actually \"pay\" anything in making that exchange.  It is true that UNUM is the sole owner of a life insurance company, but having structured the demutualization as it did, UNUM must \"accept the tax consequences of [its] choice.\"   See Commissioner v. National Alfalfa Dehydrating &amp; Milling Co., 417 U.S. 134, 149, 94 S.Ct. 2129, 2137, 40 L.Ed.2d 717 (1974).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, our decision does not rely on the fact that UNUM structured its demutualization through a holding company.  Sections 354(a) and 1032(a) would apply to the demutualization regardless of its form, even if Union Mutual distributed stock in the new stock company in direct exchange for the membership interests of its policyholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM's best argument may be the analogy it draws between a mutual insurance company liquidation and demutualization.  When a mutual insurance company is liquidated, its assets are distributed to the policyholders and those distributions may be called dividends.  This reorganization, the company says, is functionally equivalent to such a liquidation because Union Mutual no longer exists on completion of the demutualization. There are two responses.  The first is that the analogy does not work.  The very nature of a demutualization fundamentally distinguishes it from a liquidation in that the insurer is still in business after the conversion is complete.  In the present case, the policyholders continue to be provided insurance, albeit through a different form of company and under a different name.  Indeed, ensuring that Union Mutual would continue to meet its policyholders' reasonable expectations on the investment value of their policies was the very purpose of the PFA, which calculated the amount of assets necessary to pay policy claims, provide policyholder dividends, and satisfy whatever other benefits accrued to policyholders under their insurance contracts.  Notably, the Maine Insurance Commissioner gave his blessing to the transaction only on being assured there was sufficient capital preserved, together with premiums, to cover the insured risks in the future.  This does not happen in the usual liquidation and, indeed, demonstrates that UNUM's demutualization cannot properly be so characterized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, even if the analogy were apt in general, we have little reason to think Congress intended that final distributions of all assets to be within the definition of \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808(a).  Congress could easily have provided for this deduction by enacting specific language to that effect.  Had Congress wanted to provide insurance companies with a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction for any distribution to policyholders not fixed in the contract, it could simply have defined \"policyholder dividend\" as referring to \"any distribution.\"   It would not have limited the definition to \"dividends or similar distributions\" and then left it to the insurance industry to discover massive deductions in the shadows of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we think the plain meaning of &#167; 808 works against, and not for, UNUM, and mindful of the usual rule that resort to legislative history is inappropriate in such circumstances, we do briefly explain UNUM's policy and legislative history argument.  Our primary purpose in so doing is to determine whether there is a clearly expressed legislative intention which would cause us to question application of the usual rule.  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1214 n. 12, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).  A secondary reason is to note that UNUM's policy arguments are not implausible;  they simply do not carry UNUM's burden of showing clearly that Congress intended such a deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its statutory argument, UNUM offers an extended account of the legislative history and public policy behind the Code's scheme of life insurance company taxation.  UNUM argues that Congress specifically created the \"policyholder dividend\" deduction to equalize the tax treatment of mutual insurers relative to stock insurers.  Under general tax rules, stock companies are not taxed on capital raised by selling stock, but may not deduct amounts paid to redeem that stock.  (No tax, no deduction) At the same time, mutual insurers must pay income tax on capital raised by charging redundant premiums;  but, absent the policyholder dividend deduction, they may not deduct amounts paid to return capital to policyholders, which typically occur through policyholder dividends.  (Tax, but no corresponding deduction) By creating the policyholder dividend deduction in &#167; 805(a)(3), UNUM explains, Congress intended to create symmetry in the taxation of mutual insurers and thus provide equal tax treatment for both mutual and stock insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM emphasizes the expansiveness of \"policyholder dividends\" by contrasting them with a \"return premium\".  Return premiums are refunds that occur when a policy is cancelled, where the amount of the refund generally represents that portion of paid premiums not applied to the purchase of coverage up to the time of cancellation.  Robert A. Keeton &amp; Alan I. Widiss, Insurance Law:  A Guide to Fundamental Principles, Legal Doctrines, &amp; Commercial Practices &#167; 5.11(d)(2) (1988).  UNUM explains that these amounts are \"fixed in the contract\" in that they are based on the terms of the contract.  \"Policyholder dividends\" are, in contrast, any amounts not fixed in the contract, i.e., any distributions from surplus (that depend on the experience of the company or the discretion of management) that are not return premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Subchapter L, UNUM explains, Congress divided amounts returned to policyholders into the categories of \"return premiums\" and \"policyholder dividend\".  Return premiums are deductible, because they contain a return of premiums.  Policyholder dividends are also deductible, because, like return premiums, they are in part returns of capital.  Policyholder dividends are only deductible in part, however, because they can also contain earnings from the investment of the premiums which are nondeductible under general tax law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To account for this, UNUM argues, Congress created an expansive definition of \"policyholder dividend\" in &#167; 808 and enacted &#167; 809 to control the extent of the deduction, since the expansive language does not admit limitation.  UNUM claims that &#167; 809 is the sole mechanism by which policyholder dividends should be limited, not through judicial construction of the scope of the definition of \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808.  Policyholder dividends should be, in effect, any distribution that a mutual insurer makes to policyholders out of surplus for any reason, and only the terms of &#167; 809 limit the reach of the deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM argues that the facts that Congress created the policyholder dividend deduction to achieve a tax symmetry and that Congress accordingly defined \"policyholder dividend\" to possess broad scope necessarily compels the conclusion that \"policyholder dividends\" must even include distributions to policyholders that are fundamentally not dividends.  We believe this conclusion is unsupported by the text or policies underlying the statute.  UNUM's analysis of the legislative history and public policy underlying the insurance tax provisions of the Code suffers from the same flaw that undermines its statutory argument.  Nothing UNUM cites supports the proposition that Congress intended the term \"policyholder dividends\" to encompass value-for-value exchanges occurring during a corporate reorganization.  UNUM's argument fails not because its relies on erroneous facts, but rather because those facts simply do not support the conclusions UNUM wishes to draw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the mere fact that \"policyholder dividends\" are not \"fixed\" by the terms of an insurance contract does not mean that they include any distribution that a mutual insurer makes to its policyholders in any capacity.  Under &#167; 808(a), in order for a distribution to qualify as a \"policyholder dividend\", the distribution must occur to policyholders \"in their capacity as such\"--i.e., in their capacity as policyholders, not owners.  The distribution must also fundamentally be a \"dividend or similar distribution.\"   For the reasons explained in the balance of the opinion, we believe that the cash and stock distributions made by UNUM were not dividends.  Rather, the cash distribution constituted a nondeductible distribution in redemption, while the stock distribution was part of a non-recognition exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Colonial American, the Supreme Court faced a case similar to this one.

Thereafter, the insurer may not distribute any earnings or proceeds developed within that block to stockholders.  The closed block must be operated for the exclusive benefit of the included policies and contracts, distributions being for policyholder dividend purposes only.

This process, known as \"demutualization,\" often involves a conversion of the mutual policyholders' ownership interest in the old company into ownership interest in the form of stock in the new company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal raises important questions about the proper tax treatment of one form of demutualization:  whether stock and cash distributed to policyholders in exchange for their mutual ownership interests as part of a statutory demutualization constitute \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808 of the Internal Revenue Code.  If so, the insurer may take a deduction for \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 805(a)(3).  Whether the \"policyholder dividends\" deduction is available has great financial consequences for the company and for the public fisc.  This question involves consideration of the scope of the \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808, as well as the broader relationship between the general corporate tax provisions of the Code (contained in Subchapter C) and the Code's insurance tax provisions (contained in Subchapter L).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, UNUM Corp.  (\"UNUM\"), the demutualized successor to Union Mutual Life Insurance Co.  (\"Union Mutual\"), seeks a tax refund based on a \"policyholder dividends\" deduction of over $652 million.  This sum, which UNUM was required to distribute to its policyholders by state law, represents the value of Union Mutual's accumulated surplus.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit.  24-A, &#167; 3477 (West 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM's principal argument is that the cash and stock distributed during the demutualization constitute \"policyholder dividends\" under the plain language of &#167; 808(b) and thus are deductible under &#167; 805.  UNUM further argues that, beyond the statute's plain language, the legislative history and public policy behind the Code's treatment of life insurance companies support this result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS argues that general corporate tax provisions apply to insurance companies in the absence of specific provisions to the contrary in the Code's insurance tax section, and that, under those corporate tax provisions, UNUM is not entitled to any deduction for its reorganization.  The IRS argues that nothing in &#167; 808 or its legislative history indicates that Congress envisioned &#167; 808 as encompassing capital transactions such as UNUM's demutualization.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Demutualization has become increasingly common in the insurance industry.  More than 200 mutual life insurance companies have demutualized since 1930.  See S. Preston Ricardo, The Deductibility of Policyholder Dividends:  UNUM Corp. v. United States, 50 Tax Law. 265, 265 (1996).  Between 1954 and 1981, the number of mutual insurers declined from 171 to 135;  during the same time, the number of stock insurers increased from 661 to 1,823.  Edward X. Clinton, The Rights of Policyholders in an Insurance Demutualization, 41 Drake L.Rev. 657, 659 n. 13 (1992).  Today, fewer than 80 mutual insurers have assets of over $100 million.  See William B. Dunham, Jr., et al., Introduction, in Demutualization of Life Insurers, 648 PLI/Comm 9, 16 (1993).  These figures suggest that mutual insurers are rapidly demutualizing, and that new insurance companies prefer the stock form at the outset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State legislatures have facilitated this demutualization process by passing statutes permitting such conversions.  Presently, at least forty-one states have specific statutes that provide for demutualization of mutual life insurers.  Alexander M. Dye, Distributing Consideration to Policyholders, in Demutualization of Life Insurers, 648 PLI/Comm 75, 78 (1993).  Only Hawaii and Idaho expressly prohibit direct mutual to stock conversion, although they still permit demutualization through the alternate method of bulk reinsurance conversion.  See Clinton, supra, at 673 n. 116.   Every state, including those that lack specific demutualization statutes, permits at least some form of demutualization.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three usual types of mutual to stock conversions:  a statutory conversion whereby the insurer directly converts its form of business, merger with a stock insurer, and bulk reinsurance of the mutual company's policies.  See id. at 660-61.   This case only concerns the first type of conversion:  a statutory conversion, in which a mutual company alters its organizational form to become a stock insurer by redistributing all the mutual policyholder's ownership interest in the mutual insurer into shares of stock in a new stock corporation.  \"This type of reorganization may properly be regarded as a reorganization of the company because the policyholders are exchanging membership in the mutual for shares in the new corporation.\"  Id. at 660.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By demutualizing, mutual insurers can obtain certain advantages available to stock insurers.  Stock corporations are better able to raise capital because they may sell stock on the equity markets.  See id. at 666-671.   Stock companies can more easily diversify their operations by creating upstream holding companies which can own subsidiaries engaged in other businesses.  See id. at 671-72.   They can also create incentives for superior management performance through stock option plans.  See id. at 672-74.   Mutual insurers can only raise capital by retaining earnings or charging excess premiums, and are generally subject to comprehensive regulation by state authorities.  These limitations can hinder their ability to grow and diversify.  See id. at 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much is at stake in this process.  Mutual insurance companies have historically lagged behind stock insurers in growth of assets and capital.  Demutualization and subsequent stock sales may improve a mutual insurer's capital position and competitive standing with other insurers and financial institutions.  Mutual insurers naturally want to contend in the increasingly competitive and deregulated financial services markets.  Many mutual insurers regard demutualization as an important step toward bolstering their financial strength and flexibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Mutual, based in Maine, was organized as a mutual insurance company in 1848.  Union Mutual's business was selling various types of insurance and annuity products.  As a mutual company, Union Mutual had no stock and was owned by its participating policyholders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Policyholders contributed to Union Mutual's surplus by paying premiums that exceeded the actuarial cost of their policy coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, Union Mutual's management decided to reorganize the company as a stock insurer.  The management decided that the company would gain four principal business advantages from this conversion:  an increased ability to raise capital, greater flexibility to diversify into new markets, an increased accountability for company performance by management, and an enhanced ability to attract and retain key personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine law, Union Mutual was not permitted to implement its conversion plan until the plan was approved by the Maine Superintendent of Insurance.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &#167; 3477 (West 1996).  Maine law imposes several conditions that a demutualization plan must satisfy in order to receive approval by the Superintendent.  These include, inter alia, (1) that the company pay policyholders a \"fair and equitable\" amount for their ownership interests in the company, (2) that the \"equity share\" of each policyholder be determined under a fair and reasonable formula based upon the insurer's entire surplus as stated in a financial statement filed with the Superintendent, (3) that the conversion plan give each member of the demutualizing insurer a preemptive right to acquire his or her proportionate part of the proposed capital stock of the new stock company, (4) that the plan provide for payment to each member of his or her entire equity share in the insurer, with the payment to be made in cash or stock of the stock company, and (5) that policyholders entitled to receive stock or cash include all policyholders within three years prior to the date the plan was submitted for approval to the Superintendent.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 14, 1984, Union Mutual submitted a plan of recapitalization and conversion to the Superintendent.  Union Mutual amended the plan several times in response to rulings by the Superintendent.  On July 11, 1986, Union Mutual submitted its fourth and final amended plan, which was approved by the Superintendent on August 8, 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approved plan of conversion may be generally described as follows.  A holding company was formed to own all the stock of the new stock company.  Those who were \"eligible policyholders\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> transferred their \"membership interests\" in Union Mutual to the holding company in exchange for stock in the holding company.  \"Membership interests\" were defined in the conversion plan as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>[A]ll the rights or interests of each policy and contract holder of Union Mutual including, but not limited to, any right to vote, any rights which may exist with regard to the surplus of Union Mutual not apportioned by the Board for policyholder dividends, and any rights in liquidation or reorganization of Union Mutual, but shall not include any other right expressly conferred by a policyholder's insurance policy or contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eligible policyholders who qualified as \"cash option eligible policyholders\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> could elect to exchange their membership interests for cash instead of stock.  The holding company, after obtaining 100% of the membership interests in Union Mutual, exchanged the membership interests for 100% of the shares of the newly formed stock insurer.  The holding company sold stock not issued to policyholders to insiders and the general public.  At the conclusion of the Plan, UNUM Life Insurance Co.  (\"UNUM Life\"), the new stock company, was a wholly owned subsidiary of UNUM, the holding company.  UNUM was in turn owned by former Union Mutual policyholders, insiders, and members of the general public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The approved plan included an actuarial formula for calculating the consideration to be paid to each policyholder in exchange for his or her membership interest in Union Mutual.  This figure, denominated each policyholder's \"equity share\" in Union Mutual, was defined as \"the dollar amount of that part of Union Mutual's Adjusted Surplus attributable to\" the particular policyholder.  Each policyholder's \"equity share\" comprised two components:  a \"minimum equity share\" and the individual's \"contribution to statutory surplus\".  On December 31, 1985, the day Union Mutual presented its consolidated balance sheet for final review by the Superintendent, Union Mutual's adjusted surplus was $652,050,097.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Based on that figure, Union Mutual's management determined that each policyholder should receive a per capita amount of $612.25 as the \"minimum equity share\".  The \"contribution to statutory surplus\" varied by individual policyholder.  The formula for computing a policyholder's \"equity share\" that is referred to in the plan of conversion reveals this two-component scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan of conversion also provided for creation of an accounting mechanism known as a Participation Fund Account (\"PFA\").  The PFA created the functional equivalent of a closed block<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and was allocated assets which, together with premiums from the participating policies, were actuarially sufficient to pay policy claims and policyholder dividends.  Under the conversion plan, the amount of the assets in the PFA could not be distributed to stockholders of the demutualized insurer.  As with a closed block, it had to be invested and used for the exclusive benefit of the policyholders.  The PFA was designed with the aim that Union Mutual's policyholders would continue to receive policyholder dividends after the demutualization at the same level as before, even though policyholders and stockholders would have competing claims on the earning and profits of the company.  The PFA thus was meant to assure policyholders that their reasonable expectations about the investment value of their policies would continue to be met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The creation of the PFA was an important consideration in the Superintendent's decision to approve the demutualization plan.  In his Final Decision and Order, the Superintendent discussed the PFA at some length, observing that Union Mutual policyholders had bought their policies with an understanding that policy costs would be continually adjusted through dividends reflecting Union Mutual's actual experience.  The Superintendent also noted that, when purchasing their policies, policyholders based their dividend expectations on dividend illustrations shown to them by Union Mutual that were in turn based on the dividends the company had been paying pursuant to the dividend scales current at the time of purchase.  The Superintendent concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Even though these \"illustrations\" were not guarantees that dividends would be paid, Union Mutual, in practice, typically paid dividends in accordance with these scales.  Based upon these illustrations and upon actual practice, policyholders expect that they will continue to receive these dividends as long as their policies are in force.  Therefore, I find it appropriate that the Plan, by creating a mechanism such as the PFA, supports these expectations of future dividends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the PFA would maintain these expectations was, according to the Superintendent, critical to the acceptability of the conversion plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Mutual implemented its plan of conversion on November 14, 1986.  To the 105,098 Eligible Policyholders who selected the Cash Option, Union Mutual distributed $129,129,082.  To the remaining 58,561 Eligible Policyholders, Union Mutual distributed 20,489,072 shares of UNUM stock.  This stock was assessed as having a fair market value of $25.20 per share, making the total value of the UNUM stock distributed under the Plan equal to $522,471,336.  Union Mutual also distributed an additional $609,396 in cash to compensate policyholders for the value of fractional shares created by the conversion formula.  In total, Union Mutual distributed $652,209,814 to the Eligible Policyholders during the demutualization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the demutualization, on October 12, 1984, Union Mutual's tax counsel had asked the IRS for a private letter ruling on the tax treatment of the conversion.  Contrary to the position taken by UNUM now, Union Mutual then sought to convince the IRS that the stock distributed to policyholders in exchange for their membership interests in Union Mutual would constitute tax free exchanges under &#167; 351 of the Code.  UNUM also sought to persuade the IRS that the exchange of the membership interests received by the holding company for common stock of the new stock company would constitute a tax free recapitalization under &#167; 368(a)(1)(E).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of these positions, Union Mutual made a submission to the IRS on March 25, 1985 stating that \"the equity interest of Union Mutual's policyholders resemble the rights of stockholders in a corporation and have substantial value.\"   The submission further stated that the Supreme Court, in Helvering v.

(emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Mutual made another submission to the IRS on November 8, 1985, discussing whether the exchange of the membership interests for cash or stock would be treated as nondeductible redemptions of stock under &#167; 302 or as deductible \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808 and &#167; 805, although UNUM did not specifically ask for a letter ruling on that subject at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1986, the IRS issued its private letter ruling to Union Mutual regarding the proper tax treatment of the demutualization.  See Priv.  Ltr. Rul. 87-11-121 (December 16, 1996).  The letter ruling stated that the exchange between the policyholders and UNUM of the policyholders' membership interests in Union Mutual for UNUM stock was a tax-free exchange under &#167; 351.  See id.   The ruling also stated that the exchange between UNUM and UNUM Life, the stock insurer that would succeed Union Mutual, of the Union Mutual membership interests for UNUM Life voting common stock was a tax free recapitalization under &#167; 368(a)(1)(E).  See id.   The ruling further stated that the cash distributed to policyholders in exchange for their membership interests constituted value-for-value transfers and were, accordingly, properly characterized as nondeductible redemptions under &#167; 302, not deductible \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808 and &#167; 805.  See id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The IRS viewed the stock-for-membership interest exchanges, in contrast, as non-recognition exchanges subject to &#167; 351 (no gain or loss recognized to policyholders), &#167; 354 (no gain or loss recognized to holding company on exchange of membership interests to converted company for stock), and &#167; 1032 (no gain or loss recognized to either holding company or converted company on receipt of property for stock).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its 1986 consolidated federal income tax return, UNUM did not claim a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction for the cash and stock distributed to policyholders during the demutualization.  UNUM had entered into an agreement with the IRS extending the time period within which the IRS could audit the 1986 return, after which UNUM would be given an additional six months within which to decide whether to amend the return to claim a refund.  The IRS audit, which ended in 1991, concluded that UNUM had properly characterized the cash distributions as nondeductible stock redemptions under &#167; 302 and the stock distributions as made pursuant to nonrecognition exchanges of its stock for property.  UNUM thereafter changed its view of the proper tax treatment of the transaction by timely amending its 1986 return to claim the cash ($129,738,478), then the value of the stock ($522,471,336), as deductible policyholder dividends under &#167; 808 and &#167; 805.  UNUM sought a refund in excess of $77 million.  The IRS denied these claimed deductions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, UNUM filed suit in the district court, seeking deductions and a refund of the $77 million.  The district court ruled in favor of the government, holding that the cash and stock distributions could not be construed as \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808.  UNUM appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM makes a colorable but ultimately unpersuasive argument that this appeal involves only the narrow task of interpreting &#167; 808 and &#167; 805 of the Code.  UNUM would have at least a plausible argument that it was entitled to a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction if those two sections were the only potentially relevant Code sections to this case.

UNUM's demutualization constitutes a capital transaction and is accordingly subject to the general corporate tax rules under Subchapter C which govern such transactions.  These rules clearly bar any deduction for amounts distributed during a capital transaction.A. Structural Overview</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case involves the interplay between two Subchapters of the Code, we describe them in general terms.  Subchapter C is a broadly applicable section of the Code which contains many of the Code's general corporate tax provisions.  It applies to all corporations, including mutual and stock insurance companies.  See &#167; 7701(a)(3) (\"When used in this title, ... [t]he term 'corporation' includes ... insurance companies.\");  &#167;  7701(a)(8) (\"the term 'shareholder' includes a member in an ... insurance company.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subchapter C governs corporate capital transactions and the taxation of all corporate distributions and adjustments, including the organization, operation, liquidation, and reorganization of all corporate enterprises and their distributions to shareholders and associates.  See &#167;&#167; 301-85.  Many general rules in Subchapter C as well as additional rules in other sections of the Code contain language that, by their literal terms, bar the deduction UNUM seeks.  Sections 162, 311, 354, and 1032 apply with particular force.  We explain these sections and discuss why they apply later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subchapter L, in contrast, is a highly focused section of the Code which specifically governs certain aspects of the taxation of life insurance companies.  See &#167;&#167; 801-818.  Subchapter L enacts a special scheme of determining the gross income, deductions, and taxable income of life insurance companies, whether of the stock or mutual variety.  It accommodates the unique manner by which life insurance companies raise and distribute capital.  One purpose behind this parallel system of income calculation is to determine more accurately the taxable income of life insurance companies than general tax rules otherwise would permit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Subchapter L applies specifically to life insurance companies, the existence of Subchapter L does not exempt insurance companies from the application of the rest of the Code.  Subchapter L at times specifically displaces otherwise applicable rules.  For example, life insurance company taxable income is defined in &#167; 801 as \"life insurance gross income\" reduced by \"life insurance deductions\".  &#167; 801(b).  \"Life insurance gross income\" is specifically defined in &#167; 803, not the generally applicable definition of gross income provided in &#167; 61.  And \"life insurance deductions\" are specifically governed by &#167; 804 and &#167; 805, even though &#167; 804 and &#167; 805 incorporate many of the general rules about deductions by reference.  But Subchapter L does not alter general tax rules governing subjects not within its ambit.  Specifically, Subchapter L does not exempt insurance companies from the general corporate tax rules of Subchapter C \"[e]xcept to the extent that [Subchapter L makes] specific provisions.\"   S.Rep.

Colonial American involved the question of whether \"ceding commissions\" paid by a reinsurance company to a direct insurer under an indemnity reinsurance contract could be deducted in the year in which they were paid, or whether they had to be capitalized over the estimated life of the underlying policies.  See id. at 246-47, 109 S.Ct. at 2411.   The taxpayer argued that the ceding commissions were analogous to certain agents' commissions deductible under &#167; 809 and should be similarly deductible.  See id. at 249-50, 109 S.Ct. at 2412-13.   The IRS responded that the ceding commissions were more properly characterized as a type of capital expenditure and should, as is usual for such expenditures, be amortized over their useful life under &#167; 263.  See id. at 252-53, 109 S.Ct. at 2413-15.   The Court ruled against the taxpayer, holding that &#167; 809 did not expressly provide for the requested deduction and that &#167; 263 should apply in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary.  See id. at 260, 109 S.Ct. at 2418.   The taxpayer's argument, the Court stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>at most proves only that Congress decided to carve out an exception for agents' commissions, notwithstanding their arguable character as capital expenditures.

Thus it is UNUM's burden to demonstrate that the cash and stock distributed during the demutualization constitute deductible \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Analysis of UNUM's arguments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM's principal argument is that the cash and stock distributions constitute \"policyholder dividends\" under the plain meaning of &#167; 808, &#167; 808(b)(1) in particular, and are therefore deductible under &#167; 805(a)(3).  Bolstering this position are two overlapping contentions:  (1) the legislative history and public policy underlying the Code's scheme of life insurance taxation demonstrate that Congress intended the term \"policyholder dividend\" to include the distributions made during UNUM's demutualization;  and (2) because \"policyholder dividends\" are broader than classic corporate dividends, \"policyholder dividends\" need not possess the essential characteristics of a dividend--i.e., they are not subject to the constraints which limit the classic definition of dividends.  We reject both arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that &#167; 805(a)(3) allows life insurance companies to deduct \"policyholder dividends\" from income.  Section 805(a)(3) expressly states:  \"there shall be allowed the following deductions:  ...--The deduction for policyholder dividends ....\" &#167; 805(a)(3).  The real question, rather, is whether the definition of \"policyholder dividend\" in &#167; 808 encompasses the cash and stock distributed during UNUM's demutualization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this regard, UNUM's principal argument is that the plain meaning of &#167; 808 entitles it to deduct the amounts distributed during the demutualization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We believe that, in order to make this claim successfully, UNUM must demonstrate that the distributions satisfy both &#167; 808(a) and &#167; 808(b).  Section 808(a) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>[F]or purposes of this part, the term \"policyholder dividend\" means any dividend or similar distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167;   808(a).  Under &#167; 808(b)(1), upon which UNUM hinges the main body of its argument, a \"policyholder dividend\" may include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>any amount paid or credited (including as an increase in benefits) where the amount is not fixed in the contract but depends on the experience of the company or the discretion of the management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 808(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM asserts that the distributions easily satisfy &#167; 808(a), which, UNUM claims, merely emphasizes the broad scope of \"policyholder dividends.\"   The source of UNUM's authority for this claim is unclear.  UNUM seems to rely principally on Republic Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364198\"><a href=\"/opinion/364198/republic-national-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1979), in which the court stated that \"policyholder dividends\" have an \"expansive definition\" and \"include more than just classic dividends.\"  Id. at 532.   UNUM seems also to rely on Treas.  Reg. &#167; 1.811-2(a) (1997), which tracks the language of &#167; 808(a), as further evidence of the broad scope of the \"policyholder dividend.\"   Because \"policyholder dividends\" are \"expansive\", UNUM argues, they necessarily encompass the amounts distributed during the demutualization.  We are not persuaded by these arguments, which attempt to sweep the language of &#167; 808(a) under the table.  Rather, we think that &#167; 808(a) presents a major obstacle, which UNUM fails to overcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM argues that the real test is whether the distributions satisfy &#167; 808(b).  UNUM focuses its attention on the text of &#167; 808(b)(1), arguing:  (1) Nothing in the insurance contracts between UNUM and its policyholders addressed the amounts due to the policyholders in a demutualization;  therefore the amounts were \"not fixed in the contract\";  (2) The cash was distributed out of Union Mutual's accumulated surplus, which represents the fruits of the company's considerable business success since its founding;  therefore the amounts \"depend[ed] on the experience of the company\";  (3) Union Mutual's management, though subject to the supervision of the Maine Superintendent of Insurance and obligated to present \"fair and equitable\" terms to the policyholder, decided the amounts within that range which would be paid to policyholders in exchange for their equity interests;  therefore, the amounts were based \"on the discretion of management.\"   The combination of these circumstances, UNUM argues, satisfies the elements of &#167; 808(b)(1), and thus the distributions are \"policyholder dividends\" deductible under &#167; 805(a)(3), regardless of the general corporate tax provisions contained in Subchapter C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we recognize that UNUM's argument is plausible, we nonetheless find it unpersuasive.  As we explain later, &#167; 808(b) describes categories of distributions that may constitute policyholder dividends provided that the definition of &#167; 808(a) is met.  But UNUM has failed to satisfy us that the term \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808(a) includes value-for-value exchanges that occur during a corporate reorganization such as this.  UNUM's argument ultimately suffers from a fundamental defect:  it assumes that Congress wished to ignore the context in which the cash and stock distributions took place.  We later explain why UNUM's arguments that the distributions fit within &#167; 808(a) fail.  We first set the stage as to why Subchapter C applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.

UNUM in turn exchanged the policyholders' membership interests in Union Mutual for stock in UNUM or cash.  UNUM was financially in no worse a position after \"paying out\" $522 million worth of stock to implement the demutualization than it was before the transaction occurred.  What changed was the form of ownership, precisely the topic which capital transactions typically involve.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  As for the $130 million distributed in cash to redeem certain policyholders' interests, UNUM was left poorer.  But the Code disallows deductions for such distributions made in redemption.  See &#167; 311(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that, because UNUM's demutualization is a capital transaction, it is subject to the general corporate tax provisions of Subchapter C unless UNUM carries its burden of showing an exception.  These provisions clearly prohibit a company from deducting cash or the value of stock distributed to its policyholders in redemption of their equity interests in the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Subchapter C, the Code would clearly disallow UNUM from taking a deduction on the cash distributed during the demutualization.  Section 311 provides that a corporation that purchases shares of its stock from a shareholder ordinarily may not receive a deduction for that purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Section 311(a) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation on the distribution, with respect to its stock, of its stock (or rights to acquire its stock), or property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 311(a).  Congress reinforced the strength of this rule by enacting &#167; 162(l ) (now &#167; 162(k)) after the Fifth Circuit recognized a narrow exception in Five Star Manufacturing Co. v.

Section 162(k)(1) unreservedly prohibits corporations from taking deductions for distributions made in the course of reacquiring its stock:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>Except as provided in paragraph 2, no deduction otherwise allowable shall be allowed under this chapter for any amount paid or incurred by a corporation in connection with the reacquisition of its stock....<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 162(k)(1).  The reference to \"this chapter\" is to Chapter One of the Code (I.R.C. &#167;&#167; 1-1399), which includes both the general corporate tax provisions in Subchapter C and the insurance tax provisions in Subchapter L. While &#167; 162(k)(2) does contain some exceptions to the general rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> none of these apply to insurance companies.  By its literal terms, therefore, &#167; 162 forecloses any deduction for the cash distributed by UNUM.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Code is equally clear that UNUM may not deduct the value of the stock distributed in exchange for equity interests.

Congress could have done the same with the Code sections that directly govern UNUM's demutualization.

UNUM essentially makes a two-step argument regarding &#167; 808(a):  (1) any distribution which fits the strict language of &#167; 808(b) is a \"policyholder dividend\" for purposes of &#167; 808, regardless of the language of &#167; 808(a);  and (2) because the transaction here is a \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808, UNUM is entitled to a deduction under &#167; 805(a)(3).

Section 808(a) states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>For purposes of this part, the term \"policyholder dividend\" means any dividend or similar distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 808(a).  This text may be divided into three components.  The \"[f]or the purposes of this part\" language requires that the definition of \"policyholder dividend\" has no force beyond Part I of Subchapter L, which specifically involves the taxation of life insurance companies;  thus &#167; 808 cannot govern a transaction basically within the purview of Subchapter C. The \"any dividend or similar distribution\" language requires all \"policyholder dividends\" to possess the essential characteristics of a dividend.  Finally, the \"to policyholders in their capacity as such\" requires that the dividend-like distributions be based on the contractual relationship between the policyholder and insurer.  We interpret the language of &#167; 808(a) to mean exactly what it says.  Any distribution by an insurer to its policyholders must accordingly bear the essential characteristics of a dividend and be based on the contractual relationship between the policyholder and insurer in order to qualify as a \"policyholder dividend\".  And if &#167; 808(a) is not satisfied, then &#167; 808(b) cannot be satisfied either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM attempts to circumvent the plain meaning of &#167; 808(a) by arguing that the language of &#167; 316 specifically exempts \"policyholder dividends\" from the constraints that bind typical corporate dividends.  Section 316(a) defines the term \"dividend\" as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>For the purposes of this subtitle, the term \"dividend\" means any distribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders ... out of its earnings and profits of the taxable year....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 316(a).  By its terms, this definition of dividends applies to Subtitle A, 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1-1563, which includes the portion of the Code governing income taxation.  Section 316(b) limits the extent of the application of this definition:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>The definition in subsection (a) shall not apply to the term 'dividend' as used in Subchapter L in any case where the reference is to dividends of insurance companies paid to policyholders as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">s316(b).  UNUM argues that the language of &#167; 316(b) demonstrates that \"policyholder dividends\" have broader scope than \"dividends\" as defined in &#167; 316(a), so it would be erroneous to conclude that policyholder dividends should be deemed a type of dividend as that term is so defined.  It is true that &#167; 316(b) means that a policyholder dividend under &#167; 808 is not limited to distributions out of the insurer's earnings and profits and may include additional amounts from other sources.  But, UNUM's assertion notwithstanding, it does not follow that because \"policyholder dividends\" may include more than classic corporate dividends then \"policyholder dividends\" may therefore encompass any distribution to policyholders regardless of its context or purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  As Judge Carter appropriately noted,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>The fact that \"policyholder dividend\" is, in certain respects, broader in scope than \"classic dividend\" neither implies, nor even suggests, that Congress intended \"policyholder dividend\" to be construed broadly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM Corp. v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 20 n. 6 (D.Maine 1996).  Indeed, the term \"policyholder dividend\" is still a defined category.  That it possesses a broader scope than the term \"dividend\" as defined in &#167; 316(a) suggests only that policyholder dividends are different from ordinary corporate dividends, not that they are fundamentally unlike them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F. The distributions are not dividends</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis suggests that the lengthy debate as to whether and how policyholder dividends are like or unlike corporate dividends is largely beside the point.  All dividends, whether policyholder dividends or corporate dividends, share certain essential characteristics.  The focus should be on whether the stock and cash distributions bear the essential characteristics which qualify them as a dividend of any stripe.  We find that the cash and stock distributions at issue in this case simply are not \"policyholder dividends\" as that term is defined, because they are fundamentally not dividends or distributions similar to dividends as &#167; 808(a) requires.  Because they do not meet the definition of &#167; 808(a), &#167; 808(b) is superfluous.  Moreover, because the distributions do not meet the definition of &#167; 808(a), they are still subject to the general corporate tax rules of Subchapter C, under which they may not be deducted.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The economics of the demutualization compel this conclusion.  A dividend, even a policyholder dividend, is a unilateral distribution by a company to its owners (who, in the case of mutual life insurance companies, also happen to be customers).  No matter how large, a dividend still leaves intact the owner's equity interest in the company.  But the cash and stock distributions for which UNUM seeks a deduction were not unilateral distributions by a company to its owners.  Both were made in exchange for policyholders' membership interests in the former mutual company.  Those who received cash had their equity interests extinguished, transactions amounting to classic redemptions.

Policyholder dividends typically include a capital component in addition to earnings and Congress wished to provide a deduction for that component.  See &#167; 805(a)(3);  &#167; 809 (limiting the extent of the deduction).  But the fact that \"policyholder dividends\" may include additional components does not change the fact that they must still essentially constitute dividends as &#167; 808(a) expressly requires.  The acknowledgement reflected in &#167; 316(b) that policyholder dividends are more expansive than classic dividends does not alter this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court observed, UNUM's bootstrapping argument ignores other sources of authority on what constitutes a \"dividend.\"   In Hellmich v.

A distribution is \"not essentially equivalent to a dividend\" if it \"result[s] in a meaningful reduction of the shareholder's proportional interest in the corporation.\"  Id. In light of this authority, we do not view distributions of stock or cash by a mutual insurer in consideration for the same value of ownership interest in a mutual company to be a dividend under any definition of the term, including a \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cash distribution is not a dividend or similar to a dividend precisely because it did reduce (to zero) the ownership interest of those policyholders who received cash and left them in no position to enjoy future returns, except as policyholders.  Cf. Hellmich, 276 U.S. at 237, 48 S.Ct. at 245-46.   It was thus akin to a nondeductible distribution in redemption.  In contrast, the stock distribution was not a dividend or similar to a dividend because it was not in the nature of a \"recurrent return upon stock paid to stockholders by a going corporation in the ordinary course of business.\"  Id. Rather, it effected a conversion of one form of equity to another through a classic non-recognition exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>G. Other reasons</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that UNUM's demutualization occurred through a holding company suggests additional reasons why UNUM is also not, for other reasons, entitled to a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction.  First, UNUM, which distributed its stock to policyholders in exchange for their membership interests in Union Mutual, is not a \"life insurance company\" as defined in &#167; 816(a);  the tax consequences of the stock distributions are accordingly subject to general corporation tax provisions in Subchapter C, which disallow the deduction.  See &#167; 354(a);  &#167; 1032(a).  Second, the term \"amount paid\" in &#167; 808(b)(1) requires distributions out of the company's surplus, whereas the stock distribution came from the holding company.  Union Mutual did not actually \"pay\" anything in making that exchange.  It is true that UNUM is the sole owner of a life insurance company, but having structured the demutualization as it did, UNUM must \"accept the tax consequences of [its] choice.\"   See Commissioner v. National Alfalfa Dehydrating &amp; Milling Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109049\"><a href=\"/opinion/109049/commissioner-v-national-alfalfa-dehydrating-milling-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109049\"><a href=\"/opinion/109049/commissioner-v-national-alfalfa-dehydrating-milling-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Sections 354(a) and 1032(a) would apply to the demutualization regardless of its form, even if Union Mutual distributed stock in the new stock company in direct exchange for the membership interests of its policyholders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM's best argument may be the analogy it draws between a mutual insurance company liquidation and demutualization.  When a mutual insurance company is liquidated, its assets are distributed to the policyholders and those distributions may be called dividends.  This reorganization, the company says, is functionally equivalent to such a liquidation because Union Mutual no longer exists on completion of the demutualization. There are two responses.  The first is that the analogy does not work.  The very nature of a demutualization fundamentally distinguishes it from a liquidation in that the insurer is still in business after the conversion is complete.  In the present case, the policyholders continue to be provided insurance, albeit through a different form of company and under a different name.  Indeed, ensuring that Union Mutual would continue to meet its policyholders' reasonable expectations on the investment value of their policies was the very purpose of the PFA, which calculated the amount of assets necessary to pay policy claims, provide policyholder dividends, and satisfy whatever other benefits accrued to policyholders under their insurance contracts.  Notably, the Maine Insurance Commissioner gave his blessing to the transaction only on being assured there was sufficient capital preserved, together with premiums, to cover the insured risks in the future.  This does not happen in the usual liquidation and, indeed, demonstrates that UNUM's demutualization cannot properly be so characterized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, even if the analogy were apt in general, we have little reason to think Congress intended that final distributions of all assets to be within the definition of \"policyholder dividends\" under &#167; 808(a).  Congress could easily have provided for this deduction by enacting specific language to that effect.  Had Congress wanted to provide insurance companies with a \"policyholder dividend\" deduction for any distribution to policyholders not fixed in the contract, it could simply have defined \"policyholder dividend\" as referring to \"any distribution.\"   It would not have limited the definition to \"dividends or similar distributions\" and then left it to the insurance industry to discover massive deductions in the shadows of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we think the plain meaning of &#167; 808 works against, and not for, UNUM, and mindful of the usual rule that resort to legislative history is inappropriate in such circumstances, we do briefly explain UNUM's policy and legislative history argument.  Our primary purpose in so doing is to determine whether there is a clearly expressed legislative intention which would cause us to question application of the usual rule.  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 432 n. 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111838\"><a href=\"/opinion/111838/ins-v-cardoza-fonseca/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span> (1987).  A secondary reason is to note that UNUM's policy arguments are not implausible;  they simply do not carry UNUM's burden of showing clearly that Congress intended such a deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of its statutory argument, UNUM offers an extended account of the legislative history and public policy behind the Code's scheme of life insurance company taxation.  UNUM argues that Congress specifically created the \"policyholder dividend\" deduction to equalize the tax treatment of mutual insurers relative to stock insurers.  Under general tax rules, stock companies are not taxed on capital raised by selling stock, but may not deduct amounts paid to redeem that stock.  (No tax, no deduction) At the same time, mutual insurers must pay income tax on capital raised by charging redundant premiums;  but, absent the policyholder dividend deduction, they may not deduct amounts paid to return capital to policyholders, which typically occur through policyholder dividends.  (Tax, but no corresponding deduction) By creating the policyholder dividend deduction in &#167; 805(a)(3), UNUM explains, Congress intended to create symmetry in the taxation of mutual insurers and thus provide equal tax treatment for both mutual and stock insurers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM emphasizes the expansiveness of \"policyholder dividends\" by contrasting them with a \"return premium\".  Return premiums are refunds that occur when a policy is cancelled, where the amount of the refund generally represents that portion of paid premiums not applied to the purchase of coverage up to the time of cancellation.  Robert A. Keeton &amp; Alan I. Widiss, Insurance Law:  A Guide to Fundamental Principles, Legal Doctrines, &amp; Commercial Practices &#167; 5.11(d)(2) (1988).  UNUM explains that these amounts are \"fixed in the contract\" in that they are based on the terms of the contract.  \"Policyholder dividends\" are, in contrast, any amounts not fixed in the contract, i.e., any distributions from surplus (that depend on the experience of the company or the discretion of management) that are not return premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Subchapter L, UNUM explains, Congress divided amounts returned to policyholders into the categories of \"return premiums\" and \"policyholder dividend\".  Return premiums are deductible, because they contain a return of premiums.  Policyholder dividends are also deductible, because, like return premiums, they are in part returns of capital.  Policyholder dividends are only deductible in part, however, because they can also contain earnings from the investment of the premiums which are nondeductible under general tax law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To account for this, UNUM argues, Congress created an expansive definition of \"policyholder dividend\" in &#167; 808 and enacted &#167; 809 to control the extent of the deduction, since the expansive language does not admit limitation.  UNUM claims that &#167; 809 is the sole mechanism by which policyholder dividends should be limited, not through judicial construction of the scope of the definition of \"policyholder dividend\" under &#167; 808.  Policyholder dividends should be, in effect, any distribution that a mutual insurer makes to policyholders out of surplus for any reason, and only the terms of &#167; 809 limit the reach of the deduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UNUM argues that the facts that Congress created the policyholder dividend deduction to achieve a tax symmetry and that Congress accordingly defined \"policyholder dividend\" to possess broad scope necessarily compels the conclusion that \"policyholder dividends\" must even include distributions to policyholders that are fundamentally not dividends.  We believe this conclusion is unsupported by the text or policies underlying the statute.  UNUM's analysis of the legislative history and public policy underlying the insurance tax provisions of the Code suffers from the same flaw that undermines its statutory argument.  Nothing UNUM cites supports the proposition that Congress intended the term \"policyholder dividends\" to encompass value-for-value exchanges occurring during a corporate reorganization.  UNUM's argument fails not because its relies on erroneous facts, but rather because those facts simply do not support the conclusions UNUM wishes to draw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, the mere fact that \"policyholder dividends\" are not \"fixed\" by the terms of an insurance contract does not mean that they include any distribution that a mutual insurer makes to its policyholders in any capacity.  Under &#167; 808(a), in order for a distribution to qualify as a \"policyholder dividend\", the distribution must occur to policyholders \"in their capacity as such\"--i.e., in their capacity as policyholders, not owners.  The distribution must also fundamentally be a \"dividend or similar distribution.\"   For the reasons explained in the balance of the opinion, we believe that the cash and stock distributions made by UNUM were not dividends.  Rather, the cash distribution constituted a nondeductible distribution in redemption, while the stock distribution was part of a non-recognition exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Colonial American, the Supreme Court faced a case similar to this one.  As here, the taxpayer made a colorable argument that Subsection L provided for tax treatment that general tax law otherwise prohibited.  Similarly, the IRS responded that the basic policies and structure of the Code defeated the taxpayer's argument.  The Supreme Court, explaining its decision in favor of the IRS, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p>It cannot be denied that the language on which petitioner relies, taken in isolation, could be read to authorize the tax treatment it seeks....  But when the statutory and regulatory language is parsed more carefully, petitioner's position becomes dubious, and when the language is read against the background of the statutory structure, it becomes untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colonial American, 491 U.S. at 257, 109 S.Ct. at 2417.   We believe the same to be true in this case.  To accept UNUM's arguments \"we would have to conclude that Congress subsumed a major deduction within the fine details of its definition\" of the policyholder dividend.  Id. at 260, 109 S.Ct. at 2418.   We do not believe that Congress intended to conceal in &#167; 808 a deduction of this magnitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INDOPCO requires a taxpayer to carry the burden of proof that it is entitled to a claimed deduction.

Thereafter, the insurer may not distribute any earnings or proceeds developed within that block to stockholders.

I.R.C. &#167; 317(b), providing that \"[f]or purposes of this part, stock shall be treated as redeemed by a corporation if the corporation acquires its stock from a shareholder in exchange for property, whether or not the stock so acquired is cancelled, retired, or held as treasury stock.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Section 162(k)(2) provides that:</p>\n        <p>(2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to--</p>\n        <p>(A) Certain deductions.--Any--</p>\n        <p>(i) deduction allowable under section 162 (relating to interest)</p>\n        <p>(ii) deduction for amounts which are properly allocable to indebtedness and amortized over the term of such indebtedness, or</p>\n        <p>(iii) deduction for dividends paid (within the meaning of section 561)</p>\n        <p>(B) Stock of certain regulated investment companies.--Any amount paid or incurred in connection with the redemption of any stock in a regulated investment company which issues only stock which is redeemable upon the demand of the shareholder.</p>\n        <p>The \"dividends paid\" deduction under &#167; 561 does not include policyholder dividends, but only includes dividends as described in &#167; 316 \"relating to [the] definition of dividends for purposes of corporate distributions\".  &#167;  562(a).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The legislative history of &#167; 162 supports the conclusion that &#167; 162(k) forecloses a deduction for UNUM in this case.  The Committee Report suggests that Congress intended &#167; 162(l ) (now &#167; 162(k)) to be construed broadly to foreclose any deduction for payments in connection with redemptions, except for those specifically enumerated in the statute</p>\n        <p>The conferees intend that the denial of deductibility will apply to amounts paid in connection with a purchase of stock in a corporation, whether paid by the corporation directly or indirectly, e.g., by a controlling shareholder, commonly controlled subsidiary or related party.</p>\n        <p>The conferees wish to clarify that, while the phrase \"in connection with [a] redemption\" is intended to be construed broadly, the provision is not intended to deny a deduction for otherwise deductible amounts paid in a transaction that has no nexus with the redemption other than being proximate in time or arising out of the same general circumstances.</p>\n        <p>H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 99-841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess at II-168, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4075, 4256.   In this case, there is a clearly established nexus in that the payment \"does ... represent consideration for the [membership interests] or expense related to [their] acquisition....\"  Id. at 4257.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> UNUM cites dicta in Republic Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364198\"><a href=\"/opinion/364198/republic-national-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 532 (5th Cir.1979), describing the \"policyholder dividend\" as \"expansive.\"   Because policyholder dividends are \"expansive,\" UNUM argues, policyholder dividends can encompass even value-for-value exchanges that occur during a corporate recapitalization.  This argument misapprehends the meaning of Republic Nat'l Life.   In that case, the court was referring to the fact that the definition of \"policyholder dividend\" is expansive relative to the \"classic dividend\" definition, adding that \"Congress intended to include more than just classic dividends\" within policyholder dividends.

The PFA, a crucial element in the decision of the Maine Insurance Commissioner to approve this transaction, is an accounting mechanism which recognizes (in the common sense of the word) that policyholder dividend expectations may be segregated from other ownership interests and the two are not equivalent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The one aspect of the demutualization involving the stock of a life insurance company was the transaction between the new stock life insurer, UNUM Life, and the holding company, UNUM, in which the stock company exchanged 100% of its shares for 100% of the membership interest in Union Mutual.  A transaction between two corporations can not come within the rubric of &#167; 808, which involves distributions to \"policyholders in their capacity as such.\"   Instead, it constitutes a recapitalization under &#167; 368(a)(1)(E), as the IRS confirmed, in response to UNUM's request, in Priv.
