The  plaintiff\r                    SKINNER,   Senior  District   Judge.\r                                                       \r\n\noriginally  brought  this  action against  his  former  employer,\r\n\nLucent Technologies,  Inc. (Lucent),  in the  Superior Court  for\r\n\nEssex County, Massachusetts, in aid of a pending claim before the\r\n\nMassachusetts Commission  Against  Discrimination  (MCAD).    The\r\n\nrelief  sought by  the terms  of  the complaint  was a  temporary\r\n\ninjunction  (1)  permitting   him  to  return  to  work   with  a\r\n\n\"reasonable accommodation\" for his  disability and (2)  requiring\r\n\nLucent  to  toll the  90-day  deadline for  applying  for various\r\n\nbenefits.   The plaintiff  relies on Massachusetts  General Laws,\r\n\nch. 151B,   9 and the Americans With Disabilities  Act, 42 U.S.C.\r\n\n  12111 et  seq.  The  defendant removed the  case to the  United\r                         \r\n\nStates  District Court, alleging a federal question and diversity\r\n\nof citizenship.  The plaintiff is a resident of New Hampshire and\r\n\nLucent  is  a  Delaware corporation  having  a  regular place  of\r\n\nbusiness in Massachusetts.\r\n\n          The  district  court  made findings  of  likelihood  of\r\n\nsuccess on  the merits, irreparable harm and  absence of hardship\r\n\nto the defendant.  It  entered a preliminary injunction requiring\r\n\nLucent to allow the  plaintiff to return to part-time  work for a\r\n\n\"provisional\" period  of four  weeks and  tolling the period  for\r\n\napplying for  various benefits for  the same period.   So much of\r\n\nthe order as required Lucent to allow the plaintiff to work part-\r\n\ntime was stayed pending appeal.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The  district  court   had  original  federal  question\r\n\njurisdiction  of  this  action,  and  this  court  has  appellate\r\n\njurisdiction.  28 U.S.C.    1331, 1441 and 1292(a)(1).\r\n\n                       STANDARDS OF REVIEW\r                                 STANDARDS OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We have  extensively  addressed the  criteria  for  the\r\n\nissuance of a preliminary  injunction and the scope  of appellate\r\n\nreview in a long series of cases, e.g.:\r\n\n            In  the  typical  case,  a  party   seeking\r\n          preliminary  injunctive  relief  must  prove:\r\n          (1) a  substantial likelihood  of success  on\r\n          the  merits;   (2)  a  significant   risk  of\r\n          irreparable   harm  if   the  injunction   is\r\n          withheld;   (3)   a  favorable   balance   of\r\n          hardships; (4) a fit (or at least, a  lack of\r\n          friction)  between  the  injunction  and  the\r\n          public interest. . . . We review the district\r\n          court's grant of a preliminary injunction for\r\n          a mistake of law or abuse of discretion.\r\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Comm'n  v. Astra USA, Inc., 94  F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n738, 743 (1st Cir. 1996)  (citations omitted).\r\n\n          In  its   brief,  Lucent  identifies   the  plaintiff's\r\n\nlikelihood of success  and his risk of irreparable  injury as the\r\n\ntwo issues presented for review.  The other two criteria, balance\r\n\nof hardship and the public interest, therefore, are not issues in\r\n\nthis appeal.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The following summary of the evidence is taken from the\r\n\nverified  complaint, the verified  complaint before the  MCAD and\r\n\nvarious affidavits submitted  to the district  court.  While  the\r\n\nunderlying  claim is  not at  issue in  this appeal,  we consider\r\n\nthese allegations  as relevant  background to  our resolution  of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthis appeal.  We take the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n\nthe plaintiff-appellee.\r\n\n          The   plaintiff  was   employed  by   Lucent  and   its\r\n\npredecessor entities for twenty-four years.  He  was a \"Composite\r\n\nMaster Tradesworker,\"  i.e.,  an expert  carpenter,  assigned  to\r\n\nLucent's   Merrimack   Valley   facility    in   North   Andover,\r\n\nMassachusetts,   and  he  was  represented  by  a  local  of  the\r\n\nCommunications  Workers  of  America  union  under  a  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement.  He was eligible for 52 weeks of disability\r\n\nleave at  full pay  under his  employer's \"Sickness  and Accident\r\n\nDisability Benefit Plan.\" \r\n\n          In April of  1996, plaintiff had a mental breakdown and\r\n\nwent on  paid disability leave.  He had  been able to attend work\r\n\nonly briefly in June and July of 1997.  Plaintiff  attributes his\r\n\ndisability to sexual harassment by other Lucent employees.\r\n\n          According  to a  complaint he  filed  with the  MCAD in\r\n\nSeptember of  1996, the  plaintiff had  been subjected  to sexual\r\n\nharassment  by his  male co-workers and  his male  supervisor for\r\n\nfive to six years.  He identified six harassers by name.  The co-\r\n\nworkers made the  plaintiff the butt of crude  and derisive jokes\r\n\nabout being a homosexual and a  child molester.  The plaintiff is\r\n\nneither  a  homosexual  nor  a child  molester.    The harassment\r\n\nincluded offensive touching by his supervisor and others.\r\n\n          At one point,  the name \"Tookie\"  was inscribed on  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  locker.  This  graffiti was  a  reference  to Tookie\r\n\nAmirault,  a  man convicted  of  child  molestation in  a  highly\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\npublicized case.   The plaintiff's co-workers called  him by this\r\n\nname.  The plaintiff's supervisor  did not act on the plaintiff's\r\n\nrequests  for redress, and  even participated in  the harassment.\r\n\nAccording to the MCAD complaint, the last  instance of harassment\r\n\noccurred on April 9, 1996.  The plaintiff discovered that someone\r\n\nhad placed on his truck a picture of a man  in his underwear.  He\r\n\nbrought the photo to  his supervisor, said that he could not take\r\n\nit   anymore,  and went  home.   Thereafter,  the plaintiff  made\r\n\nattempts on his own life and was hospitalized several times.\r\n\n          In  July  of  1996, the  plaintiff  consulted  Dr. Jack\r\n\nDanielian,  a  psychologist.     He  was  diagnosed   with  major\r\n\ndepression and post-traumatic  stress disorder.   In late October\r\n\nor November  of  1996, he  consulted  with Rowen  Hochstedler,  a\r\n\npsychiatrist  at  a   Newburyport  hospital.     Dr.  Hochstedler\r\n\nprescribed medication, but discontinued it in early 1997, because\r\n\nthe plaintiff functioned well without it, and it was likely to do\r\n\nmore harm than good.\r\n\n          Lucent notified the plaintiff in March of 1997 that his\r\n\ndisability benefits would expire on May 27, 1997.   He sought and\r\n\nobtained from Dr. Danielian and Dr. Hochstedler medical clearance\r\n\nto return to work  in April.  Dr. Morin, a  psychiatrist hired by\r\n\nLucent,  recommended  that  he  be  kept  away from  his  alleged\r\n\nharassers upon his return.\r\n\n          Dr. Waugh, a  general practice physician who  serves as\r\n\nMedical Director at  Lucent's Merrimack  Valley facility  finally\r\n\nauthorized  the  plaintiff's return  to  work  on May  23,  1997.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nConsistent   with  the   plaintiff's  wishes   and   Dr.  Morin's\r\n\nrecommendation, he  was assigned to  a new  work site with  a new\r\n\nsupervisor named Robert Bartley.\r\n\n          The plaintiff was  to work five days a week, 6:30 a. m.\r\n\nto 3:00  p. m.   His  first day,  May 23,  was the Friday  before\r\n\nMemorial Day weekend.  He completed the day without incident.   A\r\n\nhuman  resources officer for Lucent named Sheila Landers met with\r\n\nthe  plaintiff that day  and ordered  him to  stay away  from his\r\n\nformer co-workers.\r\n\n          The next workday was Tuesday,  May 27.  Ms. Landers met\r\n\nwith the plaintiff's former co-workers and told them to stay away\r\n\nfrom him.  No disciplinary  action was imposed for their conduct.\r\n\nThat morning, the plaintiff returned  to his former locker at his\r\n\nold work  site and found  the words \"Tooky's Toys\"  (or \"Tookie's\r\n\nToys\") inscribed in the locker.  According to his affidavit, this\r\n\ninscription was probably present before his disability leave, but\r\n\nit was different from the  inscription \"Tookie\" on the outside of\r\n\nhis locker which was  referred to in his MCAD complaint and which\r\n\nhe says he had removed himself.\r\n\n          The plaintiff  was upset by  the inscription to  such a\r\n\ndegree that  he could  not continue  with work.   He  reported to\r\n\nLucent's medical department, saw Dr.  Waugh, and was sent home at\r\n\n8:10 a. m.\r\n\n          The plaintiff returned to work the next day, Wednesday,\r\n\nMay 28.  He met with Dr.  Waugh and they agreed to meet weekly to\r\n\nmonitor his progress.  The  plaintiff worked the remainder of the\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nweek.  He used  some of his paid personal time to leave two hours\r\n\nearly on Friday, May  30.  He worked a full day  on the following\r\n\nMonday, June 2.\r\n\n          On the morning of Tuesday, June 3, the plaintiff became\r\n\nemotionally distraught  and went  home with  the  consent of  his\r\n\nsupervisor  at about 8:30  a. m.   Without giving any  names, the\r\n\nplaintiff ascribed his distress to people giving him dirty looks.\r\n\nBy  a subsequent affidavit  he explained that the  wife of one of\r\n\nthe  men he accused of harassment had given him hostile looks and\r\n\ntwo male employees appeared to be smirking at him and laughing.\r\n\n          As  he  departed, the  plaintiff had  some conversation\r\n\nwith his supervisor in which the possibility of a temporary part-\r\n\ntime schedule was discussed.   Bartley suggested he use  vacation\r\n\ntime to fill in a part-time  schedule until he got used to  being\r\n\nback at work.\r\n\n          The   plaintiff  remained   home  the   following  day,\r\n\nWednesday, June 4.  He expressed a desire to return to work.\r\n\n          Dr. Danielian, the psychologist treating the plaintiff,\r\n\nspoke to  Dr.  Waugh on  the  telephone.   They agreed  that  the\r\n\nplaintiff  should  see Dr. Hochstedler.  Later  that day, Bartley\r\n\nspoke  to  Dr.   Waugh  and  an  employee  of  Lucent's  benefits\r\n\ndepartment named Lina  McLaughlin.  Dr. Waugh said  he would need\r\n\ninput  from the  plaintiff's  treating  physicians  in  order  to\r\n\nauthorize the plaintiff's return to work.\r\n\n          Mr.  Bartley  and Lina  McLaughlin then  telephoned the\r\n\nplaintiff and  told him  he would need  Dr. Waugh's  clearance to\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nreturn to work, else he would be removed from the payroll because\r\n\nhe had run out of disability benefits.\r\n\n          On Thursday, June  5, the plaintiff reported  for work.\r\n\nDr.  Waugh refused  to authorize  his  return.   Mr. Bartley  and\r\n\nMs. McLaughlin  then met  with  him  and told  him  he had  three\r\n\noptions:\r\n\n          (i) apply  for a disability  pension pursuant\r\n          to the pension plan;\r\n\n          (ii) apply for  disability payments under the\r\n          long-term disability plan; or\r\n\n          (iii)  take an  additional unpaid  disability\r\n          leave for up to  six months to allow  for the\r\n          possibility of a recovery permitting a return\r\n          to work.\r\n\n          Later  that   day,  the   plaintiff's  counsel   called\r\n\nDr. Danielian  and informed  him  of  the  ultimatum put  to  the\r\n\nplaintiff.    Dr. Danielian  called  Dr.  Waugh.   Dr.  Danielian\r\n\nreports by affidavit that Dr. Waugh disclaimed responsibility for\r\n\nthe decision  to turn the  plaintiff away.   On  Monday, June  9,\r\n\nplaintiff's counsel made a demand to Lucent that the plaintiff be\r\n\nafforded the  accommodation of a  temporary return to  work part-\r\n\ntime.\r\n\n          At  this point the  record reveals a  series of letters\r\n\nand  affidavits  from the  plaintiff's  treating  therapists, Dr.\r\n\nDanielian (psychologist) and Dr.  Hochstedler (psychiatrist), the\r\n\ngist of which may be summarized as follows:\r\n\n          1.   The plaintiff  is fit to go  to work, part-time at\r\n\nthe outset, with  the likelihood of full-time work  as he adjusts\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nto the return to the workplace.  A trial period of part-time work\r\n\nwould be a reasonable accommodation to his disability.\r\n\n          2.  The  plaintiff is likely to function better without\r\n\nmedication.\r\n\n          3.  Facing up to the reality  of returning to Lucent is\r\n\na  critical factor in curing the plaintiff's depression, although\r\n\nit is likely that his progress would be uneven.\r\n\n          4.  Delay in return to work will tend to exacerbate his\r\n\ncondition.1\r\n\n          A psychiatrist,  hired by Lucent, and  Lucent's medical\r\n\ndirector ultimately expressed  contrary views, and the  plaintiff\r\n\nwas not permitted to return to part-time work.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff's  therapists  were qualified  in  their\r\n\nrespective fields, and the district judge, as finder of fact, was\r\n\nentitled to accept their opinions, which she did.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.

Id. 102 F.3d at 19.\r                                        \r\n\n          The district judge made the following finding:\r\n\n            \"I also  find that  Ralph has  demonstrated\r\n          irreparable harm.   Though  losses occasioned\r\n          by  employment disputes often  do not rise to\r\n          the level  of irreparable harm,  Ralph's case\r\n          is  different for  two  reasons.   First, the\r\n          harassment Ralph suffered at  Lucent played a\r\n          significant role  in his breakdown.   Medical\r\n          evidence suggests  that returning to  work is\r\n          essential to his  recovery.  Second,  Ralph's\r\n          disability  will worsen the  longer he is out\r\n          of  work.   These  circumstances  distinguish\r\n          Ralph's case from the standard discrimination\r\n          lawsuit.\"\r\n\nWe agree.\r\n\nC.  Preemption\r                        \r\n\n          The defendant's  first preemption argument  is that the\r\n\nplaintiff's claim  is  preempted  by  the  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement between the  plaintiff's union and Lucent  which, among\r\n\nother  things, provides  a grievance  and arbitration  procedure.\r\n\nLabor Management  Act,    301, 29  U.S.C.    185.   This argument\r\n\nfails,  however,  because the  present  controversy  concerns the\r\n\nplaintiff's rights under  state and federal statutes  which exist\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nindependently of the  collective bargaining agreement and  do not\r\n\nrequire interpretation of  that agreement.

We note:\r\n\n            \"It  is doubtful  whether without  the last\r\n          quoted  proviso, [defendant]  would have  any\r\n          plausible   claim   of   federal  preemption.\r\n          Massachusetts has an  independent interest in\r\n          regulating injury compensation and apart from\r\n          the  proviso the  elements  of  both [of  the\r\n          plaintiff's]   state-law claims appear  to be\r\n          independent    of    bargaining     agreement\r\n          provisions.\" \r\n\nId. at 41.\r            \r\n\n          In Reese v.

We hold that these\r\n\nrights  are  not to  be  preempted by  the  collective bargaining\r\n\nagreement.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n          Secondly,  the  defendant  asserts  preemption  by  the\r\n\nEmployment  Retirement Income  Security  Act  (ERISA), 29  U.S.C.\r\n\n1144(A).

Such  is normally  the case\r\n          with    respect    to   laws    of    general\r\n          applicability. . . .  A court cannot conclude\r\n          that   a  state   law  is   one   of  general\r\n          applicability, and  as such is  not preempted\r\n          by ERISA,  based on the form or  label of the\r\n          law, however.  Absent precedent on a  closely\r\n          related problem,  the inquiry into  whether a\r\n          state law \"relates to\" an   ERISA  plan or is\r\n          merely  \"tenuous,   remote,  or   peripheral\"\r\n          requires  a court to look at the facts of [a]\r\n          particular case.\r\n\nSee also Rozzell v.

Supp. 377,  380 (N.D.  Ill. 1994).   In  this  case, the  only\r\n\nimpact on Lucent's  ERISA plan is the  extension of time to  make\r\n\napplication for certain  benefits.  No variation in  the terms of\r\n\nbenefits or their application is implicated.  The Seventh Circuit\r\n\nhas held that the time limits under an ERISA plan are  subject to\r\n\nequitable tolling.

The other two criteria, balance\r\n\nof hardship and the public interest, therefore, are not issues in\r\n\nthis appeal.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The following summary of the evidence is taken from the\r\n\nverified  complaint, the verified  complaint before the  MCAD and\r\n\nvarious affidavits submitted  to the district  court.  While  the\r\n\nunderlying  claim is  not at  issue in  this appeal,  we consider\r\n\nthese allegations  as relevant  background to  our resolution  of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthis appeal.  We take the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n\nthe plaintiff-appellee.\r\n\n          The   plaintiff  was   employed  by   Lucent  and   its\r\n\npredecessor entities for twenty-four years.  He  was a \"Composite\r\n\nMaster Tradesworker,\"  i.e.,  an expert  carpenter,  assigned  to\r\n\nLucent's   Merrimack   Valley   facility    in   North   Andover,\r\n\nMassachusetts,   and  he  was  represented  by  a  local  of  the\r\n\nCommunications  Workers  of  America  union  under  a  collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement.  He was eligible for 52 weeks of disability\r\n\nleave at  full pay  under his  employer's \"Sickness  and Accident\r\n\nDisability Benefit Plan.\" \r\n\n          In April of  1996, plaintiff had a mental breakdown and\r\n\nwent on  paid disability leave.  He had  been able to attend work\r\n\nonly briefly in June and July of 1997.  Plaintiff  attributes his\r\n\ndisability to sexual harassment by other Lucent employees.\r\n\n          According  to a  complaint he  filed  with the  MCAD in\r\n\nSeptember of  1996, the  plaintiff had  been subjected  to sexual\r\n\nharassment  by his  male co-workers and  his male  supervisor for\r\n\nfive to six years.  He identified six harassers by name.  The co-\r\n\nworkers made the  plaintiff the butt of crude  and derisive jokes\r\n\nabout being a homosexual and a  child molester.  The plaintiff is\r\n\nneither  a  homosexual  nor  a child  molester.    The harassment\r\n\nincluded offensive touching by his supervisor and others.\r\n\n          At one point,  the name \"Tookie\"  was inscribed on  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  locker.  This  graffiti was  a  reference  to Tookie\r\n\nAmirault,  a  man convicted  of  child  molestation in  a  highly\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\npublicized case.   The plaintiff's co-workers called  him by this\r\n\nname.  The plaintiff's supervisor  did not act on the plaintiff's\r\n\nrequests  for redress, and  even participated in  the harassment.\r\n\nAccording to the MCAD complaint, the last  instance of harassment\r\n\noccurred on April 9, 1996.  The plaintiff discovered that someone\r\n\nhad placed on his truck a picture of a man  in his underwear.  He\r\n\nbrought the photo to  his supervisor, said that he could not take\r\n\nit   anymore,  and went  home.   Thereafter,  the plaintiff  made\r\n\nattempts on his own life and was hospitalized several times.\r\n\n          In  July  of  1996, the  plaintiff  consulted  Dr. Jack\r\n\nDanielian,  a  psychologist.     He  was  diagnosed   with  major\r\n\ndepression and post-traumatic  stress disorder.   In late October\r\n\nor November  of  1996, he  consulted  with Rowen  Hochstedler,  a\r\n\npsychiatrist  at  a   Newburyport  hospital.     Dr.  Hochstedler\r\n\nprescribed medication, but discontinued it in early 1997, because\r\n\nthe plaintiff functioned well without it, and it was likely to do\r\n\nmore harm than good.\r\n\n          Lucent notified the plaintiff in March of 1997 that his\r\n\ndisability benefits would expire on May 27, 1997.   He sought and\r\n\nobtained from Dr. Danielian and Dr. Hochstedler medical clearance\r\n\nto return to work  in April.  Dr. Morin, a  psychiatrist hired by\r\n\nLucent,  recommended  that  he  be  kept  away from  his  alleged\r\n\nharassers upon his return.\r\n\n          Dr. Waugh, a  general practice physician who  serves as\r\n\nMedical Director at  Lucent's Merrimack  Valley facility  finally\r\n\nauthorized  the  plaintiff's return  to  work  on May  23,  1997.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nConsistent   with  the   plaintiff's  wishes   and   Dr.  Morin's\r\n\nrecommendation, he  was assigned to  a new  work site with  a new\r\n\nsupervisor named Robert Bartley.\r\n\n          The plaintiff was  to work five days a week, 6:30 a. m.\r\n\nto 3:00  p. m.   His  first day,  May 23,  was the Friday  before\r\n\nMemorial Day weekend.  He completed the day without incident.   A\r\n\nhuman  resources officer for Lucent named Sheila Landers met with\r\n\nthe  plaintiff that day  and ordered  him to  stay away  from his\r\n\nformer co-workers.\r\n\n          The next workday was Tuesday,  May 27.  Ms. Landers met\r\n\nwith the plaintiff's former co-workers and told them to stay away\r\n\nfrom him.  No disciplinary  action was imposed for their conduct.\r\n\nThat morning, the plaintiff returned  to his former locker at his\r\n\nold work  site and found  the words \"Tooky's Toys\"  (or \"Tookie's\r\n\nToys\") inscribed in the locker.  According to his affidavit, this\r\n\ninscription was probably present before his disability leave, but\r\n\nit was different from the  inscription \"Tookie\" on the outside of\r\n\nhis locker which was  referred to in his MCAD complaint and which\r\n\nhe says he had removed himself.\r\n\n          The plaintiff  was upset by  the inscription to  such a\r\n\ndegree that  he could  not continue  with work.   He  reported to\r\n\nLucent's medical department, saw Dr.  Waugh, and was sent home at\r\n\n8:10 a. m.\r\n\n          The plaintiff returned to work the next day, Wednesday,\r\n\nMay 28.  He met with Dr.  Waugh and they agreed to meet weekly to\r\n\nmonitor his progress.  The  plaintiff worked the remainder of the\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nweek.  He used  some of his paid personal time to leave two hours\r\n\nearly on Friday, May  30.  He worked a full day  on the following\r\n\nMonday, June 2.\r\n\n          On the morning of Tuesday, June 3, the plaintiff became\r\n\nemotionally distraught  and went  home with  the  consent of  his\r\n\nsupervisor  at about 8:30  a. m.   Without giving any  names, the\r\n\nplaintiff ascribed his distress to people giving him dirty looks.\r\n\nBy  a subsequent affidavit  he explained that the  wife of one of\r\n\nthe  men he accused of harassment had given him hostile looks and\r\n\ntwo male employees appeared to be smirking at him and laughing.\r\n\n          As  he  departed, the  plaintiff had  some conversation\r\n\nwith his supervisor in which the possibility of a temporary part-\r\n\ntime schedule was discussed.   Bartley suggested he use  vacation\r\n\ntime to fill in a part-time  schedule until he got used to  being\r\n\nback at work.\r\n\n          The   plaintiff  remained   home  the   following  day,\r\n\nWednesday, June 4.  He expressed a desire to return to work.\r\n\n          Dr. Danielian, the psychologist treating the plaintiff,\r\n\nspoke to  Dr.  Waugh on  the  telephone.   They agreed  that  the\r\n\nplaintiff  should  see Dr. Hochstedler.  Later  that day, Bartley\r\n\nspoke  to  Dr.   Waugh  and  an  employee  of  Lucent's  benefits\r\n\ndepartment named Lina  McLaughlin.  Dr. Waugh said  he would need\r\n\ninput  from the  plaintiff's  treating  physicians  in  order  to\r\n\nauthorize the plaintiff's return to work.\r\n\n          Mr.  Bartley  and Lina  McLaughlin then  telephoned the\r\n\nplaintiff and  told him  he would need  Dr. Waugh's  clearance to\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nreturn to work, else he would be removed from the payroll because\r\n\nhe had run out of disability benefits.\r\n\n          On Thursday, June  5, the plaintiff reported  for work.\r\n\nDr.  Waugh refused  to authorize  his  return.   Mr. Bartley  and\r\n\nMs. McLaughlin  then met  with  him  and told  him  he had  three\r\n\noptions:\r\n\n          (i) apply  for a disability  pension pursuant\r\n          to the pension plan;\r\n\n          (ii) apply for  disability payments under the\r\n          long-term disability plan; or\r\n\n          (iii)  take an  additional unpaid  disability\r\n          leave for up to  six months to allow  for the\r\n          possibility of a recovery permitting a return\r\n          to work.\r\n\n          Later  that   day,  the   plaintiff's  counsel   called\r\n\nDr. Danielian  and informed  him  of  the  ultimatum put  to  the\r\n\nplaintiff.    Dr. Danielian  called  Dr.  Waugh.   Dr.  Danielian\r\n\nreports by affidavit that Dr. Waugh disclaimed responsibility for\r\n\nthe decision  to turn the  plaintiff away.   On  Monday, June  9,\r\n\nplaintiff's counsel made a demand to Lucent that the plaintiff be\r\n\nafforded the  accommodation of a  temporary return to  work part-\r\n\ntime.\r\n\n          At  this point the  record reveals a  series of letters\r\n\nand  affidavits  from the  plaintiff's  treating  therapists, Dr.\r\n\nDanielian (psychologist) and Dr.  Hochstedler (psychiatrist), the\r\n\ngist of which may be summarized as follows:\r\n\n          1.   The plaintiff  is fit to go  to work, part-time at\r\n\nthe outset, with  the likelihood of full-time work  as he adjusts\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nto the return to the workplace.  A trial period of part-time work\r\n\nwould be a reasonable accommodation to his disability.\r\n\n          2.  The  plaintiff is likely to function better without\r\n\nmedication.\r\n\n          3.  Facing up to the reality  of returning to Lucent is\r\n\na  critical factor in curing the plaintiff's depression, although\r\n\nit is likely that his progress would be uneven.\r\n\n          4.  Delay in return to work will tend to exacerbate his\r\n\ncondition.1\r\n\n          A psychiatrist,  hired by Lucent, and  Lucent's medical\r\n\ndirector ultimately expressed  contrary views, and the  plaintiff\r\n\nwas not permitted to return to part-time work.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff's  therapists  were qualified  in  their\r\n\nrespective fields, and the district judge, as finder of fact, was\r\n\nentitled to accept their opinions, which she did.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.

First, the\r\n          harassment Ralph suffered at  Lucent played a\r\n          significant role  in his breakdown.   Medical\r\n          evidence suggests  that returning to  work is\r\n          essential to his  recovery.  Second,  Ralph's\r\n          disability  will worsen the  longer he is out\r\n          of  work.   These  circumstances  distinguish\r\n          Ralph's case from the standard discrimination\r\n          lawsuit.\"\r\n\nWe agree.\r\n\nC.  Preemption\r                        \r\n\n          The defendant's  first preemption argument  is that the\r\n\nplaintiff's claim  is  preempted  by  the  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement between the  plaintiff's union and Lucent  which, among\r\n\nother  things, provides  a grievance  and arbitration  procedure.\r\n\nLabor Management  Act,    301, 29  U.S.C.    185.   This argument\r\n\nfails,  however,  because the  present  controversy  concerns the\r\n\nplaintiff's rights under  state and federal statutes  which exist\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nindependently of the  collective bargaining agreement and  do not\r\n\nrequire interpretation of  that agreement.
