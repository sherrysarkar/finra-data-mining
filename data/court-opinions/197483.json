This breach of\r\n\ncontract case is a product of the renovation and expansion of\r\n\nthe Ambassador Plaza Hotel and Casino (formerly a Howard\r\n\nJohnson Hotel) in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Plaintiff-appellant\r\n\nTaber Partners I is the owner of the hotel. Its two partners\r\n\nare A. Eugene Romano and his daughter, Linda Romano.\r\n\nDefendant-appellee and cross-appellant Merit Builders, Inc. was\r\n\nthe general contractor. John Schlump, one of the two owners of\r\n\nMerit, directed the construction and reconstruction work on the\r\n\nhotel.\r\n\n          On January 18, 1989, Taber entered into a \"cost-plus\"\r\n\nconstruction contract with Merit whereby Merit became the\r\n\ngeneral contractor for the renovation and expansion of the\r\n\nhotel. Prior to this, Schlump had been retained as a\r\n\nconsultant by Eugene Romano to advise him how to proceed with\r\n\nthe proposed reconstruction and expansion. The \"cost-plus\"\r\n\ncontract was followed by a fixed price contract; both contracts\r\n\nwere collectively called the Tower contract. A third contract\r\n\nwas entered into by the parties for finish work on the casino,\r\n\ntwo restaurants, and the hotel lobby.\r\n\n          On February 20, 1991, Taber filed a complaint in the\r\n\nfederal district court of Puerto Rico alleging breach of\r\n\ncontract by reason of delay, defective performance, and\r\n\nnegligent workmanship. There was also a claim for fraud and\r\n\ndeceit. The complaint was amended twice; the causes of action\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nremained essentially the same. At some point, it is not clear\r\n\nfrom the record just when, Taber sued the Insurance Company of\r\n\nNorth America under the performance bond INA issued for the\r\n\nTower contract.\r\n\n          Merit brought a counterclaim against Taber alleging\r\n\nmultiple breaches of contract, a claim based on Taber's alleged\r\n\ndelays and changes in the scope and nature of the work\r\n\ncontracted for, and fraud. Merit also brought a third-party\r\n\naction against Desarrollos Metropolitanos, S.E., the concrete\r\n\nsubcontractor. It brought another third-party complaint\r\n\nagainst Victor Torres and Associates, the inspectors of the\r\n\nwork, alleging breach of duty and tortious interference with\r\n\nthe performance of the contracts between Taber and Merit.\r\n\n          After a fourteen-week trial, the jury returned a\r\n\nverdict finding that Merit was not liable to Taber. It further\r\n\nfound that Taber owed Merit $1,597,414.00 for breach of\r\n\ncontract. We consider Taber's appeal first.\r\n\n          At the close of the evidence, the district court\r\n\ndismissed Merit's claim against Victor Torres and Associates.\r\n\n                       TABER'S APPEAL\r\n\n          Taber forwards two issues on appeal: The ruling of\r\n\nthe district court excluding evidence of the loss of value of\r\n\nthe hotel due to defective construction work; and improper jury\r\n\ninstructions.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nThe Exclusionary Ruling\r\n\n          We start with the exclusionary ruling. In a pre-\r\n\ntrial order the court ruled that it would not allow evidence as\r\n\nto the loss of value of the hotel. Taber had two expert\r\n\nwitnesses who would have testified that the reconstruction and\r\n\nrenovation work by Merit was done so incompetently and\r\n\ndefectively that the hotel's value was considerably less than\r\n\nwhat it would have been had it been done properly.\r\n\n          At the start of its specific instructions the court\r\n\ntold the jury:\r\n\n               Taber Partners I claims that Merit\r\n          Builders, Inc. breached all contracts\r\n          entered into for the renovation and\r\n          expansion of the Ambassador Plaza Hotel\r\n          and Casino by failing to properly\r\n          construct the building and by failing to\r\n          complete the project in time. As a\r\n          result, plaintiff claims that it suffered\r\n          damages suffered [sic] due to alleged\r\n          construction defects and time delays for\r\n          which it seeks to recover the total sum of\r\n          $3,730,995 from Merit.\r\n\nThis was an accurate statement of Taber's claims.\r\n\n          The jury answered the following questions on Merit's\r\n\nliability:\r\n\n          PART A: Taber's claim against Merit for\r\n          breach of contract\r\n\n          Question 1A.\r\n\n               Do you find that under the Lump Sum\r\n          Tower Contract Merit failed to perform its\r\n          duties and obligations or in any other way\r\n          breached its contract with Taber by\r\n          failing to comply with the plans and\r\n          specifications?\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          . . . \r\n\n          Question 3A.\r\n\n               Do you find that under the Specialty\r\n          Contract Merit failed to perform its\r\n          duties or in any other way breached its\r\n          contract with Taber by failing to comply\r\n          with the plans and specifications?\r\n\n          . . .\r\n\n          Question 5A.\r\n\n               Do you find that under the Cost Plus\r\n          Contract Merit failed to perform its\r\n          duties or in any other way breached its\r\n          contract with Taber by failing to follow\r\n          the plans and specifications?\r\n\n          These jury findings establish beyond peradventure\r\n\nthat Merit was not liable to Taber for breach of contract,\r\n\nwhich was the basis of Taber's claims against Merit. \r\n\n          We have read the transcript testimony of all\r\n\nwitnesses who testified on behalf of Taber. The record shows\r\n\nthat there was a plethora of evidence from which the jury could\r\n\nhave found liability, if it believed any of the witnesses. But\r\n\nit chose not to do so. If any principle is embedded firmly in\r\n\nour law it is that the jury is the final arbiter of the facts\r\n\nand credibility decisions are exclusively within its domain.\r\n\n          Another firmly established legal rule is that a\r\n\nfinding of liability must precede any finding of damages.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nTaber seeks to avoid this rule by arguing that \"the Judge\r\n\nerroneously forced Taber to argue liability without being\r\n\npermitted to prove damages; it is the rare jury that will find\r\n\nliability when it cannot appreciate that the plaintiff has\r\n\nsuffered damage.\" Taber's Brief at 20. This argument is\r\n\nbelied by the record. The court allowed in evidence all\r\n\ndamages claimed by Taber except that of the value of the hotel\r\n\nand those that were duplicative.\r\n\n          Randall Redman, an expert witness called by Taber,\r\n\ntestified that, after inspecting the project, he told Eugene\r\n\nRomano that the only way to achieve a quality building that\r\n\nwould last would be to tear the building down and start all\r\n\nover.\r\n\n          During the testimony of Eugene Romano it was\r\n\nstipulated as follows:\r\n\n               If the jury finds that there was a\r\n          delay by Merit in the performance of any\r\n          of the contracts, the parties agree that\r\n          there is a $2,000 liquidated damages\r\n          provision per day, per contract, which\r\n          includes the specialty contract. That is\r\n          to say, the work for the casino,\r\n          restaurant and lobby, plus and also the\r\n          tower contract.\r\n\n               The cost-plus contract is\r\n          specifically not made a part of this\r\n          stipulation as it had no time limit in\r\n          which it was supposed to be complete.\r\n\n          Eldon Gayle Tipping, another of Taber's experts,\r\n\ntestified that the cost to repair this project would be in\r\n\nexcess of the original contract price. He testified\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nspecifically that the damages due to defective concrete work\r\n\nwere $1,353,703.00.\r\n\n          Victor Torres, a civil engineer, was retained to\r\n\nsettle disputes between the parties and issue certificates of\r\n\npayment. He testified extensively about change orders and\r\n\n\"deductive\" change orders. A \"deductive\" change order results\r\n\nin a decrease of the amount due for a specific contract change.\r\n\nTorres testified that he allowed $856,944.90 in deductive\r\n\nchange orders out of $3,938,228.64 claimed by Taber.\r\n\n          The most extensive testimony on damages came from\r\n\nLinda Romano, a partner, with her father, in Taber. She\r\n\nstarted her testimony by stating:\r\n\n               The Witness: We sued Merit Builders\r\n          because we paid Merit in excess of $12\r\n          million to build us a quality hotel within\r\n          a specified time and they didn't do it.\r\n          And we sued the Insurance Company of North\r\n          America because they promised the\r\n          performance, they secured the performance\r\n          of Merit under the performance bond.\r\n\n          By Mr. Stokes:\r\n\n          Q    Ms. Romano, what are you seeking by\r\n          this lawsuit?\r\n\n          A    I am asking the jury to find that the\r\n          Insurance Company of North America and\r\n          Merit Builders should pay us in excess of\r\n          three and a half million dollars.\r\n\n               In addition to that, I am asking the\r\n          jury to find that we have paid Merit in\r\n          full. I am seeking to be made whole,\r\n          although I don't believe I can be.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Linda Romano testified for four days on direct\r\n\nexamination. She explained the defects in construction. This\r\n\npart of her testimony was amplified by numerous photographs,\r\n\nwhich were admitted in evidence. Ms. Romano took over 2,000\r\n\nphotos of the work in progress. Romano gave specific costs of\r\n\nchange orders and deductive change orders. She concluded her\r\n\ntestimony by summarizing the amount due Taber for defective\r\n\nwork and time delays -- $3,730,995.00. This was the figure\r\n\ngiven by the court in its instructions to the jury as to the\r\n\namount Taber claimed in damages.\r\n\n          Despite the argumentative rhetoric in Taber's brief,\r\n\nthe record makes it abundantly clear that the jury was fully\r\n\ninformed as to the construction defects alleged by Taber and\r\n\nits claim for the costs of correcting them. The district court\r\n\nallowed 98% of the evidence offered by Taber to be presented to\r\n\nthe jury. This is not a case of a trial judge being technical\r\n\nand limiting in his evidentiary rulings. Taber received an\r\n\neminently fair trial. It cannot now seize upon one adverse\r\n\nruling on the preclusion of certain evidence on damages to\r\n\noverturn the jury's findings that Merit was not liable to Taber\r\n\nfor breach of contract. Such findings preclude, as a matter of\r\n\nlaw, any contention on damages.\r\n\nThe Jury Instructions\r\n\n          We state this issue as it is worded in Taber's brief \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nat page 3:\r\n\n               The District Court, in this case\r\n          arising from faulty hotel construction,\r\n          reversibly erred by improperly instructing\r\n          the jury to presume as factually\r\n          legitimate the certificates for payment\r\n          issued by the inspecting engineer/\r\n          architect, Victor Torres, in direct\r\n          contravention of the contract language,\r\n          yet failing to instruct the jury to assume\r\n          as similarly legitimate the deductive\r\n          change orders and substantial completion\r\n          decisions certified by the same\r\n          individual.\r\n\n          This plaint founders on the same barrier reef as did\r\n\nTaber's argument excluding one of its claims for damages -- the\r\n\njury findings of no liability.\r\n\n          We also point out that in this circuit objections to\r\n\njury instructions cannot be properly preserved unless a party\r\n\nobjects after the charge and before the jury has retired to\r\n\nconsider the case. The mandate of Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 is stated\r\n\nas follows:\r\n\n          No party may assign as error the giving or\r\n          the failure to give an instruction unless\r\n          that party objects thereto before the jury\r\n          retires to consider its verdict,  stating\r\n          distinctly the matter objected to and the\r\n          grounds  \r                              of  \r                                  the  \r                                      objection. Opportunity\r\n          shall be given to make the objection out\r\n          of the hearing of the jury. (Emphasis\r\n          added).\r\n\nWe have construed this to mean what it says. Objections to\r\n\njury instructions must be stated fully after the charge and\r\n\nbefore the jury retires regardless of any pre-charge\r\n\nobjections. See \r                            Senra v.

Failure to follow our regime results in\r\n\na plain error analysis.\r\n\n          After the charge the court invited counsel to the\r\n\nbench. All counsel except Taber's made detailed objections on\r\n\nthe record. The only thing counsel for Taber said was: \"Same\r\n\ncomments as yesterday, Your Honor.\" This was not sufficient\r\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 and our case law.\r\n\n          We have read the jury instructions carefully and find\r\n\nno plain error. In fact, we think the jury instructions\r\n\nexplained this difficult, complex, and lengthy case clearly and\r\n\nfairly to the jury.\r\n\n                    MERIT'S COUNTERCLAIM\r\n\nFraud\r\n\n          Merit objects to the pre-trial dismissal of its fraud\r\n\nclaim against Taber. The record discloses the following pre-\r\n\ntrial order:\r\n\n               Finally, during the Pretrial\r\n          Conference, the parties discussed with the\r\n          Court the fraud claims presented by Taber\r\n          and Merit in the Second Amended Complaint\r\n          and the Counterclaim. Both parties agreed\r\n          that  \r                           these  \r                                  fraud  \r                                         allegations  \r                                                      lack  \r                                                            the\r\n          requisite   \r                                 specificity   \r                                               detailed   \r                                                          under\r\n          Rule 9(b) \r                                of \r                                   the \r                                        Federal \r                                                Rules \r                                                      of \r                                                          Civil\r\n          Procedure. However, neither party brought\r\n          this issue to the Court's attention before\r\n          the Pretrial Conference. In light of the\r\n          parties' admissions during the Conference,\r\n          and after close examination of the\r\n          complaint and the counterclaim, the Court\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\n          will not allow evidence or allegations of\r\n          fraud to be made during Trial by either\r\n          party. (Emphasis added).\r\n\nIn light of Merit's agreement that its fraud allegations lacked\r\n\nthe specificity required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), Merit is\r\n\nforeclosed from objecting to the exclusion of its fraud claim.\r\n\nMoreover, we have read the entire counterclaim carefully and it\r\n\nis obvious that Merit did not rely on any of the fraudulent\r\n\nacts alleged. Reliance was not alleged in the fraud claim.\r\n\nThis was a breach of contract case. Merit's answer and\r\n\ncounterclaim make it evident that its defense to the breach of\r\n\ncontract claim was that it met its contract obligations and was\r\n\nowed money by Taber (which the jury found to be true).\r\n\nDismissal of Merit's Contract Claims\r\n\n          Merit objects to two other pre-trial rulings:\r\n\n(1) the preclusion of damages compensable in the \"construction\r\n\ncontext\" of this case; (2) the preclusion of damages from\r\n\nTaber's delays and changes in the nature and scope of the work\r\n\ncontracted.\r\n\n          As we understand it from Merit's brief at page 48,\r\n\nMerit claims that in addition to the amount awarded it by the\r\n\njury for unpaid change orders and other specified claims, it\r\n\nhas a claim for \"disruptions and resulting damages\" in the\r\n\namount of two million dollars.  Id.\r\n\n          The answer to this claim comes from the record.\r\n\nDuring the trial, Merit attempted through a blow-up to\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\nintroduce evidence of damages for general overhead, general\r\n\nfield conditions, acceleration costs, and delay damages. The\r\n\ncourt excluded the claim for three reasons. We need go no\r\n\nfurther than the first:\r\n\n               First, for the pretrial conference on\r\n          February 28, 1995, the Court ordered the\r\n          parties to submit an itemization of all\r\n          damages to be claimed at trial. Merit\r\n          submitted its itemized list of damages by\r\n          motion dated February 28, 1995. During\r\n          said conference Merit discussed with the\r\n          Court all of the claims it wanted to\r\n          present at trial and never mentioned the\r\n          claims brought to the Court's attention\r\n          yesterday.\r\n\n          Merit waived its claim to the additional damages\r\n\nsought by its failure to submit them in accord with the pre-\r\n\ntrial order of the court.\r\n\n          The jury's findings that Merit was not liable to\r\n\nTaber nullified the two third-party claims brought by Merit.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is     Affirmed.\r\n\nCosts on appeal are against Taber.\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\n",

This breach of\r\n\ncontract case is a product of the renovation and expansion of\r\n\nthe Ambassador Plaza Hotel and Casino (formerly a Howard\r\n\nJohnson Hotel) in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Plaintiff-appellant\r\n\nTaber Partners I is the owner of the hotel. Its two partners\r\n\nare A. Eugene Romano and his daughter, Linda Romano.\r\n\nDefendant-appellee and cross-appellant Merit Builders, Inc. was\r\n\nthe general contractor. John Schlump, one of the two owners of\r\n\nMerit, directed the construction and reconstruction work on the\r\n\nhotel.\r\n\n          On January 18, 1989, Taber entered into a \"cost-plus\"\r\n\nconstruction contract with Merit whereby Merit became the\r\n\ngeneral contractor for the renovation and expansion of the\r\n\nhotel. Prior to this, Schlump had been retained as a\r\n\nconsultant by Eugene Romano to advise him how to proceed with\r\n\nthe proposed reconstruction and expansion. The \"cost-plus\"\r\n\ncontract was followed by a fixed price contract; both contracts\r\n\nwere collectively called the Tower contract. A third contract\r\n\nwas entered into by the parties for finish work on the casino,\r\n\ntwo restaurants, and the hotel lobby.\r\n\n          On February 20, 1991, Taber filed a complaint in the\r\n\nfederal district court of Puerto Rico alleging breach of\r\n\ncontract by reason of delay, defective performance, and\r\n\nnegligent workmanship. There was also a claim for fraud and\r\n\ndeceit. The complaint was amended twice; the causes of action\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nremained essentially the same. At some point, it is not clear\r\n\nfrom the record just when, Taber sued the Insurance Company of\r\n\nNorth America under the performance bond INA issued for the\r\n\nTower contract.\r\n\n          Merit brought a counterclaim against Taber alleging\r\n\nmultiple breaches of contract, a claim based on Taber's alleged\r\n\ndelays and changes in the scope and nature of the work\r\n\ncontracted for, and fraud. Merit also brought a third-party\r\n\naction against Desarrollos Metropolitanos, S.E., the concrete\r\n\nsubcontractor. It brought another third-party complaint\r\n\nagainst Victor Torres and Associates, the inspectors of the\r\n\nwork, alleging breach of duty and tortious interference with\r\n\nthe performance of the contracts between Taber and Merit.\r\n\n          After a fourteen-week trial, the jury returned a\r\n\nverdict finding that Merit was not liable to Taber. It further\r\n\nfound that Taber owed Merit $1,597,414.00 for breach of\r\n\ncontract. We consider Taber's appeal first.\r\n\n          At the close of the evidence, the district court\r\n\ndismissed Merit's claim against Victor Torres and Associates.\r\n\n                       TABER'S APPEAL\r\n\n          Taber forwards two issues on appeal: The ruling of\r\n\nthe district court excluding evidence of the loss of value of\r\n\nthe hotel due to defective construction work; and improper jury\r\n\ninstructions.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nThe Exclusionary Ruling\r\n\n          We start with the exclusionary ruling. In a pre-\r\n\ntrial order the court ruled that it would not allow evidence as\r\n\nto the loss of value of the hotel. Taber had two expert\r\n\nwitnesses who would have testified that the reconstruction and\r\n\nrenovation work by Merit was done so incompetently and\r\n\ndefectively that the hotel's value was considerably less than\r\n\nwhat it would have been had it been done properly.\r\n\n          At the start of its specific instructions the court\r\n\ntold the jury:\r\n\n               Taber Partners I claims that Merit\r\n          Builders, Inc. breached all contracts\r\n          entered into for the renovation and\r\n          expansion of the Ambassador Plaza Hotel\r\n          and Casino by failing to properly\r\n          construct the building and by failing to\r\n          complete the project in time. As a\r\n          result, plaintiff claims that it suffered\r\n          damages suffered [sic] due to alleged\r\n          construction defects and time delays for\r\n          which it seeks to recover the total sum of\r\n          $3,730,995 from Merit.\r\n\nThis was an accurate statement of Taber's claims.\r\n\n          The jury answered the following questions on Merit's\r\n\nliability:\r\n\n          PART A: Taber's claim against Merit for\r\n          breach of contract\r\n\n          Question 1A.\r\n\n               Do you find that under the Lump Sum\r\n          Tower Contract Merit failed to perform its\r\n          duties and obligations or in any other way\r\n          breached its contract with Taber by\r\n          failing to comply with the plans and\r\n          specifications?\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          . . . \r\n\n          Question 3A.\r\n\n               Do you find that under the Specialty\r\n          Contract Merit failed to perform its\r\n          duties or in any other way breached its\r\n          contract with Taber by failing to comply\r\n          with the plans and specifications?\r\n\n          . . .\r\n\n          Question 5A.\r\n\n               Do you find that under the Cost Plus\r\n          Contract Merit failed to perform its\r\n          duties or in any other way breached its\r\n          contract with Taber by failing to follow\r\n          the plans and specifications?\r\n\n          These jury findings establish beyond peradventure\r\n\nthat Merit was not liable to Taber for breach of contract,\r\n\nwhich was the basis of Taber's claims against Merit. \r\n\n          We have read the transcript testimony of all\r\n\nwitnesses who testified on behalf of Taber. The record shows\r\n\nthat there was a plethora of evidence from which the jury could\r\n\nhave found liability, if it believed any of the witnesses. But\r\n\nit chose not to do so. If any principle is embedded firmly in\r\n\nour law it is that the jury is the final arbiter of the facts\r\n\nand credibility decisions are exclusively within its domain.\r\n\n          Another firmly established legal rule is that a\r\n\nfinding of liability must precede any finding of damages.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nTaber seeks to avoid this rule by arguing that \"the Judge\r\n\nerroneously forced Taber to argue liability without being\r\n\npermitted to prove damages; it is the rare jury that will find\r\n\nliability when it cannot appreciate that the plaintiff has\r\n\nsuffered damage.\" Taber's Brief at 20. This argument is\r\n\nbelied by the record. The court allowed in evidence all\r\n\ndamages claimed by Taber except that of the value of the hotel\r\n\nand those that were duplicative.\r\n\n          Randall Redman, an expert witness called by Taber,\r\n\ntestified that, after inspecting the project, he told Eugene\r\n\nRomano that the only way to achieve a quality building that\r\n\nwould last would be to tear the building down and start all\r\n\nover.\r\n\n          During the testimony of Eugene Romano it was\r\n\nstipulated as follows:\r\n\n               If the jury finds that there was a\r\n          delay by Merit in the performance of any\r\n          of the contracts, the parties agree that\r\n          there is a $2,000 liquidated damages\r\n          provision per day, per contract, which\r\n          includes the specialty contract. That is\r\n          to say, the work for the casino,\r\n          restaurant and lobby, plus and also the\r\n          tower contract.\r\n\n               The cost-plus contract is\r\n          specifically not made a part of this\r\n          stipulation as it had no time limit in\r\n          which it was supposed to be complete.\r\n\n          Eldon Gayle Tipping, another of Taber's experts,\r\n\ntestified that the cost to repair this project would be in\r\n\nexcess of the original contract price. He testified\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nspecifically that the damages due to defective concrete work\r\n\nwere $1,353,703.00.\r\n\n          Victor Torres, a civil engineer, was retained to\r\n\nsettle disputes between the parties and issue certificates of\r\n\npayment. He testified extensively about change orders and\r\n\n\"deductive\" change orders. A \"deductive\" change order results\r\n\nin a decrease of the amount due for a specific contract change.\r\n\nTorres testified that he allowed $856,944.90 in deductive\r\n\nchange orders out of $3,938,228.64 claimed by Taber.\r\n\n          The most extensive testimony on damages came from\r\n\nLinda Romano, a partner, with her father, in Taber. She\r\n\nstarted her testimony by stating:\r\n\n               The Witness: We sued Merit Builders\r\n          because we paid Merit in excess of $12\r\n          million to build us a quality hotel within\r\n          a specified time and they didn't do it.\r\n          And we sued the Insurance Company of North\r\n          America because they promised the\r\n          performance, they secured the performance\r\n          of Merit under the performance bond.\r\n\n          By Mr. Stokes:\r\n\n          Q    Ms. Romano, what are you seeking by\r\n          this lawsuit?\r\n\n          A    I am asking the jury to find that the\r\n          Insurance Company of North America and\r\n          Merit Builders should pay us in excess of\r\n          three and a half million dollars.\r\n\n               In addition to that, I am asking the\r\n          jury to find that we have paid Merit in\r\n          full. I am seeking to be made whole,\r\n          although I don't believe I can be.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Linda Romano testified for four days on direct\r\n\nexamination. She explained the defects in construction. This\r\n\npart of her testimony was amplified by numerous photographs,\r\n\nwhich were admitted in evidence. Ms. Romano took over 2,000\r\n\nphotos of the work in progress. Romano gave specific costs of\r\n\nchange orders and deductive change orders. She concluded her\r\n\ntestimony by summarizing the amount due Taber for defective\r\n\nwork and time delays -- $3,730,995.00. This was the figure\r\n\ngiven by the court in its instructions to the jury as to the\r\n\namount Taber claimed in damages.\r\n\n          Despite the argumentative rhetoric in Taber's brief,\r\n\nthe record makes it abundantly clear that the jury was fully\r\n\ninformed as to the construction defects alleged by Taber and\r\n\nits claim for the costs of correcting them. The district court\r\n\nallowed 98% of the evidence offered by Taber to be presented to\r\n\nthe jury. This is not a case of a trial judge being technical\r\n\nand limiting in his evidentiary rulings. Taber received an\r\n\neminently fair trial. It cannot now seize upon one adverse\r\n\nruling on the preclusion of certain evidence on damages to\r\n\noverturn the jury's findings that Merit was not liable to Taber\r\n\nfor breach of contract. Such findings preclude, as a matter of\r\n\nlaw, any contention on damages.\r\n\nThe Jury Instructions\r\n\n          We state this issue as it is worded in Taber's brief \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nat page 3:\r\n\n               The District Court, in this case\r\n          arising from faulty hotel construction,\r\n          reversibly erred by improperly instructing\r\n          the jury to presume as factually\r\n          legitimate the certificates for payment\r\n          issued by the inspecting engineer/\r\n          architect, Victor Torres, in direct\r\n          contravention of the contract language,\r\n          yet failing to instruct the jury to assume\r\n          as similarly legitimate the deductive\r\n          change orders and substantial completion\r\n          decisions certified by the same\r\n          individual.\r\n\n          This plaint founders on the same barrier reef as did\r\n\nTaber's argument excluding one of its claims for damages -- the\r\n\njury findings of no liability.\r\n\n          We also point out that in this circuit objections to\r\n\njury instructions cannot be properly preserved unless a party\r\n\nobjects after the charge and before the jury has retired to\r\n\nconsider the case. The mandate of Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 is stated\r\n\nas follows:\r\n\n          No party may assign as error the giving or\r\n          the failure to give an instruction unless\r\n          that party objects thereto before the jury\r\n          retires to consider its verdict,  stating\r\n          distinctly the matter objected to and the\r\n          grounds  \r                              of  \r                                  the  \r                                      objection. Opportunity\r\n          shall be given to make the objection out\r\n          of the hearing of the jury. (Emphasis\r\n          added).\r\n\nWe have construed this to mean what it says. Objections to\r\n\njury instructions must be stated fully after the charge and\r\n\nbefore the jury retires regardless of any pre-charge\r\n\nobjections. See \r                            Senra v.

Failure to follow our regime results in\r\n\na plain error analysis.\r\n\n          After the charge the court invited counsel to the\r\n\nbench. All counsel except Taber's made detailed objections on\r\n\nthe record. The only thing counsel for Taber said was: \"Same\r\n\ncomments as yesterday, Your Honor.\" This was not sufficient\r\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 and our case law.\r\n\n          We have read the jury instructions carefully and find\r\n\nno plain error. In fact, we think the jury instructions\r\n\nexplained this difficult, complex, and lengthy case clearly and\r\n\nfairly to the jury.\r\n\n                    MERIT'S COUNTERCLAIM\r\n\nFraud\r\n\n          Merit objects to the pre-trial dismissal of its fraud\r\n\nclaim against Taber. The record discloses the following pre-\r\n\ntrial order:\r\n\n               Finally, during the Pretrial\r\n          Conference, the parties discussed with the\r\n          Court the fraud claims presented by Taber\r\n          and Merit in the Second Amended Complaint\r\n          and the Counterclaim. Both parties agreed\r\n          that  \r                           these  \r                                  fraud  \r                                         allegations  \r                                                      lack  \r                                                            the\r\n          requisite   \r                                 specificity   \r                                               detailed   \r                                                          under\r\n          Rule 9(b) \r                                of \r                                   the \r                                        Federal \r                                                Rules \r                                                      of \r                                                          Civil\r\n          Procedure. However, neither party brought\r\n          this issue to the Court's attention before\r\n          the Pretrial Conference. In light of the\r\n          parties' admissions during the Conference,\r\n          and after close examination of the\r\n          complaint and the counterclaim, the Court\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\n          will not allow evidence or allegations of\r\n          fraud to be made during Trial by either\r\n          party. (Emphasis added).\r\n\nIn light of Merit's agreement that its fraud allegations lacked\r\n\nthe specificity required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), Merit is\r\n\nforeclosed from objecting to the exclusion of its fraud claim.\r\n\nMoreover, we have read the entire counterclaim carefully and it\r\n\nis obvious that Merit did not rely on any of the fraudulent\r\n\nacts alleged. Reliance was not alleged in the fraud claim.\r\n\nThis was a breach of contract case. Merit's answer and\r\n\ncounterclaim make it evident that its defense to the breach of\r\n\ncontract claim was that it met its contract obligations and was\r\n\nowed money by Taber (which the jury found to be true).\r\n\nDismissal of Merit's Contract Claims\r\n\n          Merit objects to two other pre-trial rulings:\r\n\n(1) the preclusion of damages compensable in the \"construction\r\n\ncontext\" of this case; (2) the preclusion of damages from\r\n\nTaber's delays and changes in the nature and scope of the work\r\n\ncontracted.\r\n\n          As we understand it from Merit's brief at page 48,\r\n\nMerit claims that in addition to the amount awarded it by the\r\n\njury for unpaid change orders and other specified claims, it\r\n\nhas a claim for \"disruptions and resulting damages\" in the\r\n\namount of two million dollars.  Id.\r\n\n          The answer to this claim comes from the record.\r\n\nDuring the trial, Merit attempted through a blow-up to\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\nintroduce evidence of damages for general overhead, general\r\n\nfield conditions, acceleration costs, and delay damages. The\r\n\ncourt excluded the claim for three reasons. We need go no\r\n\nfurther than the first:\r\n\n               First, for the pretrial conference on\r\n          February 28, 1995, the Court ordered the\r\n          parties to submit an itemization of all\r\n          damages to be claimed at trial. Merit\r\n          submitted its itemized list of damages by\r\n          motion dated February 28, 1995. During\r\n          said conference Merit discussed with the\r\n          Court all of the claims it wanted to\r\n          present at trial and never mentioned the\r\n          claims brought to the Court's attention\r\n          yesterday.\r\n\n          Merit waived its claim to the additional damages\r\n\nsought by its failure to submit them in accord with the pre-\r\n\ntrial order of the court.\r\n\n          The jury's findings that Merit was not liable to\r\n\nTaber nullified the two third-party claims brought by Merit.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is     Affirmed.\r\n\nCosts on appeal are against Taber.\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\n</pre>",
