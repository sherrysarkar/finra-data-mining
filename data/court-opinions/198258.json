ROSS,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n                 STRATUS COMPUTER, INC.,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n     [Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Danny M. Ross on brief pro se.\r\n William J. Brisk on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 18, 1998\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.   Plaintiff appeals an adverse summary\r\njudgment dismissing his claims of discriminatory harassment and\r\nconstructive discharge from his employment.  The district court\r\ngranted summary judgment on the ground that even if plaintiff\r\ncould establish a prima facie case of discrimination, he had\r\nfailed to offer minimally sufficient proof that the employer's\r\narticulated, non-discriminatory reasons for its  disciplinary\r\nactions constituted a pretext, and that the real reason was\r\nprohibited discrimination.  \r\n          Reviewing the judgment de novo, in light of the\r\nparties' briefs and the entire record, we agree with the\r\ndistrict court's determination.  We also find no error in the\r\ndenial of plaintiff's motions for a default judgment, and for\r\nan appointment of counsel.  Plaintiff's other assignments of\r\nerror require no comment.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1       \r\n\n                           -2-\n",
