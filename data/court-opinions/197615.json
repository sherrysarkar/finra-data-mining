We reject this argument and affirm. \r\n\n          On  March   10,  1994,   plaintiff/appellant  Diana\r\n\nGilbert participated in  the Guaranteed Learn to  Ski Program\r\n\nat   Sunday  River,  a   ski  area  owned   and  operated  by\r\n\ndefendant/appellee Sunday  River  Skiway  Corporation.    The\r\n\ninstructor assigned to plaintiff's novice  class first taught\r\n\nGilbert and two others basic skiing techniques, including how\r\n\nto  stop and  turn.   Because the  lift customarily  used for\r\n\nclass was not  operating, the instructor took the  group on a\r\n\nlift  that  went  higher  on the  mountain  than  the  normal\r\n\nbeginners slope.   The instructor then directed  the students\r\n\nto   ski  down  to  the   beginners  area  usually  used  for\r\n\ninstruction.   On  her first  turn,  Gilbert accelerated  too\r\n\nquickly and fell, injuring her knee.  This suit followed. \r\n\n          The   Maine   Skier's   and   Tramway   Passengers'\r\n\nResponsibilities  Act (\"MSTPRA\"),  26 M.R.S.A.    488 (1988),\r\n\nstates  that \"each  skier who  participates in  the sport  of\r\n\nskiing  shall be  deemed  to  have assumed  the  risk of  the\r\n\ndangers inherent in the sport . . . .\"  Although  section 488\r\n\nis designed to protect ski area operators from  liability for\r\n\nskiers' injuries,  the  statute contains  an  exception  that\r\n\nimposes liability on a ski area when the skier's injuries are\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n\"actually caused by the negligent operation of the ski area.\"\r\n\nId.   Gilbert  presented evidence  to the  jury that  the ski\r               \r\n\ninstructor  brought her to  a slope that was  too steep for a\r\n\nfirst-time skier and that this conduct constituted  negligent\r\n\noperation of the ski area.\r\n\n          At  the close  of  the  evidence,  and  after  some\r\n\ndeliberation,  the   district  court  charged  the   jury  by\r\n\nparaphrasing section 488.  The charge stated: \r\n\n          Maine  law  provides  that  everyone  who\r\n          participates  in  the   sport  of  skiing\r\n          assumes the  risk of dangers  inherent in\r\n          the  sport  and  responsibility  for  any\r\n          injury  unless  the injury  was  actually\r\n          caused by the  negligent operation of the\r\n          ski  area.   In this case,  the plaintiff\r\n          Diana Gilbert  claims that  the defendant\r\n          Sunday    River     Skiway    Corporation\r\n          negligently  operated  its  ski  area  in\r\n          instructing  her   where  to  ski   as  a\r\n          beginner enrolled in the Guaranteed Learn\r\n          to  Ski Program,  and  that  it was  this\r\n          negligence  that  caused her  injury  and\r\n          damages that she now seeks to recover. \r\n                             ...\r\n          If you find that Sunday River was not\r\n          negligent or that its negligence did not\r\n          cause Diana Gilbert's injuries, then your\r\n          verdict must be for Sunday River.\r\n\nGilbert seasonably objected to the instruction.  The jury \r\n\nreturned a verdict that Sunday River was not negligent. \r\n\n          Gilbert concedes that the district court's\r\n\ninstruction does not misstate or misdescribe the Maine skier\r\n\nstatute in any way.  Rather, Gilbert argues that, because\r\n\nsection 488 arguably does not require the jury to decide\r\n\nwhether she had assumed the risk of her injuries, the court's\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nreference to assumption of the risk was so confusing that a\r\n\nnew trial is warranted.  For this proposition, Gilbert relies\r\n\nexclusively on dictum from State v. Gilbert, 473 A.2d 1273\r                                                       \r\n\n(Me. 1984), which, while affirming a trial court's refusal to\r\n\ninclude an irrelevant affirmative defense instruction in a\r\n\ncriminal case, states the unremarkable proposition that \"[a]n\r\n\ninstruction on an issue not generated by the evidence would\r\n\nserve only to confuse or mislead the jury.\"  Id. at 1277. \r                                                            \r\n\nGilbert's reliance is misplaced. \r\n\n          We reject Gilbert's argument for two reasons. \r\n\nFirst, the court's inclusion of the assumption of the risk\r\n\nlanguage was not extraneous or irrelevant.  To the contrary,\r\n\nthe language was a necessary part of the cogent summary of\r\n\nthe controlling law that the district court appropriately\r\n\nprovided the jury.  See Hardin v. Ski Venture, Inc., 50 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1291, 1295 (4th Cir. 1995)(noting it would be \"truly bizarre\"\r\n\nif the district court were not allowed to cite assumption of\r\n\nthe risk language in the controlling skier statute in its\r\n\ninstructions).  \"The instructions, rather than being\r\n\noverinclusive, were thorough.\"  State v. Baker, 505 A.2d 96,\r                                                          \r\n\n98 (Me. 1986).  Second, assuming for the sake of argument\r\n\nthat the court's summary of section 488 constitutes an\r\n\nerroneous instruction on an issue not generated by the\r\n\nevidence, we are at a loss to see how Gilbert suffered legal\r\n\nprejudice as a result.  \"An error in jury instructions will\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nwarrant reversal of a judgment only if the error is\r\n\ndetermined to have been prejudicial, based on a review of the\r\n\nrecord as a whole.\"  Davet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1992).  The charge was a model of clarity in directing\r\n\nthe jury to decide whether Sunday River was negligent in its\r\n\noperation of the ski area.  These instructions gave the jury\r\n\nample guidance and leeway to find Sunday River negligent. \r\n\nHow an accurate description of the applicable law could have\r\n\ndeflected a reasonable jury from deciding whether Sunday\r\n\nRiver was negligent truly escapes us.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.

To the contrary,\r\n\nthe language was a necessary part of the cogent summary of\r\n\nthe controlling law that the district court appropriately\r\n\nprovided the jury.  See Hardin v. Ski Venture, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692291\"><a href=\"/opinion/692291/henry-l-hardin-v-ski-venture-incorporated-dba-snowshoe-resort-a-west/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r                                                               \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">1291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1295 (4th Cir. 1995)(noting it would be \"truly bizarre\"\r\n\nif the district court were not allowed to cite assumption of\r\n\nthe risk language in the controlling skier statute in its\r\n\ninstructions).  \"The instructions, rather than being\r\n\noverinclusive, were thorough.\"  State v.

Second, assuming for the sake of argument\r\n\nthat the court's summary of section 488 constitutes an\r\n\nerroneous instruction on an issue not generated by the\r\n\nevidence, we are at a loss to see how Gilbert suffered legal\r\n\nprejudice as a result.  \"An error in jury instructions will\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nwarrant reversal of a judgment only if the error is\r\n\ndetermined to have been prejudicial, based on a review of the\r\n\nrecord as a whole.\"  Davet v.

The charge was a model of clarity in directing\r\n\nthe jury to decide whether Sunday River was negligent in its\r\n\noperation of the ski area.  These instructions gave the jury\r\n\nample guidance and leeway to find Sunday River negligent. \r\n\nHow an accurate description of the applicable law could have\r\n\ndeflected a reasonable jury from deciding whether Sunday\r\n\nRiver was negligent truly escapes us.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.
