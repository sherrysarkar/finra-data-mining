Pro se plaintiff  Carlos R.

We  conclude that  plaintiff's\r\n\npersonal injury claims were  properly dismissed because  they\r\n\nare  barred by the statute of limitations.   Plaintiff failed\r\n\nto present  these claims   within  two years  of the  date of\r\n\ntheir accrual, as required by 28 U.S.C.   2401(b).  Plaintiff\r\n\nhas  also failed to present  a cogent argument addressing his\r\n\nproperty  damage claim on appeal.   Thus, we  deem it waived.\r\n\nSee Barrett v.
