Pro se appellant Carlos  Cruz appeals\r                                \r\n\nfrom  the district court's  judgment dismissing his  in forma\r\n\npauperis complaint under 28 U.S.C.    1915(e).  We vacate the\r\n\njudgment  and  remand  to  the  district  court  for  further\r\n\nproceedings.  \r\n\n          Cruz  filed  his   complaint  asserting  employment\r\n\ndiscrimination and other  claims under the in  forma pauperis\r\n\nstatute, 28  U.S.C.    1915.   Upon  preliminary review,  the\r\n\ndistrict court construed the  complaint to be based  on Title\r\n\nVII and  issued a show  cause order directing Cruz  to submit\r\n\nhis right to sue letter \"indicating that he has exhausted his\r\n\nadministrative remedies\"  under Title  VII.   The court  made\r\n\nclear that failure  to submit the letter by  the deadline set\r\n\nby the court would result in dismissal of  the action under  \r\n\n1915(e).  Cruz timely submitted  his right to sue letter, but\r\n\nthe district  court dismissed  the action  anyway, giving  no\r\n\nexplanation.  \r\n\n          The  right  to  sue  letter  indicates  that   Cruz\r\n\nexhausted  his Title VII administrative remedies for at least\r\n\nsome  of   his  present  employment   discrimination  claims.\r\n\nTherefore,  we vacate  the judgment below  and remand  to the\r\n\ndistrict court  for further proceedings consistent  with this\r\n\nopinion.   We express no  opinion about the actual  merits of\r\n\nany of the claims asserted in the complaint.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Vacated  and  remanded for  proceedings  consistent\r                                                                         \r\n\nherewith.\r                     \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
