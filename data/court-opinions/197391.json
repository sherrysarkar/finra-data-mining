Celso was stabbed by his brother,\r\n\nFrancisco Rodr guez-Cirilo  (\"Francisco\"), who is not  a party to\r\n\nthe suit.  The family members filed a civil rights damages action\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.   1983 (1994) against two officers  of the Puerto\r\n\nRico  Police Department  alleging that  the officers'  failure to\r\n\nenforce a temporary detention  order against Francisco caused the\r\n\ninjury to Celso and thus violated his constitutional rights.1\r\n\n           The  district  court held  that  plaintiffs  failed to\r\n\nestablish that a  due process right protected  under section 1983\r\n\nwas  violated  by  the   officers'  failure  to  prevent  private\r\n\nviolence,  and  also held  that  plaintiffs  could not  establish\r\n\ncausation.  Having reviewed the record and the parties' briefs on\r\n\nappeal,  we  find  that the  district  court's  treatment  of the\r\n\ncausation  issue correctly  identifies  a  sufficient ground  for\r\n\ngranting summary judgment to the defendants.  We therefore do not\r\n\nreach  the nettlesome  legal  question of  whether,  in light  of\r\n\nDeShaney v.

Alvarado, 101 F.3d  223, 225 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996).   On\r                             \r\n\nMarch  16, 1994,  Jorge Rodr guez-Nieves  (\"Jorge\"), a  nephew of\r\n\nboth Celso and Francisco who is not a party in  the instant suit,\r\n\nfiled a petition  pursuant to  the Mental Health  Code of  Puerto\r\n\nRico  (\"Law 116\"),2  to  have his  uncle Francisco  involuntarily\r\n\ndetained for  psychiatric examination.  The  petition stated that\r\n\nFrancisco  presented  a danger  to  himself  and others  and  had\r\n\nthreatened to  kill with a sharp  object, such as a  machete or a\r\n\nknife.    On March  17, 1994,  a San  Juan municipal  court judge\r\n\nresponded to the petition  by issuing an order that  Francisco be\r\n\ndetained  for  examination.     The  temporary  detention   order\r\n\nauthorizes a law  enforcement officer  to detain  the subject  --\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24   6006 (Supp. 1991).\r                \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nwith  the assistance of health care personnel if necessary -- and\r\n\nto  take him  to  a  psychiatric  institution  where  he  can  be\r\n\nexamined, and where he cannot be held for more than 24 hours.  If\r\n\nthe  examining doctor  concludes  that detention  for any  longer\r\n\nperiod  or treatment of the subject is required, then that doctor\r\n\nmust notify the petitioner, who must then notify the  court.  The\r\n\ntemporary detention order under Law 116  does not explicitly give\r\n\npolice officers any discretion with regard to enforcement.3\r\n\n            On the  same day  that the  order was  issued, Jorge,\r\n\nalong with two of Francisco's siblings (but not Celso), went to a\r\n\npolice station to have  the order enforced.  The  defendants were\r\n\nat  the  police station  and assumed  the  task of  enforcing the\r\n\norder, calling on paramedics for assistance.  Later that day, the\r\n\ndefendant police  officers, the paramedics, and  the three family\r\n\nmembers  found Francisco  at  a local  establishment.   Francisco\r\n\nrefused  to go  with the  officers, stating  that he  was already\r\n\nbeing  treated at a veteran's hospital.  The officers then failed\r\n\nto carry out the order, despite the efforts of the family members\r\n\nto convince the officers  that Francisco was dangerous.    Before\r\n\ndeparting,  the  officers  told  the  family  members  that  they\r\n\nthemselves  should take  Francisco  to a  veteran's hospital  for\r\n\ntreatment, which is  contrary to the  stated procedure under  Law\r\n\n116.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Defendants  appear to concede  the fact that carrying  out the\r\nterms of such a  Law 116 order is a  non-discretionary obligation\r\non the part of the police officer.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            No further  legal steps were taken  to obtain another\r\n\ndetention order, although the plaintiffs and other family members\r\n\nassert  that they made further informal requests to the police to\r\n\ntake  Francisco into  custody.   Francisco  was ultimately  never\r\n\ntaken to  a hospital for examination  or treatment.  On  April 6,\r\n\n1994, nearly three weeks  after the defendants' failure to  carry\r\n\nout the temporary detention order, the injury giving rise to this\r\n\ndamages suit occurred.  Francisco stabbed his brother Celso while\r\n\nCelso was at their mother's house  for a visit.  Celso had argued\r\n\nwith  Francisco about  getting their mother  some water  and then\r\n\nstood  out on a balcony;  a few minutes  later Francisco returned\r\n\nand stabbed  Celso in  the chest with  a knife.   Celso  suffered\r\n\ninjuries to  his  chest  and to  his  respiratory  and  digestive\r\n\nsystems.\r\n\n            Plaintiffs  brought actions  for  damages under  both\r\n\nsection 1983 and Puerto Rico tort provisions.  The district court\r\n\ngranted summary judgment  to defendants on the section  1983 suit\r\n\nand dismissed the state tort claims without prejudice.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n            We review  the  district  court's  grant  of  summary\r\n\njudgment de novo.

Mart nez\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nv.  Col n, 54  F.3d 980,  984 (1st  Cir. 1995).   To  satisfy the\r                   \r\n\nsecond element, plaintiffs must show that the defendants' conduct\r\n\nwas the cause in fact of the alleged deprivation.  See Guti rrez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodr guez v. Cartagena, 882  F.2d 553, 559 (1st Cir.  1989).  The\r                                \r\n\nissue of  causation of damages in a section 1983 suit is based on\r\n\nbasic  notions of  tort  causation.   See  Maldonado Santiago  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nVel squez Garc a, 821  F.2d 822,  831 (1st  Cir. 1987)  (\"Section\r                          \r\n\n1983  imposes a causation requirement similar to that of ordinary\r\n\ntort  law.\").   In applying  basic tort  principles to  the facts\r\n\nraised  by  a  particular   section  1983  claim,  the  causation\r\n\nrequirement may be fleshed  out with reference to state  law tort\r\n\nprinciples.   Guti rrez-Rodr guez, 882 F.2d at 561.\r                                           \r\n\n            As discussed in the decision below, plaintiffs cannot\r\n\nestablish  that the conduct  of the defendants,  in not enforcing\r\n\nthe temporary detention order,  was the legal cause of  an attack\r\n\noccurring much later.   See  Rodr guez-Cirilo v.  Garc a, 908  F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. 85, 91 (D.P.R.  1995).  The concept of  proximate causation\r\n\nrestricts tort  liability to those whose  conduct, beyond falling\r\n\nwithin  the infinite  causal  web leading  to  an injury,  was  a\r\n\nlegally  significant cause.  The  passage of  time can  certainly\r\n\nreduce the  legal significance of a  particular contributing act.\r\n\nSee Restatement (Second) of Torts    433 (1965) (lapse of  time a\r                                           \r\n\nfactor  to be  considered in  determining whether  a contributing\r\n\nfactor is substantial).  \r\n\n            The  remoteness  in time  of  the harm  in  this case\r\n\nprecludes a  finding of proximate causation.   Although Francisco\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncommitted  the kind of violence  mentioned in the  petition for a\r\n\ndetention  order, the space of  over two weeks  that passed after\r\n\nthe  officers' failure  to  detain Francisco,  during which  time\r\n\nfamily members did not attempt to obtain another detention order,\r\n\nrenders  his later act of violence too remote to impose liability\r\n\non  the officers.  Cf. Mart nez  v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 285\r                                                        \r\n\n(1980)  (murder committed  by parolee  five months  after release\r\n\n\"too  remote\" a  consequence to  hold  parole board  liable under\r\n\nsection  1983);  Restatement  (Second)  of Torts     433  (1965).\r                                                          \r\n\nAlthough  the stabbing  occurred  at  the  address named  in  the\r\n\noriginal petition, and although the  police officers may have had\r\n\nsome indication that  Celso would be at danger  from an attack by\r\n\nFrancisco,4 given  the intervening  time we  cannot say that  the\r\n\nofficers' failure to enforce the order was the legal cause of the\r\n\ninjury.  See Mart nez,  444 U.S. at 285; Restatement  (Second) of\r                                                                           \r\n\nTorts    433  cmt. f  (\"Experience has  shown that  when a  great\r               \r\n\nlength of  time has  elapsed between the  actor's negligence  and\r\n\nharm  to another, a great number of contributing factors may have\r\n\noperated,  many of which may be difficult or impossible of actual\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   It is a widely recognized tort law principle that one  may be\r\nresponsible  for  the  foreseeable  intervening  acts  of   third\r\nparties.

The  temporary detention  period was itself  limited to  a\r\n\nmaximum of  twenty-four hours.   Appellants offered  no competent\r\n\nevidence that could have supported a finding that an  examination\r\n\nin  Francisco's particular  case would  have prevented  the later\r\n\nattack.   Appellants  rely  on a  clinical psychologist's  signed\r\n\nstatement  asserting  that  Francisco's   \"personality  disorder\"\r\n\ncaused  the stabbing, and  that, had  Francisco been  detained on\r\n\nMarch 17, 1994, he  would have received effective treatment  that\r\n\nwould have prevented the stabbing.   This statement, based solely\r\n\non  information collected through  conversations with Francisco's\r\n\nrelations  and formed  without any  direct examination  of either\r\n\nFrancisco  or of  his medical  records, is  not enough  to defeat\r\n\ndefendants' motion  for summary  judgment and  does not  create a\r\n\ntriable  issue of material fact as to causation.5  \"The nonmoving\r\n\nparty must  establish a trial-worthy issue  by presenting 'enough\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  This statement, as the district court notes, would probably be\r\nfound unreliable and inadmissible  as expert testimony under Fed.\r\nR.

Thus,   not  only   do  appellants   run  into\r\n\nproximate  causation problems,  but their  case also  falls short\r\n\nwith regard to demonstrating  the \"but for\" aspect of  causation.\r\n\nSee  Restatement (Second) of Torts,    432 (1965).   We conclude,\r                                            \r\n\ntherefore, that defendants were properly granted summary judgment\r\n\nbased on plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate causation under well-\r\n\nestablished tort principles.  \r\n\n          Appellants'  remaining  arguments  on  appeal   do  not\r\n\nrequire lengthy  treatment.    First,  we note  that  the  record\r\n\nindicates that the  appellants have failed  to support, with  any\r\n\ncompetent evidence, their additional assertion that there existed\r\n\na  conspiracy between  the  defendants and  Francisco to  violate\r\n\nplaintiffs'  civil rights.   Second,  in response  to appellants'\r\n\nclaim  that the district  court abused its  discretion in denying\r\n\nthem an opportunity  to amend their complaint  after the deadline\r\n\nfor such amendments established  in the court's scheduling order,\r\n\nwe note that  even had the  plaintiffs been able  to amend  their\r\n\ncomplaint  by adding as a  third defendant the  supervisor of the\r\n\ntwo  defendant police  officers, the  fundamental, insurmountable\r\n\nobstacle of causation would still have remained,  and would still\r\n\nhave offered a sufficient ground for summary judgment in favor of\r\n\ndefendants.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n            For the foregoing reasons  the district court's grant\r\n\nof summary judgment to defendants is affirmed. \r                                                       \r\n\n                                              Concurrence Follows\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          CAMPBELL, Senior  Circuit Judge (Concurring).

However, I\r\n\nconcur  with the  majority's result  because I  do not  think the\r\n\npolice  officers'   conduct  constituted  a   violation  of   the\r\n\nplaintiffs' constitutional due process rights.\r\n\n                          I.

Causation\r\n\n          I think the record indicates the existence of a factual\r\n\nissue  as  to  causation,  precluding  the  granting  of  summary\r\n\njudgment in favor  of Defendants on the  ground of an absence  of\r\n\ncausation.  See  Ahern v. O'Donnell, 109 F.3d  809, 811 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1997)  (all inferences to be made in  favor of party against whom\r\n\nsummary judgment sought).\r\n\n          Causation  depends upon  whether,  assuming the  police\r\n\nofficers violated    1983  on March  17 by  not carrying  out the\r\n\ncourt order  directing them  to take Francisco  into custody  for\r\n\npsychiatric examination, there was a sufficient causal connection\r\n\nbetween  the  officers' default  and  Francisco's  stabbing of  a\r\n\nrelative two weeks later.\r\n\n          Causation  in tort  law is  generally divided  into two\r\n\nconcepts:  causation  in fact, or actual causation, and proximate\r\n\nor legal  causation.  See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keeton\r                                                                           \r\n\non  Torts     41-42 (5th  ed.  1984).   The terms  for these  two\r                   \r\n\nconcepts are sometimes confused,  as are the concepts themselves.\r\n\nRegardless of  the terminology, however, there  are two questions\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthat  must  be answered  to  determine if  a  defendant's conduct\r\n\n\"caused\" a  plaintiff's injury.   The  first question  is whether\r\n\nthere was  in fact some  causal relationship between  the conduct\r\n\nand  the outcome.  The Restatement expresses this test as whether\r                                            \r\n\nthe defendant's  conduct was a \"substantial  factor\" in producing\r\n\nthe harm.  Id.  The second question is  whether the circumstances\r                        \r\n\nand  causal  relationship  are  such  that the  law  will  impose\r\n\nliability on the  defendant.   Sometimes this is  expressed as  a\r\n\nforeseeability  test, see  Keeton,  supra,    42,  at 273.    Cf.\r                                                                           \r\n\nRestatement  (Second)  of  Torts,      431(b)  (1965)  (different\r                                          \r\n\nterminology).\r\n\n          Regarding the second  issue, foreseeability, that prong\r\n\nis  plainly satisfied here.   A foreseeable result  of the police\r\n\nofficers'  failure  to take  Francisco  to  the psychiatrist  for\r\n\nexamination,  as ordered  by the  court, was  that he  would harm\r\n\nsomeone,  since  the  express  basis  of   the  court  order  was\r\n\nFrancisco's  potential dangerousness  and likely  eligibility for\r\n\ninvoluntary commitment in  a mental health facility.   The reason\r\n\nfor  the  ordered  psychiatric  examination,  as  Puerto   Rico's\r\n\nstatute specifically  provides, infra, is to  determine whether a\r                                               \r\n\nperson believed to  be dangerous  is dangerous, and  needs to  be\r                                              \r\n\ncommitted  immediately  in  order  to  avoid  the  kind  of  harm\r\n\nFrancisco later caused.  While under the  preliminary court order\r\n\nin issue  Francisco could only be detained for twenty-four hours,\r\n\nthe  order directed  that he  be psychiatrically  examined during\r\n\nthat period and that,  within the twenty-four hours, a  report of\r                                                             \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nhis condition be sent to the judge and proper steps be  initiated\r\n\nfor his  involuntary admittance should  that be indicated.   Thus\r                              \r\n\nthe harm that occurred  here was clearly a foreseeable  result of\r\n\ninterrupting  the protective  process begun  by the  petition and\r\n\norder.\r\n\n          Since the harm that  occurred was foreseeable, the only\r\n\nremaining  question  is  that  of  actual  cause,  i.e.,  whether\r                                                   \r\n\nFrancisco's  later  assault  with  a knife  was  actually  linked\r\n\ncausally in sufficient  degree to the police's  failure to detain\r\n\nFrancisco  for the  ordered psychiatric  examination.   I believe\r\n\nthat on this record a  factual issue is raised as to  whether the\r\n\npolice officers' failure to comply with the court order to detain\r\n\nFrancisco  was a \"substantial factor\"  in bringing about the harm\r\n\nfrom Francisco's later stabbing of Celso.6 \r\n\n          The  order the  police failed  to carry out  was issued\r\n\nunder a  comprehensive statutory  scheme for the  examination and\r\n\ninvoluntary commitment  to a  mental health facility  of mentally\r\n\nill  people who  are dangerous to  themselves or others.   In the\r\n\nfirst  step of this process,  any person who  fears an individual\r\n\nmay be psychologically unstable may  bring that individual to the\r\n\nattention of  a Puerto  Rico court.   P.R.

See Keeton, supra,    42, at 278\r                                                            \r\n(\"[T]he  1948   revision   of  the   Restatement  limited   [the]\r\napplication [of the \"substantial factor\" test] very definitely to\r\ncause in fact alone.\")  (citing, inter alia, Restatement (Second)\r                                                                           \r\nof Torts   433 (1965)).\r                  \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n6006.  This occurred  here when a relative, Mr.  Jorge Rodr guez-\r\n\nNieves,  filed a petition to the Puerto Rico court declaring that\r\n\nFrancisco  was  believed  dangerous,  having threatened  to  kill\r\n\nsomeone with a sharp  object such as a  machete or a knife.   The\r\n\npetition also  stated  that Francisco  had previously  been in  a\r\n\nrecognized mental institution.\r\n\n          The second step spelled out in  the Puerto Rico statute\r\n\nis for a judge to decide, preliminarily, whether or not there are\r\n\n\"reasonable grounds  to believe  that the  patient is  subject to\r\n\ninvoluntary admission and needs immediate hospitalization to keep\r                     \r\n\nhim  from  harming himself,  other  persons  or property.\"    Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(emphasis supplied).   The judge expressly  found such reasonable\r\n\ngrounds here and issued  a written order that Francisco was to be\r\n\ndetained for twenty-four hours and examined by  a psychiatrist to\r\n\ndetermine \"if he should be admitted immediately and involuntarily\r\n\nto the psychiatric  institution,\" as the  statute provided.   The\r\n\norder  directed that  an explanatory  report  be returned  to the\r\n\njudge  within   the  twenty-four   hours  and  a   resolution  of\r\n\nprovisional   admittance  prepared   in   the   event   continued\r\n\nhospitalization was required.  It  was the court order containing\r\n\nthe above  provisions that the  police allegedly failed  to carry\r\n\nout,  with  the result  that Francisco  was  never examined  by a\r\n\npsychiatrist  and  the  necessary   steps  never  taken  for  his\r\n\ninvoluntary hospitalization should that have  been recommended by\r\n\nthe psychiatrist.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          If Francisco  had been  examined, the  psychiatrist was\r\n\nunder a duty, as the order and Puerto Rico law provide, to report\r\n\nhis   findings  concerning   Francisco's  mental   condition  and\r\n\npotential dangerousness  back  to the  court  within  twenty-four\r\n\nhours.   If  the court  had then  found by  clear and  convincing\r\n\nevidence, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24,   6089,  that Francisco was\r                       \r\n\n\"subject to involuntary admission,\"  the court would have ordered\r\n\nhim confined  to a mental health  facility.  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.\r\n\n24,    6090.  The statute  provides that a person  is \"subject to\r\n\ninvoluntary admission\" if he  is mentally ill and if,  because of\r\n\nhis illness, he \"may reasonably  be expected to physically injure\r\n\nhimself or any other person, or damage property.\"  P.R. Laws Ann.\r\n\ntit. 24,   4002(14)(a).  \r\n\n          It  is important to  emphasize that  the order  here in\r\n\nquestion  did not merely provide for a twenty-four hour period of\r\n\ndetention.    Rather  it  was  based  on  a  judge's  finding  of\r\n\nreasonable  cause to believe  that Francisco was  a candidate for\r\n\ninvoluntary  admission,  i.e.  confinement,  in  a mental  health\r\n\nfacility.  The twenty-four hours' detention was merely the period\r\n\nwithin which he was to be evaluated, after which, if  the initial\r\n\nfinding was confirmed, he would be involuntarily committed  for a\r\n\nmore extended period.  Under Puerto Rico law, a court's order for\r\n\ninvoluntary  admission is limited,  in the  first instance,  to a\r\n\nterm of  thirty days,  but it  can be  followed by an  additional\r\n\nthirty-day order.    P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  24,    6094(a).   This\r\n\nsecond thirty-day  period may then be  supplemented by additional\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nperiods  of 180  days as  long  as the  patient \"continues  to be\r\n\nsubject to involuntary  admission.\"   P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 24,   \r\n\n6094(b).  So in effect, once involuntarily admitted, a person may\r\n\nbe  forced  to  remain  confined  in  a  mental  health  facility\r\n\nindefinitely if he  remains a  danger to himself,  others, or  to\r\n\nproperty because of a mental illness.\r\n\n          I  believe the  evidence  here plainly  creates a  jury\r\n\nissue  as to whether Francisco would likely have been confined to\r\n\na  mental  health facility  for a  sufficient  period of  time to\r\n\nrender him  unable to  stab Celso  when he  did,  had the  police\r\n\ncomplied with the  court order  to detain him  for a  psychiatric\r\n\nexamination.  A jury could find that the police officers' failure\r\n\nto  enforce the order was  a \"substantial factor\"  in the ensuing\r\n\nharm.\r\n\n          As  noted,   there  is  evidence  that   Francisco  had\r\n\nthreatened to  kill with a sharp  object, such as a  machete or a\r\n\nknife, a threat followed by stabbing his brother two weeks later.\r\n\nThe record also  indicates his prior hospitalization  in a mental\r\n\nfacility, giving  rise to an inference that  his behavior stemmed\r\n\nfrom an  underlying mental  condition.  Even  more significantly,\r\n\nthe  record   shows  a   judicial  determination,  reciting   the\r\n\nconsideration  of evidence,  that \"the  Court finds  a reasonable\r\n\nbasis  to  believe  that  [Francisco]   may  be  subject  to   an\r\n\ninvoluntary  admission treatment  and  hospitalization under  the\r\n\nprovisions of the  Puerto Rico Mental  Health Code.\"   Underlying\r\n\nthat  determination  necessarily  lay  a  finding  of  reasonable\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\ngrounds  to  believe that  Francisco  might  harm himself,  other\r\n\npersons or property.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24,   6006.  \r                                   \r\n\n          The  above facts  more  than suffice,  in  my view,  to\r\n\ndemonstrate  a triable issue over  whether, if the defendants had\r\n\ndone  their duty and  brought Francisco  to the  psychiatrist for\r\n\nexamination,  the latter  would more  likely than not  have found\r\n\nthat  Francisco was  mentally ill and  a danger to  himself or to\r\n\nothers and  recommended committing  him involuntarily.   Had that\r\n\nrecommendation been  made, it  could also be  reasonably inferred\r\n\nthat  the Puerto Rico court would have implemented it pursuant to\r\n\nthe statutory  authority  described above,  and  that  Francisco,\r\n\nbeing confined, would not have been able to stab Celso two  weeks\r\n\nlater.   Hence, I believe there is  adequate evidence to create a\r\n\nfactual issue for later trial  over whether the police  officers'\r\n\ndefault was a \"substantial factor\" in causing Celso's stabbing.7\r\n\n          The majority argues that  no reasonable jury could find\r\n\nthat the  police  officers' failure  to  bring Francisco  to  the\r\n\npsychiatrist actually  caused Celso's  injuries.  They  point out\r\n\nthat two weeks  elapsed between the  police officers' failure  to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  My colleagues' error, as I see it, is in treating causation as\r\na  matter for their own determination now rather than recognizing\r\nthat,  on  summary  judgment,  the question  is  simply  whether,\r\nviewing everything  most favorably to (here)  the plaintiffs, the\r\nrecord indicates a disputed issue of fact.  I do not see how, for\r\nthat purpose, one can  ignore the finding, similar to  a probable\r\ncause finding,  of a Puerto  Rico judge, coupled  with undisputed\r\nfacts  strongly  indicating  that  Francisco  was  both  mentally\r\nunbalanced  and   dangerous  to   others      the   criteria  for\r\ninvoluntary admission.  From these facts a reasonable  jury could\r\ninfer  that he would likely have been committed for several weeks\r\nor more, thus preventing any attack on Celso.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\ndetain Francisco and  the stabbing.  They also  insist that it is\r\n\ntoo speculative, on this record,  to know whether Francisco would\r\n\nhave  been confined or  treated so as  not to  have injured Celso\r\n\nwhen he did.\r\n\n          The time factor is hardly significant here.   Two weeks\r\n\nis  not a lengthy interval for  present purposes; it is less than\r\n\nthe  thirty days which the court could have initially ordered him\r\n\nconfined had the court determined, after psychiatric examination,\r\n\nthat he was dangerous.  \"[W]here it is evident that the influence\r\n\nof  the actor's  negligence is still  a substantial  factor, mere\r\n\nlapse of time, no  matter how long, is not sufficient  to prevent\r\n\nit from being the legal cause of the other's harm.\"   Restatement\r                                                                           \r\n\n(Second)  of Torts,   433(c) cmt. f  (1965).  The damage from the\r                            \r\n\ncollapse of a defective bridge is no less caused by the builder's\r\n\nnegligence   even  though   occurring  months   or  years   after\r\n\nconstruction.\r\n\n          As  for the argument that it is too speculative whether\r\n\nFrancisco would have been confined,  I think, for reasons already\r\n\ndiscussed,  that  the present  record  is sufficient  to  raise a\r\n\nfactual issue concerning his likely commitment that makes summary\r\n\njudgment  inappropriate.   The  evidence  of  Francisco's  mental\r\n\ninstability and  dangerousness is uncontested making  it probable\r\n\nthat  he would have  been committed.   The Puerto Rico  judge had\r\n\nalready  found   that  Francisco  was  a   likely  candidate  for\r\n\ninvoluntary commitment     a preliminary finding, to be sure, but\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nindicative of a factual issue in that judge's mind as to the need\r\n\nto commit him.\r\n\n          There is, in addition,  the affidavit of a psychologist\r\n\nwhich, if  accepted,  would  lend even  further  support  to  the\r\n\nprobability of  his commitment.   Unfortunately, as  the district\r\n\ncourt and  my colleagues note,  the affidavit is  poorly drafted.\r\n\nThe   affidavit  says   only  that   it  is   the  psychologist's\r\n\n\"understanding\"   that  Francisco   has  a   serious  personality\r\n\ndisorder.  It does say, however, that the psychologist is \"of the\r\n\nopinion that Mr. Francisco  Rodr guez-Cirilo's being  temporarily\r\n\ndetained  on March 17, 1994  for the purpose  [of] an examination\r\n\nand evaluation of his  mental condition . . . would have resulted\r\n\nin Francisco Rodr guez-Cirilo's  receipt of timely  and effective\r\n\npsychological and/or psychiatric treatment,  most likely on an in\r                                                                           \r\n\npatient  basis  over  an  extended  period  of  time,\"  (emphasis\r                                                              \r\n\nsupplied)  and expresses  the opinion  that such  treatment would\r\n\nhave prevented Francisco's later stabbing of Cirilo.\r\n\n          Given,  in  any  case,  the  other uncontested  factual\r\n\nevidence   mentioned   above   plainly   indicating   Francisco's\r\n\nabnormality  and dangerousness,  I  cannot doubt  that a  factual\r                                                                           \r\n\nissue exists over whether Francisco would have been confined and,\r                      \r\n\nif  so, rendered unable to have committed the assault in dispute.\r\n\nThe very finding by  the Puerto Rico court of  reasonable grounds\r\n\nto believe  that Francisco was subject  to involuntary commitment\r\n\nsuggests the existence of such a triable issue.  The existence of\r\n\nsuch an issue is the only question  at the present stage.  We are\r                                   \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nnot  now  acting  as factfinders.    Summary  judgment  is not  a\r\n\nsubstitute  for trial.  The credible evidence here all shows that\r\n\nFrancisco  was  suffering from  mental  instability,  having been\r\n\npreviously  hospitalized and  having  uttered  credible  threats,\r\n\nlater  carried out,  to  stab  someone  to  death.    Hence  even\r\n\nexcluding the  affidavit, the record provides a factual basis for\r\n\na  finding   that,  if   detained  as  ordered   for  psychiatric\r\n\nexamination,  Francisco would,  more likely  than not,  have been\r\n\ninvoluntarily  admitted  to  a mental  health  facility,  thereby\r\n\npreventing the  later stabbing.  The police  officers' failure to\r\n\ndetain  Francisco could thus reasonably  be found to  have been a\r\n\n\"substantial factor\" in producing Celso's injuries.  \r\n\n                    II.  The Due Process Claim\r                              II.  The Due Process Claim\r\n\n          Despite my disagreement with the majority on causation,\r\n\nI concur in the result because, like the district court, I do not\r\n\nbelieve  that the plaintiffs have  stated a violation  of the Due\r\n\nProcess Clause of the federal constitution.8 \r\n\n          Plaintiffs' due process claim does not rest, of course,\r\n\non any contention  that the police  or other agents of  the state\r\n\nattacked  or physically  harmed Celso.   This  case is  not about\r\n\nviolence  committed by agents of  the state.  Rather, Plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaim  concerns  the  all  too common  situation  where  violence\r\n\ninflicted  by a  third party  might have  been prevented  had the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8   The  Fourteenth  Amendment states,  in relevant  part, \"[N]or\r\nshall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\r\nwithout due process of law . . . .\"\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\npolice or  other public  officials  acted more  diligently.   But\r\n\nwhile police default may  be found to have  caused Celso to  lose\r\n\nthe  protection of a state statutory scheme designed to guard the\r\n\npublic against people having Francisco's potential  for violence,\r\n\nthis   unfortunate  failure   does   not  violate   the   federal\r\n\nconstitution.  As the Supreme Court wrote:\r\n\n               But nothing in the language of the Due\r\n            Process Clause itself requires  the State\r\n            to   protect   the  life,   liberty,  and\r\n            property of its citizens against invasion\r\n            by private actors.  The Clause is phrased\r\n            as a limitation  on the State's  power to\r\n            act,   not  as  a  guarantee  of  certain\r\n            minimal  levels  of safety  and security.\r\n            It  forbids the  State itself  to deprive\r\n            individuals of life, liberty, or property\r\n            without  \"due process  of  law,\" but  its\r\n            language  cannot  fairly  be extended  to\r\n            impose an affirmative  obligation on  the\r\n            State to  ensure that those  interests do\r\n            not come to harm through other means.\r\n\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189,\r                                                            \r\n\n195 (1989).  See also Estate of Gilmore v. Buckley,  787 F.2d 714\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir.)

Police\r\n\nofficers  certainly have a  duty to obey  court orders.   But the\r\n\ncourt did not, in  ordering Francisco's detention, thereby create\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nthe sort of \"special  relationship\" between the state and  all of\r\n\nFrancisco's potential  victims that  might make the  state liable\r\n\nfor any  harm  that came  to  them  at Francisco's  hands.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\ngenerally DeShaney, 489 U.S.  at 198-203 (discussing the \"special\r                            \r\n\nrelationship\"  test).  Neither  did the  state render  Celso more\r\n\nvulnerable to the danger posed by Francisco.  See id. at 201.  By\r                                                               \r\n\nfailing  to detain  him  for examination,  the defendants  merely\r\n\nfailed  to reduce a  danger    not  of the state's  own making   \r\n\nthat Francisco's violent proclivities already created. \r\n\n          The  police  officers  in  this  case  may  have  acted\r\n\nimproperly.  Faced with  a court order to detain  Francisco, they\r\n\nshould not  have substituted their  judgment for the  court's and\r\n\nrefused to  detain him  in violation  of the  court's order.   As\r\n\ndiscussed above, a jury could reasonably find that their wrongful\r\n\nfailure  to enforce the court's order was a substantial factor in\r\n\ncausing  Celso's  injury  by  Francisco.    Their  default  might\r\n\nconstitute a tort under  state law.  See Restatement  (Second) of\r                                                                           \r\n\nTorts   323  (1965) (stating  that one who  undertakes to  render\r               \r\n\nservices to  another may  be liable for  performing negligently).\r\n\nBut  \"the   Due  Process  Clause  of   the  Fourteenth  Amendment\r\n\n. . . does not  transform every tort  committed by a  state actor\r\n\ninto a constitutional violation.\"  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 202.

Celso was stabbed by his brother, Francisco Rodrguez-Cirilo (\"Francisco\"), who is not a party to the suit.  The family members filed a civil rights damages action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994) against two officers of the Puerto Rico Police Department alleging that the officers' failure to enforce a temporary detention order against Francisco caused the injury to Celso and thus violated his constitutional rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that plaintiffs failed to establish that a due process right protected under section 1983 was violated by the officers' failure to prevent private violence, and also held that plaintiffs could not establish causation.  Having reviewed the record and the parties' briefs on appeal, we find that the district court's treatment of the causation issue correctly identifies a sufficient ground for granting summary judgment to the defendants.  We therefore do not reach the nettlesome legal question of whether, in light of DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), a police officer's knowing refusal to carry out the express terms of a non-discretionary detention order can be deemed an \"affirmative act\" that, by increasing the risk of private harm to those sought to be protected by the order, may trigger due process concerns.  Cf. DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006;  Frances- Coln v. Ramrez, 107 F.3d 62, 64 (1st Cir.1997) (discussing the limited scope for relief under section 1983 where \"the government employee, in the rare and exceptional case, affirmatively acts to increase the threat of harm to the claimant\");  Soto v.

Sanchez v. Alvarado, 101 F.3d 223, 225 n. 1 (1st Cir.1996).  On March 16, 1994, Jorge Rodrguez-Nieves (\"Jorge\"), a nephew of both Celso and Francisco who is not a party in the instant suit, filed a petition pursuant to the Mental Health Code of Puerto Rico (\"Law 116\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to have his uncle Francisco involuntarily detained for psychiatric examination.  The petition stated that Francisco presented a danger to himself and others and had threatened to kill with a sharp object, such as a machete or a knife.  On March 17, 1994, a San Juan municipal court judge responded to the petition by issuing an order that Francisco be detained for examination.  The temporary detention order authorizes a law enforcement officer to detain the subject--with the assistance of health care personnel if necessary--and to take him to a psychiatric institution where he can be examined, and where he cannot be held for more than 24 hours.  If the examining doctor concludes that detention for any longer period or treatment of the subject is required, then that doctor must notify the petitioner, who must then notify the court.  The temporary detention order under Law 116 does not explicitly give police officers any discretion with regard to enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day that the order was issued, Jorge, along with two of Francisco's siblings (but not Celso), went to a police station to have the order enforced.  The defendants were at the police station and assumed the task of enforcing the order, calling on paramedics for assistance.  Later that day, the defendant police officers, the paramedics, and the three family members found Francisco at a local establishment.  Francisco refused to go with the officers, stating that he was already being treated at a veteran's hospital.  The officers then failed to carry out the order, despite the efforts of the family members to convince the officers that Francisco was dangerous.  Before departing, the officers told the family members that they themselves should take Francisco to a veteran's hospital for treatment, which is contrary to the stated procedure under Law 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No further legal steps were taken to obtain another detention order, although the plaintiffs and other family members assert that they made further informal requests to the police to take Francisco into custody.  Francisco was ultimately never taken to a hospital for examination or treatment.  On April 6, 1994, nearly three weeks after the defendants' failure to carry out the temporary detention order, the injury giving rise to this damages suit occurred.  Francisco stabbed his brother Celso while Celso was at their mother's house for a visit.  Celso had argued with Francisco about getting their mother some water and then stood out on a balcony;  a few minutes later Francisco returned and stabbed Celso in the chest with a knife.  Celso suffered injuries to his chest and to his respiratory and digestive systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought actions for damages under both section 1983 and Puerto Rico tort provisions.

Serrano-Cruz v. DFI Puerto Rico, Inc., 109 F.3d 23, 24 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential elements of a claim under section 1983 are:  First, that the defendants acted under color of state law;  and second, that the defendants' conduct worked a denial of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.  Martnez v. Coln, 54 F.3d 980, 984 (1st Cir.1995).  To satisfy the second element, plaintiffs must show that the defendants' conduct was the cause in fact of the alleged deprivation.  See Gutierrez-Rodrguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 559 (1st Cir.1989).  The issue of causation of damages in a section 1983 suit is based on basic notions of tort causation.  See Maldonado Santiago v. Velazquez Garca, 821 F.2d 822, 831 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Section 1983 imposes a causation requirement similar to that of ordinary tort law.\").  In applying basic tort principles to the facts raised by a particular section 1983 claim, the causation requirement may be fleshed out with reference to state law tort principles.  Gutierrez-Rodrguez, 882 F.2d at 561.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed in the decision below, plaintiffs cannot establish that the conduct of the defendants, in not enforcing the temporary detention order, was the legal cause of an attack occurring much later.  See Rodrguez-Cirilo v. Garca, 908 F.Supp. 85, 91 (D.P.R.1995).  The concept of proximate causation restricts tort liability to those whose conduct, beyond falling within the infinite causal web leading to an injury, was a legally significant cause.  The passage of time can certainly reduce the legal significance of a particular contributing act.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433 (1965) (lapse of time a factor to be considered in determining whether a contributing factor is substantial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remoteness in time of the harm in this case precludes a finding of proximate causation.  Although Francisco committed the kind of violence mentioned in the petition for a detention order, the space of over two weeks that passed after the officers' failure to detain Francisco, during which time family members did not attempt to obtain another detention order, renders his later act of violence too remote to impose liability on the officers.  Cf. Martnez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 285, 100 S.Ct. 553, 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980) (murder committed by parolee five months after release \"too remote\" a consequence to hold parole board liable under section 1983);  Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433 (1965).  Although the stabbing occurred at the address named in the original petition, and although the police officers may have had some indication that Celso would be at danger from an attack by Francisco,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> given the intervening time we cannot say that the officers' failure to enforce the order was the legal cause of the injury.  See Martnez, 444 U.S. at 285, 100 S.Ct. at 558-59;  Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433 cmt. f (\"Experience has shown that when a great length of time has elapsed between the actor's negligence and harm to another, a great number of contributing factors may have operated, many of which may be difficult or impossible of actual proof....  [T]he effect of the actor's conduct may thus be so attenuated as to be insignificant....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What further persuades us that the causation issue in this case is dispositive is that even if Francisco had been taken to a hospital on March 17, 1994, for examination, appellants have not shown that an examination performed on that day would have prevented the violent attack, spurred by an argument, on April 6, 1996.  The temporary detention period was itself limited to a maximum of twenty-four hours.  Appellants offered no competent evidence that could have supported a finding that an examination in Francisco's particular case would have prevented the later attack.  Appellants rely on a clinical psychologist's signed statement asserting that Francisco's \"personality disorder\" caused the stabbing, and that, had Francisco been detained on March 17, 1994, he would have received effective treatment that would have prevented the stabbing.  This statement, based solely on information collected through conversations with Francisco's relations and formed without any direct examination of either Francisco or of his medical records, is not enough to defeat defendants' motion for summary judgment and does not create a triable issue of material fact as to causation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \"The nonmoving party must establish a trial-worthy issue by presenting 'enough competent evidence to enable a finding favorable to the nonmoving party.' \"  LeBlanc v. Great Am.  Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510-11, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).  Thus, not only do appellants run into proximate causation problems, but their case also falls short with regard to demonstrating the \"but for\" aspect of causation.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts, &#167; 432 (1965).  We conclude, therefore, that defendants were properly granted summary judgment based on plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate causation under well-established tort principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' remaining arguments on appeal do not require lengthy treatment.  First, we note that the record indicates that the appellants have failed to support, with any competent evidence, their additional assertion that there existed a conspiracy between the defendants and Francisco to violate plaintiffs' civil rights.  Second, in response to appellants' claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying them an opportunity to amend their complaint after the deadline for such amendments established in the court's scheduling order, we note that even had the plaintiffs been able to amend their complaint by adding as a third defendant the supervisor of the two defendant police officers, the fundamental, insurmountable obstacle of causation would still have remained, and would still have offered a sufficient ground for summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons the district court's grant of summary judgment to defendants is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I write separately because I believe that there was sufficient evidence of causation to allow the issue to go to the jury.

Causation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think the record indicates the existence of a factual issue as to causation, precluding the granting of summary judgment in favor of Defendants on the ground of an absence of causation.  See Ahern v. O'Donnell, 109 F.3d 809, 811 (1st Cir.1997) (all inferences to be made in favor of party against whom summary judgment sought).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Causation depends upon whether, assuming the police officers violated &#167; 1983 on March 17 by not carrying out the court order directing them to take Francisco into custody for psychiatric examination, there was a sufficient causal connection between the officers' default and Francisco's stabbing of a relative two weeks later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Causation in tort law is generally divided into two concepts:  causation in fact, or actual causation, and proximate or legal causation.  See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts &#167;&#167; 41-42 (5th ed.1984).  The terms for these two concepts are sometimes confused, as are the concepts themselves.  Regardless of the terminology, however, there are two questions that must be answered to determine if a defendant's conduct \"caused\" a plaintiff's injury.  The first question is whether there was in fact some causal relationship between the conduct and the outcome.  The Restatement expresses this test as whether the defendant's conduct was a \"substantial factor\" in producing the harm.  Id. The second question is whether the circumstances and causal relationship are such that the law will impose liability on the defendant.  Sometimes this is expressed as a foreseeability test, see Keeton, supra, &#167; 42, at 273.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts, &#167; 431(b) (1965) (different terminology).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the second issue, foreseeability, that prong is plainly satisfied here.  A foreseeable result of the police officers' failure to take Francisco to the psychiatrist for examination, as ordered by the court, was that he would harm someone, since the express basis of the court order was Francisco's potential dangerousness and likely eligibility for involuntary commitment in a mental health facility.  The reason for the ordered psychiatric examination, as Puerto Rico's statute specifically provides, infra, is to determine whether a person believed to be dangerous is dangerous, and needs to be committed immediately in order to avoid the kind of harm Francisco later caused.  While under the preliminary court order in issue Francisco could only be detained for twenty-four hours, the order directed that he be psychiatrically examined during that period and that, within the twenty-four hours, a report of his condition be sent to the judge and proper steps be initiated for his involuntary admittance should that be indicated.  Thus the harm that occurred here was clearly a foreseeable result of interrupting the protective process begun by the petition and order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the harm that occurred was foreseeable, the only remaining question is that of actual cause, i.e., whether Francisco's later assault with a knife was actually linked causally in sufficient degree to the police's failure to detain Francisco for the ordered psychiatric examination.  I believe that on this record a factual issue is raised as to whether the police officers' failure to comply with the court order to detain Francisco was a \"substantial factor\" in bringing about the harm from Francisco's later stabbing of Celso.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order the police failed to carry out was issued under a comprehensive statutory scheme for the examination and involuntary commitment to a mental health facility of mentally ill people who are dangerous to themselves or others.  In the first step of this process, any person who fears an individual may be psychologically unstable may bring that individual to the attention of a Puerto Rico court.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6006.  This occurred here when a relative, Mr. Jorge Rodrguez-Nieves, filed a petition to the Puerto Rico court declaring that Francisco was believed dangerous, having threatened to kill someone with a sharp object such as a machete or a knife.  The petition also stated that Francisco had previously been in a recognized mental institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step spelled out in the Puerto Rico statute is for a judge to decide, preliminarily, whether or not there are \"reasonable grounds to believe that the patient is subject to involuntary admission and needs immediate hospitalization to keep him from harming himself, other persons or property.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).  The judge expressly found such reasonable grounds here and issued a written order that Francisco was to be detained for twenty-four hours and examined by a psychiatrist to determine \"if he should be admitted immediately and involuntarily to the psychiatric institution,\" as the statute provided.  The order directed that an explanatory report be returned to the judge within the twenty-four hours and a resolution of provisional admittance prepared in the event continued hospitalization was required.  It was the court order containing the above provisions that the police allegedly failed to carry out, with the result that Francisco was never examined by a psychiatrist and the necessary steps never taken for his involuntary hospitalization should that have been recommended by the psychiatrist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Francisco had been examined, the psychiatrist was under a duty, as the order and Puerto Rico law provide, to report his findings concerning Francisco's mental condition and potential dangerousness back to the court within twenty-four hours.  If the court had then found by clear and convincing evidence, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6089, that Francisco was \"subject to involuntary admission,\" the court would have ordered him confined to a mental health facility.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6090.  The statute provides that a person is \"subject to involuntary admission\" if he is mentally ill and if, because of his illness, he \"may reasonably be expected to physically injure himself or any other person, or damage property.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 4002(14)(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to emphasize that the order here in question did not merely provide for a twenty-four hour period of detention.  Rather it was based on a judge's finding of reasonable cause to believe that Francisco was a candidate for involuntary admission, i.e. confinement, in a mental health facility.  The twenty-four hours' detention was merely the period within which he was to be evaluated, after which, if the initial finding was confirmed, he would be involuntarily committed for a more extended period.  Under Puerto Rico law, a court's order for involuntary admission is limited, in the first instance, to a term of thirty days, but it can be followed by an additional thirty-day order.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6094(a).  This second thirty-day period may then be supplemented by additional periods of 180 days as long as the patient \"continues to be subject to involuntary admission.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6094(b).  So in effect, once involuntarily admitted, a person may be forced to remain confined in a mental health facility indefinitely if he remains a danger to himself, others, or to property because of a mental illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe the evidence here plainly creates a jury issue as to whether Francisco would likely have been confined to a mental health facility for a sufficient period of time to render him unable to stab Celso when he did, had the police complied with the court order to detain him for a psychiatric examination.  A jury could find that the police officers' failure to enforce the order was a \"substantial factor\" in the ensuing harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, there is evidence that Francisco had threatened to kill with a sharp object, such as a machete or a knife, a threat followed by stabbing his brother two weeks later.  The record also indicates his prior hospitalization in a mental facility, giving rise to an inference that his behavior stemmed from an underlying mental condition.  Even more significantly, the record shows a judicial determination, reciting the consideration of evidence, that \"the Court finds a reasonable basis to believe that [Francisco] may be subject to an involuntary admission treatment and hospitalization under the provisions of the Puerto Rico Mental Health Code.\"  Underlying that determination necessarily lay a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that Francisco might harm himself, other persons or property.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above facts more than suffice, in my view, to demonstrate a triable issue over whether, if the defendants had done their duty and brought Francisco to the psychiatrist for examination, the latter would more likely than not have found that Francisco was mentally ill and a danger to himself or to others and recommended committing him involuntarily.  Had that recommendation been made, it could also be reasonably inferred that the Puerto Rico court would have implemented it pursuant to the statutory authority described above, and that Francisco, being confined, would not have been able to stab Celso two weeks later.  Hence, I believe there is adequate evidence to create a factual issue for later trial over whether the police officers' default was a \"substantial factor\" in causing Celso's stabbing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority argues that no reasonable jury could find that the police officers' failure to bring Francisco to the psychiatrist actually caused Celso's injuries.  They point out that two weeks elapsed between the police officers' failure to detain Francisco and the stabbing.  They also insist that it is too speculative, on this record, to know whether Francisco would have been confined or treated so as not to have injured Celso when he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The time factor is hardly significant here.  Two weeks is not a lengthy interval for present purposes;  it is less than the thirty days which the court could have initially ordered him confined had the court determined, after psychiatric examination, that he was dangerous.  \"[W]here it is evident that the influence of the actor's negligence is still a substantial factor, mere lapse of time, no matter how long, is not sufficient to prevent it from being the legal cause of the other's harm.\"   Restatement (Second) of Torts, &#167; 433(c) cmt. f (1965).  The damage from the collapse of a defective bridge is no less caused by the builder's negligence even though occurring months or years after construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the argument that it is too speculative whether Francisco would have been confined, I think, for reasons already discussed, that the present record is sufficient to raise a factual issue concerning his likely commitment that makes summary judgment inappropriate.  The evidence of Francisco's mental instability and dangerousness is uncontested making it probable that he would have been committed.  The Puerto Rico judge had already found that Francisco was a likely candidate for involuntary commitment--a preliminary finding, to be sure, but indicative of a factual issue in that judge's mind as to the need to commit him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, in addition, the affidavit of a psychologist which, if accepted, would lend even further support to the probability of his commitment.  Unfortunately, as the district court and my colleagues note, the affidavit is poorly drafted.  The affidavit says only that it is the psychologist's \"understanding\" that Francisco has a serious personality disorder.  It does say, however, that the psychologist is \"of the opinion that Mr. Francisco Rodrguez-Cirilo's being temporarily detained on March 17, 1994 for the purpose [of] an examination and evaluation of his mental condition ... would have resulted in Francisco Rodrguez-Cirilo's receipt of timely and effective psychological and/or psychiatric treatment, most likely on an in patient basis over an extended period of time,\" (emphasis supplied) and expresses the opinion that such treatment would have prevented Francisco's later stabbing of Cirilo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given, in any case, the other uncontested factual evidence mentioned above plainly indicating Francisco's abnormality and dangerousness, I cannot doubt that a factual issue exists over whether Francisco would have been confined and, if so, rendered unable to have committed the assault in dispute.  The very finding by the Puerto Rico court of reasonable grounds to believe that Francisco was subject to involuntary commitment suggests the existence of such a triable issue.  The existence of such an issue is the only question at the present stage.  We are not now acting as factfinders.  Summary judgment is not a substitute for trial.  The credible evidence here all shows that Francisco was suffering from mental instability, having been previously hospitalized and having uttered credible threats, later carried out, to stab someone to death.  Hence even excluding the affidavit, the record provides a factual basis for a finding that, if detained as ordered for psychiatric examination, Francisco would, more likely than not, have been involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility, thereby preventing the later stabbing.  The police officers' failure to detain Francisco could thus reasonably be found to have been a \"substantial factor\" in producing Celso's injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Due Process Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite my disagreement with the majority on causation, I concur in the result because, like the district court, I do not believe that the plaintiffs have stated a violation of the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' due process claim does not rest, of course, on any contention that the police or other agents of the state attacked or physically harmed Celso.  This case is not about violence committed by agents of the state.  Rather, Plaintiffs' claim concerns the all too common situation where violence inflicted by a third party might have been prevented had the police or other public officials acted more diligently.  But while police default may be found to have caused Celso to lose the protection of a state statutory scheme designed to guard the public against people having Francisco's potential for violence, this unfortunate failure does not violate the federal constitution.  As the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.  The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State's power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.  It forbids the State itself to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without \"due process of law,\" but its language cannot fairly be extended to impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those interests do not come to harm through other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1003, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989).  See also Estate of Gilmore v. Buckley, 787 F.2d 714 (1st Cir.)  (holding that a county was not liable under the Due Process Clause for the death of a woman murdered by a prison inmate while he was on a furlough release, even though the county had reason to know that the victim was in special danger from the murderer), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 882, 107 S.Ct. 270, 93 L.Ed.2d 247 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the fact that the police violated the plain order of a Puerto Rico court to detain Francisco and bring him to a psychiatrist for examination change the analysis.  Police officers certainly have a duty to obey court orders.  But the court did not, in ordering Francisco's detention, thereby create the sort of \"special relationship\" between the state and all of Francisco's potential victims that might make the state liable for any harm that came to them at Francisco's hands.  See generally DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 198-203, 109 S.Ct. at 1004-07 (discussing the \"special relationship\" test).  Neither did the state render Celso more vulnerable to the danger posed by Francisco.  See id. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006.   By failing to detain him for examination, the defendants merely failed to reduce a danger--not of the state's own making--that Francisco's violent proclivities already created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police officers in this case may have acted improperly.  Faced with a court order to detain Francisco, they should not have substituted their judgment for the court's and refused to detain him in violation of the court's order.  As discussed above, a jury could reasonably find that their wrongful failure to enforce the court's order was a substantial factor in causing Celso's injury by Francisco.  Their default might constitute a tort under state law.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 323 (1965) (stating that one who undertakes to render services to another may be liable for performing negligently).  But \"the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... does not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.\"  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 202, 109 S.Ct. at 1006.   If the defendants' conduct here violated the Due Process Clause, then many everyday defaults of police, firefighters, and other public officials around the nation would likewise violate the Constitution on a similar theory.  It will be unfortunate, I believe, if, instead of relying on state legislatures and state courts to provide legal means to redress matters of this nature, federal courts transform conduct that is at most tortious into constitutional causes of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would affirm the decision of the district court because the plaintiffs have no cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the Due Process Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In view of the ambiguous wording of the plaintiffs' complaint, the district court chose to treat this section 1983 suit as one claiming a violation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.

For example, the requirement of \"causalidad adecuada\" under Puerto Rico tort law would permit the assignment of liability if the intervening third party action--that is, Francisco's stabbing--was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendants' actions.

Puerto Rico Water Resources Auth., 93 P.R.R. 168, 177-79 (P.R.1966) (harm caused by reasonably foreseeable intervening causes, including the actions of third parties, may lead to liability)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This statement, as the district court notes, would probably be found unreliable and inadmissible as expert testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 702.  Garca, 908 F.Supp. at 91-92.   In any event, the psychologist's broad assertion regarding causation does not create a triable issue in this case, where the defendant's case as to a lack of proximate causation is strong</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although the majority discusses the Restatement 's \"substantial factor\" test under the rubric of proximate causation, Rodrguez-Cirilo v. Garca, at 52 (1st Cir.1997), it is perhaps more accurately described as referring to actual causation.  See Keeton, supra, &#167; 42, at 278 (\"[T]he 1948 revision of the Restatement limited [the] application [of the \"substantial factor\" test] very definitely to cause in fact alone.\")  (citing, inter alia, Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433 (1965))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> My colleagues' error, as I see it, is in treating causation as a matter for their own determination now rather than recognizing that, on summary judgment, the question is simply whether, viewing everything most favorably to (here) the plaintiffs, the record indicates a disputed issue of fact.  I do not see how, for that purpose, one can ignore the finding, similar to a probable cause finding, of a Puerto Rico judge, coupled with undisputed facts strongly indicating that Francisco was both mentally unbalanced and dangerous to others--the criteria for involuntary admission.

On March 16, 1994, Jorge Rodrguez-Nieves (\"Jorge\"), a nephew of both Celso and Francisco who is not a party in the instant suit, filed a petition pursuant to the Mental Health Code of Puerto Rico (\"Law 116\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to have his uncle Francisco involuntarily detained for psychiatric examination.  The petition stated that Francisco presented a danger to himself and others and had threatened to kill with a sharp object, such as a machete or a knife.  On March 17, 1994, a San Juan municipal court judge responded to the petition by issuing an order that Francisco be detained for examination.  The temporary detention order authorizes a law enforcement officer to detain the subject--with the assistance of health care personnel if necessary--and to take him to a psychiatric institution where he can be examined, and where he cannot be held for more than 24 hours.  If the examining doctor concludes that detention for any longer period or treatment of the subject is required, then that doctor must notify the petitioner, who must then notify the court.  The temporary detention order under Law 116 does not explicitly give police officers any discretion with regard to enforcement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day that the order was issued, Jorge, along with two of Francisco's siblings (but not Celso), went to a police station to have the order enforced.  The defendants were at the police station and assumed the task of enforcing the order, calling on paramedics for assistance.  Later that day, the defendant police officers, the paramedics, and the three family members found Francisco at a local establishment.  Francisco refused to go with the officers, stating that he was already being treated at a veteran's hospital.  The officers then failed to carry out the order, despite the efforts of the family members to convince the officers that Francisco was dangerous.  Before departing, the officers told the family members that they themselves should take Francisco to a veteran's hospital for treatment, which is contrary to the stated procedure under Law 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No further legal steps were taken to obtain another detention order, although the plaintiffs and other family members assert that they made further informal requests to the police to take Francisco into custody.  Francisco was ultimately never taken to a hospital for examination or treatment.  On April 6, 1994, nearly three weeks after the defendants' failure to carry out the temporary detention order, the injury giving rise to this damages suit occurred.  Francisco stabbed his brother Celso while Celso was at their mother's house for a visit.  Celso had argued with Francisco about getting their mother some water and then stood out on a balcony;  a few minutes later Francisco returned and stabbed Celso in the chest with a knife.  Celso suffered injuries to his chest and to his respiratory and digestive systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought actions for damages under both section 1983 and Puerto Rico tort provisions.

Martnez v. Coln, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696203\"><a href=\"/opinion/696203/wilfredo-martinez-aka-wilfredo-martinez-rodriguez-v-rafael-colon-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 984 (1st Cir.1995).  To satisfy the second element, plaintiffs must show that the defendants' conduct was the cause in fact of the alleged deprivation.  See Gutierrez-Rodrguez v. Cartagena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527780\"><a href=\"/opinion/527780/carlos-a-gutierrez-rodriguez-v-desiderio-cartagena-and-domingo-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 559 (1st Cir.1989).  The issue of causation of damages in a section 1983 suit is based on basic notions of tort causation.  See Maldonado Santiago v. Velazquez Garca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490113\"><a href=\"/opinion/490113/linda-maldonado-santiago-v-nestor-velazquez-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 831 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Section 1983 imposes a causation requirement similar to that of ordinary tort law.\").  In applying basic tort principles to the facts raised by a particular section 1983 claim, the causation requirement may be fleshed out with reference to state law tort principles.  Gutierrez-Rodrguez, 882 F.2d at 561.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed in the decision below, plaintiffs cannot establish that the conduct of the defendants, in not enforcing the temporary detention order, was the legal cause of an attack occurring much later.  See Rodrguez-Cirilo v. Garca, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span>, 91 (D.P.R.1995).  The concept of proximate causation restricts tort liability to those whose conduct, beyond falling within the infinite causal web leading to an injury, was a legally significant cause.  The passage of time can certainly reduce the legal significance of a particular contributing act.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433 (1965) (lapse of time a factor to be considered in determining whether a contributing factor is substantial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remoteness in time of the harm in this case precludes a finding of proximate causation.  Although Francisco committed the kind of violence mentioned in the petition for a detention order, the space of over two weeks that passed after the officers' failure to detain Francisco, during which time family members did not attempt to obtain another detention order, renders his later act of violence too remote to impose liability on the officers.  Cf. Martnez v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110169\"><a href=\"/opinion/110169/martinez-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span>, 285, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110169\"><a href=\"/opinion/110169/martinez-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the stabbing occurred at the address named in the original petition, and although the police officers may have had some indication that Celso would be at danger from an attack by Francisco,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> given the intervening time we cannot say that the officers' failure to enforce the order was the legal cause of the injury.  See Martnez, 444 U.S. at 285, 100 S.Ct. at 558-59;  Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433 cmt. f (\"Experience has shown that when a great length of time has elapsed between the actor's negligence and harm to another, a great number of contributing factors may have operated, many of which may be difficult or impossible of actual proof....

The temporary detention period was itself limited to a maximum of twenty-four hours.  Appellants offered no competent evidence that could have supported a finding that an examination in Francisco's particular case would have prevented the later attack.  Appellants rely on a clinical psychologist's signed statement asserting that Francisco's \"personality disorder\" caused the stabbing, and that, had Francisco been detained on March 17, 1994, he would have received effective treatment that would have prevented the stabbing.  This statement, based solely on information collected through conversations with Francisco's relations and formed without any direct examination of either Francisco or of his medical records, is not enough to defeat defendants' motion for summary judgment and does not create a triable issue of material fact as to causation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \"The nonmoving party must establish a trial-worthy issue by presenting 'enough competent evidence to enable a finding favorable to the nonmoving party.' \"  LeBlanc v.

Thus, not only do appellants run into proximate causation problems, but their case also falls short with regard to demonstrating the \"but for\" aspect of causation.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts, &#167; 432 (1965).  We conclude, therefore, that defendants were properly granted summary judgment based on plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate causation under well-established tort principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' remaining arguments on appeal do not require lengthy treatment.  First, we note that the record indicates that the appellants have failed to support, with any competent evidence, their additional assertion that there existed a conspiracy between the defendants and Francisco to violate plaintiffs' civil rights.  Second, in response to appellants' claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying them an opportunity to amend their complaint after the deadline for such amendments established in the court's scheduling order, we note that even had the plaintiffs been able to amend their complaint by adding as a third defendant the supervisor of the two defendant police officers, the fundamental, insurmountable obstacle of causation would still have remained, and would still have offered a sufficient ground for summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons the district court's grant of summary judgment to defendants is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I write separately because I believe that there was sufficient evidence of causation to allow the issue to go to the jury.

See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts &#167;&#167; 41-42 (5th ed.1984).  The terms for these two concepts are sometimes confused, as are the concepts themselves.  Regardless of the terminology, however, there are two questions that must be answered to determine if a defendant's conduct \"caused\" a plaintiff's injury.  The first question is whether there was in fact some causal relationship between the conduct and the outcome.  The Restatement expresses this test as whether the defendant's conduct was a \"substantial factor\" in producing the harm.  Id. The second question is whether the circumstances and causal relationship are such that the law will impose liability on the defendant.  Sometimes this is expressed as a foreseeability test, see Keeton, supra, &#167; 42, at 273.  Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts, &#167; 431(b) (1965) (different terminology).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the second issue, foreseeability, that prong is plainly satisfied here.  A foreseeable result of the police officers' failure to take Francisco to the psychiatrist for examination, as ordered by the court, was that he would harm someone, since the express basis of the court order was Francisco's potential dangerousness and likely eligibility for involuntary commitment in a mental health facility.  The reason for the ordered psychiatric examination, as Puerto Rico's statute specifically provides, infra, is to determine whether a person believed to be dangerous is dangerous, and needs to be committed immediately in order to avoid the kind of harm Francisco later caused.  While under the preliminary court order in issue Francisco could only be detained for twenty-four hours, the order directed that he be psychiatrically examined during that period and that, within the twenty-four hours, a report of his condition be sent to the judge and proper steps be initiated for his involuntary admittance should that be indicated.  Thus the harm that occurred here was clearly a foreseeable result of interrupting the protective process begun by the petition and order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the harm that occurred was foreseeable, the only remaining question is that of actual cause, i.e., whether Francisco's later assault with a knife was actually linked causally in sufficient degree to the police's failure to detain Francisco for the ordered psychiatric examination.  I believe that on this record a factual issue is raised as to whether the police officers' failure to comply with the court order to detain Francisco was a \"substantial factor\" in bringing about the harm from Francisco's later stabbing of Celso.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order the police failed to carry out was issued under a comprehensive statutory scheme for the examination and involuntary commitment to a mental health facility of mentally ill people who are dangerous to themselves or others.  In the first step of this process, any person who fears an individual may be psychologically unstable may bring that individual to the attention of a Puerto Rico court.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6006.  This occurred here when a relative, Mr. Jorge Rodrguez-Nieves, filed a petition to the Puerto Rico court declaring that Francisco was believed dangerous, having threatened to kill someone with a sharp object such as a machete or a knife.  The petition also stated that Francisco had previously been in a recognized mental institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step spelled out in the Puerto Rico statute is for a judge to decide, preliminarily, whether or not there are \"reasonable grounds to believe that the patient is subject to involuntary admission and needs immediate hospitalization to keep him from harming himself, other persons or property.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).  The judge expressly found such reasonable grounds here and issued a written order that Francisco was to be detained for twenty-four hours and examined by a psychiatrist to determine \"if he should be admitted immediately and involuntarily to the psychiatric institution,\" as the statute provided.  The order directed that an explanatory report be returned to the judge within the twenty-four hours and a resolution of provisional admittance prepared in the event continued hospitalization was required.  It was the court order containing the above provisions that the police allegedly failed to carry out, with the result that Francisco was never examined by a psychiatrist and the necessary steps never taken for his involuntary hospitalization should that have been recommended by the psychiatrist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Francisco had been examined, the psychiatrist was under a duty, as the order and Puerto Rico law provide, to report his findings concerning Francisco's mental condition and potential dangerousness back to the court within twenty-four hours.  If the court had then found by clear and convincing evidence, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6089, that Francisco was \"subject to involuntary admission,\" the court would have ordered him confined to a mental health facility.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6090.  The statute provides that a person is \"subject to involuntary admission\" if he is mentally ill and if, because of his illness, he \"may reasonably be expected to physically injure himself or any other person, or damage property.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 4002(14)(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to emphasize that the order here in question did not merely provide for a twenty-four hour period of detention.  Rather it was based on a judge's finding of reasonable cause to believe that Francisco was a candidate for involuntary admission, i.e. confinement, in a mental health facility.  The twenty-four hours' detention was merely the period within which he was to be evaluated, after which, if the initial finding was confirmed, he would be involuntarily committed for a more extended period.  Under Puerto Rico law, a court's order for involuntary admission is limited, in the first instance, to a term of thirty days, but it can be followed by an additional thirty-day order.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6094(a).  This second thirty-day period may then be supplemented by additional periods of 180 days as long as the patient \"continues to be subject to involuntary admission.\"  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6094(b).  So in effect, once involuntarily admitted, a person may be forced to remain confined in a mental health facility indefinitely if he remains a danger to himself, others, or to property because of a mental illness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe the evidence here plainly creates a jury issue as to whether Francisco would likely have been confined to a mental health facility for a sufficient period of time to render him unable to stab Celso when he did, had the police complied with the court order to detain him for a psychiatric examination.  A jury could find that the police officers' failure to enforce the order was a \"substantial factor\" in the ensuing harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, there is evidence that Francisco had threatened to kill with a sharp object, such as a machete or a knife, a threat followed by stabbing his brother two weeks later.  The record also indicates his prior hospitalization in a mental facility, giving rise to an inference that his behavior stemmed from an underlying mental condition.  Even more significantly, the record shows a judicial determination, reciting the consideration of evidence, that \"the Court finds a reasonable basis to believe that [Francisco] may be subject to an involuntary admission treatment and hospitalization under the provisions of the Puerto Rico Mental Health Code.\"  Underlying that determination necessarily lay a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that Francisco might harm himself, other persons or property.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 24, &#167; 6006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above facts more than suffice, in my view, to demonstrate a triable issue over whether, if the defendants had done their duty and brought Francisco to the psychiatrist for examination, the latter would more likely than not have found that Francisco was mentally ill and a danger to himself or to others and recommended committing him involuntarily.  Had that recommendation been made, it could also be reasonably inferred that the Puerto Rico court would have implemented it pursuant to the statutory authority described above, and that Francisco, being confined, would not have been able to stab Celso two weeks later.  Hence, I believe there is adequate evidence to create a factual issue for later trial over whether the police officers' default was a \"substantial factor\" in causing Celso's stabbing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority argues that no reasonable jury could find that the police officers' failure to bring Francisco to the psychiatrist actually caused Celso's injuries.  They point out that two weeks elapsed between the police officers' failure to detain Francisco and the stabbing.  They also insist that it is too speculative, on this record, to know whether Francisco would have been confined or treated so as not to have injured Celso when he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The time factor is hardly significant here.  Two weeks is not a lengthy interval for present purposes;  it is less than the thirty days which the court could have initially ordered him confined had the court determined, after psychiatric examination, that he was dangerous.  \"[W]here it is evident that the influence of the actor's negligence is still a substantial factor, mere lapse of time, no matter how long, is not sufficient to prevent it from being the legal cause of the other's harm.\"   Restatement (Second) of Torts, &#167; 433(c) cmt. f (1965).  The damage from the collapse of a defective bridge is no less caused by the builder's negligence even though occurring months or years after construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the argument that it is too speculative whether Francisco would have been confined, I think, for reasons already discussed, that the present record is sufficient to raise a factual issue concerning his likely commitment that makes summary judgment inappropriate.  The evidence of Francisco's mental instability and dangerousness is uncontested making it probable that he would have been committed.  The Puerto Rico judge had already found that Francisco was a likely candidate for involuntary commitment--a preliminary finding, to be sure, but indicative of a factual issue in that judge's mind as to the need to commit him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, in addition, the affidavit of a psychologist which, if accepted, would lend even further support to the probability of his commitment.  Unfortunately, as the district court and my colleagues note, the affidavit is poorly drafted.  The affidavit says only that it is the psychologist's \"understanding\" that Francisco has a serious personality disorder.  It does say, however, that the psychologist is \"of the opinion that Mr. Francisco Rodrguez-Cirilo's being temporarily detained on March 17, 1994 for the purpose [of] an examination and evaluation of his mental condition ... would have resulted in Francisco Rodrguez-Cirilo's receipt of timely and effective psychological and/or psychiatric treatment, most likely on an in patient basis over an extended period of time,\" (emphasis supplied) and expresses the opinion that such treatment would have prevented Francisco's later stabbing of Cirilo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given, in any case, the other uncontested factual evidence mentioned above plainly indicating Francisco's abnormality and dangerousness, I cannot doubt that a factual issue exists over whether Francisco would have been confined and, if so, rendered unable to have committed the assault in dispute.  The very finding by the Puerto Rico court of reasonable grounds to believe that Francisco was subject to involuntary commitment suggests the existence of such a triable issue.  The existence of such an issue is the only question at the present stage.  We are not now acting as factfinders.  Summary judgment is not a substitute for trial.  The credible evidence here all shows that Francisco was suffering from mental instability, having been previously hospitalized and having uttered credible threats, later carried out, to stab someone to death.  Hence even excluding the affidavit, the record provides a factual basis for a finding that, if detained as ordered for psychiatric examination, Francisco would, more likely than not, have been involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility, thereby preventing the later stabbing.  The police officers' failure to detain Francisco could thus reasonably be found to have been a \"substantial factor\" in producing Celso's injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Due Process Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite my disagreement with the majority on causation, I concur in the result because, like the district court, I do not believe that the plaintiffs have stated a violation of the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' due process claim does not rest, of course, on any contention that the police or other agents of the state attacked or physically harmed Celso.  This case is not about violence committed by agents of the state.  Rather, Plaintiffs' claim concerns the all too common situation where violence inflicted by a third party might have been prevented had the police or other public officials acted more diligently.  But while police default may be found to have caused Celso to lose the protection of a state statutory scheme designed to guard the public against people having Francisco's potential for violence, this unfortunate failure does not violate the federal constitution.  As the Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.  The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State's power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.  It forbids the State itself to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without \"due process of law,\" but its language cannot fairly be extended to impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those interests do not come to harm through other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeShaney v.

Police officers certainly have a duty to obey court orders.  But the court did not, in ordering Francisco's detention, thereby create the sort of \"special relationship\" between the state and all of Francisco's potential victims that might make the state liable for any harm that came to them at Francisco's hands.  See generally DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 198-203, 109 S.Ct. at 1004-07 (discussing the \"special relationship\" test).  Neither did the state render Celso more vulnerable to the danger posed by Francisco.  See id. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006.   By failing to detain him for examination, the defendants merely failed to reduce a danger--not of the state's own making--that Francisco's violent proclivities already created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police officers in this case may have acted improperly.  Faced with a court order to detain Francisco, they should not have substituted their judgment for the court's and refused to detain him in violation of the court's order.  As discussed above, a jury could reasonably find that their wrongful failure to enforce the court's order was a substantial factor in causing Celso's injury by Francisco.  Their default might constitute a tort under state law.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 323 (1965) (stating that one who undertakes to render services to another may be liable for performing negligently).  But \"the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... does not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.\"  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 202, 109 S.Ct. at 1006.   If the defendants' conduct here violated the Due Process Clause, then many everyday defaults of police, firefighters, and other public officials around the nation would likewise violate the Constitution on a similar theory.  It will be unfortunate, I believe, if, instead of relying on state legislatures and state courts to provide legal means to redress matters of this nature, federal courts transform conduct that is at most tortious into constitutional causes of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would affirm the decision of the district court because the plaintiffs have no cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the Due Process Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In view of the ambiguous wording of the plaintiffs' complaint, the district court chose to treat this section 1983 suit as one claiming a violation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.

See Keeton, supra, &#167; 42, at 278 (\"[T]he 1948 revision of the Restatement limited [the] application [of the \"substantial factor\" test] very definitely to cause in fact alone.\")  (citing, inter alia, Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433 (1965))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> My colleagues' error, as I see it, is in treating causation as a matter for their own determination now rather than recognizing that, on summary judgment, the question is simply whether, viewing everything most favorably to (here) the plaintiffs, the record indicates a disputed issue of fact.  I do not see how, for that purpose, one can ignore the finding, similar to a probable cause finding, of a Puerto Rico judge, coupled with undisputed facts strongly indicating that Francisco was both mentally unbalanced and dangerous to others--the criteria for involuntary admission.  From these facts a reasonable jury could infer that he would likely have been committed for several weeks or more, thus preventing any attack on Celso</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The Fourteenth Amendment states, in relevant part, \"[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
