Separate statements of Judges\n\nStahl, Torruella and Lipez are attached.\n\n\n\n\n                               By the Court:\n\n                                Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n                               By: Julie Gregg, Appeals Attorney\n\f              STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.                I write because the\n\naffirmance of the district court's decision by this equally\n\ndivided en banc court marks the first time that a court of\n\nappeals has let stand a district court ruling that the presence\n\nof a large quantity of drugs and a weapon seen at some earlier\n\nbut unspecified time            standing alone satisfies the \"reasonable\n\nsuspicion\" standard set out by the Supreme Court in Richards v.\n\nWisconsin, 520 U.S. 385, 394 (1997), regarding when the police\n\nmay dispense with their obligation to \"knock and announce\"\n\nbefore executing a warrant.\n\n              In    the   affidavit         supporting   their   March    17,    1998\n\nwarrant application, the police informed the magistrate judge\n\nthat earlier that month, a reliable confidential informant told\n\nthem    that       he   had   been     in    the   defendant's    home    (at    some\n\nindeterminate time in the past) and had observed \"large amounts\n\nof cocaine as well as at least one firearm.\"                             Later, the\n\naffidavit stated that \"sometime during the past five days,\" the\n\ninformant had been in the apartment and \"had observed a large\n\namount   of    cocaine        within    the    residence.\"       Apparently,      the\n\ninformant made no mention of a weapon and seemingly the police\n\ndid    not    inquire     whether       any    weapons   were    present    in    the\n\napartment on that occasion.                   The affidavit also mentioned a\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fprior drug arrest of the defendant in Connecticut, although the\n\ndate and circumstances of the arrest were not included.             The\n\npolice affidavit indicated that a no-knock warrant was being\n\nsought; however, the original complaint did not specifically\n\ninclude any \"no-knock\" language.         The magistrate judge directed\n\nthe officer to make a hand-written notation clarifying that the\n\npolice were applying for a no-knock warrant.            Despite these\n\nchanges to the complaint, however, nowhere on the face of the\n\nwarrant does it indicate that the magistrate judge granted the\n\nno-knock request.      The police have acknowledged that there was\n\nno change in circumstances between the time that they obtained\n\nthe warrant and the date of its execution.           Nonetheless, the\n\npolice maintain that, based on these facts, they were entitled\n\nto make a no-knock entry even without the magistrate's approval.\n\n          In Richards, the Supreme Court made clear that the\n\ndetermination of whether there is a \"reasonable suspicion\" of\n\nthe   existence   of    \"exigent    circumstances,\"     such   as   the\n\ndestruction of evidence or dangerousness to the police, in order\n\nto justify a no-knock entry must be based on an examination of\n\nthe \"particular circumstances\" of the case.          520 U.S. at 394.\n\nThe pronouncement of any per se rule would be antithetical to\n\nthe Supreme Court's instruction that lower courts conduct a\n\nfact-specific inquiry.     However, based on the information that\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwas presented to the lower court in this case, which all parties\n\nconcede was \"scant,\" the district court simply could not have\n\ndetermined    that   there   was   reasonable   suspicion   that   this\n\ndefendant presented a risk of danger to the police without\n\ndeciding that drugs plus a gun amounts to per se \"reasonable\n\nsuspicion.\"   No other circuit has announced such a blanket rule,\n\nand in the cases where reasonable suspicion was found, those\n\ncourts were presented with specific information        regarding that\n\nindividual defendant's violent criminal history, belligerent\n\ndisposition, or other factors indicating the likelihood that the\n\ndefendant would pose a threat to the safety of the police.1         The\n\n\n    1 See United States v. Geraldo, No. 00-3115, 2001 WL 1488587,\nat *5 (D.C. Cir.

Lalor, 996 F.2d 1578, 1584-85 (4th\nCir. 1993) (finding no-knock entry was permissible on the basis\nof officer safety concerns where police had found a weapon on\ndefendant at the time of his arrest on an unrelated charge five\ndays earlier and in light of the fact that the defendant had\nbeen \"belligerent\" and had made \"derogatory remarks about the\npolice\" during an encounter with officers earlier that same\nmonth).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fdeviates from well-established First Circuit precedent requiring\n\nthat       no-knock    entries     be     supported     by    the     particular\n\ncircumstance of a specific case.2\n\n              All of the judges who originally heard this case agree\n\nthat the panel's decision should have been reinstated, and that\n\nthis matter should have been remanded to the district court for\n\nthe    development     of   a    more   adequate      factual   record.       The\n\nsignificance of this decision letting the ruling of the district\n\ncourt stand cannot be ignored, and its capacity to undermine the\n\nprotections       of    the      Fourth       Amendment      should     not    be\n\nunderestimated.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     See, e.g., United States v. Hawkins, 139 F.3d 29, 32 (1st\nCir. 1998) (noting defendant's \"copious record of violent\nconvictions, coupled with the attesting police officer's\npersonal knowledge of a recent armed action by him\"); United\nStates v. Jewell, 60 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1995) (finding no-\nknock entry justified where defendant kept a pit bull dog in the\napartment, and had an \"extensive history of arrest and\nconviction for violent crimes\").\n\n                                        -6-\n\f              TORRUELLA,        Circuit      Judge.        I    write   separately     to\n\nexplain my vote to reverse the district court's ruling, and to\n\nvoice    my      criticism       of    the    existing         \"knock   and    announce\"\n\njurisprudence.\n\n              We are required to review the factual record of this\n\ncase in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Richards v.\n\nWisconsin, 520 U.S. 385 (1997), and our own circuit caselaw on\n\nthis issue.           Both Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent\n\nclearly requires             something more compelling than the existence\n\nof drugs and a weapon to satisfy the \"reasonable suspicion\"\n\nstandard before the police can dispense with the obligation to\n\n\"knock    and    announce\"       when     executing       a    warrant.       See   supra\n\n(Stahl,       J.).      My    vote,    then,       is   dictated    by    the   clearly\n\nestablished precedent to which I am bound.\n\n              Nevertheless, I write to express my criticism for the\n\nprecedent I uphold.            Everyday experience demonstrates that the\n\npresence of weapons and drugs for sale in the same locale\n\ncreates a high probability that violence will ensue.                          Given this\n\nheightened danger, it is unreasonable for courts to expose law\n\nenforcement          officials    to    an    even      greater    risk   of    harm   by\n\nrequiring them to announce their presence to their would-be\n\nattackers.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\f          It is thus entirely reasonable to presume a high risk\n\nof violence in a situation such as this and          unreasonable to\n\nendanger the police even further by requiring them to \"knock and\n\nannounce.\"\n\nBecause the ultimate standard under the Fourth Amendment is\n\nreasonableness, see Camara v. Mun. Court of San Francisco, 387\n\nU.S. 523, 539 (1967), I would endorse a per se rule supporting\n\nno-knock police entries in circumstances where the police --\n\nacting   on   reliable   information   --   reasonably   believe   that\n\nweapons and drugs are present at the place to be searched.3\n\n          The state of the law being otherwise, however, I am\n\ncompelled to vote to reverse the district court's ruling on the\n\ngrounds that the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard has not been\n\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\n\n    3This position assumes, of course, that all other Fourth\nAmendment requirements have been satisfied.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f                   LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    As a member of the panel\n\nthat originally heard this case, I write separately to explain\n\nwhy I still cannot vote to affirm the decision of the trial\n\ncourt and why I believe that the panel correctly remanded this\n\ncase to the trial court for further consideration.           In my view,\n\nthe trial court made two errors:          (1) its finding that the\n\nevidence before the magistrate judge supported a reasonable\n\nsuspicion of dangerousness to the police, justifying a no-knock\n\nentry; and (2) its failure to resolve the important factual\n\nquestion of whether or not the magistrate judge had authorized\n\na no-knock warrant.\n\n              Reasonable Suspicion of Dangerousness\n\n           I accept the proposition that the presence of drugs and\n\na gun in an apartment where drug dealing is suspected justifies\n\nthe   reasonable   suspicion,   without   more,   that   a   \"knock   and\n\nannounce\" entry would endanger the police.           In my view, to\n\nobtain authorization for a no-knock entry, the police need not\n\nshow that the defendant presented a risk of danger to the police\n\nbecause of facts peculiar to that defendant, such as a violent\n\ncriminal history, recent threats or other history that would\n\nstrengthen the suspicion of the defendant’s propensity to use\n\nthe gun.   Any such requirement would ignore the reality that the\n\npresence of a gun at a site where drugs are sold signals the\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fpossibility    of    danger        and   would   expose    police    officers    to\n\nunreasonable risks.        Indeed, I believe that the Supreme Court,\n\napplying Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385 (1997), would\n\nagree.\n\n            However, these unreasonable risks support a no-knock\n\nentry when there is a reasonable suspicion of the presence of a\n\ngun at the time of the entry.              In this case, the evidence of the\n\npresence of a gun was so stale and so scant that it did not\n\njustify a reasonable suspicion that a gun would be present when\n\nthe officers entered the apartment.                 United States v. Schaefer,\n\n87   F.3d   562,    568   (1st      Cir.    1996)    (acknowledging     that    \"an\n\naffidavit    supporting        a    search   warrant      must   contain    timely\n\ninformation or else it will fail\"); United States v. Dauphinee,\n\n538 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1976) (\"It is well established that the\n\ntemporal proximity or remoteness of the events observed has a\n\nbearing on the validity of a warrant.\"); Rosencranz v. United\n\nStates, 356 F.2d 310, 315-16 n.3 (1st Cir. 1966)(same).\n\n            According     to       the   affidavit    supporting     the   warrant\n\napplication, the police's confidential source indicated that he\n\nhad been in the apartment in question and had observed \"large\n\namounts of cocaine as well as at least one firearm.\"                       There is\n\nno evidence as to when this sighting occurred.                   In addition, the\n\naffidavit revealed that on another occasion the informant had\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fseen a large amount of cocaine in defendant's apartment five\n\ndays prior to the warrant application; however, nothing in the\n\naffidavit indicated the presence of a firearm in the apartment\n\non that occasion.       Without suggesting that five days is the\n\ncontrolling standard of recentness, if the affidavit in this\n\ncase had disclosed reliable information as to the presence of\n\nboth the gun and drugs within five days of the request for a\n\nwarrant, that evidence would have been sufficient to meet the\n\nreasonable suspicion standard.           That, however, is not the record\n\nbefore us.     For that reason, I disagree with the outcome reached\n\nby the trial court.\n\n         Approval or Disapproval of a No-Knock Warrant\n\n          In addition, the government argued to the panel that\n\nthey should have an opportunity upon remand to invoke the Leon\n\ngood   faith   exception      in   the    event    of   a   finding   that   the\n\nmagistrate judge had wrongly granted a no knock warrant upon\n\nwhich they reasonably relied.            See United States v. Leon, 468\n\nU.S.   897,    922   (1984)   (holding      that    \"evidence    obtained    in\n\nobjectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated\n\nsearch warrant\" need not be suppressed).                The panel agreed that\n\nthe government should have that opportunity, believing that it\n\nshould not be disadvantaged because the trial court failed to\n\naddress that important issue.            Of course, the trial court could\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\ffind that the magistrate judge refused to authorize a no-knock\n\nentry.    If so, the officers would not have been justified in\n\ndisregarding that decision of the magistrate judge in carrying\n\nout a no-knock entry.        As Judge Stahl has noted, the police\n\nacknowledge that there was no change in circumstances between\n\nthe time the magistrate judge issued the warrant and the date of\n\nits execution that would have justified disregarding a denial of\n\ntheir request for a no-knock warrant.         Cf. Richards, 520 U.S. at\n\n395-96 n.7 (holding that magistrate's decision not to authorize\n\na   no-knock   entry   did   not   preclude     no-knock   entry   where\n\ncircumstances that confronted officers at the time of entry\n\njustified their ultimate decision to enter unannounced).             See\n\nUnited States v. Sargent, 150 F.Supp.2d 157, 161 (D.Me. 2001)\n\n(recognizing that courts tend to excuse police's failure to\n\nproperly announce their presence (notwithstanding denial of no-\n\nknock warrant) where \"new critical events\" transpired between\n\ntime that warrant issued and time that police enter premises).\n\nThe record as it stands leaves open the possibility that the\n\npolice acted contrary to a judicial order through the no-knock\n\nentry.    That troubling prospect also precludes me from affirming\n\nthe district court's decision and supports the wisdom of a\n\nremand.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f",

Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385 (1997), and our own circuit caselaw on this issue. Both Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent clearly requires something more compelling than the existence of drugs and a weapon to satisfy the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard before the police can dispense with the obligation to \"knock and announce\" when executing a warrant. See supra (Stahl, J.). My vote, then, is dictated by the clearly established precedent to which I am bound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I write to express my criticism for the precedent I uphold. Everyday experience demonstrates that the presence of weapons and drugs for sale in the same locale creates a high probability that violence will ensue. Given this heightened danger, it is unreasonable for courts to expose law enforcement officials to an even greater risk of harm by requiring them to announce their presence to their would-be attackers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus entirely reasonable to presume a high risk of violence in a situation such as this and unreasonable to endanger the police even further by requiring them to \"knock and announce.\" Because the ultimate standard under the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, see Camara v. Mun. Court of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 539 (1967), I would endorse a per se rule supporting no-knock police entries in circumstances where the police -- acting on reliable information -- reasonably believe that weapons and drugs are present at the place to be searched.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state of the law being otherwise, however, I am compelled to vote to reverse the district court's ruling on the grounds that the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard has not been satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This position assumes, of course, that all other Fourth Amendment requirements have been satisfied.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. As a member of the panel that originally heard this case, I write separately to explain why I still cannot vote to affirm the decision of the trial court and why I believe that the panel correctly remanded this case to the trial court for further consideration. In my view, the trial court made two errors: (1) its finding that the evidence before the magistrate judge supported a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness to the police, justifying a no-knock entry; and (2) its failure to resolve the important factual question of whether or not the magistrate judge had authorized a no-knock warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Reasonable Suspicion of Dangerousness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I accept the proposition that the presence of drugs and a gun in an apartment where drug dealing is suspected justifies the reasonable suspicion, without more, that a \"knock and announce\" entry would endanger the police. In my view, to obtain authorization for a no-knock entry, the police need not show that the defendant presented a risk of danger to the police because of facts peculiar to that defendant, such as a violent criminal history, recent threats or other history that would strengthen the suspicion of the defendant's propensity to use the gun. Any such requirement would ignore the reality that the presence of a gun at a site where drugs are sold signals the possibility of danger and would expose police officers to unreasonable risks. Indeed, I believe that the Supreme Court, applying Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385 (1997), would agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, these unreasonable risks support a no-knock entry when there is a reasonable suspicion of the presence of a gun at the time of the entry. In this case, the evidence of the presence of a gun was so stale and so scant that it did not justify a reasonable suspicion that a gun would be present when the officers entered the apartment. United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 568 (1st Cir. 1996) (acknowledging that \"an affidavit supporting a search warrant must contain timely information or else it will fail\"); United States v. Dauphinee, 538 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1976) (\"It is well established that the temporal proximity or remoteness of the events observed has a bearing on the validity of a warrant.\"); Rosencranz v. United States, 356 F.2d 310, 315-16 n.3 (1st Cir. 1966)(same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the affidavit supporting the warrant application, the police's confidential source indicated that he had been in the apartment in question and had observed \"large amounts of cocaine as well as at least one firearm.\" There is no evidence as to when this sighting occurred. In addition, the affidavit revealed that on another occasion the informant had seen a large amount of cocaine in defendant's apartment five days prior to the warrant application; however, nothing in the affidavit indicated the presence of a firearm in the apartment on that occasion. Without suggesting that five days is the controlling standard of recentness, if the affidavit in this case had disclosed reliable information as to the presence of both the gun and drugs within five days of the request for a warrant, that evidence would have been sufficient to meet the reasonable suspicion standard. That, however, is not the record before us. For that reason, I disagree with the outcome reached by the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approval or Disapproval of a No-Knock Warrant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the government argued to the panel that they should have an opportunity upon remand to invoke the Leon good faith exception in the event of a finding that the magistrate judge had wrongly granted a no knock warrant upon which they reasonably relied. See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (1984) (holding that \"evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant\" need not be suppressed). The panel agreed that the government should have that opportunity, believing that it should not be disadvantaged because the trial court failed to address that important issue. Of course, the trial court could find that the magistrate judge refused to authorize a no-knock entry. If so, the officers would not have been justified in disregarding that decision of the magistrate judge in carrying out a no-knock entry. As Judge Stahl has noted, the police acknowledge that there was no change in circumstances between the time the magistrate judge issued the warrant and the date of its execution that would have justified disregarding a denial of their request for a no-knock warrant. Cf. Richards, 520 U.S. at 395-96 n.7 (holding that magistrate's decision not to authorize a no-knock entry did not preclude no-knock entry where circumstances that confronted officers at the time of entry justified their ultimate decision to enter unannounced). See United States v. Sargent, 150 F.Supp.2d 157, 161 (D.Me. 2001) (recognizing that courts tend to excuse police's failure to properly announce their presence (notwithstanding denial of no-knock warrant) where \"new critical events\" transpired between time that warrant issued and time that police enter premises). The record as it stands leaves open the possibility that the police acted contrary to a judicial order through the no-knock entry. That troubling prospect also precludes me from affirming the district court's decision and supports the wisdom of a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The affidavit also mentioned a prior drug arrest of the defendant in Connecticut, although the date and circumstances of the arrest were not included. The police affidavit indicated that a no-knock warrant was being sought; however, the original complaint did not specifically include any \"no-knock\" language.

Despite these changes to the complaint, however, nowhere on the face of the warrant does it indicate that the magistrate judge granted the no-knock request.

Both Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent clearly requires something more compelling than the existence of drugs and a weapon to satisfy the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard before the police can dispense with the obligation to \"knock and announce\" when executing a warrant. See supra (Stahl, J.). My vote, then, is dictated by the clearly established precedent to which I am bound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, I write to express my criticism for the precedent I uphold. Everyday experience demonstrates that the presence of weapons and drugs for sale in the same locale creates a high probability that violence will ensue. Given this heightened danger, it is unreasonable for courts to expose law enforcement officials to an even greater risk of harm by requiring them to announce their presence to their would-be attackers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus entirely reasonable to presume a high risk of violence in a situation such as this and unreasonable to endanger the police even further by requiring them to \"knock and announce.\" Because the ultimate standard under the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, see Camara v. Mun. Court of San Francisco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107473\"><a href=\"/opinion/107473/camara-v-municipal-court-of-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span>, 539 (1967), I would endorse a per se rule supporting no-knock police entries in circumstances where the police -- acting on reliable information -- reasonably believe that weapons and drugs are present at the place to be searched.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state of the law being otherwise, however, I am compelled to vote to reverse the district court's ruling on the grounds that the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard has not been satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This position assumes, of course, that all other Fourth Amendment requirements have been satisfied.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. As a member of the panel that originally heard this case, I write separately to explain why I still cannot vote to affirm the decision of the trial court and why I believe that the panel correctly remanded this case to the trial court for further consideration. In my view, the trial court made two errors: (1) its finding that the evidence before the magistrate judge supported a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness to the police, justifying a no-knock entry; and (2) its failure to resolve the important factual question of whether or not the magistrate judge had authorized a no-knock warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Reasonable Suspicion of Dangerousness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I accept the proposition that the presence of drugs and a gun in an apartment where drug dealing is suspected justifies the reasonable suspicion, without more, that a \"knock and announce\" entry would endanger the police. In my view, to obtain authorization for a no-knock entry, the police need not show that the defendant presented a risk of danger to the police because of facts peculiar to that defendant, such as a violent criminal history, recent threats or other history that would strengthen the suspicion of the defendant's propensity to use the gun. Any such requirement would ignore the reality that the presence of a gun at a site where drugs are sold signals the possibility of danger and would expose police officers to unreasonable risks. Indeed, I believe that the Supreme Court, applying Richards v. Wisconsin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118103\"><a href=\"/opinion/118103/richards-v-wisconsin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span> (1997), would agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, these unreasonable risks support a no-knock entry when there is a reasonable suspicion of the presence of a gun at the time of the entry. In this case, the evidence of the presence of a gun was so stale and so scant that it did not justify a reasonable suspicion that a gun would be present when the officers entered the apartment. United States v. Schaefer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196839\"><a href=\"/opinion/196839/united-states-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir. 1996) (acknowledging that \"an affidavit supporting a search warrant must contain timely information or else it will fail\"); United States v.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"270626\"><a href=\"/opinion/270626/samuel-rosencranz-v-united-states-of-america-anthony-dipietro-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span>, 315-16 n.3 (1st Cir. 1966)(same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the affidavit supporting the warrant application, the police's confidential source indicated that he had been in the apartment in question and had observed \"large amounts of cocaine as well as at least one firearm.\" There is no evidence as to when this sighting occurred. In addition, the affidavit revealed that on another occasion the informant had seen a large amount of cocaine in defendant's apartment five days prior to the warrant application; however, nothing in the affidavit indicated the presence of a firearm in the apartment on that occasion. Without suggesting that five days is the controlling standard of recentness, if the affidavit in this case had disclosed reliable information as to the presence of both the gun and drugs within five days of the request for a warrant, that evidence would have been sufficient to meet the reasonable suspicion standard. That, however, is not the record before us. For that reason, I disagree with the outcome reached by the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approval or Disapproval of a No-Knock Warrant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the government argued to the panel that they should have an opportunity upon remand to invoke the Leon good faith exception in the event of a finding that the magistrate judge had wrongly granted a no knock warrant upon which they reasonably relied. See United States v. Leon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 922 (1984) (holding that \"evidence obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search warrant\" need not be suppressed). The panel agreed that the government should have that opportunity, believing that it should not be disadvantaged because the trial court failed to address that important issue. Of course, the trial court could find that the magistrate judge refused to authorize a no-knock entry. If so, the officers would not have been justified in disregarding that decision of the magistrate judge in carrying out a no-knock entry. As Judge Stahl has noted, the police acknowledge that there was no change in circumstances between the time the magistrate judge issued the warrant and the date of its execution that would have justified disregarding a denial of their request for a no-knock warrant. Cf. Richards, 520 U.S. at 395-96 n.7 (holding that magistrate's decision not to authorize a no-knock entry did not preclude no-knock entry where circumstances that confronted officers at the time of entry justified their ultimate decision to enter unannounced). See United States v. Sargent, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2468297\"><a href=\"/opinion/2468297/united-states-v-sargent/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 161 (D.Me. 2001) (recognizing that courts tend to excuse police's failure to properly announce their presence (notwithstanding denial of no-knock warrant) where \"new critical events\" transpired between time that warrant issued and time that police enter premises). The record as it stands leaves open the possibility that the police acted contrary to a judicial order through the no-knock entry. That troubling prospect also precludes me from affirming the district court's decision and supports the wisdom of a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
