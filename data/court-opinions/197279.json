The  venture\r\n\nfailed, and they sued the court-appointed receiver which sold\r\n\nthem  the farm and the bank which had originally financed the\r\n\nproject.   A jury found against plaintiffs on their claims of\r\n\ncommon law  fraud and  misrepresentation for failure  to meet\r\n\ntheir burden of showing proximate cause.  The district court,\r\n\ninitially  finding  plaintiffs' allegations  actionable under\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws  ch. 93A (\"chapter  93A\"), found after  trial\r\n\nthat  defendants  had committed  unfair  and deceptive  trade\r\n\npractices,  but  that  their  offending acts  did  not  occur\r\n\n\"primarily and substantially\"  in Massachusetts, as  required\r\n\nby chapter  93A.  Plaintiffs recovered  nothing.  Defendants'\r\n\nmotion for  attorneys' fees was  also denied.

Aquacare\r\n\nprepared  a  prospectus  (the   Aquacare  I  report),   which\r\n\npresented  general  information   about  the  biological  and\r\n\ntechnical aspects of the  proposed operation.  The prospectus\r\n\nalso contained financial  projections and  asserted that  the\r\n\nproduction capacity  of  the contemplated  facility would  be\r\n\n131.8 tons  of fish in  the first year  of operation and  360\r\n\ntons annually thereafter.\r\n\n          The Royal  Bank of Canada financed the construction\r\n\nof  the  farm, which  was operated  by  a firm  called Marine\r\n\nHarvesting, Ltd. (\"Marine\").  Fish were first introduced into\r\n\nthe facility  in December  1987, but there  were construction\r\n\ndelays  and  the plant  was  not completed  until  June 1988.\r\n\nThings went badly from the  start.  The fish did not  grow as\r\n\nfast as  anticipated  and  had  unexpectedly  high  mortality\r\n\nrates.  By October  1988, the fish had not yet reached market\r\n\nsize (4 lbs), as expected.\r\n\n          In  October,  Cleve   Myers,  Marine's   President,\r\n\nretained   Aquatech   Systems,   A.S.,    another   Norwegian\r\n\naquaculture  firm, to  perform  an independent  study of  the\r\n\nfarm's  problems.  Myers wanted to  know, among other things,\r\n\nhow many tons of fish the farm was capable of producing.  Dr.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nMichael Smith, a biologist from Aquatech, came to the farm on\r\n\nOctober   30  and  spent   three  days  making  observations,\r\n\nconducting tests, and speaking with employees.  Dr. Smith was\r\n\nnot shown  the Aquacare I report, but  the Aquacare operating\r\n\nmanuals  were made  available  to him.    The result  of  Dr.\r\n\nSmith's analysis  was a forty-four page  report (the Aquatech\r\n\nreport), dated November 18, 1988.  \r\n\n          The Aquatech report  criticized the  design of  the\r\n\nfarm.   The report stated that \"until experience over a fully\r\n\noperational  annual cycle  has been  gained,\" the  farm could\r\n\nproduce,  at best,  only  200 tons  of fish  per  year.   Dr.\r\n\nSmith's   report  also   made  several   recommendations  for\r\n\nimproving production.   For  instance, it recommended  that a\r\n\nhigher proportion  of fresh water  be pumped into  the tanks,\r\n\nfor  purposes  of  both  temperature   control  and  salinity\r\n\ncontrol.  This suggestion deviated from the specifications in\r\n\nthe Aquacare  operating manuals.  The  200-ton projection was\r\n\npremised on the assumption that the recommended changes would\r\n\nbe implemented.\r\n\n          Meanwhile, Osler, Inc., one  of Marine's two fifty-\r\n\npercent shareholders,  was in receivership, and  A.S. Bergens\r\n\nSkillingsbanken,  the  other  fifty-percent shareholder,  was\r\n\nrefusing to inject additional capital into the venture.\r\n\n          On  November 30, Myers turned the  keys to the farm\r\n\nover to Lou McGinn, the Loan Officer in charge of the project\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nat  the Royal Bank, and requested  that the farm be placed in\r\n\nvoluntary receivership.  Myers stated that  without operating\r\n\ncapital he  was unable to care  for the inventory or  pay the\r\n\nstaff.  He also  stated that he had \"received  a consultant's\r\n\nreport  regarding the  production capabilities  of  the plant\r\n\nwhich  indicate [sic] that the  facility is not  viable as it\r                                                           \r\n\npresently is financed.\"   McGinn stated  that Myers had  told\r\n\nhim that he received  \"a consultant's report\" which indicated\r\n\nthat \"the  plant was capable of  producing only approximately\r\n\n200 tons  of product per year  as opposed to the  360 tons of\r\n\nproduct per year  upon which its financing and  viability had\r\n\nbeen initially contemplated and established.\"  In a letter of\r\n\nJanuary 4, 1989, to McGinn, Myers wrote that:\r\n\n          after the [Aquatech] report  indicated an\r\n          expected tonnage, which was not viable, I\r\n          received confirmation  from the directors\r\n          and major shareholders to advise the bank\r\n          and request a receiver.   Both they and I\r\n          considered    it   wrong    to   continue\r\n          operations with this  information in  our\r\n          possession.\r\n\nMcGinn understood from Myers that the Aquatech report was one\r\n\nof the  factors that led Marine  to decide not to  inject any\r\n\nmore  money into  the project  and to  opt  for receivership.\r\n\nMcGinn informed  his supervisor  of the development,  and the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nsupervisor  noted  in  a   memo  that  \"apparently  a  recent\r\n\nstudy . . . placessomequestion ontheviabilityof theproject.\"1\r\n\n          At the  Royal Bank's request, the  Supreme Court of\r\n\nPEI  appointed Deloitte  &amp;  Touche2 as  receiver of  Marine's\r\n\nassets.  Karen  Cramm, a partner in  Deloitte's Halifax, Nova\r\n\nScotia office, was in charge of the receivership.  Cramm took\r\n\ninstructions on  the handling  of the  assets from the  Royal\r\n\nBank, specifically  from  McGinn, as  well  as from  the  PEI\r\n\ncourt.    The Royal  Bank was  the  sole secured  creditor of\r\n\nMarine,  with   a  $ 2.8  million  note   outstanding.    The\r\n\nexpectation was  that none of Marine's  other creditors would\r\n\nget anything out of the sale  of the assets; there would be a\r\n\nshortfall.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    More  than a year later,  on February 26, 1990,  McGinn\r\nprepared  a \"Bad  and Doubtful  Debt Report\"  on the  loan to\r\nMarine,  which was  somewhat  contradictory  to  his  earlier\r\nunderstanding.  The report stated, in relevant part:\r\n\n          While  the  funds  in  question  did  not\r\n          materialize  as  anticipated we  were not\r\n          aware of a  developing concern as  to the\r\n          overall   viability  of   the  operation,\r\n          seemingly  based  on  the findings  of  a\r\n          study   which   indicated  growth   rates\r\n          originally   expected  for   the  species\r\n          involved  were  significantly  overstated\r\n          and   maybe   by   as   much    as   50%.\r\n          Accordingly, Skillingsbanken A/S were not\r\n          prepared  to  participate further  in any\r\n          manner  and requested that  a Receiver be\r\n          appointed immediately.\r\n\n2.  Deloitte  &amp; Touche was known  as Touche Ross  Ltd. at the\r\ntime the initial events leading to this litigation occurred.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Cramm  immediately  took  possession   of  Marine's\r\n\nassets and  reviewed the  company's financial records.   Farm\r\n\nemployees were terminated as  employees of Marine and rehired\r\n\nas employees  of Deloitte, as receiver for  Marine.  Deloitte\r\n\ndecided to  sell the farm by means of a public tender.  Cramm\r\n\nimmediately  began  preparing  an information  package  which\r\n\ncould be sent to potential investors.  Around this time Myers\r\n\nshowed Cramm  both  the Aquacare  I report  and the  Aquatech\r\n\nreport.   Cramm read both  reports.  She  included neither of\r\n\nthe  reports in  the  information package,  though later  she\r\n\nwould  offer  the  Aquacare  I report  alone  to  prospective\r\n\npurchasers.\r\n\n          Deloitte    placed   advertisements    in   various\r\n\nnewspapers, including  the Boston Globe, describing  the farm\r                                                   \r\n\nand  inviting  interested  readers  to contact  Deloitte  for\r\n\nfurther information.   The ads stated  that the \"business  is\r\n\nintended to be sold on a going-concern basis.\"\r\n\n          In early December,  after learning that  Marine had\r\n\nbecome insolvent, Aquacare contacted  Cramm and told her that\r\n\nit  wanted access to  the plant to conduct  a review of plant\r\n\noperations.   Aquacare had  heard about the  Aquatech report,\r\n\nwhich   criticized   Aquacare's   design    and   operational\r\n\nspecifications.     Cramm   agreed  to   Aquacare's  request.\r\n\nAquacare then issued two unsolicited reports, the Aquacare II\r\n\nreport  on December 15 and  the Aquacare III follow-up report\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\non  December 20,  attempting  to rebut  the Aquatech  report.\r\n\nAquacare II reviewed plant  operations and praised the design\r\n\nand operational specifications of the plant.  Aquacare II re-\r\n\nasserted that  360-ton production  \"can  be achieved  without\r\n\nproblem,\" provided there was  proper stocking of  fingerlings\r\n\n(young fish), and recommended  a fingerling acquisition plan.\r\n\nAquacare II  also blamed Marine's management  for the plant's\r\n\nfailures.    Aquacare  III  explicitly refuted  the  Aquatech\r\n\nreport.  Aquacare did not bill Deloitte for these reports.\r\n\n          Meanwhile,  John Roche, a Massachusetts real estate\r\n\ndeveloper,   had  been  seeking  a  business  opportunity  in\r\n\naquaculture. After reading the Globe ad, he called Cramm from\r                                                \r\n\nhis  home in  Massachusetts.  The  next day she  sent him the\r\n\ninformation package.   Roche discussed  the farm with  two of\r\n\nhis business associates, Mark DiRico (the chief engineer of a\r\n\npackaging   supply  business)  and   George  Call,  who  both\r\n\nexpressed an interest.   Roche and Call decided to  visit the\r\n\nfacility in Canada.  On January 3 or 4, 1989, they toured the\r\n\nfacility with Cramm.   During this  visit, Roche asked  Cramm\r\n\nwhy  the previous investors  had failed.   She responded that\r\n\nthey had  run out  of money.   Roche and  Call also  met with\r\n\nCliff  Yorston, the Plant Manager, who told them that some of\r\n\nthe fish  were ready for  sale and that all  the plant needed\r\n\nwas an infusion of new capital.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Cramm offered the visitors a copy of the Aquacare I\r\n\nreport.   Before receiving it,  they were required  to sign a\r\n\ndisclaimer, which stated, among  other things, that they were\r\n\naware that Deloitte \"had not, in any way, attempted to verify\r\n\nthe  information contained  herein.\"   Cramm stated  that she\r\n\noffered  the  Aquacare  I report  to  prospective  purchasers\r\n\nbecause \"it was an informative package that included a layout\r\n\nof  the plant facility\" and \"it talked about, in general, the\r\n\naquaculture  operation.\"  She  explained that  the disclaimer\r\n\nwas intended to protect Deloitte against claims involving any\r\n\ninaccuracies in the information contained in the report, such\r\n\nas   the   financial    projections,   growth   charts,   and\r\n\nprofitability   analysis.     She  had   not  reviewed   that\r\n\ninformation and had no opinion as to its accuracy.\r\n\n          Cramm admits  she did not  offer Roche  and Call  a\r\n\ncopy  of the  Aquatech report,  but claims  it was  among the\r\n\nfinancial  statements that  Roche  and Call  were invited  to\r\n\nview.\r\n\n          Roche and Call  next met with  McGinn at the  Royal\r\n\nBank  of Canada  to discuss  financing.   McGinn,  like Cramm\r\n\nbefore  him, told the two  Americans that the  farm went into\r\n\nreceivership because  the previous  investors had run  out of\r\n\nmoney.\r\n\n          Roche  and Call  returned  to Massachusetts,  where\r\n\nRoche showed the  Aquacare I  report to DiRico.   During  the\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nnext  week,  Roche had  several telephone  conversations with\r\n\nMcGinn  about potential financing.   McGinn  recommended that\r\n\nRoche retain a local Canadian  lawyer, Scott MacKenzie, and a\r\n\nlocal Canadian accountant, Stan  MacPherson, to assist him in\r\n\ndealing with various government agencies.  Roche did so.\r\n\n          On   January  11,   Roche  and   Call,  this   time\r\n\naccompanied by DiRico, met with McGinn and Cramm at the Royal\r\n\nBank in PEI.  DiRico asked McGinn for \"sales figures\"; DiRico\r\n\nclaims that McGinn gave him a copy of  the Aquacare I report,\r\n\ntelling  him that \"all the figures are in here.\"  DiRico says\r\n\nhe was  not asked to  sign a  disclaimer.  Cramm  denies that\r\n\nDiRico  was given  a  copy of  the  report at  this  meeting.\r\n\nDiRico  asked  McGinn  about  the  plant's  troubles;  McGinn\r\n\nresponded that mismanagement was to blame.\r\n\n          Roche and his associates also went to see the farm.\r\n\nCliff Yorston, the  Plant Manager, pulled  a large fish  from\r\n\none of  the tanks and  told the  two visitors that  he had  a\r\n\nwhole tankful of similar  \"beauties\" which could be sold  for\r\n\n$ 3.75 a pound in  Boston.  Roche and his  associates planned\r\n\nto  generate  operating capital  for  the  plant through  the\r\n\nimmediate sale of inventory. \r\n\n          Roche  and  his partners  made  an  offer of  $ 2.9\r\n\nmillion the next day,  subject to Royal Bank financing.   But\r\n\nCramm, after securing the  Royal Bank's support, rejected the\r\n\noffer,  instead choosing  to  accept a  lower all-cash  offer\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n($ 1.4 million) from a  group led by Hirsch Spiegleman.   The\r\n\nSpiegleman group's offer, unlike the Roche group's offer, did\r\n\nnot require Royal Bank financing.\r\n\n          On or around January 17, Cramm told Roche that  his\r\n\noffer  had been rejected.  McGinn also asked Roche if Roche's\r\n\ngroup  would  still  be  interested  in  the  event that  the\r\n\nSpiegleman deal fell through.\r\n\n          After his bid was accepted,  Spiegleman requested a\r\n\ncopy of the Aquatech report (which he referred to as the \"200\r\n\nton report\").   The record  does not  reveal how  Spiegleman,\r\n\nunlike Roche, knew about the Aquatech report.  Cramm informed\r\n\nAquacare of Spiegleman's request  and asked for permission to\r\n\ngive him a copy of  the Aquacare II and Aquacare  III reports\r\n\nat the same time.\r\n\n          In   mid-February   1989,   the   Spiegleman   deal\r\n\ncollapsed.  The Roche group hoped to take over the Spiegleman\r\n\noffer rather than going through  the process of submitting  a\r\n\nnew  bid.  Seeking financing, Roche and his partners met with\r\n\nAmy Hunter, a  loan officer  at Boston Private  Bank &amp;  Trust\r\n\nCompany  (Boston Private).  Roche  gave Hunter a  copy of the\r\n\nAquacare  I  report.     Hunter  understood  that  Roche  was\r\n\npresenting  the  report as  his  business plan.    Roche told\r\n\nHunter that the fish farm  went into receivership because the\r\n\nprevious owners had run out of money.  Roche also told Hunter\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nthat  he planned  to raise  operating capital  by immediately\r\n\nselling fish.\r\n\n          Hunter next called Cramm and McGinn to confirm what\r\n\nRoche  had told  her.   Cramm  told  Hunter that  the  farm's\r\n\nequipment was  state-of-the-art and  all that was  needed was\r\n\nthe right  management.  McGinn echoed  these thoughts, adding\r\n\nthat  Roche would get half  his investment back  in the first\r\n\nthree months without even  having to invest in any  new fish.\r\n\nHunter asked McGinn if he  knew of any downside risks to  the\r\n\nfarm  or whether he had any projections for the farm.  McGinn\r\n\nresponded  that he did not know any downside risks other than\r\n\nbad management  and that Roche's  ideas sounded good  to him.\r\n\nHe  did not  offer any  other projections.   On  February 28,\r\n\nBoston Private  approved a  loan of  $ 1.2 million  to Roche,\r\n\nsecured by property Roche owned in the Boston area.\r\n\n          Cramm, however, decided not  to allow Roche to take\r\n\nover Spiegleman's  offer.  Instead, she  re-tendered the farm\r\n\nto  all  potentially   interested  buyers,  including  Roche.\r\n\nConsequently, she  edited the original information packet and\r\n\nsent it  out  on March  1 to  everyone who  had expressed  an\r\n\ninterest in the farm.3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The only  substantive change made  in the packet  was the\r\naddition of an express statement,  in light of a disagreement\r\nwith the Spiegleman group, that the assets that were for sale\r\ndid not include an investment tax credit belonging to Marine.\r\nThe packet also mentioned that the Spiegleman deal had fallen\r\nthrough.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          On March 2, Cramm received from Yorston, the farm's\r\n\nPlant Manager,  a  copy of  a  recent memorandum  written  by\r\n\nAquacare (the Aquacare IV report).   This memorandum had been\r\n\nprepared  by Aquacare  for  its subsidiary,  Seasprings.   It\r\n\naccidentally  fell  into  Yorston's  hands  because Aquacare,\r\n\nintending to send  it by fax  to Seasprings,  sent it to  the\r\n\nfish farm's  fax number.   The  Aquacare IV report  contained\r\n\nscathing  criticism  of Deloitte's  management  of  the farm.\r\n\nAquacare  asserted that Deloitte,  by attempting  to maintain\r\n\nthe status quo pending sale, was  actually reducing the value\r\n\nof the farm's assets.  For instance, several tons of fish had\r\n\nmatured past  marketability.  Aquacare believed that Deloitte\r\n\nwas  wasting  money  by   feeding  these  unmarketable  fish.\r\n\nAdditionally,  Deloitte had  failed  in a  timely fashion  to\r\n\npurchase fingerlings to restock  the farm and future harvests\r\n\nwould  be lower.    Aquacare believed  that under  Deloitte's\r\n\nmanagement the value of  the inventory as well as  the farm's\r\n\n1989  and  1990  earning  potential  were  decreasing  daily.\r\n\nAquacare  implicitly disavowed  its  own  earlier  production\r\n\ncapacity  projections,  made in  the  Aquacare  I report  and\r\n\nreasserted in the Aquacare II report, at least as to 1989 and\r\n\n1990.4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  McGinn explained the decision not to buy any fingerlings,\r\ndespite  Aquacare's  recommendations   that  fingerlings   be\r\npurchased in a carefully prescribed manner at specific times,\r\nas part of defendants' strategy of maintaining the status quo\r\npending  the sale  of the  assets without  investing  any new\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          Roche and DiRico visited the farm again on March 8.\r\n\nRoche told Yorston that if his bid was accepted he would need\r\n\nto start  selling fish immediately to  raise working capital.\r\n\nYorston replied that he had $ 150,000 worth of fish ready for\r\n\nshipment  to Boston.  Roche also believed that, once the farm\r\n\nwas purchased, McGinn was prepared to provide working capital\r\n\nin the form  of a Royal  Bank operating line.   On March  10,\r\n\nRoche and his partners offered $ 1.4 million.  This offer was\r\n\naccepted on March 13.\r\n\n          Roche called  Yorston on March 13  to inquire again\r\n\nabout  the prospects  of immediate  sales.   Yorston  faxed a\r\n\nresponse  to Roche.   The  cover sheet  said, \"Here  are some\r\n\nprojected  cash flows  for 1989.\"   The  attached projections\r\n\nanticipated sales in  March of $ 154,000 and  total sales for\r\n\nthe year of almost $ 2.5 million.5  These projections had not\r\n\nbeen prepared by Deloitte or by Marine, but by the Spiegleman\r\n\ngroup.   However,  someone  had obliterated  the  identifying\r\n\nheading at the top of the page so that, when the  projections\r\n\nwere  sent  by fax,  the source  of  the projections  was not\r\n\nidentified  to Roche.  Yorston had earlier told Roche that he\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nmoney  in the farm.   This remained their  strategy after the\r\nSpiegleman deal  fell through  and it  became clear  that the\r\nassets would not be sold until late March.\r\n\n5.  There is no  indication as to whether these  figures were\r\nsupposed to be in US currency or in Canadian currency.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nwas not authorized to release any information about the plant\r\n\nwithout permission from Cramm.\r\n\n          On March 17, Scott MacKenzie, the Canadian attorney\r\n\nhired  by Roche  to help  buy the  farm, faxed  two newspaper\r\n\narticles  to Roche, along with a brief note saying that Roche\r\n\nmight  find the attached articles \"interesting.\"   One of the\r\n\narticles discussed Marine's collapse, quoting Myers as saying\r\n\n\"[t]he Aquatech  report was  devastating and the  only option\r\n\nopen to Marine Harvesting  Ltd. was to request that  the bank\r\n\nplace a receiver  on site.\"   Roche filed  the articles  away\r\n\nwithout reading them.\r\n\n          On March  20, the Canadian court  approved the sale\r\n\nof  the  farm.    Roche  formed  a  corporation  in   Canada,\r\n\nInternational  Marine Fisheries,  Ltd.  (IMFL),  to make  the\r\n\npurchase.    Roche  instructed  Yorston to  fill  orders  for\r\n\nshipment to Boston.  Yorston was  able to fill the first  few\r\n\norders  of  2 to  4  pound  fish, but  the  buyers  in Boston\r\n\ncomplained  that the fish were too small.  Yorston was unable\r\n\nto fill the  first order  for 4  to 6  pound fish.   He  then\r\n\nresigned.  Scott Taylor, formerly the farm's Chief Biologist,\r\n\ntook  over Yorston's position, but he was also unable to fill\r\n\nthese  orders.  In April,  Taylor told Roche  that the larger\r\n\nfish were all unmarketable because they were too old and that\r\n\nthe other fish  were too  small for sale.   Taylor  predicted\r\n\nthat the smaller fish would be  four pounds by June and could\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nbe sold then.  By June, the smaller fish still  had not grown\r\n\nto four  pounds.  Taylor was  fired.  The  new Plant Manager,\r\n\nRichard Gallant,  recommended, in  order to cut  expenses and\r\n\nsee if the fish would grow faster, that the fish be placed in\r\n\ncages in the bay.  This was done in July.\r\n\n          Roche and  his partners injected cash  of their own\r\n\ninto the enterprise to save it and also took out an operating\r\n\nline of  credit from the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of\r\n\n$ 500,000.  Roche personally guaranteed the loan.  During the\r\n\nsummer, Roche and DiRico bought Call's share.\r\n\n          Roche  came to think  the fish farm  was a failure.\r\n\nHe began  negotiating with  a local veterinary  college which\r\n\nwas  interested in buying the farm for research purposes.  He\r\n\nhired Deloitte to help him set up this deal.  Stan MacPherson\r\n\nand  Cleve Myers, both recently hired  by Deloitte, worked on\r\n\nthe project.\r\n\n          In  September 1989,  Roche  was at  the fish  farm.\r\n\nTipped  off by  a  former secretary,  he  found the  Aquatech\r\n\nreport  in a desk drawer.  Attached  to the report was a 1988\r\n\nnote from Cleve Myers,  the former president of Marine,  to a\r\n\nprospective fish dealer.  The note said that the farm:\r\n\n          was   placed   in   receivership   Friday\r\n          afternoon.   The fish have not grown fast\r\n          enough, as you know, plus I have received\r\n          a specialist's report from Norway stating\r\n          that we  can only grow  200 tons annually\r\n          (just enough to lose one  million dollars\r\n          each year).\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nAfter  reading  the  report   and  the  attached  note  Roche\r\n\nconcluded that he had been defrauded. \r\n\n          In November  1989, the  Bank of Nova  Scotia called\r\n\nthe loan and demanded that Roche, as personal guarantor, make\r\n\npayment to the bank.  He did not do so.  The fish farm closed\r\n\nin December,  and went into  receivership in  February.   The\r\n\nBank  of Nova Scotia sued  Roche and DiRico  on the defaulted\r\n\nloan.\r\n\n          Meanwhile,    IMFL,   the    plaintiffs'   Canadian\r\n\ncorporation, was dissolved  in May  1990.   Roche and  DiRico\r\n\nbrought  this action against  Deloitte and the  Royal Bank in\r\n\nNovember 1990.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Roche and  DiRico sued Deloitte and  the Royal Bank\r\n\non two theories: common  law fraud and misrepresentation, and\r\n\n\"unfair  or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any\r\n\ntrade or commerce,\" under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A,   2.\r\n\n          The  common law  counts were  tried before  a jury.\r\n\nSince the defendants did not consent  to a jury determination\r\n\nof  the  chapter 93A  claim, that  claim  was decided  by the\r\n\ndistrict  judge.  The jury  returned a verdict  for the Royal\r\n\nBank on all  the common law  counts.  As  for the common  law\r\n\nclaims against Deloitte, the jury found that Roche and DiRico\r\n\nhad proved there were negligent misrepresentations, but  that\r\n\nthe plaintiffs were ninety-nine percent negligent compared to\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nthe one  percent negligence of Deloitte;  therefore the claim\r\n\nfoundered  on  proximate  cause  grounds  and  there  was  no\r\n\nrecovery.    The district  court  ruled  that defendants  had\r\n\nengaged in  misrepresentations contrary  to  the standard  of\r\n\nchapter 93A,6  but that the  actionable conduct did  not take\r\n\nplace \"primarily  and substantially within  the commonwealth\"\r\n\nof  Massachusetts, as chapter 93A  requires.  Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n\nch. 93A,   11.   The court thus ruled in favor  of defendants\r\n\non the issue of chapter 93A liability.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs,  while  defending the  district court's\r\n\npredicate  rulings, appeal  the court's ultimate  decision on\r\n\nchapter  93A  liability.    They assert  that  the  deception\r\n\noccurred  primarily  and  substantially   in  Massachusetts.7\r\n\nDefendants,   by   contrast,   defend   the   \"primarily  and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Defendants argue on appeal  that this ruling violates the\r\nSeventh  Amendment in light of the jury verdict on the common\r\nlaw claims.  We need not  reach the issue since we affirm the\r\nchapter 93A judgment for defendants on other grounds. \r\n\n7.  Plaintiffs   argue  that   the  court's   \"primarily  and\r\nsubstantially\"  decision  is  in  tension  with  its  earlier\r\ndecision to apply Massachusetts law to the dispute instead of\r\nCanadian law.  Defendants  make essentially the same argument\r\nin reverse -- that the latter decision was correct and should\r\ntrump the former.  These arguments miss the mark.  The choice\r\nof  law  test and  the  \"primarily  and substantially\"  test,\r\nthough similar in many  respects, are not identical.   That a\r\njudge  should reach  opposite results  in applying  these two\r\ntests  in a  single case  is no  sign of  error.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\nBushkin Assocs., Inc. v.

Specifically,  defendants argue\r\n\nthat  Roche and DiRico are  not the real  parties in interest\r\n\nbecause  the deception,  as alleged,  was perpetrated  on the\r\n\nCanadian  corporation established  by  Roche  and  DiRico  to\r\n\npurchase and operate  the fish farm,  not on  the two men  as\r\n\nindividuals.    They  also  argue  that,  under  forum  state\r\n\n(Massachusetts)  conflicts  principles, Canadian  law, rather\r\n\nthan Massachusetts law, should have been applied to the suit.\r\n\nFinally,  they  argue  that,  even  under  Massachusetts law,\r\n\nplaintiffs  had  not  successfully  shown  actionable conduct\r\n\nunder 93A.  Because we affirm the ruling below  on the ground\r\n\nthat  the  conduct was  not  primarily  and substantially  in\r\n\nMassachusetts,  there is  no  reason  to address  defendants'\r\n\nother arguments in any detail. \r\n\n          The  question of  whether  the  deception  occurred\r\n\nprimarily and  substantially in Massachusetts is  one of law,\r\n\nwhich we review de  novo.

Cramm's response on January 4,  1989,\r\n          to  a question from  plaintiffs about the\r\n          problems  of  the  fish farm,  indicating\r\n          that the  previous operators had  run out\r\n          of money, but omitting that the investors\r\n          withdrew   after  reading   the  Aquatech\r\n          report;\r\n\n          ii.    McGinn's  statement  to  the  same\r\n          effect;\r\n\n          iii.  Cramm's failure to offer plaintiffs\r\n          a  copy of the  Aquatech report  when she\r\n          offered  them a  copy of  the Aquacare  I\r\n          report;\r\n\n          iv.    Cramm's  failure,  after  March 1,\r\n          1989,  to  disclose  to   plaintiffs  the\r\n          Aquacare  IV  report,  which showed  that\r\n          Aquacare   no   longer   stood   by   the\r\n          projections  it had  made in  the earlier\r\n          Aquacare I report;\r\n\n          v.   McGinn's statement that buyers would\r\n          be  able  to  sell  fish  immediately  to\r\n          generate operating capital; and\r\n\n          vi.    McGinn's  failure to  tell  Hunter\r\n          about the Aquatech report, after offering\r\n          his opinion  as to  the viability  of the\r\n          farm, when  she asked if he  had any more\r\n          information.9\r\n\n          Both   parties   challenge  the   district  court's\r\n\nfindings on what constituted  the deception.

The   district  court  excluded  from  consideration  the\r\ndeceptive oral  statements made by Yorston  to the plaintiffs\r\nand  the deceptive fax sent  by Yorston to  Roche because the\r\nplaintiffs had failed to plead Yorston's allegedly fraudulent\r\nconduct with  the requisite specificity.   Plaintiffs protest\r\nthis ruling.  We need not reach the issue as it is immaterial\r\nto the outcome.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nus to give a  broader construction, while defendants complain\r\n\nthat the district  court saw deception where there  was none.\r\n\nWe have reviewed  the record  and are mindful  that there  is\r\n\nconflicting testimony  on many  points.   The  judge saw  the\r\n\nwitnesses on the stand and had the opportunity to weigh their\r\n\ncredibility.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\r                             \r\n\n          Defendants argue  that the district court  erred in\r\n\nfinding that defendants  deceptively failed  to disclose  the\r\n\nAquatech  report.  Defendants  assert that the non-disclosure\r\n\nclaim  is  an  impossibility  here  because  plaintiffs   had\r\n\nknowledge  prior to buying  the farm about  the very document\r\n\nthe  defendants  are  accused  of failing  to  disclose,  the\r\n\nAquatech report.  This  knowledge, the defendants essentially\r\n\nargue,  is based on either of two alternate theories.  First,\r\n\ndefendants assert that  plaintiffs had  imputed knowledge  of\r\n\nthe  report: their  agent MacKenzie  knew about  the Aquatech\r\n\nreport through  a newspaper article and  that knowledge could\r\n\nbe imputed  to the  plaintiffs.10  Second,  defendants assert\r\n\nthat the plaintiffs had constructive knowledge: MacKenzie had\r\n\nfaxed   a  copy  of  the  article  to  Roche  (a  week  after\r\n\nplaintiffs' offer was accepted),  and Roche's knowledge could\r\n\nbe  assumed, without  relying on  an agency  theory (although\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Defendants  rely on  DeVaux v.  American Home  Assurance\r                                                                         \r\nCo.,  444 N.E.2d  355, 358  (Mass.  1983), and  several other\r               \r\ncases for this agency theory.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nRoche did not  read the  article until long  after).11   Even\r\n\nassuming these  theories  are valid,  defendants  have  still\r\n\nfailed  to  demonstrate  reversible  error.    Prior  to  the\r\n\nclosing, plaintiffs  at most  knew  of the  existence of  the\r                                                                    \r\n\nAquatech  report.   Defendants'  deception  here  was in  not\r\n\nproviding plaintiffs  with a copy  of the  report given  that\r                                                 \r\n\nplaintiffs  had  been provided  with  a  copy  of  the  rival\r                                                             \r\n\nAquacare  I report.  Under these facts the district court did\r\n\nnot  err in  finding  that defendants  deceptively failed  to\r\n\ndisclose the Aquatech report.\r\n\n          Defendants also  argue it  was clear error  for the\r\n\ndistrict court to conclude that the farm's original investors\r\n\npulled out because of the Aquatech report, a conclusion  upon\r\n\nwhich the non-disclosure claim rests.  Defendants are correct\r\n\nthat the record does not reveal that the investors pulled out\r\n\nsolely because of the  unfavorable Aquatech report.  However,\r                  \r\n\nthe report  clearly  played a  major role  in the  investors'\r\n\ndecision to place  the plant  in receivership.   At the  very\r\n\nleast,  Cramm and  McGinn  knew that  the previous  investors\r\n\npulled out just after receiving the Aquatech report, and that\r\n\nthe report played a large role in this decision.  Myers wrote\r\n\nMcGinn on January 4, 1989, saying that both the directors and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  Defendants cite  Chandler v.  Atlas Gen. Indus.,  215 F.\r                                                                \r\nSupp. 617, 618-19 (D. Mass. 1963), for the proposition that a\r\nplaintiff  \"cannot close  his eyes  to  the obvious  and then\r\nclaim to be deceived.\"\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nthe  major  shareholders thought  it  was  wrong to  continue\r\n\noperations  after receiving the  information in  the Aquatech\r\n\nreport as to the expected tonnage.  There is no clear error.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs,  in turn, challenge certain findings of\r\n\nnon-deception  as clearly  erroneous.   They  argue that  the\r               \r\n\nadvertisement  placed  by  Cramm  was  deceptive  because  it\r\n\ndescribed the farm as  a \"going concern.\"  A  \"going concern\"\r\n\nis \"[a]n enterprise which  is being carried on as a whole and\r\n\nwith some  particular object in view\" or \"an existing solvent\r\n\nbusiness, which is being conducted in  the usual and ordinary\r\n\nway  for which it was organized.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 691\r                                                                     \r\n\n(6th ed. 1990).   The district court determined that  the use\r\n\nof  the   term  \"going  concern\"  here   was  not  deceptive.\r\n\nPlaintiffs  rely  entirely on  Dr.  Smith's  findings in  the\r\n\nAquatech  report in asserting on appeal that the farm was not\r\n\na  \"going concern.\"  In  Dr. Smith's opinion, say plaintiffs,\r\n\nthe farm's pumping system was incapable of operating properly\r\n\nat optimum levels and the farm was, as a general matter,  not\r\n\nstate-of-the-art.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs' charge  of error fails on  two grounds.\r\n\nFirst,  Dr. Smith  is  one aquaculture  expert among  several\r\n\nwhose conflicting  views about the farm became  known in this\r\n\ncase.  Indeed, this is the very reason his report should have\r\n\nbeen available  to the plaintiffs:   the plaintiffs  had been\r\n\ngiven  a different  report  by a  competing aquaculture  firm\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nwhich expressed a  far rosier view  of the farm's  operations\r\n\nand   production  capacity.     While  the  plaintiffs'  non-\r\n\ndisclosure  claim  is  rooted  in  the  variety  of  opinions\r\n\navailable  about  the viability  of  the  farm, their  \"going\r\n\nconcern\" argument presents Dr.  Smith's opinion as the single\r\n\ntruth.   But most damaging to  plaintiffs, Dr. Smith's report\r\n\nnever  suggested, let alone stated,  that the farm  was not a\r\n\n\"going concern.\"  His report  indicates only his belief  that\r\n\nthe farm was more poorly designed, and consequently a riskier\r\n\ninvestment, than its designers thought.12\r\n\n          Finally, that the farm ultimately failed (and thus,\r\n\npresumably could not properly have been described as a \"going\r\n\nconcern\"  at some point during its decline) is not proof that\r\n\nit was  doomed to failure at  the time the ad  was placed, at\r\n\nthe  start of  the  receivership.   Indeed,  implicit in  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' overall case  is a claim that their venture might\r\n\nnot have failed if  the receiver had managed the  farm better\r\n\nduring  the term of the receivership and if the selling price\r\n\nbetter reflected the actual  value of the assets.   Precisely\r\n\nbecause the value and production capacity of the farm were so\r\n\nhotly disputed at trial, the judge did not commit clear error\r\n\nin finding  that the farm was  a \"going concern\" at  the time\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.  Plaintiffs also claim  that the  farm was  not a  \"going\r\nconcern\" because it fell short of Amy Hunter's  definition of\r\n\"going concern.\"  Amy  Hunter's definition of \"going concern\"\r\nneed not have been adopted by the court.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nthe  Globe ad was placed.   The farm's  ultimate failure does\r                      \r\n\nnot change this.13\r\n\n          These factual findings lead to the question whether\r\n\nthe  deception  occurred   primarily  and  substantially   in\r\n\nMassachusetts.  Contrary  to the standard burden  of proof on\r\n\njurisdictional questions, here the burden is on defendants to\r                                                                      \r\n\nshow   that   their   misconduct   occurred   primarily   and\r\n\nsubstantially outside  Massachusetts.

Compagnie\r                                                                         \r\n\nde  Reassurance  d'Ile  de France,  57  F.3d  at 90;  Clinton\r                                                                         \r\n\nHospital,  907 F.2d at 1265-66.  The district court was aware\r                    \r\n\nof this and ruled  that the first factor weighed  against the\r\n\nplaintiffs because most of the defendants' misrepresentations\r\n\nand deceptive acts were committed in Canada.  This is plainly\r\n\ncorrect.   Indeed, the district court  understated the point:\r\n\nall the misrepresentations occurred in Canada.  Nevertheless,\r               \r\n\nplaintiffs argue on appeal  that the \"clear preponderance\" of\r\n\ndefendants'  deceptive  conduct  occurred  in  Massachusetts.\r\n\nThis  argument, however, is premised on a certain set of acts\r\n\nwhich the  district  court  did  not  consider  part  of  the\r\n\ndeception.   Specifically, plaintiffs assert that  the Boston\r                                                                         \r\n\nGlobe  ad and  the  two information  packets were  deceptions\r                 \r\n\nwhich  defendants  committed  in  Massachusetts.     But  the\r\n\ndistrict  court did  not err in  finding that the  ad and the\r\n\npackets were not misleading.\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\n          As to the non-disclosure of the Aquatech report and\r\n\nthe  Aquacare IV report,  there is a  metaphysical dilemma in\r\n\nascertaining where this  occurred.  The very  problem is that\r\n\ndisclosure did not  occur.  The  district court read  Clinton\r                                                                         \r\n\nHospital as support for  the proposition that  non-disclosure\r                    \r\n\noccurs where the defendant who fails to disclose  is located.\r\n\nThis was  obviously Canada.   But  Clinton Hospital does  not\r                                                               \r\n\nanswer this  question.   Where the defendants'  obligation to\r\n\ndisclose  certain  documents  arose  out  of their  voluntary\r\n\ndisclosure  of  other  documents,  and  where  the   parties'\r\n\ndealings were fairly  evenly split between two places,  it is\r\n\nmost  reasonable to  say  that  the  non-disclosure  occurred\r\n\nequally  in both  places.    However,  since all  the  actual\r\n\nmisrepresentations,  as  detailed  above, were  made  by  the\r\n\ndefendants in Canada, the first Clinton Hospital factor still\r                                                            \r\n\nweighs  in  favor  of   defendants.14    The  district  court\r\n\nconcluded,  and we agree,  that the  bulk of  the defendants'\r\n\nunfair and deceptive acts and omissions were in Canada.\r\n\n          The  second Clinton  Hospital  factor  requires  an\r                                                   \r\n\nanalysis  of where the plaintiffs received and acted upon the\r\n\ndeceptive or unfair acts or practices.  As the district court\r\n\nproperly  recognized,  this  factor,  though  framed  by  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  That  some  of  the  misrepresentations,  while made  in\r\nCanada, were  received in  Massachusetts, will  be considered\r\nwith  respect to the  second Clinton Hospital  factor, but is\r                                                         \r\nnot relevant here.\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nClinton Hospital  court as  a single factor,  really requires\r                            \r\n\ntwo distinct inquiries.\r\n\n          As to where the plaintiffs received the  deception,\r\n\nthe district  court concluded that it was  primarily Canada. \r\n\nIn coming  to this decision,  the court declined  to consider\r\n\nthe  misleading statements  made by  McGinn to  Hunter during\r\n\ntheir  telephone  conversation  because  the  district  court\r\n\nbelieved Hunter \"was not acting as an agent of the plaintiffs\r\n\nwhen  she received  the  misrepresentation, and  there is  no\r\n\nevidence  she relayed  any of  the misrepresentations  to the\r\n\nplaintiffs.\"   Plaintiffs  complain  the court  erred in  not\r\n\nincluding this  telephone conversation as a  deception.  This\r\n\nis an  arguable issue, but we resolve  it against plaintiffs.\r\n\nIn terms of strict  agency law, Hunter was acting  for Boston\r\n\nPrivate, not for plaintiffs,  when she made the call.   There\r\n\nis no evidence  that Hunter told McGinn or Cramm that she was\r\n\ncalling on  Roche's  behalf or  that she  would transmit  the\r\n\ninformation to Roche.   Thus, while there was a  deception of\r\n\nHunter, it was not of plaintiffs.  As to the district court's\r\n\nsecond rationale -- that  no misrepresentations were conveyed\r\n\nby Hunter to plaintiffs -- it is inapplicable on these facts.\r\n\nMcGinn  concealed  from Hunter  the  very  information which,\r\n\nHunter testified, she  would have relayed to  Roche if McGinn\r                                             \r\n\nhad been more forthcoming.\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\n          The  only  other   misrepresentation  received   in\r\n\nMassachusetts was the Yorston  fax, which, under the district\r\n\ncourt's own  evidentiary rulings,  may be considered  in this\r\n\nanalysis.   On  the other hand,  there were  three misleading\r\n\nstatements  made  by  the  defendants  and  received  by  the\r\n\nplaintiffs in  Canada during  the plaintiffs'  initial visits\r\n\nthere.   And, as discussed  above, the defendants' failure to\r\n\ndisclose was, for these  purposes, received by the plaintiffs\r\n\nequally in Massachusetts and  Canada, as the parties' overall\r\n\ndealings  were  evenly  divided  between  those  two  places.\r\n\nTherefore, while  the plaintiffs  received  the deception  in\r\n\nboth places, we  agree with the district  court that slightly\r\n\nmore of it was received in Canada.15\r\n\n          The second Clinton Hospital factor also requires us\r                                                 \r\n\nto  examine  where  plaintiffs  acted   upon  the  deception.\r\n\nIndeed, in Clinton Hospital,  this court recognized that \"the\r                                       \r\n\ncritical  factor  is  the  locus  of  the  recipient  of  the\r\n\ndeception at  the time of  reliance.\"  Clinton  Hospital, 907\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 1265-66; see  also Compagnie de Reassurance  d'Ile de\r                                                                         \r\n\nFrance,  57 F.3d at 90.  Under varying circumstances this may\r                  \r\n\nor may not be the same place as the place where the plaintiff\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  As with the  first Clinton  Hospital factor,  plaintiffs\r                                                     \r\nurge us  to frame the  deception broadly enough  to encompass\r\nthe  description  of the  farm as  a  \"going concern\"  in the\r\nBoston  Globe ad and in  the two information  packets, all of\r                         \r\nwhich plaintiffs  obviously received in  Massachusetts.   For\r\nreasons expressed above, we will not do so.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nreceived the  deception.  Here, the  district court concluded\r\n\nthat the plaintiffs' actions  in reliance were evenly divided\r\n\nbetween Massachusetts,  where they negotiated  a loan secured\r\n\nby Massachusetts  properties, and Canada, where  they hired a\r\n\nlawyer and  accountant and  formed a Canadian  corporation to\r\n\npurchase  the farm,  and  that this  sub-factor thus  favored\r\n\nneither party.\r\n\n          The  district  court thus  concluded that  the two-\r\n\nfaceted  second factor,  like  the first  factor, weighed  in\r\n\nfavor of Canada, and consequently in favor of the defendants.\r\n\nWe agree.\r\n\n          The third Clinton Hospital  factor is the  location\r                                                \r\n\nof  the  loss.    The  parties  advance  radically  different\r\n\nconceptions of  the loss  here.   Plaintiffs assert  that the\r\n\nloss was the loss of the Massachusetts property  that secured\r\n\nthe Boston Private loan and that was ultimately foreclosed on\r\n\nwhen  the  plaintiffs  defaulted  on the  loan.    Defendants\r\n\nconceive  of the  loss as  the  loss of  the money  which was\r\n\ninvested in the farm in Canada.\r\n\n          The   district   court   adopted  the   plaintiffs'\r\n\ndefinition.   The court's  reasoning was  heavily influenced,\r\n\nperhaps  even mandated, by its earlier ruling on the scope of\r\n\nthe damages which plaintiffs would be allowed to seek in this\r\n\naction.     In  that  earlier  ruling,   the  court  rejected\r\n\ndefendants'  argument that the plaintiffs as individuals were\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nnot the real parties in interest in this case by defining the\r\n\nalleged losses narrowly, allowing plaintiffs to seek recovery\r\n\nonly of  losses they incurred personally  in capitalizing the\r\n\ncorporation and not those  losses suffered by the corporation\r\n\nin Canada.  The  district court felt obligated, for  the sake\r\n\nof consistency, to  use the  same conception of  the loss  in\r\n\nthis  context.   The  court  thus concluded  that  this third\r\n\nfactor favored the plaintiffs.  We agree.\r\n\n          The  district court balanced  the three factors and\r\n\nfound that defendants -- in whose favor the first two factors\r\n\nweighed -- had met their burden of proving that the deception\r\n\nhad    occurred    primarily   and    substantially   outside\r\n\nMassachusetts.  Although  the pragmatic, functional  analysis\r\n\nis  not  necessarily limited  to  the  three factors,  it  is\r\n\nsignificant that two of the three identified factors weigh in\r\n\nfavor of the  defendants here.

Defendants appeal.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\n          The district court first noted  the dispute between\r\n\nthe parties over whether United States or Canadian law should\r\n\napply  to the  fee-shifting claim.   Then,  assuming arguendo\r                                                                         \r\n\nthat  Canadian law  applied, as  defendants urged,  the court\r\n\ninterpreted  Canadian  law  to  grant  judges  \"absolute  and\r\n\nunfettered\" discretion in attorneys' fees claims.  Exercising\r\n\nthis discretion, the district  court determined that an award\r\n\nof  fees  would  be  \"inequitable\"   because  of  defendants'\r\n\nintentional misconduct, and it denied the motion.\r\n\n          Defendants base their argument -- one wholly  based\r\n\non Canadian substantive law -- on the underlying premise that\r\n\nCanadian  substantive  law  applies  to  the  entire  dispute\r\n\nbetween the parties.   They  make no argument  that they  are\r\n\nentitled  to  fees under  Massachusetts  law.   The  district\r\n\ncourt,  however,  rejected  the  defendants'  choice  of  law\r\n\nposition,  applying  Massachusetts  law  to  the  plaintiffs'\r\n\nchapter 93A  claim.   The  court  consulted Canadian  law  in\r\n\nconsidering, and  disposing of,  the claim  for  the sake  of\r\n\nargument  only.  It is  unnecessary to resolve  the choice of\r\n\nlaw  issue,  as the  denial  of  attorneys'  fees was,  under\r\n\nCanadian law, well within  the trial court's discretion given\r\n\nthe circumstances of this case.\r\n\n          Defendants unsuccessfully argue  that the  district\r\n\ncourt  overestimated  the  degree  of  discretion  enjoyed by\r\n\nCanadian courts in the  fee-shifting context.

They\r\n\nclaim  that  Massachusetts  law  is  irrelevant  to  Canadian\r\n\nattorney fee determinations and  thus that the district judge\r\n\nerred   in  considering   conduct  that   was  violative   of\r\n\nMassachusetts  law.    Defendants misapprehend  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  reasoning.   The  point  is that  their  conduct was\r\n\nwrongful, not  that  it violated  a particular  statute.   In\r                    \r\n\ndenying the  motion, the  court noted that  \"defendants acted\r\n\nintentionally   to   withhold   material   information   from\r\n\nplaintiffs.\"  Chapter  93A was merely the lens  through which\r\n\nthe court examined defendants' conduct.

The term  \"costs,\" as used in  Canadian law, encompasses\r\nattorneys' fees.

It was  entirely\r\n\nproper, in this context,  for the district judge  to consider\r\n\ndefendants'   intentional   misconduct   in   deceiving   the\r\n\nplaintiffs as  a circumstance militating against  an award of\r\n\nfees.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n          For the reasons  expressed above,  the judgment  of\r\n\nthe district court in  favor of defendants and the  denial of\r\n\ndefendants' post-trial  motion for attorneys'  fees are  both\r\n\naffirmed.

Aquacare prepared a prospectus (the Aquacare I report), which presented general information about the biological and technical aspects of the proposed operation.  The prospectus also contained financial projections and asserted that the production capacity of the contemplated facility would be 131.8 tons of fish in the first year of operation and 360 tons annually thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Royal Bank of Canada financed the construction of the farm, which was operated by a firm called Marine Harvesting, Ltd.  (\"Marine\").  Fish were first introduced into the facility in December 1987, but there were construction delays and the plant was not completed until June 1988.  Things went badly from the start.  The fish did not grow as fast as anticipated and had unexpectedly high mortality rates.  By October 1988, the fish had not yet reached market size (4 lbs), as expected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, Cleve Myers, Marine's President, retained Aquatech Systems, A.S., another Norwegian aquaculture firm, to perform an independent study of the farm's problems.  Myers wanted to know, among other things, how many tons of fish the farm was capable of producing.  Dr. Michael Smith, a biologist from Aquatech, came to the farm on October 30 and spent three days making observations, conducting tests, and speaking with employees.  Dr. Smith was not shown the Aquacare I report, but the Aquacare operating manuals were made available to him.  The result of Dr. Smith's analysis was a forty-four page report (the Aquatech report), dated November 18, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Aquatech report criticized the design of the farm.  The report stated that \"until experience over a fully operational annual cycle has been gained,\" the farm could produce, at best, only 200 tons of fish per year.  Dr. Smith's report also made several recommendations for improving production.  For instance, it recommended that a higher proportion of fresh water be pumped into the tanks, for purposes of both temperature control and salinity control.  This suggestion deviated from the specifications in the Aquacare operating manuals.  The 200-ton projection was premised on the assumption that the recommended changes would be implemented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Osler, Inc., one of Marine's two fifty-percent shareholders, was in receivership, and A.S. Bergens Skillingsbanken, the other fifty-percent shareholder, was refusing to inject additional capital into the venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, Myers turned the keys to the farm over to Lou McGinn, the Loan Officer in charge of the project at the Royal Bank, and requested that the farm be placed in voluntary receivership.  Myers stated that without operating capital he was unable to care for the inventory or pay the staff.  He also stated that he had \"received a consultant's report regarding the production capabilities of the plant which indicate [sic] that the facility is not viable as it presently is financed.\"   McGinn stated that Myers had told him that he received \"a consultant's report\" which indicated that \"the plant was capable of producing only approximately 200 tons of product per year as opposed to the 360 tons of product per year upon which its financing and viability had been initially contemplated and established.\"   In a letter of January 4, 1989, to McGinn, Myers wrote that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>after the [Aquatech] report indicated an expected tonnage, which was not viable, I received confirmation from the directors and major shareholders to advise the bank and request a receiver.

McGinn informed his supervisor of the development, and the supervisor noted in a memo that \"apparently a recent study ... places some question on the viability of the project.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the Royal Bank's request, the Supreme Court of PEI appointed Deloitte &amp; Touche<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as receiver of Marine's assets.  Karen Cramm, a partner in Deloitte's Halifax, Nova Scotia office, was in charge of the receivership.  Cramm took instructions on the handling of the assets from the Royal Bank, specifically from McGinn, as well as from the PEI court.  The Royal Bank was the sole secured creditor of Marine, with a $ 2.8 million note outstanding.  The expectation was that none of Marine's other creditors would get anything out of the sale of the assets;  there would be a shortfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm immediately took possession of Marine's assets and reviewed the company's financial records.  Farm employees were terminated as employees of Marine and rehired as employees of Deloitte, as receiver for Marine.  Deloitte decided to sell the farm by means of a public tender.  Cramm immediately began preparing an information package which could be sent to potential investors.  Around this time Myers showed Cramm both the Aquacare I report and the Aquatech report.  Cramm read both reports.  She included neither of the reports in the information package, though later she would offer the Aquacare I report alone to prospective purchasers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deloitte placed advertisements in various newspapers, including the Boston Globe, describing the farm and inviting interested readers to contact Deloitte for further information.  The ads stated that the \"business is intended to be sold on a going-concern basis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early December, after learning that Marine had become insolvent, Aquacare contacted Cramm and told her that it wanted access to the plant to conduct a review of plant operations.  Aquacare had heard about the Aquatech report, which criticized Aquacare's design and operational specifications.  Cramm agreed to Aquacare's request.  Aquacare then issued two unsolicited reports, the Aquacare II report on December 15 and the Aquacare III follow-up report on December 20, attempting to rebut the Aquatech report.  Aquacare II reviewed plant operations and praised the design and operational specifications of the plant.  Aquacare II reasserted that 360-ton production \"can be achieved without problem,\" provided there was proper stocking of fingerlings (young fish), and recommended a fingerling acquisition plan.  Aquacare II also blamed Marine's management for the plant's failures.  Aquacare III explicitly refuted the Aquatech report.  Aquacare did not bill Deloitte for these reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, John Roche, a Massachusetts real estate developer, had been seeking a business opportunity in aquaculture.  After reading the Globe ad, he called Cramm from his home in Massachusetts.  The next day she sent him the information package.  Roche discussed the farm with two of his business associates, Mark DiRico (the chief engineer of a packaging supply business) and George Call, who both expressed an interest.  Roche and Call decided to visit the facility in Canada.  On January 3 or 4, 1989, they toured the facility with Cramm.  During this visit, Roche asked Cramm why the previous investors had failed.  She responded that they had run out of money.  Roche and Call also met with Cliff Yorston, the Plant Manager, who told them that some of the fish were ready for sale and that all the plant needed was an infusion of new capital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm offered the visitors a copy of the Aquacare I report.  Before receiving it, they were required to sign a disclaimer, which stated, among other things, that they were aware that Deloitte \"had not, in any way, attempted to verify the information contained herein.\"   Cramm stated that she offered the Aquacare I report to prospective purchasers because \"it was an informative package that included a layout of the plant facility\" and \"it talked about, in general, the aquaculture operation.\"   She explained that the disclaimer was intended to protect Deloitte against claims involving any inaccuracies in the information contained in the report, such as the financial projections, growth charts, and profitability analysis.  She had not reviewed that information and had no opinion as to its accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm admits she did not offer Roche and Call a copy of the Aquatech report, but claims it was among the financial statements that Roche and Call were invited to view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and Call next met with McGinn at the Royal Bank of Canada to discuss financing.  McGinn, like Cramm before him, told the two Americans that the farm went into receivership because the previous investors had run out of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and Call returned to Massachusetts, where Roche showed the Aquacare I report to DiRico.  During the next week, Roche had several telephone conversations with McGinn about potential financing.  McGinn recommended that Roche retain a local Canadian lawyer, Scott MacKenzie, and a local Canadian accountant, Stan MacPherson, to assist him in dealing with various government agencies.  Roche did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, Roche and Call, this time accompanied by DiRico, met with McGinn and Cramm at the Royal Bank in PEI.  DiRico asked McGinn for \"sales figures\";  DiRico claims that McGinn gave him a copy of the Aquacare I report, telling him that \"all the figures are in here.\"   DiRico says he was not asked to sign a disclaimer.  Cramm denies that DiRico was given a copy of the report at this meeting.  DiRico asked McGinn about the plant's troubles;  McGinn responded that mismanagement was to blame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and his associates also went to see the farm.  Cliff Yorston, the Plant Manager, pulled a large fish from one of the tanks and told the two visitors that he had a whole tankful of similar \"beauties\" which could be sold for $ 3.75 a pound in Boston.  Roche and his associates planned to generate operating capital for the plant through the immediate sale of inventory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and his partners made an offer of $ 2.9 million the next day, subject to Royal Bank financing.  But Cramm, after securing the Royal Bank's support, rejected the offer, instead choosing to accept a lower all-cash offer ($ 1.4 million) from a group led by Hirsch Spiegleman.  The Spiegleman group's offer, unlike the Roche group's offer, did not require Royal Bank financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or around January 17, Cramm told Roche that his offer had been rejected.  McGinn also asked Roche if Roche's group would still be interested in the event that the Spiegleman deal fell through.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his bid was accepted, Spiegleman requested a copy of the Aquatech report (which he referred to as the \"200 ton report\").  The record does not reveal how Spiegleman, unlike Roche, knew about the Aquatech report.  Cramm informed Aquacare of Spiegleman's request and asked for permission to give him a copy of the Aquacare II and Aquacare III reports at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-February 1989, the Spiegleman deal collapsed.  The Roche group hoped to take over the Spiegleman offer rather than going through the process of submitting a new bid.  Seeking financing, Roche and his partners met with Amy Hunter, a loan officer at Boston Private Bank &amp; Trust Company (Boston Private).  Roche gave Hunter a copy of the Aquacare I report.  Hunter understood that Roche was presenting the report as his business plan.  Roche told Hunter that the fish farm went into receivership because the previous owners had run out of money.  Roche also told Hunter that he planned to raise operating capital by immediately selling fish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter next called Cramm and McGinn to confirm what Roche had told her.  Cramm told Hunter that the farm's equipment was state-of-the-art and all that was needed was the right management.  McGinn echoed these thoughts, adding that Roche would get half his investment back in the first three months without even having to invest in any new fish.  Hunter asked McGinn if he knew of any downside risks to the farm or whether he had any projections for the farm.  McGinn responded that he did not know any downside risks other than bad management and that Roche's ideas sounded good to him.  He did not offer any other projections.  On February 28, Boston Private approved a loan of $ 1.2 million to Roche, secured by property Roche owned in the Boston area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm, however, decided not to allow Roche to take over Spiegleman's offer.  Instead, she re-tendered the farm to all potentially interested buyers, including Roche.  Consequently, she edited the original information packet and sent it out on March 1 to everyone who had expressed an interest in the farm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, Cramm received from Yorston, the farm's Plant Manager, a copy of a recent memorandum written by Aquacare (the Aquacare IV report).  This memorandum had been prepared by Aquacare for its subsidiary, Seasprings.  It accidentally fell into Yorston's hands because Aquacare, intending to send it by fax to Seasprings, sent it to the fish farm's fax number.  The Aquacare IV report contained scathing criticism of Deloitte's management of the farm.  Aquacare asserted that Deloitte, by attempting to maintain the status quo pending sale, was actually reducing the value of the farm's assets.  For instance, several tons of fish had matured past marketability.  Aquacare believed that Deloitte was wasting money by feeding these unmarketable fish.  Additionally, Deloitte had failed in a timely fashion to purchase fingerlings to restock the farm and future harvests would be lower.  Aquacare believed that under Deloitte's management the value of the inventory as well as the farm's 1989 and 1990 earning potential were decreasing daily.  Aquacare implicitly disavowed its own earlier production capacity projections, made in the Aquacare I report and reasserted in the Aquacare II report, at least as to 1989 and 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and DiRico visited the farm again on March 8. Roche told Yorston that if his bid was accepted he would need to start selling fish immediately to raise working capital.  Yorston replied that he had $ 150,000 worth of fish ready for shipment to Boston.  Roche also believed that, once the farm was purchased, McGinn was prepared to provide working capital in the form of a Royal Bank operating line.  On March 10, Roche and his partners offered $ 1.4 million.  This offer was accepted on March 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche called Yorston on March 13 to inquire again about the prospects of immediate sales.  Yorston faxed a response to Roche.  The cover sheet said, \"Here are some projected cash flows for 1989.\"   The attached projections anticipated sales in March of $ 154,000 and total sales for the year of almost $ 2.5 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  These projections had not been prepared by Deloitte or by Marine, but by the Spiegleman group.  However, someone had obliterated the identifying heading at the top of the page so that, when the projections were sent by fax, the source of the projections was not identified to Roche.  Yorston had earlier told Roche that he was not authorized to release any information about the plant without permission from Cramm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 17, Scott MacKenzie, the Canadian attorney hired by Roche to help buy the farm, faxed two newspaper articles to Roche, along with a brief note saying that Roche might find the attached articles \"interesting.\"   One of the articles discussed Marine's collapse, quoting Myers as saying \"[t]he Aquatech report was devastating and the only option open to Marine Harvesting Ltd. was to request that the bank place a receiver on site.\"   Roche filed the articles away without reading them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, the Canadian court approved the sale of the farm.  Roche formed a corporation in Canada, International Marine Fisheries, Ltd.  (IMFL), to make the purchase.  Roche instructed Yorston to fill orders for shipment to Boston.  Yorston was able to fill the first few orders of 2 to 4 pound fish, but the buyers in Boston complained that the fish were too small.  Yorston was unable to fill the first order for 4 to 6 pound fish.  He then resigned.  Scott Taylor, formerly the farm's Chief Biologist, took over Yorston's position, but he was also unable to fill these orders.  In April, Taylor told Roche that the larger fish were all unmarketable because they were too old and that the other fish were too small for sale.  Taylor predicted that the smaller fish would be four pounds by June and could be sold then.  By June, the smaller fish still had not grown to four pounds.  Taylor was fired.  The new Plant Manager, Richard Gallant, recommended, in order to cut expenses and see if the fish would grow faster, that the fish be placed in cages in the bay.  This was done in July.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and his partners injected cash of their own into the enterprise to save it and also took out an operating line of credit from the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of $ 500,000.  Roche personally guaranteed the loan.  During the summer, Roche and DiRico bought Call's share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche came to think the fish farm was a failure.  He began negotiating with a local veterinary college which was interested in buying the farm for research purposes.  He hired Deloitte to help him set up this deal.  Stan MacPherson and Cleve Myers, both recently hired by Deloitte, worked on the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1989, Roche was at the fish farm.  Tipped off by a former secretary, he found the Aquatech report in a desk drawer.  Attached to the report was a 1988 note from Cleve Myers, the former president of Marine, to a prospective fish dealer.  The note said that the farm:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>was placed in receivership Friday afternoon.  The fish have not grown fast enough, as you know, plus I have received a specialist's report from Norway stating that we can only grow 200 tons annually (just enough to lose one million dollars each year).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reading the report and the attached note Roche concluded that he had been defrauded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, the Bank of Nova Scotia called the loan and demanded that Roche, as personal guarantor, make payment to the bank.  He did not do so.  The fish farm closed in December, and went into receivership in February.  The Bank of Nova Scotia sued Roche and DiRico on the defaulted loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, IMFL, the plaintiffs' Canadian corporation, was dissolved in May 1990.  Roche and DiRico brought this action against Deloitte and the Royal Bank in November 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and DiRico sued Deloitte and the Royal Bank on two theories:  common law fraud and misrepresentation, and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,\" under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common law counts were tried before a jury.  Since the defendants did not consent to a jury determination of the chapter 93A claim, that claim was decided by the district judge.  The jury returned a verdict for the Royal Bank on all the common law counts.  As for the common law claims against Deloitte, the jury found that Roche and DiRico had proved there were negligent misrepresentations, but that the plaintiffs were ninety-nine percent negligent compared to the one percent negligence of Deloitte;  therefore the claim foundered on proximate cause grounds and there was no recovery.  The district court ruled that defendants had engaged in misrepresentations contrary to the standard of chapter 93A,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> but that the actionable conduct did not take place \"primarily and substantially within the commonwealth\" of Massachusetts, as chapter 93A requires.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11.  The court thus ruled in favor of defendants on the issue of chapter 93A liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, while defending the district court's predicate rulings, appeal the court's ultimate decision on chapter 93A liability.  They assert that the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Defendants, by contrast, defend the \"primarily and substantially\" ruling, but challenge a number of the district court's predicate rulings.  Specifically, defendants argue that Roche and DiRico are not the real parties in interest because the deception, as alleged, was perpetrated on the Canadian corporation established by Roche and DiRico to purchase and operate the fish farm, not on the two men as individuals.  They also argue that, under forum state (Massachusetts) conflicts principles, Canadian law, rather than Massachusetts law, should have been applied to the suit.  Finally, they argue that, even under Massachusetts law, plaintiffs had not successfully shown actionable conduct under 93A. Because we affirm the ruling below on the ground that the conduct was not primarily and substantially in Massachusetts, there is no reason to address defendants' other arguments in any detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts is one of law, which we review de novo.  Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France v. New England Reinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d 56, 90 (1st Cir.1995);  Clinton Hosp. Ass'n v. Corson Group, Inc., 907 F.2d 1260, 1264 (1st Cir.1990).  This review, however, cannot be conducted in a vacuum.  We first determine exactly what constituted the unfair or deceptive acts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that six acts or omissions constituted actionable deception on the plaintiffs.  Whether a certain act or omission (or cluster of acts or omissions) is actionable under chapter 93A is a question of fact.  Brennan v. Carvel Corp., 929 F.2d 801, 813 (1st Cir.1991);  USM Corp. v. Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., 28 Mass.App.Ct. 108, 546 N.E.2d 888, 897 (1989).  Review is for clear error.  After defining the deception, the district court then employed the pragmatic, functional analysis spelled out by this court in Clinton Hospital, 907 F.2d at 1266, in order to ascertain whether the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Neither party challenges the district court's methodology in determining the \"primarily and substantially\" question by examining only the specific acts (or omissions) of misconduct, instead of, say, by examining the larger context of the parties' dealings.  We therefore use the same methodology.  See also Gilleran, The Law of Chapter 93A &#167; 3:15, at 32 &amp; n.59.1 (1995 Supp.)  (\"The relevant wrongful conduct to be considered for purposes of personal jurisdiction under 93A is that conduct which violated 93A.\")  (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the following six acts/omissions constituted the deception:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>i.

Plaintiffs urge us to give a broader construction, while defendants complain that the district court saw deception where there was none.  We have reviewed the record and are mindful that there is conflicting testimony on many points.  The judge saw the witnesses on the stand and had the opportunity to weigh their credibility.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the district court erred in finding that defendants deceptively failed to disclose the Aquatech report.  Defendants assert that the non-disclosure claim is an impossibility here because plaintiffs had knowledge prior to buying the farm about the very document the defendants are accused of failing to disclose, the Aquatech report.  This knowledge, the defendants essentially argue, is based on either of two alternate theories.  First, defendants assert that plaintiffs had imputed knowledge of the report:  their agent MacKenzie knew about the Aquatech report through a newspaper article and that knowledge could be imputed to the plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Second, defendants assert that the plaintiffs had constructive knowledge:  MacKenzie had faxed a copy of the article to Roche (a week after plaintiffs' offer was accepted), and Roche's knowledge could be assumed, without relying on an agency theory (although Roche did not read the article until long after).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Even assuming these theories are valid, defendants have still failed to demonstrate reversible error.  Prior to the closing, plaintiffs at most knew of the existence of the Aquatech report.  Defendants' deception here was in not providing plaintiffs with a copy of the report given that plaintiffs had been provided with a copy of the rival Aquacare I report.  Under these facts the district court did not err in finding that defendants deceptively failed to disclose the Aquatech report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue it was clear error for the district court to conclude that the farm's original investors pulled out because of the Aquatech report, a conclusion upon which the non-disclosure claim rests.  Defendants are correct that the record does not reveal that the investors pulled out solely because of the unfavorable Aquatech report.  However, the report clearly played a major role in the investors' decision to place the plant in receivership.  At the very least, Cramm and McGinn knew that the previous investors pulled out just after receiving the Aquatech report, and that the report played a large role in this decision.  Myers wrote McGinn on January 4, 1989, saying that both the directors and the major shareholders thought it was wrong to continue operations after receiving the information in the Aquatech report as to the expected tonnage.  There is no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, in turn, challenge certain findings of non-deception as clearly erroneous.  They argue that the advertisement placed by Cramm was deceptive because it described the farm as a \"going concern.\"   A \"going concern\" is \"[a]n enterprise which is being carried on as a whole and with some particular object in view\" or \"an existing solvent business, which is being conducted in the usual and ordinary way for which it was organized.\"   Black's Law Dictionary 691 (6th ed.1990).  The district court determined that the use of the term \"going concern\" here was not deceptive.  Plaintiffs rely entirely on Dr. Smith's findings in the Aquatech report in asserting on appeal that the farm was not a \"going concern.\"   In Dr. Smith's opinion, say plaintiffs, the farm's pumping system was incapable of operating properly at optimum levels and the farm was, as a general matter, not state-of-the-art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' charge of error fails on two grounds.  First, Dr. Smith is one aquaculture expert among several whose conflicting views about the farm became known in this case.  Indeed, this is the very reason his report should have been available to the plaintiffs:  the plaintiffs had been given a different report by a competing aquaculture firm which expressed a far rosier view of the farm's operations and production capacity.  While the plaintiffs' non-disclosure claim is rooted in the variety of opinions available about the viability of the farm, their \"going concern\" argument presents Dr. Smith's opinion as the single truth.  But most damaging to plaintiffs, Dr. Smith's report never suggested, let alone stated, that the farm was not a \"going concern.\"   His report indicates only his belief that the farm was more poorly designed, and consequently a riskier investment, than its designers thought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, that the farm ultimately failed (and thus, presumably could not properly have been described as a \"going concern\" at some point during its decline) is not proof that it was doomed to failure at the time the ad was placed, at the start of the receivership.  Indeed, implicit in the plaintiffs' overall case is a claim that their venture might not have failed if the receiver had managed the farm better during the term of the receivership and if the selling price better reflected the actual value of the assets.  Precisely because the value and production capacity of the farm were so hotly disputed at trial, the judge did not commit clear error in finding that the farm was a \"going concern\" at the time the Globe ad was placed.  The farm's ultimate failure does not change this.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factual findings lead to the question whether the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts.  Contrary to the standard burden of proof on jurisdictional questions, here the burden is on defendants to show that their misconduct occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11;  Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90;  see Gilleran, supra, &#167; 3:16, at 65.  This is because \" &#167; 11 provides an exemption from 93A liability, available as a defense, rather than a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.\"  Kansallis Fin.  Ltd. v. Fern, 40 F.3d 476, 481 (1st Cir.1994).  The district court's conclusion that defendants satisfied this statutory burden is one of law, reviewed de novo.  Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90;  Clinton Hospital, 907 F.2d at 1264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Clinton Hospital, this court read the sparse body of Massachusetts precedent as support for a pragmatic, functional approach for determining whether actionable misconduct occurs primarily and substantially in Massachusetts.  The Clinton Hospital court distilled the approach down to three basic factors:  (1) where defendant committed the deception;  (2) where plaintiff was deceived and acted upon the deception;  and (3) the situs of plaintiff's losses due to the deception.  Id. at 1265-66.   The district court, applying the Clinton Hospital factors to this case, reasoned that the deception here occurred primarily and substantially in Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has previously recognized that the first factor is the least weighty of the three factors.  Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90;  Clinton Hospital, 907 F.2d at 1265-66.   The district court was aware of this and ruled that the first factor weighed against the plaintiffs because most of the defendants' misrepresentations and deceptive acts were committed in Canada.  This is plainly correct.  Indeed, the district court understated the point:  all the misrepresentations occurred in Canada.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs argue on appeal that the \"clear preponderance\" of defendants' deceptive conduct occurred in Massachusetts.  This argument, however, is premised on a certain set of acts which the district court did not consider part of the deception.  Specifically, plaintiffs assert that the Boston Globe ad and the two information packets were deceptions which defendants committed in Massachusetts.  But the district court did not err in finding that the ad and the packets were not misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the non-disclosure of the Aquatech report and the Aquacare IV report, there is a metaphysical dilemma in ascertaining where this occurred.  The very problem is that disclosure did not occur.  The district court read Clinton Hospital as support for the proposition that non-disclosure occurs where the defendant who fails to disclose is located.  This was obviously Canada.  But Clinton Hospital does not answer this question.  Where the defendants' obligation to disclose certain documents arose out of their voluntary disclosure of other documents, and where the parties' dealings were fairly evenly split between two places, it is most reasonable to say that the non-disclosure occurred equally in both places.  However, since all the actual misrepresentations, as detailed above, were made by the defendants in Canada, the first Clinton Hospital factor still weighs in favor of defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  The district court concluded, and we agree, that the bulk of the defendants' unfair and deceptive acts and omissions were in Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Clinton Hospital factor requires an analysis of where the plaintiffs received and acted upon the deceptive or unfair acts or practices.  As the district court properly recognized, this factor, though framed by the Clinton Hospital court as a single factor, really requires two distinct inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to where the plaintiffs received the deception, the district court concluded that it was primarily Canada.  In coming to this decision, the court declined to consider the misleading statements made by McGinn to Hunter during their telephone conversation because the district court believed Hunter \"was not acting as an agent of the plaintiffs when she received the misrepresentation, and there is no evidence she relayed any of the misrepresentations to the plaintiffs.\"   Plaintiffs complain the court erred in not including this telephone conversation as a deception.  This is an arguable issue, but we resolve it against plaintiffs.  In terms of strict agency law, Hunter was acting for Boston Private, not for plaintiffs, when she made the call.  There is no evidence that Hunter told McGinn or Cramm that she was calling on Roche's behalf or that she would transmit the information to Roche.  Thus, while there was a deception of Hunter, it was not of plaintiffs.  As to the district court's second rationale--that no misrepresentations were conveyed by Hunter to plaintiffs--it is inapplicable on these facts.  McGinn concealed from Hunter the very information which, Hunter testified, she would have relayed to Roche if McGinn had been more forthcoming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other misrepresentation received in Massachusetts was the Yorston fax, which, under the district court's own evidentiary rulings, may be considered in this analysis.  On the other hand, there were three misleading statements made by the defendants and received by the plaintiffs in Canada during the plaintiffs' initial visits there.  And, as discussed above, the defendants' failure to disclose was, for these purposes, received by the plaintiffs equally in Massachusetts and Canada, as the parties' overall dealings were evenly divided between those two places.  Therefore, while the plaintiffs received the deception in both places, we agree with the district court that slightly more of it was received in Canada.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Clinton Hospital factor also requires us to examine where plaintiffs acted upon the deception.  Indeed, in Clinton Hospital, this court recognized that \"the critical factor is the locus of the recipient of the deception at the time of reliance.\"  Clinton Hospital, 907 F.2d at 1265-66;  see also Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90.   Under varying circumstances this may or may not be the same place as the place where the plaintiff received the deception.  Here, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs' actions in reliance were evenly divided between Massachusetts, where they negotiated a loan secured by Massachusetts properties, and Canada, where they hired a lawyer and accountant and formed a Canadian corporation to purchase the farm, and that this sub-factor thus favored neither party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thus concluded that the two-faceted second factor, like the first factor, weighed in favor of Canada, and consequently in favor of the defendants.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third Clinton Hospital factor is the location of the loss.  The parties advance radically different conceptions of the loss here.  Plaintiffs assert that the loss was the loss of the Massachusetts property that secured the Boston Private loan and that was ultimately foreclosed on when the plaintiffs defaulted on the loan.  Defendants conceive of the loss as the loss of the money which was invested in the farm in Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the plaintiffs' definition.  The court's reasoning was heavily influenced, perhaps even mandated, by its earlier ruling on the scope of the damages which plaintiffs would be allowed to seek in this action.  In that earlier ruling, the court rejected defendants' argument that the plaintiffs as individuals were not the real parties in interest in this case by defining the alleged losses narrowly, allowing plaintiffs to seek recovery only of losses they incurred personally in capitalizing the corporation and not those losses suffered by the corporation in Canada.  The district court felt obligated, for the sake of consistency, to use the same conception of the loss in this context.  The court thus concluded that this third factor favored the plaintiffs.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court balanced the three factors and found that defendants--in whose favor the first two factors weighed--had met their burden of proving that the deception had occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts.  Although the pragmatic, functional analysis is not necessarily limited to the three factors, it is significant that two of the three identified factors weigh in favor of the defendants here.  Cf. Central Mass.  Television, Inc. v. Amplicon, Inc., 930 F.Supp. 16, 27 (D.Mass.1996) (\"[W]hen 'place of injury' is the only factor weighing in favor of a claimant, the admonition of Massachusetts courts that liability under chapter 93A is not to be imposed lightly is particularly relevant.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved, after trial, for attorneys' fees in the sum of $ 865,000.  The district court, in a written memorandum, denied this motion.  Defendants appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first noted the dispute between the parties over whether United States or Canadian law should apply to the fee-shifting claim.  Then, assuming arguendo that Canadian law applied, as defendants urged, the court interpreted Canadian law to grant judges \"absolute and unfettered\" discretion in attorneys' fees claims.  Exercising this discretion, the district court determined that an award of fees would be \"inequitable\" because of defendants' intentional misconduct, and it denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants base their argument--one wholly based on Canadian substantive law--on the underlying premise that Canadian substantive law applies to the entire dispute between the parties.  They make no argument that they are entitled to fees under Massachusetts law.  The district court, however, rejected the defendants' choice of law position, applying Massachusetts law to the plaintiffs' chapter 93A claim.  The court consulted Canadian law in considering, and disposing of, the claim for the sake of argument only.  It is unnecessary to resolve the choice of law issue, as the denial of attorneys' fees was, under Canadian law, well within the trial court's discretion given the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants unsuccessfully argue that the district court overestimated the degree of discretion enjoyed by Canadian courts in the fee-shifting context.  Under Canadian law, \"[a] successful litigant has by law no right to costs.\"   Orkin, The Law of Costs &#167; 202.1, at 2-3 (2d ed.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  \"Although [the successful litigant] may have a reasonable expectation of receiving [costs], this is subject to what some cases have termed the court's absolute and unfettered discretion to award or withhold costs.\"  Id. This discretion is \"to be exercised according to the circumstances of each particular case.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the court abused its discretion by basing its denial of fees on its finding that defendants' conduct was violative of chapter 93A.  They claim that Massachusetts law is irrelevant to Canadian attorney fee determinations and thus that the district judge erred in considering conduct that was violative of Massachusetts law.  Defendants misapprehend the district court's reasoning.  The point is that their conduct was wrongful, not that it violated a particular statute.  In denying the motion, the court noted that \"defendants acted intentionally to withhold material information from plaintiffs.\"  Chapter 93A was merely the lens through which the court examined defendants' conduct.  Certainly, under the broad discretion Canadian law accords judges in attorney fee determinations, the district judge was entitled to consider this misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants prevailed on plaintiffs' chapter 93A claim because they successfully asserted that the misconduct occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts.  Their motion for attorneys' fees was denied because the district court, exercising its discretion, believed it would be inequitable to award fees to parties whose wrongful conduct had been established at trial.  It was entirely proper, in this context, for the district judge to consider defendants' intentional misconduct in deceiving the plaintiffs as a circumstance militating against an award of fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons expressed above, the judgment of the district court in favor of defendants and the denial of defendants' post-trial motion for attorneys' fees are both affirmed.

Aquacare prepared a prospectus (the Aquacare I report), which presented general information about the biological and technical aspects of the proposed operation.  The prospectus also contained financial projections and asserted that the production capacity of the contemplated facility would be 131.8 tons of fish in the first year of operation and 360 tons annually thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Royal Bank of Canada financed the construction of the farm, which was operated by a firm called Marine Harvesting, Ltd.  (\"Marine\").  Fish were first introduced into the facility in December 1987, but there were construction delays and the plant was not completed until June 1988.  Things went badly from the start.  The fish did not grow as fast as anticipated and had unexpectedly high mortality rates.  By October 1988, the fish had not yet reached market size (4 lbs), as expected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October, Cleve Myers, Marine's President, retained Aquatech Systems, A.S., another Norwegian aquaculture firm, to perform an independent study of the farm's problems.  Myers wanted to know, among other things, how many tons of fish the farm was capable of producing.  Dr. Michael Smith, a biologist from Aquatech, came to the farm on October 30 and spent three days making observations, conducting tests, and speaking with employees.  Dr. Smith was not shown the Aquacare I report, but the Aquacare operating manuals were made available to him.  The result of Dr. Smith's analysis was a forty-four page report (the Aquatech report), dated November 18, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Aquatech report criticized the design of the farm.  The report stated that \"until experience over a fully operational annual cycle has been gained,\" the farm could produce, at best, only 200 tons of fish per year.  Dr. Smith's report also made several recommendations for improving production.  For instance, it recommended that a higher proportion of fresh water be pumped into the tanks, for purposes of both temperature control and salinity control.  This suggestion deviated from the specifications in the Aquacare operating manuals.  The 200-ton projection was premised on the assumption that the recommended changes would be implemented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Osler, Inc., one of Marine's two fifty-percent shareholders, was in receivership, and A.S. Bergens Skillingsbanken, the other fifty-percent shareholder, was refusing to inject additional capital into the venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, Myers turned the keys to the farm over to Lou McGinn, the Loan Officer in charge of the project at the Royal Bank, and requested that the farm be placed in voluntary receivership.  Myers stated that without operating capital he was unable to care for the inventory or pay the staff.  He also stated that he had \"received a consultant's report regarding the production capabilities of the plant which indicate [sic] that the facility is not viable as it presently is financed.\"   McGinn stated that Myers had told him that he received \"a consultant's report\" which indicated that \"the plant was capable of producing only approximately 200 tons of product per year as opposed to the 360 tons of product per year upon which its financing and viability had been initially contemplated and established.\"   In a letter of January 4, 1989, to McGinn, Myers wrote that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>after the [Aquatech] report indicated an expected tonnage, which was not viable, I received confirmation from the directors and major shareholders to advise the bank and request a receiver.

McGinn informed his supervisor of the development, and the supervisor noted in a memo that \"apparently a recent study ... places some question on the viability of the project.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the Royal Bank's request, the Supreme Court of PEI appointed Deloitte &amp; Touche<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> as receiver of Marine's assets.  Karen Cramm, a partner in Deloitte's Halifax, Nova Scotia office, was in charge of the receivership.  Cramm took instructions on the handling of the assets from the Royal Bank, specifically from McGinn, as well as from the PEI court.  The Royal Bank was the sole secured creditor of Marine, with a $ 2.8 million note outstanding.  The expectation was that none of Marine's other creditors would get anything out of the sale of the assets;  there would be a shortfall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm immediately took possession of Marine's assets and reviewed the company's financial records.  Farm employees were terminated as employees of Marine and rehired as employees of Deloitte, as receiver for Marine.  Deloitte decided to sell the farm by means of a public tender.  Cramm immediately began preparing an information package which could be sent to potential investors.  Around this time Myers showed Cramm both the Aquacare I report and the Aquatech report.  Cramm read both reports.  She included neither of the reports in the information package, though later she would offer the Aquacare I report alone to prospective purchasers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Deloitte placed advertisements in various newspapers, including the Boston Globe, describing the farm and inviting interested readers to contact Deloitte for further information.  The ads stated that the \"business is intended to be sold on a going-concern basis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early December, after learning that Marine had become insolvent, Aquacare contacted Cramm and told her that it wanted access to the plant to conduct a review of plant operations.  Aquacare had heard about the Aquatech report, which criticized Aquacare's design and operational specifications.  Cramm agreed to Aquacare's request.  Aquacare then issued two unsolicited reports, the Aquacare II report on December 15 and the Aquacare III follow-up report on December 20, attempting to rebut the Aquatech report.  Aquacare II reviewed plant operations and praised the design and operational specifications of the plant.  Aquacare II reasserted that 360-ton production \"can be achieved without problem,\" provided there was proper stocking of fingerlings (young fish), and recommended a fingerling acquisition plan.  Aquacare II also blamed Marine's management for the plant's failures.  Aquacare III explicitly refuted the Aquatech report.  Aquacare did not bill Deloitte for these reports.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, John Roche, a Massachusetts real estate developer, had been seeking a business opportunity in aquaculture.  After reading the Globe ad, he called Cramm from his home in Massachusetts.  The next day she sent him the information package.  Roche discussed the farm with two of his business associates, Mark DiRico (the chief engineer of a packaging supply business) and George Call, who both expressed an interest.  Roche and Call decided to visit the facility in Canada.  On January 3 or 4, 1989, they toured the facility with Cramm.  During this visit, Roche asked Cramm why the previous investors had failed.  She responded that they had run out of money.  Roche and Call also met with Cliff Yorston, the Plant Manager, who told them that some of the fish were ready for sale and that all the plant needed was an infusion of new capital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm offered the visitors a copy of the Aquacare I report.  Before receiving it, they were required to sign a disclaimer, which stated, among other things, that they were aware that Deloitte \"had not, in any way, attempted to verify the information contained herein.\"   Cramm stated that she offered the Aquacare I report to prospective purchasers because \"it was an informative package that included a layout of the plant facility\" and \"it talked about, in general, the aquaculture operation.\"   She explained that the disclaimer was intended to protect Deloitte against claims involving any inaccuracies in the information contained in the report, such as the financial projections, growth charts, and profitability analysis.  She had not reviewed that information and had no opinion as to its accuracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm admits she did not offer Roche and Call a copy of the Aquatech report, but claims it was among the financial statements that Roche and Call were invited to view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and Call next met with McGinn at the Royal Bank of Canada to discuss financing.  McGinn, like Cramm before him, told the two Americans that the farm went into receivership because the previous investors had run out of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and Call returned to Massachusetts, where Roche showed the Aquacare I report to DiRico.  During the next week, Roche had several telephone conversations with McGinn about potential financing.  McGinn recommended that Roche retain a local Canadian lawyer, Scott MacKenzie, and a local Canadian accountant, Stan MacPherson, to assist him in dealing with various government agencies.  Roche did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, Roche and Call, this time accompanied by DiRico, met with McGinn and Cramm at the Royal Bank in PEI.  DiRico asked McGinn for \"sales figures\";  DiRico claims that McGinn gave him a copy of the Aquacare I report, telling him that \"all the figures are in here.\"   DiRico says he was not asked to sign a disclaimer.  Cramm denies that DiRico was given a copy of the report at this meeting.  DiRico asked McGinn about the plant's troubles;  McGinn responded that mismanagement was to blame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and his associates also went to see the farm.  Cliff Yorston, the Plant Manager, pulled a large fish from one of the tanks and told the two visitors that he had a whole tankful of similar \"beauties\" which could be sold for $ 3.75 a pound in Boston.  Roche and his associates planned to generate operating capital for the plant through the immediate sale of inventory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and his partners made an offer of $ 2.9 million the next day, subject to Royal Bank financing.  But Cramm, after securing the Royal Bank's support, rejected the offer, instead choosing to accept a lower all-cash offer ($ 1.4 million) from a group led by Hirsch Spiegleman.  The Spiegleman group's offer, unlike the Roche group's offer, did not require Royal Bank financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or around January 17, Cramm told Roche that his offer had been rejected.  McGinn also asked Roche if Roche's group would still be interested in the event that the Spiegleman deal fell through.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his bid was accepted, Spiegleman requested a copy of the Aquatech report (which he referred to as the \"200 ton report\").  The record does not reveal how Spiegleman, unlike Roche, knew about the Aquatech report.  Cramm informed Aquacare of Spiegleman's request and asked for permission to give him a copy of the Aquacare II and Aquacare III reports at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-February 1989, the Spiegleman deal collapsed.  The Roche group hoped to take over the Spiegleman offer rather than going through the process of submitting a new bid.  Seeking financing, Roche and his partners met with Amy Hunter, a loan officer at Boston Private Bank &amp; Trust Company (Boston Private).  Roche gave Hunter a copy of the Aquacare I report.  Hunter understood that Roche was presenting the report as his business plan.  Roche told Hunter that the fish farm went into receivership because the previous owners had run out of money.  Roche also told Hunter that he planned to raise operating capital by immediately selling fish.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter next called Cramm and McGinn to confirm what Roche had told her.  Cramm told Hunter that the farm's equipment was state-of-the-art and all that was needed was the right management.  McGinn echoed these thoughts, adding that Roche would get half his investment back in the first three months without even having to invest in any new fish.  Hunter asked McGinn if he knew of any downside risks to the farm or whether he had any projections for the farm.  McGinn responded that he did not know any downside risks other than bad management and that Roche's ideas sounded good to him.  He did not offer any other projections.  On February 28, Boston Private approved a loan of $ 1.2 million to Roche, secured by property Roche owned in the Boston area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cramm, however, decided not to allow Roche to take over Spiegleman's offer.  Instead, she re-tendered the farm to all potentially interested buyers, including Roche.  Consequently, she edited the original information packet and sent it out on March 1 to everyone who had expressed an interest in the farm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 2, Cramm received from Yorston, the farm's Plant Manager, a copy of a recent memorandum written by Aquacare (the Aquacare IV report).  This memorandum had been prepared by Aquacare for its subsidiary, Seasprings.  It accidentally fell into Yorston's hands because Aquacare, intending to send it by fax to Seasprings, sent it to the fish farm's fax number.  The Aquacare IV report contained scathing criticism of Deloitte's management of the farm.  Aquacare asserted that Deloitte, by attempting to maintain the status quo pending sale, was actually reducing the value of the farm's assets.  For instance, several tons of fish had matured past marketability.  Aquacare believed that Deloitte was wasting money by feeding these unmarketable fish.  Additionally, Deloitte had failed in a timely fashion to purchase fingerlings to restock the farm and future harvests would be lower.  Aquacare believed that under Deloitte's management the value of the inventory as well as the farm's 1989 and 1990 earning potential were decreasing daily.  Aquacare implicitly disavowed its own earlier production capacity projections, made in the Aquacare I report and reasserted in the Aquacare II report, at least as to 1989 and 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and DiRico visited the farm again on March 8. Roche told Yorston that if his bid was accepted he would need to start selling fish immediately to raise working capital.  Yorston replied that he had $ 150,000 worth of fish ready for shipment to Boston.  Roche also believed that, once the farm was purchased, McGinn was prepared to provide working capital in the form of a Royal Bank operating line.  On March 10, Roche and his partners offered $ 1.4 million.  This offer was accepted on March 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche called Yorston on March 13 to inquire again about the prospects of immediate sales.  Yorston faxed a response to Roche.  The cover sheet said, \"Here are some projected cash flows for 1989.\"   The attached projections anticipated sales in March of $ 154,000 and total sales for the year of almost $ 2.5 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  These projections had not been prepared by Deloitte or by Marine, but by the Spiegleman group.  However, someone had obliterated the identifying heading at the top of the page so that, when the projections were sent by fax, the source of the projections was not identified to Roche.  Yorston had earlier told Roche that he was not authorized to release any information about the plant without permission from Cramm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 17, Scott MacKenzie, the Canadian attorney hired by Roche to help buy the farm, faxed two newspaper articles to Roche, along with a brief note saying that Roche might find the attached articles \"interesting.\"   One of the articles discussed Marine's collapse, quoting Myers as saying \"[t]he Aquatech report was devastating and the only option open to Marine Harvesting Ltd. was to request that the bank place a receiver on site.\"   Roche filed the articles away without reading them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 20, the Canadian court approved the sale of the farm.  Roche formed a corporation in Canada, International Marine Fisheries, Ltd.  (IMFL), to make the purchase.  Roche instructed Yorston to fill orders for shipment to Boston.  Yorston was able to fill the first few orders of 2 to 4 pound fish, but the buyers in Boston complained that the fish were too small.  Yorston was unable to fill the first order for 4 to 6 pound fish.  He then resigned.  Scott Taylor, formerly the farm's Chief Biologist, took over Yorston's position, but he was also unable to fill these orders.  In April, Taylor told Roche that the larger fish were all unmarketable because they were too old and that the other fish were too small for sale.  Taylor predicted that the smaller fish would be four pounds by June and could be sold then.  By June, the smaller fish still had not grown to four pounds.  Taylor was fired.  The new Plant Manager, Richard Gallant, recommended, in order to cut expenses and see if the fish would grow faster, that the fish be placed in cages in the bay.  This was done in July.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and his partners injected cash of their own into the enterprise to save it and also took out an operating line of credit from the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of $ 500,000.  Roche personally guaranteed the loan.  During the summer, Roche and DiRico bought Call's share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche came to think the fish farm was a failure.  He began negotiating with a local veterinary college which was interested in buying the farm for research purposes.  He hired Deloitte to help him set up this deal.  Stan MacPherson and Cleve Myers, both recently hired by Deloitte, worked on the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1989, Roche was at the fish farm.  Tipped off by a former secretary, he found the Aquatech report in a desk drawer.  Attached to the report was a 1988 note from Cleve Myers, the former president of Marine, to a prospective fish dealer.  The note said that the farm:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>was placed in receivership Friday afternoon.  The fish have not grown fast enough, as you know, plus I have received a specialist's report from Norway stating that we can only grow 200 tons annually (just enough to lose one million dollars each year).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reading the report and the attached note Roche concluded that he had been defrauded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1989, the Bank of Nova Scotia called the loan and demanded that Roche, as personal guarantor, make payment to the bank.  He did not do so.  The fish farm closed in December, and went into receivership in February.  The Bank of Nova Scotia sued Roche and DiRico on the defaulted loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, IMFL, the plaintiffs' Canadian corporation, was dissolved in May 1990.  Roche and DiRico brought this action against Deloitte and the Royal Bank in November 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roche and DiRico sued Deloitte and the Royal Bank on two theories:  common law fraud and misrepresentation, and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,\" under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common law counts were tried before a jury.  Since the defendants did not consent to a jury determination of the chapter 93A claim, that claim was decided by the district judge.  The jury returned a verdict for the Royal Bank on all the common law counts.  As for the common law claims against Deloitte, the jury found that Roche and DiRico had proved there were negligent misrepresentations, but that the plaintiffs were ninety-nine percent negligent compared to the one percent negligence of Deloitte;  therefore the claim foundered on proximate cause grounds and there was no recovery.  The district court ruled that defendants had engaged in misrepresentations contrary to the standard of chapter 93A,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> but that the actionable conduct did not take place \"primarily and substantially within the commonwealth\" of Massachusetts, as chapter 93A requires.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11.  The court thus ruled in favor of defendants on the issue of chapter 93A liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, while defending the district court's predicate rulings, appeal the court's ultimate decision on chapter 93A liability.  They assert that the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Defendants, by contrast, defend the \"primarily and substantially\" ruling, but challenge a number of the district court's predicate rulings.  Specifically, defendants argue that Roche and DiRico are not the real parties in interest because the deception, as alleged, was perpetrated on the Canadian corporation established by Roche and DiRico to purchase and operate the fish farm, not on the two men as individuals.  They also argue that, under forum state (Massachusetts) conflicts principles, Canadian law, rather than Massachusetts law, should have been applied to the suit.  Finally, they argue that, even under Massachusetts law, plaintiffs had not successfully shown actionable conduct under 93A. Because we affirm the ruling below on the ground that the conduct was not primarily and substantially in Massachusetts, there is no reason to address defendants' other arguments in any detail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts is one of law, which we review de novo.

See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the district court erred in finding that defendants deceptively failed to disclose the Aquatech report.  Defendants assert that the non-disclosure claim is an impossibility here because plaintiffs had knowledge prior to buying the farm about the very document the defendants are accused of failing to disclose, the Aquatech report.  This knowledge, the defendants essentially argue, is based on either of two alternate theories.  First, defendants assert that plaintiffs had imputed knowledge of the report:  their agent MacKenzie knew about the Aquatech report through a newspaper article and that knowledge could be imputed to the plaintiffs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Second, defendants assert that the plaintiffs had constructive knowledge:  MacKenzie had faxed a copy of the article to Roche (a week after plaintiffs' offer was accepted), and Roche's knowledge could be assumed, without relying on an agency theory (although Roche did not read the article until long after).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Even assuming these theories are valid, defendants have still failed to demonstrate reversible error.  Prior to the closing, plaintiffs at most knew of the existence of the Aquatech report.  Defendants' deception here was in not providing plaintiffs with a copy of the report given that plaintiffs had been provided with a copy of the rival Aquacare I report.  Under these facts the district court did not err in finding that defendants deceptively failed to disclose the Aquatech report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue it was clear error for the district court to conclude that the farm's original investors pulled out because of the Aquatech report, a conclusion upon which the non-disclosure claim rests.  Defendants are correct that the record does not reveal that the investors pulled out solely because of the unfavorable Aquatech report.  However, the report clearly played a major role in the investors' decision to place the plant in receivership.  At the very least, Cramm and McGinn knew that the previous investors pulled out just after receiving the Aquatech report, and that the report played a large role in this decision.  Myers wrote McGinn on January 4, 1989, saying that both the directors and the major shareholders thought it was wrong to continue operations after receiving the information in the Aquatech report as to the expected tonnage.  There is no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, in turn, challenge certain findings of non-deception as clearly erroneous.  They argue that the advertisement placed by Cramm was deceptive because it described the farm as a \"going concern.\"   A \"going concern\" is \"[a]n enterprise which is being carried on as a whole and with some particular object in view\" or \"an existing solvent business, which is being conducted in the usual and ordinary way for which it was organized.\"   Black's Law Dictionary 691 (6th ed.1990).  The district court determined that the use of the term \"going concern\" here was not deceptive.  Plaintiffs rely entirely on Dr. Smith's findings in the Aquatech report in asserting on appeal that the farm was not a \"going concern.\"   In Dr. Smith's opinion, say plaintiffs, the farm's pumping system was incapable of operating properly at optimum levels and the farm was, as a general matter, not state-of-the-art.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' charge of error fails on two grounds.  First, Dr. Smith is one aquaculture expert among several whose conflicting views about the farm became known in this case.  Indeed, this is the very reason his report should have been available to the plaintiffs:  the plaintiffs had been given a different report by a competing aquaculture firm which expressed a far rosier view of the farm's operations and production capacity.  While the plaintiffs' non-disclosure claim is rooted in the variety of opinions available about the viability of the farm, their \"going concern\" argument presents Dr. Smith's opinion as the single truth.  But most damaging to plaintiffs, Dr. Smith's report never suggested, let alone stated, that the farm was not a \"going concern.\"   His report indicates only his belief that the farm was more poorly designed, and consequently a riskier investment, than its designers thought.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, that the farm ultimately failed (and thus, presumably could not properly have been described as a \"going concern\" at some point during its decline) is not proof that it was doomed to failure at the time the ad was placed, at the start of the receivership.  Indeed, implicit in the plaintiffs' overall case is a claim that their venture might not have failed if the receiver had managed the farm better during the term of the receivership and if the selling price better reflected the actual value of the assets.  Precisely because the value and production capacity of the farm were so hotly disputed at trial, the judge did not commit clear error in finding that the farm was a \"going concern\" at the time the Globe ad was placed.  The farm's ultimate failure does not change this.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These factual findings lead to the question whether the deception occurred primarily and substantially in Massachusetts.  Contrary to the standard burden of proof on jurisdictional questions, here the burden is on defendants to show that their misconduct occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11;  Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90;  see Gilleran, supra, &#167; 3:16, at 65.  This is because \" &#167; 11 provides an exemption from 93A liability, available as a defense, rather than a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.\"  Kansallis Fin.  Ltd. v. Fern, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195738\"><a href=\"/opinion/195738/kansallis-v-fern/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 481 (1st Cir.1994).  The district court's conclusion that defendants satisfied this statutory burden is one of law, reviewed de novo.  Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90;  Clinton Hospital, 907 F.2d at 1264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Clinton Hospital, this court read the sparse body of Massachusetts precedent as support for a pragmatic, functional approach for determining whether actionable misconduct occurs primarily and substantially in Massachusetts.  The Clinton Hospital court distilled the approach down to three basic factors:  (1) where defendant committed the deception;  (2) where plaintiff was deceived and acted upon the deception;  and (3) the situs of plaintiff's losses due to the deception.  Id. at 1265-66.   The district court, applying the Clinton Hospital factors to this case, reasoned that the deception here occurred primarily and substantially in Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has previously recognized that the first factor is the least weighty of the three factors.  Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90;  Clinton Hospital, 907 F.2d at 1265-66.   The district court was aware of this and ruled that the first factor weighed against the plaintiffs because most of the defendants' misrepresentations and deceptive acts were committed in Canada.  This is plainly correct.  Indeed, the district court understated the point:  all the misrepresentations occurred in Canada.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs argue on appeal that the \"clear preponderance\" of defendants' deceptive conduct occurred in Massachusetts.  This argument, however, is premised on a certain set of acts which the district court did not consider part of the deception.  Specifically, plaintiffs assert that the Boston Globe ad and the two information packets were deceptions which defendants committed in Massachusetts.  But the district court did not err in finding that the ad and the packets were not misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the non-disclosure of the Aquatech report and the Aquacare IV report, there is a metaphysical dilemma in ascertaining where this occurred.  The very problem is that disclosure did not occur.  The district court read Clinton Hospital as support for the proposition that non-disclosure occurs where the defendant who fails to disclose is located.  This was obviously Canada.  But Clinton Hospital does not answer this question.  Where the defendants' obligation to disclose certain documents arose out of their voluntary disclosure of other documents, and where the parties' dealings were fairly evenly split between two places, it is most reasonable to say that the non-disclosure occurred equally in both places.  However, since all the actual misrepresentations, as detailed above, were made by the defendants in Canada, the first Clinton Hospital factor still weighs in favor of defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  The district court concluded, and we agree, that the bulk of the defendants' unfair and deceptive acts and omissions were in Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Clinton Hospital factor requires an analysis of where the plaintiffs received and acted upon the deceptive or unfair acts or practices.  As the district court properly recognized, this factor, though framed by the Clinton Hospital court as a single factor, really requires two distinct inquiries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to where the plaintiffs received the deception, the district court concluded that it was primarily Canada.  In coming to this decision, the court declined to consider the misleading statements made by McGinn to Hunter during their telephone conversation because the district court believed Hunter \"was not acting as an agent of the plaintiffs when she received the misrepresentation, and there is no evidence she relayed any of the misrepresentations to the plaintiffs.\"   Plaintiffs complain the court erred in not including this telephone conversation as a deception.  This is an arguable issue, but we resolve it against plaintiffs.  In terms of strict agency law, Hunter was acting for Boston Private, not for plaintiffs, when she made the call.  There is no evidence that Hunter told McGinn or Cramm that she was calling on Roche's behalf or that she would transmit the information to Roche.  Thus, while there was a deception of Hunter, it was not of plaintiffs.  As to the district court's second rationale--that no misrepresentations were conveyed by Hunter to plaintiffs--it is inapplicable on these facts.  McGinn concealed from Hunter the very information which, Hunter testified, she would have relayed to Roche if McGinn had been more forthcoming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other misrepresentation received in Massachusetts was the Yorston fax, which, under the district court's own evidentiary rulings, may be considered in this analysis.  On the other hand, there were three misleading statements made by the defendants and received by the plaintiffs in Canada during the plaintiffs' initial visits there.  And, as discussed above, the defendants' failure to disclose was, for these purposes, received by the plaintiffs equally in Massachusetts and Canada, as the parties' overall dealings were evenly divided between those two places.  Therefore, while the plaintiffs received the deception in both places, we agree with the district court that slightly more of it was received in Canada.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second Clinton Hospital factor also requires us to examine where plaintiffs acted upon the deception.  Indeed, in Clinton Hospital, this court recognized that \"the critical factor is the locus of the recipient of the deception at the time of reliance.\"  Clinton Hospital, 907 F.2d at 1265-66;  see also Compagnie de Reassurance d'Ile de France, 57 F.3d at 90.   Under varying circumstances this may or may not be the same place as the place where the plaintiff received the deception.  Here, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs' actions in reliance were evenly divided between Massachusetts, where they negotiated a loan secured by Massachusetts properties, and Canada, where they hired a lawyer and accountant and formed a Canadian corporation to purchase the farm, and that this sub-factor thus favored neither party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court thus concluded that the two-faceted second factor, like the first factor, weighed in favor of Canada, and consequently in favor of the defendants.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third Clinton Hospital factor is the location of the loss.  The parties advance radically different conceptions of the loss here.  Plaintiffs assert that the loss was the loss of the Massachusetts property that secured the Boston Private loan and that was ultimately foreclosed on when the plaintiffs defaulted on the loan.  Defendants conceive of the loss as the loss of the money which was invested in the farm in Canada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the plaintiffs' definition.  The court's reasoning was heavily influenced, perhaps even mandated, by its earlier ruling on the scope of the damages which plaintiffs would be allowed to seek in this action.  In that earlier ruling, the court rejected defendants' argument that the plaintiffs as individuals were not the real parties in interest in this case by defining the alleged losses narrowly, allowing plaintiffs to seek recovery only of losses they incurred personally in capitalizing the corporation and not those losses suffered by the corporation in Canada.  The district court felt obligated, for the sake of consistency, to use the same conception of the loss in this context.  The court thus concluded that this third factor favored the plaintiffs.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court balanced the three factors and found that defendants--in whose favor the first two factors weighed--had met their burden of proving that the deception had occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts.  Although the pragmatic, functional analysis is not necessarily limited to the three factors, it is significant that two of the three identified factors weigh in favor of the defendants here.  Cf. Central Mass.  Television, Inc. v. Amplicon, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></span>, 27 (D.Mass.1996) (\"[W]hen 'place of injury' is the only factor weighing in favor of a claimant, the admonition of Massachusetts courts that liability under chapter 93A is not to be imposed lightly is particularly relevant.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved, after trial, for attorneys' fees in the sum of $ 865,000.  The district court, in a written memorandum, denied this motion.  Defendants appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first noted the dispute between the parties over whether United States or Canadian law should apply to the fee-shifting claim.  Then, assuming arguendo that Canadian law applied, as defendants urged, the court interpreted Canadian law to grant judges \"absolute and unfettered\" discretion in attorneys' fees claims.  Exercising this discretion, the district court determined that an award of fees would be \"inequitable\" because of defendants' intentional misconduct, and it denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants base their argument--one wholly based on Canadian substantive law--on the underlying premise that Canadian substantive law applies to the entire dispute between the parties.  They make no argument that they are entitled to fees under Massachusetts law.  The district court, however, rejected the defendants' choice of law position, applying Massachusetts law to the plaintiffs' chapter 93A claim.  The court consulted Canadian law in considering, and disposing of, the claim for the sake of argument only.  It is unnecessary to resolve the choice of law issue, as the denial of attorneys' fees was, under Canadian law, well within the trial court's discretion given the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants unsuccessfully argue that the district court overestimated the degree of discretion enjoyed by Canadian courts in the fee-shifting context.  Under Canadian law, \"[a] successful litigant has by law no right to costs.\"   Orkin, The Law of Costs &#167; 202.1, at 2-3 (2d ed.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  \"Although [the successful litigant] may have a reasonable expectation of receiving [costs], this is subject to what some cases have termed the court's absolute and unfettered discretion to award or withhold costs.\"  Id. This discretion is \"to be exercised according to the circumstances of each particular case.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the court abused its discretion by basing its denial of fees on its finding that defendants' conduct was violative of chapter 93A.  They claim that Massachusetts law is irrelevant to Canadian attorney fee determinations and thus that the district judge erred in considering conduct that was violative of Massachusetts law.  Defendants misapprehend the district court's reasoning.  The point is that their conduct was wrongful, not that it violated a particular statute.  In denying the motion, the court noted that \"defendants acted intentionally to withhold material information from plaintiffs.\"  Chapter 93A was merely the lens through which the court examined defendants' conduct.  Certainly, under the broad discretion Canadian law accords judges in attorney fee determinations, the district judge was entitled to consider this misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants prevailed on plaintiffs' chapter 93A claim because they successfully asserted that the misconduct occurred primarily and substantially outside Massachusetts.  Their motion for attorneys' fees was denied because the district court, exercising its discretion, believed it would be inequitable to award fees to parties whose wrongful conduct had been established at trial.  It was entirely proper, in this context, for the district judge to consider defendants' intentional misconduct in deceiving the plaintiffs as a circumstance militating against an award of fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons expressed above, the judgment of the district court in favor of defendants and the denial of defendants' post-trial motion for attorneys' fees are both affirmed.
