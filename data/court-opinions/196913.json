David Gordon  Fleming  is a  Maine  state\r                           \r\n\nprisoner incarcerated  at the Maine  Correctional Institution\r\n\nin  Warren (MCI-Warren).    On  March  1, 1996,  Fleming  was\r\n\ntransferred  within MCI-Warren from Housing Unit C to Housing\r\n\nUnit B.   He was  later informed  that, \"You became  loud and\r\n\nstarted  hollering trying  to incite  all the  inmates  in C.\r\n\nWing,  your action[s]  were reviewed  by  the Program  Review\r\n\nCommittee, and  they recommended that  you be returned  to B.\r\n\nWing so that you would not disrupt the unit.\"   Shortly after\r\n\nthe transfer,  Fleming filed  both a  civil rights  complaint\r\n\npursuant  to  42 U.S.C.     1983,  Fleming v.  Department  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorrections,  et  al.,  Civil  No.  96-70-B,  and  a  \"habeas\r                                 \r\n\npetition,\"  Fleming  v.  Department of  Corrections,  et al.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nCivil No. 96-77-B.  A magistrate judge recommended  that both\r\n\nfilings be dismissed  as frivolous within  the meaning of  28\r\n\nU.S.C.      1915(d).     The  district   judge  adopted   the\r\n\nmagistrate's  recommendations.  Fleming  now appeals from the\r\n\ndismissal of his  complaint in civil action No.  96-70-B.  He\r\n\nalso  seeks a certificate of probable cause permitting him to\r\n\nappeal the dismissal of his \"habeas petition\" in civil action\r\n\nNo. 96-77-B.1\r                        1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1After Fleming  filed his  petition for  a certificate  of\r               1\r\nprobable cause in this  court, the President signed  into law\r\nthe  Antiterrorism and Effective  Death Penalty Act  of 1996,\r\nPub. L.  No.  104-132,  110  Stat.  1214  (April  24,  1996).\r\nAlthough Fleming  has not raised  the issue, we note  that we\r\nneed not decide in this case whether any of the amendments in\r\nthe Act apply since it would not alter our disposition.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     For  the following reasons,  we affirm the  dismissal of\r\n\nFleming's complaint in civil action No. 96-70-B.  \r\n\n     Relying on  the Supreme  Court's decision  in Sandin  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nConner, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995), the district court ruled that\r                  \r\n\nFleming  had no liberty interest  in being free from transfer\r\n\nto the \"B-side\" of MCI-Warren which would trigger due process\r\n\nrequirements.  Fleming makes no meaningful argument that this\r\n\nruling was in  error.  Instead, he criticizes  the holding of\r\n\nSandin and suggests that, if it is the \"new law of the land,\"\r                  \r\n\nhe has little  incentive to abide  by prison  rules.  We  are\r\n\nbound by  Supreme Court  decisions, and we  see no  basis for\r\n\nsetting  aside the  district  court's  ruling  that  the  due\r\n\nprocess claim is frivolous.  \r\n\n     Assuming  without  deciding  that  the  issue  has  been\r\n\npreserved  on  appeal,  we  would  affirm  the  dismissal  of\r\n\nFleming's equal protection claim as frivolous.   Fleming does\r\n\nnot allege  that he  is a  member of a  protected class,  and\r\n\nthere is  no suggestion that  the transfer to Housing  Unit B\r\n\nwas the result of invidious discrimination.  See, e.g., Wolff\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  McDonnell, 418  U.S.  539,  556  (1974)  (observing  that\r                         \r\n\nprisoners  are protected  under the  Equal Protection  clause\r\n\nagainst  invidious discrimination).    Mere inconsistency  in\r\n\nprison  management does not  support a  constitutional claim.\r\n\nSee Shango v. Jurich, 681 F.2d 1091, 1104 (7th Cir. 1982).\r                                \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Finally,  the  notion  that prison  officials  \"falsely\"\r\n\ncharged  Fleming with attempting  to incite other  inmates in\r\n\nretaliation  for his  having filed a  lawsuit in  Maine state\r\n\ncourt is sufficiently implausible, on the facts of this case,\r\n\nto  warrant the  dismissal of Fleming's  retaliatory transfer\r\n\nclaim as frivolous.   See Neitzke v. Williams,  490 U.S. 319,\r                                                         \r\n\n327 (1989) (observing that   1915(d) accords judges the power\r\n\nto \"pierce the veil\" of the complaint's factual allegations).\r\n\nFleming   admits  to  the  underlying  conduct  found  to  be\r\n\nobjectionable,  though not to  its characterization by prison\r\n\nofficials.   The  particular  officials who  reported Fleming\r\n\nwere not defendants in the  Maine lawsuit.  And, although the\r\n\nMaine lawsuit was pending at  the time of Fleming's transfer,\r\n\nit was shortly thereafter dismissed as totally frivolous.  \r\n\n     Fleming's  remaining  arguments   do  not  appear   with\r\n\nsufficient clarity in his complaint or are  waived on appeal.\r\n\nUnder the circumstances, and for the reasons stated above, we\r\n\nfind no error in the dismissal of the complaint.  \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     We  also deny  Fleming's request  for  a certificate  of\r\n\nprobable cause in civil action No. 96-77-B, and we  summarily\r\n\ndismiss the appeal.  See  Loc. R. 27.1. \r                                    \r\n\n     To the extent that Fleming's \"habeas petition\" is better\r\n\nconstrued  as a    1983  complaint,  leave to  appeal is  not\r\n\nnecessary.   However, we  have already rejected  as frivolous\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nFleming's  claim that the  transfer to \"B-side\"  violated his\r\n\nright to due process.   We are also  persuaded that in  civil\r\n\naction No. 96-77-B,  Fleming abandoned any    1983 claims  in\r\n\nhis  objection  to  the  magistrate's  report  and subsequent\r\n\nfilings.  \r\n\n     Fleming, however, would  have us construe his  filing in\r\n\ncivil action  No. 96-77-B  as a habeas  petition.   He argues\r\n\nthat inmates at  Maine State Prison are permitted  to earn up\r\n\nto three work-related  good time  credits in  any month,  and\r\n\nthat  inmates  at  MCI-Warren,  himself  included, have  been\r\n\nunlawfully limited to only one or two  credits per month.  We\r\n\ndo not think this claim was raised with sufficient clarity in\r\n\nFleming's \"petition,\"  which focused on the facts surrounding\r\n\nhis  transfer  from  one housing  unit  within  MCI-Warren to\r\n\nanother.  Accordingly,  we deny the request for a certificate\r\n\nof probable cause.  See Cacoperdo v. Demosthene, 37 F.3d 504,\r                                                           \r\n\n507 (9th  Cir. 1994) (grounds  not raised in  habeas petition\r\n\nare not cognizable on appeal),  cert. denied, 115 S.

Fleming does not allege that he is a member of a protected class, and there is no suggestion that the transfer to Housing Unit B was the result of invidious discrimination.   See, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>, 556 (1974) (observing that prisoners are protected under the Equal Protection clause against invidious discrimination).  Mere inconsistency in prison management does not support a constitutional claim.   See Shango v. Jurich, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405936\"><a href=\"/opinion/405936/shango-cleve-heidelberg-jr-v-mary-jurich-gayle-franzen-former/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span>, 1104 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the notion that prison officials \"falsely\" charged Fleming with attempting to incite other inmates in retaliation for his having filed a lawsuit in Maine state court is sufficiently implausible, on the facts of this case, to warrant the dismissal of Fleming's retaliatory transfer claim as frivolous.   See Neitzke v. Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112254\"><a href=\"/opinion/112254/neitzke-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 327 (1989) (observing that &#167; 1915(d) accords judges the power to \"pierce the veil\" of the complaint's factual allegations).  Fleming admits to the underlying conduct found to be objectionable, though not to its characterization by prison officials.  The particular officials who reported Fleming were not defendants in the Maine lawsuit.  And, although the Maine lawsuit was pending at the time of Fleming's transfer, it was shortly thereafter dismissed as totally frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleming's remaining arguments do not appear with sufficient clarity in his complaint or are waived on appeal.  Under the circumstances, and for the reasons stated above, we find no error in the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also deny Fleming's request for a certificate of probable cause in civil action No. 96-77-B, and we summarily dismiss the appeal.  See Loc.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Fleming's \"habeas petition\" is better construed as a &#167; 1983 complaint, leave to appeal is not necessary.  However, we have already rejected as frivolous Fleming's claim that the transfer to \"B-side\" violated his right to due process.  We are also persuaded that in civil action No. 96-77-B, Fleming abandoned any &#167; 1983 claims in his objection to the magistrate's report and subsequent filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleming, however, would have us construe his filing in civil action No. 96-77-B as a habeas petition.  He argues that inmates at Maine State Prison are permitted to earn up to three work-related good time credits in any month, and that inmates at MCI-Warren, himself included, have been unlawfully limited to only one or two credits per month.  We do not think this claim was raised with sufficient clarity in Fleming's \"petition,\" which focused on the facts surrounding his transfer from one housing unit within MCI-Warren to another.  Accordingly, we deny the request for a certificate of probable cause.   See Cacoperdo v. Demosthene, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679609\"><a href=\"/opinion/679609/dominick-cacoperdo-v-peter-demosthenes-the-attorney-general-of-the-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 507 (9th Cir.1994) (grounds not raised in habeas petition are not cognizable on appeal), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></span> (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> After Fleming filed his petition for a certificate of probable cause in this court, the President signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (April 24, 1996).  Although Fleming has not raised the issue, we note that we need not decide in this case whether any of the amendments in the Act apply since it would not alter our disposition</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
