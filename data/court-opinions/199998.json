This proceeding is an outgrowth of\n\nthe widely publicized political corruption case brought by the\n\nfederal government against Providence mayor Vincent A. (\"Buddy\")\n\nCianci, Jr., and several codefendants.            During the trial, a daily\n\nnewspaper filed serial mandamus petitions seeking to remediate\n\nperceived violations of First Amendment and common-law rights of\n\naccess to documents, videotapes, and other materials that comprise\n\npart of the court record.            These petitions present, in essence,\n\nthree important questions (some of novel impression).\n\n            The first question pertains to public access to memoranda\n\nof law that counsel are required by local rule to submit in\n\nconnection with motions.         These memoranda contain the substance of\n\na movant's argument or a nonmovant's opposition:              pertinent facts,\n\ncase law, statutory references, and legal reasoning.                As to this\n\nquestion,      we   conclude    that    the   District   of   Rhode    Island's\n\nlongstanding practice of refusing to place these memoranda in the\n\ncase   file,    available      for   public   perusal,   violates     the   First\n\nAmendment. The second question pertains to the manner in which the\n\ndistrict court has handled such memoranda in the Cianci case.                 We\n\nuphold most — though not all — aspects of the praxis employed by\n\nthe district court.         The third question involves the newspaper's\n\nrequest for copies of videotape and audiotape evidence introduced\n\nat the trial.         Given the circumstances, we conclude that the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fdistrict   court's   refusal    to   accede     to   this   request   did   not\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Although the two petitions share a common nucleus of\n\noperative fact, they constitute discrete requests for relief.\n\nAccordingly, we describe each petition separately.\n\n                         A.   The First Petition.\n\n           On April 2, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted Mayor\n\nCianci, along with five other individuals, on a variety of charges.\n\nThe linchpin of the indictment was a RICO conspiracy count that, in\n\neffect, charged the defendants with operating City Hall as a\n\nracketeering enterprise that demanded bribes, sometimes thinly\n\ndisguised as \"campaign contributions,\" as a prerequisite to doing\n\nbusiness with the municipality and its agencies.              The indictment\n\nitself came as no surprise:          some details of the federal probe,\n\ndubbed \"Operation Plunder Dome,\" had surfaced earlier, and a number\n\nof other persons already had been indicted on related charges.\n\n           Both before and after the Cianci indictment, Operation\n\nPlunder Dome received pervasive publicity.             During the grand jury\n\ninvestigation     that    culminated       in   this    indictment,    leaked\n\ninformation proved to be a persistent problem.                  To cite one\n\nexample, a local television station broadcast a videotape that had\n\nbeen presented to the grand jury as evidence.            To cite another, an\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fAssistant United States Attorney (AUSA) played an FBI surveillance\n\ntape for several of his friends.\n\n           The Cianci indictment brought heightened attention to the\n\nscandal.   Determined to ensure the protagonists' right to a fair\n\ntrial, the district court sanctioned the wayward AUSA, appointed a\n\nspecial prosecutor to investigate whether criminal contempt charges\n\nshould be brought against whomever was responsible for the grand\n\njury leaks, and reminded counsel of their obligation to refrain\n\nfrom   publicly    disseminating       information    that   threatened   the\n\nintegrity of the upcoming trial.             See D.R.I. R. 39 (precluding\n\nrelease of information if there exists a \"reasonable likelihood\n\nthat it imposes a serious and imminent threat of interference with\n\na trial or action\"); R.I. R. Prof'l Conduct, R. 3.6 (precluding\n\nextrajudicial statements that have a \"substantial likelihood of\n\nmaterially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding\").\n\n           The capstone of the court's efforts was the issuance, on\n\nMay 15, 2001, of a non-dissemination order.            Citing the \"intense\n\nmedia coverage\" surrounding the Cianci case, the court foresaw \"a\n\nsubstantial risk of prejudicing the parties' right to a fair\n\ntrial.\"     To    diminish      that   risk,   the   court   prohibited   the\n\ndissemination     of,   inter    alia,   any   information    regarding   the\n\ntestimony, character, credibility, or reputation of any witness;\n\nany information presented to the grand jury; and any information\n\nconcerning plea negotiations.            The order (which contained an\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fexception for information \"presented at trial or during the course\n\nof any hearing conducted in open court\") was to remain in effect\n\npending the disposition of all charges against all defendants.\n\n           In the same order, the court instituted a procedure with\n\nrespect   to   the   filing   of   any     documents   that   might    contain\n\nreferences to restricted information. Each such document was to be\n\nfiled under seal, accompanied by a separate descriptive document\n\nthat, inter alia, stated the reasons why the submitted document\n\nshould be sealed.    The court, acting sua sponte or on the motion of\n\nany party, could order any document to be unsealed if it determined\n\nthat, notwithstanding any references to restricted information,\n\ninsufficient    justification      existed    for   keeping   that    document\n\nconfidential.\n\n           On May 23, 2001, the district court issued an order\n\namending this procedure (we henceforth refer to the May 15 order,\n\nas modified by the May 23 order, as the non-dissemination order).\n\nThe May 23 order changed the ground rules in three respects.\n\nFirst, counsel were instructed to refrain from making any reference\n\nto restricted information in motions or oppositions to motions.\n\nSecond, the author of any legal memorandum submitted in connection\n\nwith a motion was directed to file a certification as to whether\n\nthe   memorandum     contained     information      subject   to     the   non-\n\ndissemination order.     Third, the order stated that if the court's\n\nsubsequent review of any particular legal memorandum revealed that\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthe memorandum contained no restricted information, it would be\n\nplaced on file in the clerk's office and made available for public\n\ninspection.     The order made clear, however, that the court would\n\nnot undertake to \"redact or edit any memorandum.\"\n\n             The district court's treatment of legal memoranda in the\n\nCianci case represented a departure from the prevailing practice in\n\nthe District of Rhode Island.         Although the court's local rules\n\nseem to provide for the filing in the clerk's office of legal\n\nmemoranda supporting or opposing motions, see D.R.I. R. 12(a)(1)-\n\n(2), the District of Rhode Island has a longstanding practice —\n\ndating back to the early 1980s — of docketing such memoranda but\n\nnot placing them in the case files maintained by the clerk's\n\noffice.      Instead, they are transmitted directly to the judge to\n\nwhom   the   case   is   assigned   and    kept   in   the   judge's   chambers\n\n(inaccessible to public scrutiny except upon request).             We discuss\n\nthe propriety of this practice infra.\n\n             The Cianci case generated a blizzard of paper, and\n\nnumerous documents were submitted to the court in accordance with\n\nthe procedures established by the non-dissemination order.                 The\n\nstate's major newspaper, THE PROVIDENCE JOURNAL (THE JOURNAL ), chafed\n\nunder this regime.       On February 19, 2002, THE JOURNAL filed a motion\n\nseeking access to 42 previously filed memoranda that it claimed had\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fnot yet been made public.1   In the same motion, THE JOURNAL sought\n\nfurther modifications of the non-dissemination order, asserting\n\nthat the district court's general practice of denying access to\n\nlegal memoranda reversed the presumption of openness applicable to\n\njudicial records.   THE JOURNAL implored the court to deem all such\n\nmemoranda public when filed unless, in a particular instance, a\n\nmotion to seal was docketed and the court, after individualized\n\ninquiry, made specific record findings justifying confidentiality.\n\nTHE JOURNAL also asked the court to consider redaction on a document-\n\nby-document basis as a less restrictive means of balancing the need\n\nfor confidentiality against the public's right to know.2\n\n          Shortly before the start of trial, the district court\n\ndenied virtually all of THE JOURNAL 's requests.   See United States\n\nv. Cianci, Crim. No. 00-083-T, slip op. at 14 (D.R.I. Mar. 15,\n\n2002) (unpublished) [hereinafter \"D. Ct. Op.\"].     After outlining\n\n\n\n     1\n      This was not THE JOURNAL 's first expression of dissatisfaction\nwith the district court's handling of access to documents in the\nCianci case. THE JOURNAL earlier had sought access to an FBI agent's\naffidavit submitted in support of a request for a search warrant.\nBased upon its determination that public disclosure of the\naffidavit's contents prior to trial would prejudice the defendants'\nSixth Amendment rights, the district court denied THE JOURNAL 's\nmotion. United States v. Cianci, 175 F. Supp. 2d 194, 198, 205\n(D.R.I. 2001).\n     2\n       Although the non-dissemination order applied to more than\nlegal memoranda (e.g., it imposed stringent restrictions on\nextrajudicial statements by the parties and their counsel), THE\nJOURNAL has only challenged the order insofar as it pertains to the\ntreatment of legal memoranda. Consequently, we express no opinion\nanent any other feature of the non-dissemination order.\n\n                                -7-\n\fthe traditional treatment of legal memoranda in the District of\n\nRhode   Island,      id.   at   1-4,    the    court    described    the    special\n\nprocedures that it had instituted in the Cianci case and noted that\n\n11 of the 42 memoranda at issue already had been placed on file in\n\nthe clerk's office, id. at 4-5.           Of the remaining 31 memoranda, 17\n\n(related to discovery motions) had been referred to a magistrate\n\njudge; 3 dealt with mundane matters that the court believed were of\n\nno conceivable interest to THE JOURNAL ; and the final 11 could not\n\n\"properly be made part of the public record before trial\" because\n\nthey    referred     to    \"grand   jury      matters    and/or     matters,     the\n\ndissemination of which would prejudice the parties' rights to a\n\nfair trial.\"       Id. at 6-7.\n\n             The   district     court   then    denied    most    aspects   of   THE\n\nJOURNAL's request to modify the non-dissemination order.                The court\n\ncharacterized its treatment of legal memoranda in the Cianci case\n\nas \"perfectly consistent\" with THE JOURNAL 's proposal to make all\n\nlegal memoranda public unless otherwise directed by the court. Id.\n\nat 9. It rejected the suggested reinstitution of formal motions to\n\nseal    on   the   ground    that   the    suggestion      already    had    proven\n\nunworkable.    Id.    Relatedly, the court expressed its unwillingness\n\nto rely exclusively on counsel's representations in determining\n\nwhether to place legal memoranda on file in the clerk's office.\n\nId. at 11-12.      The court reiterated that redaction was infeasible\n\nboth    because    the     forbidden    matters    were    \"almost     invariably\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fdispersed throughout the memoranda and inextricably intertwined\n\nwith the references to applicable legal authority,\" and because the\n\nmechanics of redaction would squander scarce judicial resources.\n\nId.   at   13.         Finally,    the    court     agreed   to    amend    the   non-\n\ndissemination order to furnish a specific, on-the-record finding in\n\nsupport    of    any    subsequent       decision    to   withhold    a    particular\n\nmemorandum.      Id. at 14.\n\n             Trial commenced on March 23, 2002.               Two days later, THE\n\nJOURNAL filed a mandamus petition with this court seeking:                         (1)\n\naccess to legal memoranda previously submitted in the Cianci case\n\nbut not yet made public; (2) a directive requiring all future\n\nmemoranda to be placed on file in the clerk's office on the date of\n\nsubmission; and (3) modification of the non-dissemination order to\n\nrequire redaction when feasible (as a less restrictive alternative\n\nto sealing).\n\n                           B.     The Second Petition.\n\n            The second mandamus petition centers on 71 videotapes and\n\naudiotapes       of    secretly    recorded       conversations      with    various\n\nbureaucrats (including some of the defendants).                       Putting this\n\npetition into perspective requires an understanding of how the\n\nparties presented these videotapes and audiotapes during the Cianci\n\ntrial.\n\n             In preparation for trial, the government transferred the\n\nentire contents of the 71 tapes onto CD-ROMs.                     After loading the\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fCD-ROMs onto the hard drive of a laptop computer, the government\n\nemployed   a   software   program   called   Sanctions     to    excerpt\n\nconversations for playback.   Using this technology, the government\n\nintroduced selected passages from these conversations into evidence\n\nin the course of trial.       As the excerpts were played on the\n\ngovernment's laptop computer, they were simultaneously broadcast\n\nvia the district court's state-of-the-art audiovisual system to\n\nmonitors in both the courtroom and a remote viewing room (the\n\noverflow room).   As a taped excerpt was played, a transcript was\n\nsimultaneously scrolled across the bottom of the screen.\n\n           Before trial, the media sought copies of the videotape\n\nand audiotape evidence. Discussions ensued between representatives\n\nof the press and David DiMarzio, the clerk of court, regarding\n\npossible methods by which the tapes could be copied and distributed\n\nto the media after they had been introduced into evidence.           The\n\nclerk initially suggested that the parties could be required to\n\nsubmit an extra copy of each tape and the associated transcript for\n\ndelivery to the media at an appropriate time.     The district court\n\nvetoed this suggestion.    Next, the media representatives proposed\n\nthat the clerk's office copy the exhibits for the media.        The clerk\n\nrebuffed this proposal on the ground that copying might damage the\n\noriginal tapes.   At that point, the negotiations stalled.\n\n           Shortly after the trial began, THE JOURNAL moved for access\n\nto copies of the videotape and audiotape evidence.       The court held\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fa hearing that focused on the practicalities of complying with that\n\nrequest.    THE JOURNAL argued that other courts, in other criminal\n\ntrials, had provided copies of taped evidence to the media in one\n\nof three ways:   (1) by requiring court staff to copy the tapes; (2)\n\nby   requiring   the   parties   to   submit   duplicates;   or   (3)    by\n\nrerecording the tapes as they were being played to the jury in open\n\ncourt.\n\n            Ruling from the bench, the district court scotched all\n\nthree options.     The court rejected the first based on concerns\n\nexpressed by the clerk.      It rejected the second because it was\n\nunwilling to impose upon the parties the \"significant undertaking\"\n\nof creating and supplying extra copies of the taped evidence.            It\n\nrejected the third option based upon the clerk's representation\n\nthat there was no feasible way to rerecord the tapes as they were\n\nbeing played over the court's evidence presentation system.             In a\n\nwritten addendum, the court delineated an additional reason for its\n\ndecision:\n\n            The recordings being presented are in the form\n            of audio and video tapes that include not only\n            the conversations that have been played for\n            the jury; but, also, additional conversations\n            that have not and may not be admitted into\n            evidence.   Moreover, the Court is informed\n            that the same is true with respect to the CD\n            ROM's being used by counsel. Thus, providing\n            The Providence Journal with recordings of the\n            conversations played for the jury would\n            require both editing and duplication of the\n            tapes being offered in order to create\n            something that does not presently exist.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f          On April 26, 2002, THE JOURNAL filed its second petition\n\nfor a writ of mandamus.        This petition sought to require the\n\ndistrict court to supply the press with copies of all videotape and\n\naudiotape evidence played to the jury during the Cianci trial on a\n\ncontemporaneous basis.   We consolidated THE JOURNAL 's two mandamus\n\npetitions for hearing.   The district judge, through counsel, filed\n\nan opposition to each petition.    We heard oral argument while the\n\nCianci trial was ongoing (the district court sent the Cianci case\n\nto the jury on June 12, 2002).\n\nII.   APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n           There is a threshold question as to whether THE JOURNAL\n\nshould be proceeding by appeal or by mandamus.      Compare, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Ladd (In re Associated Press), 162 F.3d 503, 507\n\n(7th Cir. 1998) (appeal), with, e.g., Oregonian Publ'g Co. v.\n\nUnited States Dist. Ct., 920 F.2d 1462, 1464-65 (9th Cir. 1990)\n\n(mandamus).   In the circumstances of this case, however, all roads\n\nlead to Rome.\n\n           Under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, \"[a] federal\n\ncourt of appeals has the power to treat an attempted appeal from an\n\nunappealable (or possibly unappealable) order as a petition for a\n\nwrit of mandamus.\"   United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 769 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).   On this basis, we exercised mandamus jurisdiction in\n\nUnited States v. Hurley (In re Globe Newspaper Co.), 920 F.2d 88\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).     In that case, a newspaper sought access to\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\frecords relating to a criminal trial.       The district court rejected\n\nboth the newspaper's demand for access and its motion to intervene.\n\nId. at 90.        The newspaper pursued an appeal and simultaneously\n\npetitioned for a writ of mandamus.        Id.   We declined to decide the\n\njurisdictional question, but, rather, granted relief under the\n\naegis of the All Writs Act and dismissed the appeal as moot.         Id.\n\n              The petitions now before us are of the same general\n\ncharacter as the petition in In re Globe Newspaper Co.          Here, as\n\nthere, the petitions pose important questions bearing upon the\n\nconstitutional and common-law rights of public access to judicial\n\nrecords in criminal proceedings. Here, as there, the petitions are\n\nconsonant with the historic use of mandamus as a means to check\n\nostensible judicial usurpations of power.         See In re Pearson, 990\n\nF.2d 653, 656 (1st Cir. 1993).      Because we believe that the issues\n\nraised by THE JOURNAL are worthy candidates for mandamus review, we\n\nexercise our discretion to entertain both petitions under our\n\nmandamus jurisdiction.3\n\nIII.       THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE\n\n               We next discuss the case law concerning rights of access\n\nto judicial records.       We begin with first principles.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      Along with its mandamus petitions, THE JOURNAL prudently filed\na protective appeal. In view of our decision to exercise mandamus\njurisdiction, we will follow the course charted in In re Globe\nNewspaper Co., 920 F.2d at 90, and enter a separate order\ndismissing that appeal as moot.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f            Courts long have recognized \"that public monitoring of\n\nthe judicial system fosters the important values of quality,\n\nhonesty and respect for our legal system.\"         Siedle v. Putnam Inv.,\n\nInc., 147 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).        This recognition has given rise to a\n\npresumption that the public has a common-law right of access to\n\njudicial documents. Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S.\n\n589, 597 (1978).      This presumptive right of access attaches to\n\nthose materials \"which properly come before the court in the course\n\nof an adjudicatory proceeding and which are relevant to that\n\nadjudication.\"      FTC v. Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404,\n\n412-13 (1st Cir. 1987).         It follows, then, that the common-law\n\nright of access extends to \"materials on which a court relies in\n\ndetermining   the   litigants'    substantive     rights.\"     Anderson    v.\n\nCryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n            Apart from the prerogatives attendant to the common-law\n\nright of access to judicial records, the public and the press enjoy\n\na constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings under the\n\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments.          Globe Newspaper Co. v. Super.\n\nCt., 457 U.S. 596, 603-06 (1982); Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.\n\nVirginia,   448   U.S.   555,   575-80   (1980)   (plurality   op.).      The\n\nconstitutional right of access is not limited to the actual trial\n\nitself, but also encompasses most pretrial proceedings. See Press-\n\nEnterprise Co. v. Super Ct., 478 U.S. 1, 11-13 (1986) (Press-\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fEnterprise II); In re Globe Newspaper Co., 729 F.2d 47, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 1984); see also Anderson, 805 F.2d at 11 (collecting cases).\n\nWe have held that this constitutional right — which serves to\n\nensure a \"full understanding\" of criminal proceedings, thereby\n\nplacing the populace in a position \"to serve as an effective check\n\non   the   system\"      —   extends    to    documents       and    kindred      materials\n\nsubmitted    in    connection        with    the        prosecution   and    defense     of\n\ncriminal proceedings.4             Globe Newspaper Co. v. Pokaski, 868 F.2d\n\n497, 502 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n             Although the two rights of access are not coterminous,\n\ncourts have employed much the same type of screen in evaluating\n\ntheir applicability to particular claims. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Soussoudis (In re Wash. Post Co.), 807 F.2d 383, 390 (4th Cir.\n\n1986).     This overlap is understandable because the jurisprudence\n\ndiscussing    the       First      Amendment       right    of    access    to    criminal\n\nproceedings       has       been    derived        in     large    measure       from   the\n\njurisprudence that has shaped the common-law right of access.                           See\n\nAnderson, 805 F.2d at 13.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      This holding comports with case law from our sister circuits.\nE.g., United States v. Biaggi (In re N.Y. Times), 828 F.2d 110, 114\n(2d Cir. 1987); United States v. Soussoudis (In re Wash. Post Co.),\n807 F.2d 383, 389-90 (4th Cir. 1986). We note, however, that the\nSupreme Court has not yet passed upon whether the constitutional\nright of access in criminal proceedings extends to judicial\nrecords.\n\n                                            -15-\n\fIV.     ANALYSIS:    THE FIRST PETITION\n\n             The first mandamus petition attacks both the District of\n\nRhode Island's overall treatment of legal memoranda and the trial\n\ncourt's handling of those memoranda in the Cianci case. We address\n\nthese    points     separately.    First,   however,   we   focus   on   the\n\napplicable standards of review.\n\n                         A.   Standards of Review.\n\n            Despite the common ancestry shared by the two rights of\n\naccess, the standards of review referable to those rights differ.\n\nOn the one hand, the denial of a claimed right of access under the\n\ncommon law engenders review for abuse of discretion.           Id. at 13.\n\nA district court can abuse its discretion by \"ignoring a material\n\nfactor that deserves significant weight, relying on an improper\n\nfactor, or, even if it mulls only the proper mix of factors, by\n\nmaking a serious mistake in judgment.\"         Siedle, 147 F.3d at 10.\n\nSince \"only the most compelling reasons can justify non-disclosure\n\nof judicial records\" that come within the scope of the common-law\n\nright of access, Standard Fin. Mgmt., 830 F.2d at 410 (citation\n\nomitted), this review is more rigorous than garden-variety abuse of\n\ndiscretion review.\n\n             On the other hand, constitutional access claims engender\n\nde novo review.       In re State-Record Co., 917 F.2d 124, 127 (4th\n\nCir. 1990).    In such cases, the presumption in favor of access can\n\nonly be overcome \"by an overriding interest based on findings that\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fclosure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly\n\ntailored to serve that interest.\"         Press-Enterprise Co. v. Super.\n\nCt., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (Press-Enterprise I).                 This last\n\nrequirement adds a new dimension and makes the First Amendment\n\nstandard even more stringent than the common-law standard.              Thus,\n\ncourts have tended to employ the First Amendment standard in\n\nsituations in which both rights of access are implicated. E.g., In\n\nre Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d at 390.\n\n          Against this backdrop, we turn to the legal memoranda\n\nthat parties are required to file in conjunction with motions\n\nsubmitted in the District of Rhode Island. The local rules specify\n\nthat those memoranda must contain the critical elements of the\n\nparties' arguments.     See D.R.I. R. 12(a)(1)-(2).         It follows that\n\nthose memoranda constitute materials on which a court is meant to\n\nrely in determining the parties' substantive rights. In a criminal\n\ncase, therefore, they are subject to both common-law and First\n\nAmendment rights of access.        Accordingly, we review the district\n\ncourt's treatment of them under the First Amendment's heightened\n\nstandard of review.\n\n                   B.   The Traditional Practice.\n\n          The respondent notes, correctly, that legal memoranda in\n\nthe Cianci case have been made available to the public so long as\n\nthey do not contain restricted information.                Building on that\n\nfoundation,   he   argues   that    the    District   of    Rhode    Island's\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\ftraditional method of treating memoranda is not properly before us.\n\nWe do not agree.\n\n          The district court has made clear that its handling of\n\nlegal memoranda in the Cianci case represents an ad hoc exception\n\nto the District of Rhode Island's standard practice.        Absent\n\nmandamus review, the constitutional questions stemming from this\n\nstandard practice — a practice that amounts to a blanket nonfiling\n\npolicy — are likely to recur and to evade effective resolution.\n\nMoreover, an immediate adjudication of the matter will clarify\n\nmatters for judges, litigants, lawyers, and journalists in a wide\n\nrange of cases.\n\n          On suitable occasions, we have employed advisory mandamus\n\nto resolve issues \"which are both novel and of great public\n\nimportance.\"   In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d 1000, 1005 n.4\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).    The considerations enumerated above lead us to\n\nconclude that the blanket nonfiling policy is a suitable candidate\n\nfor advisory mandamus. E.g., Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104,\n\n109-12 (1964); Horn, 29 F.3d at 769-70.\n\n          Having concluded that we have an institutional interest\n\nin oversight of the District of Rhode Island's standard practice\n\nvis-à-vis the handling of legal memoranda, we turn to the validity\n\nof that practice.   Motions and objections filed in the District of\n\nRhode Island typically become part of the case file (and, thus,\n\navailable for public inspection) at the moment they are filed in\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fthe clerk's office.   Legal memoranda submitted in conjunction with\n\nsuch motions are treated differently:      those memoranda do not\n\nbecome part of the case file, but, rather, go directly to the judge\n\nto whom the case is assigned.   This leaves the question of access\n\nsolely in the discretion of the trial judge and places on persons\n\ndesiring access the onus of initiating action.    Whether viewed as\n\na restriction on access or as a practical inconvenience, this\n\nprotocol reverses the constitutional presumption of public access\n\nto documents submitted in conjunction with criminal proceedings.\n\nCf. Pokaski, 868 F.2d at 507 (indicating that a statute that\n\nrestricts public access to judicial records in criminal cases by\n\n\"plac[ing] on the public the burden of overcoming inertia\" is\n\nimpermissible).\n\n          The respondent attempts to justify the blanket nonfiling\n\npolicy on five bases.   First, the legal memoranda are directed to\n\nthe judge.   Second, and relatedly, routing memoranda directly to\n\nthe judge's chambers lessens the need for the judge to requisition\n\nthe entire case file. Third, incorporating memoranda into the case\n\nfiles maintained in the clerk's office would \"needlessly burden\n\n. . . already taxed storage facilities.\"         Fourth, a blanket\n\nnonfiling policy serves to discourage overzealous counsel from\n\nattempting to gain an \"unfair tactical advantage\" by improperly\n\ninfluencing the public. Finally, memoranda submitted in connection\n\nwith criminal proceedings might disclose grand jury testimony or\n\n\n                                -19-\n\frefer to other matters prejudicial to a defendant's right to a fair\n\ntrial.    None of these reasons justify the constitutional intrusion\n\nthat results from the District of Rhode Island's standard practice\n\nof treating legal memoranda as presumptively nonpublic.\n\n             The respondent's first asserted justification proves too\n\nmuch.     Although legal memoranda are directed to the judge, so are\n\nvirtually all the other papers filed in the case (including motions\n\nand     objections).      The   second     asserted      justification   is    no\n\njustification at all: requiring legal memoranda to be filed in the\n\nclerk's office would not mean that the judge would have to haul the\n\nentire case file into chambers whenever he or she wished to check\n\na particular point.       Copying is a routine exercise in most clerks'\n\noffices, and at any rate the district court's local rules require\n\ncounsel to file memoranda in duplicate.              See D.R.I. R. 12(d).    That\n\nwould permit placing one copy in the case file and routing the\n\nother directly to the judge.\n\n             Nor   does   the   third    asserted     justification   withstand\n\nscrutiny.     While storage limitations may well have prompted the\n\nadoption of the blanket nonfiling policy two decades ago, the\n\nrecently-completed        renovation     of    the    Federal   Courthouse     in\n\nProvidence, coupled with the court's acquisition of the adjacent\n\nPastore Building, have eliminated any intractable problem in that\n\nregard.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\f             We are equally unpersuaded that the court's policy of\n\nkeeping all legal memoranda hidden from public view is warranted\n\nbased upon hypothetical concerns about overzealous counsel behaving\n\nbadly.    Judges deal every day with the need to ensure that lawyers\n\nplay fair and square, and we are unwilling to assume, without hard\n\nevidence, that lawyers who practice in the District of Rhode Island\n\nare so unruly that ordinary antidotes to fractiousness (e.g.,\n\nsanctions, contempt, loss of the right to practice) will prove\n\nimpuissant.\n\n             As to the district court's fifth concern, we acknowledge\n\nthat     specific   cases   may    pose    greater     risks   of    prejudicial\n\ndisclosures (and, thus, may warrant special treatment).                But there\n\nis no need to discard the baby with the bath water.                   Safeguards\n\nagainst prejudice can be implemented on a case-specific basis.\n\nWhere a particularized need for restricting public access to legal\n\nmemoranda exists, that need can be addressed by the tailoring of\n\nappropriate relief.         As contrasted with the District of Rhode\n\nIsland's existing practice of treating all legal memoranda as\n\npresumptively       nonpublic,    this    would   be    a   considerably    less\n\nrestrictive, but equally effective, means for dealing with the\n\nspecter of potential prejudice.           Cf. Pokaski, 868 F.2d at 506-07\n\n(rejecting    blanket    sealing    rule    on    ground    that    case-by-case\n\nevaluation of defendants' sealing requests represented a viable\n\nless restrictive means).\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f           We hold, therefore, that the District of Rhode Island's\n\nblanket nonfiling policy — its standard practice of refusing to\n\nplace memoranda submitted in conjunction with motions on file in\n\nthe clerk's office when tendered — violates the First Amendment.5\n\n                  C.   The Procedure Employed Here.\n\n           In the Cianci case, the trial court deviated from the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy.            Thus, its\n\nmethodology invites a separate analysis.\n\n           The constitutional right of public access is a qualified\n\nright that may be outweighed by competing interests in a given\n\ncase.     Press-Enterprise I, 464 U.S. at 511 n.10; In re Globe\n\nNewspaper Co., 729 F.2d at 52.         Certainly, in a case in which\n\npublic attention is quite high, a court deliberating about whether\n\nto   restrict   broadly   public   access   to   materials   submitted   in\n\nconnection with criminal proceedings ordinarily ought to afford\n\ninterested parties an opportunity to be heard on the question of\n\nimpoundment. See, e.g., United States v. Antar, 38 F.3d 1348, 1361\n\nn.18 (3d Cir. 1994).       The court would normally be expected to\n\n\n\n      5\n      Although the Supreme Court has not established whether the\nconstitutional right of access attaches to civil cases in general,\nthe common-law right of access extends to judicial records in civil\nproceedings. Standard Fin. Mgmt., 830 F.2d at 408 & n.4. As said,\nthat right encompasses legal memoranda.       Because none of the\nrespondent's rationales for rendering legal memoranda presumptively\nnonpublic rise to the level of a compelling reason sufficient to\njustify the nondisclosure of those documents, our invalidation of\nthe District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy vis-à-vis\nlegal memoranda applies in civil as well as criminal proceedings.\n\n                                   -22-\n\fidentify and balance the competing interests involved, and weigh\n\nreasonable         alternatives        to   sealing,       making      findings      where\n\nnecessary.        In re State-Record Co., 917 F.2d at 127-29; In re Wash.\n\nPost Co., 807 F.2d at 391.\n\n             Here, THE JOURNAL has not complained about a lack of\n\nnotice, so we turn to the task of identifying and balancing the\n\ncompeting         interests    involved.           The    district        court    clearly\n\nregistered its concern that the unrestrained disclosure of certain\n\ntypes   of    information           about   the    Cianci       case   would      create    a\n\nsubstantial risk of prejudicing the parties' right to a fair trial.\n\nThis disquietude impelled the court to implement, and then fine-\n\ntune, the non-dissemination order.                  An accused's Sixth Amendment\n\nright to a fair trial plainly rises to the level of a compelling\n\ninterest.         See Press-Enterprise I, 464 U.S. at 508.                     When that\n\nright collides            head-on    with   the    public's      right    of   access      to\n\njudicial      records,        the     defendant's        fair     trial    right     takes\n\nprecedence.        In re Globe Newspaper Co., 729 F.2d at 53.\n\n             That does not mean, however, that the public's (and the\n\nmedia's) right to know can be frustrated by the mere invocation of\n\na threat to the accused's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n\nA court faced with an impending collision between these rights\n\nmust, on a case-specific basis, construct a balance.                                Press-\n\nEnterprise I, 464 U.S. at 510-11 & n.10.                          That weighing must\n\nproceed      on     the     assumption      that    restrictions          on   access      to\n\n\n                                            -23-\n\fpresumptively public judicial documents should be imposed only if\n\na substantial likelihood exists that the accused's right to a fair\n\ntrial will otherwise be prejudiced.       Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S.\n\nat 14.    We caution that this inquiry requires specific findings;\n\nthe First Amendment right of public access is too precious to be\n\nforeclosed by conclusory assertions or unsupported speculation.\n\nUnited States v. Kirk (In re Memphis Publ'g Co.), 887 F.2d 646,\n\n648-49 (6th Cir. 1989); In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d at 392-93 &\n\nn.9; United States v. Martin, 746 F.2d 964, 972 (3d Cir. 1984).\n\n           Political corruption cases tend to attract widespread\n\nmedia attention, and the Cianci case is a paradigmatic example.\n\nHere,    moreover,   the    district   court   cited   book   and   verse,\n\ncataloguing specific incidents that fueled its concerns that the\n\ndefendants' ability to receive a fair trial was in danger of being\n\nsubstantively compromised by unrestrained disclosures.          The court\n\nalluded specifically to leaks of information in violation of Rule\n\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and misbehavior by\n\nthe lead prosecutor.       In view of the notoriety of the case and the\n\nincidents recounted by the district court, we are convinced that\n\nthe court's perception of a threat to the defendants' fair trial\n\nrights was objectively reasonable.        See Gannett Co. v. DePasquale,\n\n443 U.S. 368, 392-93 (1979) (concluding that the trial court\n\nproperly appraised legitimate concerns that open proceeding posed\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\freasonable probability of prejudice to defendants' fair trial\n\nrights).\n\n           Having found that the defendants' fair trial rights\n\nrepresent a compelling interest, we next must decide whether the\n\nnon-dissemination order is drawn as narrowly as practicable.       The\n\nthreshold question is whether a trial court, in a particular case,\n\ncan adopt a procedure that reverses the presumption of public\n\naccess and automatically seals all subsequent filings until the\n\njudge determines that a specific document poses no undue risk to\n\nthe defendant's fair trial rights.\n\n           THE JOURNAL argues that the decision in Associated Press\n\nv. United States Dist. Ct., 705 F.2d 1143 (9th Cir. 1983), requires\n\nthat this question be answered in the negative.    In that case, the\n\ndistrict court, responding to extensive press coverage of a high-\n\nprofile criminal matter, issued a sua sponte order directing the\n\nparties to submit all future filings under seal in order to permit\n\nthe court \"to initially review them and to make a determination\n\nwith regard to disclosure.\"      Id. at 1144.      The trial court\n\nsubsequently imposed a 48-hour time limit within which it would\n\nrule upon the need for a given filing to remain sealed.      Id. at\n\n1145.   The Ninth Circuit nonetheless struck down the procedure and\n\ndirected the district court to vacate its order.    Id. at 1147.\n\n           In our view, Associated Press is a horse of a different\n\nhue.    There, the court of appeals concluded that the trial court\n\n\n                                -25-\n\fhad failed to make specific findings showing that \"access to\n\npretrial   documents    will    create    a    substantial   probability   of\n\nirreparable damage to defendants' fair trial rights.\" Id. at 1146.\n\nThe presence of such findings here readily distinguishes this case.\n\n           We find more helpful the opinion in United States v.\n\nMcVeigh,   119   F.3d   806    (10th    Cir.   1997).    There,   the   court\n\nacknowledged that a high-profile criminal case may \"impose[] unique\n\ndemands on the trial court, and require[] the court to establish\n\nprocedures for dealing effectively, efficiently and fairly with\n\nrecurring issues such as whether documents should be placed under\n\nseal or redacted.\"      Id. at 813.       This is exactly what transpired\n\nhere.   In response to a cognizable threat to the defendants' Sixth\n\nAmendment rights, the district court adopted a practical procedure\n\nthat enabled it effectively and efficiently to safeguard those\n\nrights. Nothing in the case law prevents a court from establishing\n\nthis sort of prophylaxis.         And given the circumstances of this\n\ncase, the district court's implementation of a general procedure to\n\nseal all memoranda temporarily appears narrowly tailored.\n\n           Turning our attention to the specifics of the non-\n\ndissemination order, we hold that the district court's insistence\n\non reviewing each memorandum before deciding whether it should\n\nremain under seal did not constitute reversible error. Although we\n\nquestion the court's apparent reluctance to rely on counsel to\n\nseparate wheat from chaff in accordance with the non-dissemination\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\forder — experience teaches that most lawyers will cooperate with\n\nthe court and, in all events, will be loath to defy a court order\n\n— nothing precludes the district court from assuming that burden.\n\n           This does not mean that we regard the non-dissemination\n\norder as a textbook model.     We have four specific concerns.       First,\n\nwhere, as here, a court undertakes to screen documents before they\n\nare placed in the case file, the procedure should incorporate a\n\nspecific timetable obligating the court to perform its self-imposed\n\nscreening responsibilities promptly and to render a timely decision\n\nas to whether a particular document is fit for public disclosure.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the court below decided to refrain from\n\nreviewing each individual memorandum to decide whether it could be\n\nmade available to the public until after the time had expired for\n\nthe   submission   of    any    possible      reply   memorandum.         This\n\nunnecessarily prolongs the process.            Each individual memorandum\n\neither contains restricted information (in which case it is subject\n\nto redaction or sealing) or it does not (in which case it does not\n\npose a threat to the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights).            Third,\n\nthe order contains no provision as to whether the court intends to\n\nunseal retained memoranda at some point after the trial has ended\n\n(and if so, when).\n\n           Finally, we think that the district court's refusal to\n\nconsider    redaction    on     a      document-by-document       basis     is\n\ninsupportable.       Courts    have    an    obligation   to   consider    all\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\freasonable alternatives to foreclosing the constitutional right of\n\naccess.    In re Globe Newspaper Co., 729 F.2d at 56.                     Redaction\n\nconstitutes a time-tested means of minimizing any intrusion on that\n\nright.     See United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.\n\n1995) (stating \"that it is proper for a district court, after\n\nweighing    competing   interests,      to   edit    and    redact    a    judicial\n\ndocument in order to allow access to appropriate portions of the\n\ndocument\"); see also United States v. Biaggi (In re N.Y. Times),\n\n828 F.2d 110, 116 (2d Cir. 1987) (rejecting \"wholesale sealing\" of\n\npapers partly because \"limited redaction [might] be appropriate\").\n\n            Here,   moreover,    our    ability      to    assess    whether    the\n\ndistrict court was justified in refusing to redact the 11 documents\n\nthat remain sealed is hampered by a lack of specific findings.                  See\n\nIn re Globe Newspaper Co., 729 F.2d at 56 (requiring a trial court\n\nthat rejects alternatives to sealing to make specific findings to\n\nfacilitate appellate review).          The court did say, generally, that\n\n\"in those rare cases where counsel find it necessary to refer to\n\ngrand jury matters or other matters not properly disclosable, those\n\nreferences are almost invariably dispersed throughout the memoranda\n\nand inextricably intertwined with the references to applicable\n\nlegal authority.\"       D. Ct. Op. at 13.           But the First Amendment\n\nrequires    consideration   of   the    feasibility        of   redaction      on   a\n\ndocument-by-document        basis,       and        the     court's        blanket\n\ncharacterization falls well short of this benchmark.\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\f          Having pointed out these defects in the non-dissemination\n\norder, we leave the matter of correction to the district court.\n\nConsistent    with   the   core   purpose   of   advisory   mandamus,   the\n\nprincipal value of our rulings is in terms of future cases.             In\n\nrespect to the Cianci case itself, the court is at the end of a\n\nlengthy trial; once the dust has settled, we are confident that the\n\ndistrict court will set a reasonable timetable for determining\n\nwhether previously submitted memoranda are to be placed on file in\n\nthe clerk's office (with or without redaction); and, as to any\n\nmemorandum withheld from filing, will enter specific findings as to\n\nthe need for that restriction and the impracticality of redaction\n\nas an alternative to sealing.       Within a reasonable time after the\n\nCianci case and all related proceedings have ended — there is a\n\n\"severed\" defendant yet to be tried — we anticipate that the\n\ndistrict court will consider the release of all documents and other\n\nmaterials then remaining under seal.         Should the district court\n\nfail to act in a timely manner to effectuate the principles\n\nendorsed in this opinion — a contingency that we doubt will occur\n\n— THE JOURNAL is free to petition for ancillary relief.\n\nV.   ANALYSIS:    THE SECOND PETITION\n\n             We next grapple with THE JOURNAL 's request for copies of\n\nthe videotapes and audiotapes played at trial. In Cox Broadcasting\n\nCorp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 494-97 (1975), the Supreme Court\n\nconcluded that the media has a First Amendment right to publish\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\finformation contained in court records that are open to public\n\ninspection.     A few years later, however, the Court rejected the\n\nargument that the First Amendment right of access allowed the media\n\nto obtain copies of tapes that had been entered into evidence at a\n\ncriminal   trial.      Warner    Communications,      435   U.S.   at   608-10.\n\nElaborating   on    this   point,   the    Justices    explained    that   the\n\nconstitutional right to attend criminal trials morphed into a right\n\nto attend the trial sessions at which the tapes were played and to\n\nreport upon what was seen and heard in the courtroom, but did not\n\nconfer the right to replicate evidentiary materials in the custody\n\nof the court.      Id. at 609.\n\n           Warner Communications is directly applicable here. As in\n\nthat case, the district court has not restricted media access to,\n\nor the publication of, any information in the public domain.\n\nIndeed, the district court has gone to great lengths to facilitate\n\naccess to the trial proceedings by, for example, reserving seats in\n\nthe courtroom for members of the press and providing an overflow\n\nroom for remote viewing.         By affording interested members of the\n\nmedia ample opportunity to see and hear the tapes as they are\n\nplayed for the jury, the court has fulfilled its pertinent First\n\nAmendment obligations. See United States v. Beckham, 789 F.2d 401,\n\n407 (6th Cir. 1986).\n\n           The demise of THE JOURNAL 's First Amendment claim does not\n\nend the matter.     The question remains whether the common-law right\n\n\n                                    -30-\n\fto inspect and copy judicial documents affords a basis for relief.\n\nAs said, this right of access extends to \"materials on which a\n\ncourt relies in determining the litigants' substantive rights.\"\n\nAnderson, 805 F.2d at 13. Thus, videotapes and audiotapes on which\n\na court relies in the determination of substantive rights are\n\nwithin its reach.    See United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d 143, 151-\n\n53 (2d Cir. 2001).    Because the videotapes and audiotapes that THE\n\nJOURNAL seeks to copy have been admitted into evidence, they fall\n\ninto this category.\n\n          Viewed in this light, the question reduces to whether the\n\ncommon-law right of access is fulfilled by permitting the press and\n\nthe public to see and hear such tapes, but not to copy them.      To\n\nanswer this question, THE JOURNAL cites a plethora of instances in\n\nwhich courts have allowed media outlets to obtain copies of tapes\n\nused in judicial proceedings.    E.g., id. at 155-56; United States\n\nv. Myers (In re Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.), 635 F.2d 945,\n\n952-54 (2d Cir. 1980).    But this compendium only serves to prove\n\nthat a trial court may allow the media to copy tapes that have been\n\nadmitted into evidence; none of the constituent cases stands for\n\nthe much different proposition that a trial court must afford such\n\naccess.\n\n          Moreover, this case offers a unique twist.      Here, the\n\ngovernment has not merely played individual tapes, but, rather, has\n\nused cutting-edge technology (the Sanctions software) to play for\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\fthe jury medleys of selected excerpts from the universe of taped\n\nmaterial stored on its laptop computer.        As a result, there is no\n\nelectronic medium — no tape or CD-ROM — currently in existence that\n\ncontains the precise medleys of taped excerpts that have been\n\nplayed in open court.      Consequently, we must decide whether the\n\ncommon-law right of access compels a court to create (or order the\n\ncreation of) a new medium that contains only taped excerpts that\n\nhave been played in open court.           This is a question of first\n\nimpression at the appellate level.\n\n            Historically, the common-law right of access permitted\n\nthe public to copy the contents of written documents.              In re\n\nApplication of Nat'l Broad. Co., 635 F.2d at 950.          Over time, the\n\nright has been extended to accommodate technological advancements\n\nin document reproduction such as photography, photocopying, and the\n\nreplication    of   videotapes   and   audiotapes.   Id.      Invariably,\n\nhowever, these accommodations have covered materials that are \"in\n\na form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.\"         Id. at\n\n952.\n\n            When, as now, the media seeks access to materials that do\n\nnot exist in readily reproducible form, a new variable enters the\n\nequation.     We are reluctant to hold that the common-law right of\n\naccess necessarily compels the creation (and, thus, the copying) of\n\nsuch materials.      We prefer instead to leave this decision, like\n\nmany other decisions as to how best to effectuate the common-law\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fright of access, to the informed discretion of the trial court, so\n\nthat it may be exercised with due regard for the idiosyncratic\n\nfacts    and    circumstances    of     a     specific   case.         See   Warner\n\nCommunications, 435 U.S. at 599; Anderson, 805 F.2d at 13.                     This\n\napproach seems especially appropriate here because the task of\n\nassessing whether the creation of an excerpt-only recording entails\n\nmere    reproduction    as   opposed    to     extensive     editing    demands   a\n\nparticularized, fact-intensive inquiry.\n\n            This brings us to the ruling below.              The district court\n\ndenied THE JOURNAL 's motion, holding that the common-law right of\n\naccess did not mandate the creation of something not already in\n\nexistence (i.e., a tape or CD-ROM containing only those excerpts\n\nplayed in open court) and finding replication infeasible.                    In this\n\nregard, the court made a number of specific findings highlighting\n\ndifficulties inherent in THE JOURNAL 's proposals for physical access\n\nto the taped excerpts.          The court concluded, for example, that\n\nediting the source material to create a tape or CD-ROM containing\n\nonly those excerpts played at trial was a far more daunting task\n\nthan merely duplicating existing source materials.               The court also\n\nfound    that   the   editing   required       to   create    tapes    or    CD-ROMs\n\ncontaining only the hundreds of taped conversations being played in\n\nopen court would impose an appreciable burden on the court's staff,\n\nthe parties, or both.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\f            We decline THE JOURNAL 's invitation to second-guess these\n\nfindings.     In the first place, the parties' representations as to\n\nhow   the   software   operates   and   how   difficult   it   would   be    to\n\nreproduce the evidence seen and heard by the jurors are sharply\n\nconflicting.     As a result, the record before us is hopelessly\n\nimprecise — and the Sanctions software package is not part of it.\n\nIn the second place, the fact that the public and the press have\n\nhad ample opportunity to see and hear the evidentiary tapes when\n\nthose tapes were played in open court during trial takes much of\n\nthe sting out of the district court's decision.                Given these\n\nconsiderations, we cannot say that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying THE JOURNAL 's request to compel the creation\n\nand production of excerpt-only tapes or CD-ROMs mimicking the\n\nmaterials actually played to the jury.6         Cf. Valley Broad. Co. v.\n\nUnited States Dist. Ct., 798 F.2d 1289, 1295 & n.8 (9th Cir. 1986)\n\n(explaining    that    substantial   administrative   burdens    alone      may\n\njustify denial of access).\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      We understand that written transcripts of the tapes have been\nmarked as exhibits for identification in the Cianci trial.        At\nfirst blush, it would seem that providing the media with copies of\nthese transcripts might represent a relatively straightforward\nmeans of furthering access without imposing any significant burden\nupon the district court or the litigants. THE JOURNAL , however, did\nnot raise the matter of the transcripts in either of its mandamus\npetitions, and, therefore, we decline to order this relief. Cf.\nPratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"It is\nfirmly settled in this circuit that arguments not advanced and\ndeveloped in an appellant's brief are deemed waived.\").\n\n                                     -34-\n\f          THE JOURNAL has a fallback position.              It argues that the\n\nmedleys of excerpts can be rerecorded as they are played in open\n\ncourt.   The district court rejected this proposal based upon the\n\nclerk of court's representation that it was infeasible to tap into\n\nthe audio/video feed to the broadcast monitors to rerecord the\n\nmaterials as they were being played in open court.                  The clerk\n\nexplained that consultations with the court's technical staff and\n\nrepresentatives of the vendor that had installed the courtroom\n\npresentation    system     had   not   yielded    a   practicable   and   cost-\n\neffective method of rerecording the audio/video transmission to the\n\noverflow room.    The district court accepted this representation.\n\n          THE    JOURNAL    disputes     the     accuracy    of   the   clerk's\n\nconclusion.      Its position rests on a supplementary affidavit\n\nsubmitted on the eve of oral argument in this court.                       That\n\naffidavit suggests the existence of what THE JOURNAL describes as a\n\ntechnologically feasible method of rerecording the audio and video\n\nexcerpts as they are played in open court.            We decline to consider\n\nthis belated proffer.       See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not\n\npresented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it\n\nin the court of appeals.\").        THE JOURNAL is, of course, free to ask\n\nthe district court to evaluate this new proposal.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\fVI.   CONCLUSION\n\n           A high-profile, multi-defendant political corruption case\n\nis bound to test the mettle of the most experienced trial judge.\n\nWe admire the manner in which Chief Judge Torres has responded to\n\nthat challenge.     Although we, with a luxury of time that district\n\njudges   rarely    enjoy,   have   concluded   that   the   court's   non-\n\ndissemination order must be modified in certain respects, that\n\nconclusion in no way detracts from our overall assessment of the\n\ndistrict court's exemplary performance.\n\n           We need go no further.      To recapitulate, we strike down\n\nthe District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy for the\n\nhandling of legal memoranda.       We uphold the district court's non-\n\ndissemination order, but direct the court, should it enter such\n\norders in future cases, to include certain specified safeguards.\n\nAs to the Cianci case itself, we leave the specifics of corrective\n\naction to the district court, consistent with the teachings of this\n\nopinion.   Finally, we deem the district court's refusal to provide\n\nTHE JOURNAL with copies of videotapes and audiotapes an appropriate\n\nexercise   of      the   court's   discretion,   given      the   peculiar\n\ncircumstances of this case.\n\n\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\f",

(\"Buddy\") Cianci, Jr., and several codefendants. During the trial, a daily newspaper filed serial mandamus petitions seeking to remediate perceived violations of First Amendment and common-law rights of access to documents, videotapes, and other materials that comprise part of the court record. These petitions present, in essence, three important questions (some of novel impression).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question pertains to public access to memoranda of law that counsel are required by local rule to submit in connection with motions. These memoranda contain the substance of a movant's argument or a nonmovant's opposition: pertinent facts, case law, statutory references, and legal reasoning. As to this question, we conclude that the District of Rhode Island's longstanding practice of refusing to place these memoranda in the case file, available for public perusal, violates the First Amendment. The second question pertains to the manner in which the district court has handled such memoranda in the Cianci case. We uphold most &#8212; though not all &#8212; aspects of the praxis employed by the district court. The third question involves the newspaper's request for copies of videotape and audiotape evidence introduced at the trial. Given the circumstances, we conclude that the district court's refusal to accede to this request did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the two petitions share a common nucleus of operative fact, they constitute discrete requests for relief. Accordingly, we describe each petition separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The First Petition.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 2, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted Mayor Cianci, along with five other individuals, on a variety of charges. The linchpin of the indictment was a RICO conspiracy count that, in effect, charged the defendants with operating City Hall as a racketeering enterprise that demanded bribes, sometimes thinly disguised as \"campaign contributions,\" as a prerequisite to doing business with the municipality and its agencies. The indictment itself came as no surprise: some details of the federal probe, dubbed \"Operation Plunder Dome,\" had surfaced earlier, and a number of other persons already had been indicted on related charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both before and after the Cianci indictment, Operation Plunder Dome received pervasive publicity. During the grand jury investigation that culminated in this indictment, leaked information proved to be a persistent problem. To cite one example, a local television station broadcast a videotape that had been presented to the grand jury as evidence. To cite another, an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) played an FBI surveillance tape for several of his friends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cianci indictment brought heightened attention to the scandal. Determined to ensure the protagonists' right to a fair trial, the district court sanctioned the wayward AUSA, appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether criminal contempt charges should be brought against whomever was responsible for the grand jury leaks, and reminded counsel of their obligation to refrain from publicly disseminating information that threatened the integrity of the upcoming trial. See D.R.I. R. 39 (precluding release of information if there exists a \"reasonable likelihood that it imposes a serious and imminent threat of interference with a trial or action\"); R.I. R. Prof'l Conduct, R. 3.6 (precluding extrajudicial statements that have a \"substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The capstone of the court's efforts was the issuance, on May 15, 2001, of a non-dissemination order. Citing the \"intense media coverage\" surrounding the Cianci case, the court foresaw \"a substantial risk of prejudicing the parties' right to a fair trial.\" To diminish that risk, the court prohibited the dissemination of, inter alia, any information regarding the testimony, character, credibility, or reputation of any witness; any information presented to the grand jury; and any information concerning plea negotiations. The order (which contained an exception for information \"presented at trial or during the course of any hearing conducted in open court\") was to remain in effect pending the disposition of all charges against all defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same order, the court instituted a procedure with respect to the filing of any documents that might contain references to restricted information. Each such document was to be filed under seal, accompanied by a separate descriptive document that, inter alia, stated the reasons why the submitted document should be sealed. The court, acting sua sponte or on the motion of any party, could order any document to be unsealed if it determined that, notwithstanding any references to restricted information, insufficient justification existed for keeping that document confidential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2001, the district court issued an order amending this procedure (we henceforth refer to the May 15 order, as modified by the May 23 order, as the non-dissemination order). The May 23 order changed the ground rules in three respects. First, counsel were instructed to refrain from making any reference to restricted information in motions or oppositions to motions. Second, the author of any legal memorandum submitted in connection with a motion was directed to file a certification as to whether the memorandum contained information subject to the non-dissemination order. Third, the order stated that if the court's subsequent review of any particular legal memorandum revealed that the memorandum contained no restricted information, it would be placed on file in the clerk's office and made available for public inspection. The order made clear, however, that the court would not undertake to \"redact or edit any memorandum.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's treatment of legal memoranda in the Cianci case represented a departure from the prevailing practice in the District of Rhode Island. Although the court's local rules seem to provide for the filing in the clerk's office of legal memoranda supporting or opposing motions, <i>see</i> D.R.I. R. 12(a)(1)-(2), the District of Rhode Island has a longstanding practice &#8212; dating back to the early 1980s &#8212; of docketing such memoranda but not placing them in the case files maintained by the clerk's office. Instead, they are transmitted directly to the judge to whom the case is assigned and kept in the judge's chambers (inaccessible to public scrutiny except upon request). We discuss the propriety of this practice <i>infra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cianci case generated a blizzard of paper, and numerous documents were submitted to the court in accordance with the procedures established by the non-dissemination order. The state's major newspaper, THE PROVIDENCE JOURNAL (THE JOURNAL), chafed under this regime. On February 19, 2002, THE JOURNAL filed a motion seeking access to 42 previously filed memoranda that it claimed had not yet been made public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In the same motion, THE JOURNAL sought further modifications of the non-dissemination order, asserting that the district court's general practice of denying access to legal memoranda reversed the presumption of openness applicable to judicial records. THE JOURNAL implored the court to deem all such memoranda public when filed unless, in a particular instance, a motion to seal was docketed and the court, after individualized inquiry, made specific record findings justifying confidentiality. THE JOURNAL also asked the court to consider redaction on a document-by-document basis as a less restrictive means of balancing the need for confidentiality against the public's right to know.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the start of trial, the district court denied virtually all of THE JOURNAL'S requests. <i>See United States v. Cianci,</i> Crim. No. 00-083-T, slip op. at 14 (D.R.I. Mar. 15, 2002) (unpublished) [hereinafter \"D. Ct. Op.\"]. After outlining the traditional treatment of legal memoranda in the District of Rhode Island, <i>id.</i> at 1-4, the court described the special procedures that it had instituted in the Cianci case and noted that 11 of the 42 memoranda at issue already had been placed on file in the clerk's office, <i>id.</i> at 4-5. Of the remaining 31 memoranda, 17 (related to discovery motions) had been referred to a magistrate judge; 3 dealt with mundane matters that the court believed were of no conceivable interest to THE JOURNAL; and the final 11 could not \"properly be made part of the public record before trial\" because they referred to \"grand jury matters and/or matters, the dissemination of which would prejudice the parties' rights to a fair trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6-7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then denied most aspects of THE JOURNAL'S request to modify the non-dissemination order. The court characterized its treatment of legal memoranda in the Cianci case as \"perfectly consistent\" with THE JOURNAL'S proposal to make all legal memoranda public unless otherwise directed by the court. <i>Id.</i> at 9. It rejected the suggested reinstitution of formal motions to seal on the ground that the suggestion already had proven unworkable. <i>Id.</i> Relatedly, the court expressed its unwillingness to rely exclusively on counsel's representations in determining whether to place legal memoranda on file in the clerk's office. <i>Id.</i> at 11-12. The court reiterated that redaction was infeasible both because the forbidden matters were \"almost invariably dispersed throughout the memoranda and inextricably intertwined with the references to applicable legal authority,\" and because the mechanics of redaction would squander scarce judicial resources. <i>Id.</i> at 13. Finally, the court agreed to amend the non-dissemination order to furnish a specific, on-the-record finding in support of any subsequent decision to withhold a particular memorandum. <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial commenced on April 23, 2002. Two days later, THE JOURNAL filed a mandamus petition with this court seeking: (1) access to legal memoranda previously submitted in the Cianci case but not yet made public; (2) a directive requiring all future memoranda to be placed on file in the clerk's office on the date of submission; and (3) modification of the non-dissemination order to require redaction when feasible (as a less restrictive alternative to sealing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Second Petition.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second mandamus petition centers on 71 videotapes and audiotapes of secretly recorded conversations with various bureaucrats (including some of the defendants). Putting this petition into perspective requires an understanding of how the parties presented these videotapes and audiotapes during the Cianci trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preparation for trial, the government transferred the entire contents of the 71 tapes onto CD-ROMs. After loading the CD-ROMs onto the hard drive of a laptop computer, the government employed a software program called Sanctions to excerpt conversations for playback. Using this technology, the government introduced selected passages from these conversations into evidence in the course of trial. As the excerpts were played on the government's laptop computer, they were simultaneously broadcast via the district court's state-of-the-art audiovisual system to monitors in both the courtroom and a remote viewing room (the overflow room). As a taped excerpt was played, a transcript was simultaneously scrolled across the bottom of the screen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, the media sought copies of the videotape and audiotape evidence. Discussions ensued between representatives of the press and David DiMarzio, the clerk of court, regarding possible methods by which the tapes could be copied and distributed to the media after they had been introduced into evidence. The clerk initially suggested that the parties could be required to submit an extra copy of each tape and the associated transcript for delivery to the media at an appropriate time. The district court vetoed this suggestion. Next, the media representatives proposed that the clerk's office copy the exhibits for the media. The clerk rebuffed this proposal on the ground that copying might damage the original tapes. At that point, the negotiations stalled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the trial began, THE JOURNAL moved for access to copies of the videotape and audiotape evidence. The court held a hearing that focused on the practicalities of complying with that request. THE JOURNAL argued that other courts, in other criminal trials, had provided copies of taped evidence to the media in one of three ways: (1) by requiring court staff to copy the tapes; (2) by requiring the parties to submit duplicates; or (3) by rerecording the tapes as they were being played to the jury in open court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruling from the bench, the district court scotched all three options. The court rejected the first based on concerns expressed by the clerk. It rejected the second because it was unwilling to impose upon the parties the \"significant undertaking\" of creating and supplying extra copies of the taped evidence. It rejected the third option based upon the clerk's representation that there was no feasible way to rerecord the tapes as they were being played over the court's evidence presentation system. In a written addendum, the court delineated an additional reason for its decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recordings being presented are in the form of audio and video tapes that include not only the conversations that have been played for the jury; but, also, additional conversations that have not and may not be admitted into evidence. Moreover, the Court is informed that the same is true with respect to the C.D. ROM's being used by counsel. Thus, providing <i>The Providence Journal</i> with recordings of the conversations played for the jury would require both editing and duplication of the tapes being offered in order to create something that does not presently exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2002, THE JOURNAL filed its second petition for a writ of mandamus. This petition sought to require the district court to supply the press with copies of all videotape and audiotape evidence played to the jury during the Cianci trial on a contemporaneous basis. We consolidated THE JOURNAL'S two mandamus petitions for hearing. The district judge, through counsel, filed an opposition to each petition. We heard oral argument while the Cianci trial was ongoing (the district court sent the Cianci case to the jury on June 12, 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a threshold question as to whether THE JOURNAL should be proceeding by appeal or by mandamus. <i>Compare, e.g., United States v. Ladd</i> (<i>In re Associated Press</i>), 162 F.3d 503, 507 (7th Cir.1998) (appeal), <i>with, e.g., Oregonian Publ'g Co. v. United States Dist. Ct.,</i> 920 F.2d 1462, 1464-65 (9th Cir.1990) (mandamus). In the circumstances of this case, however, all roads lead to Rome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, \"[a] federal court of appeals has the power to treat an attempted appeal from an unappealable (or possibly unappealable) order as a petition for a writ of mandamus.\" <i>United States v. Horn,</i> 29 F.3d 754, 769 (1st Cir.1994). On this basis, we exercised mandamus jurisdiction in <i>United States v. Hurley</i> (<i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.</i>), 920 F.2d 88 (1st Cir. 1990). In that case, a newspaper sought access to records relating to a criminal trial. The district court rejected both the newspaper's demand for access and its motion to intervene. <i>Id.</i> at 90. The newspaper pursued an appeal and simultaneously petitioned for a writ of mandamus. <i>Id.</i> We declined to decide the jurisdictional question, but, rather, granted relief under the aegis of the All Writs Act and dismissed the appeal as moot. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitions now before us are of the same general character as the petition in <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.</i> Here, as there, the petitions pose important questions bearing upon the constitutional and common-law rights of public access to judicial records in criminal proceedings. Here, as there, the petitions are consonant with the historic use of mandamus as a means to check ostensible judicial usurpations of power. <i>See In re Pearson,</i> 990 F.2d 653, 656 (1st Cir.1993). Because we believe that the issues raised by THE JOURNAL are worthy candidates for mandamus review, we exercise our discretion to entertain both petitions under our mandamus jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next discuss the case law concerning rights of access to judicial records. We begin with first principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts long have recognized \"that public monitoring of the judicial system fosters the important values of quality, honesty and respect for our legal system.\" <i>Siedle v. Putnam Inv., Inc.,</i> 147 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This recognition has given rise to a presumption that the public has a common-law right of access to judicial documents. <i>Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc.,</i> 435 U.S. 589, 597, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978). This presumptive right of access attaches to those materials \"which properly come before the court in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding and which are relevant to that adjudication.\" <i>FTC v. Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp.,</i> 830 F.2d 404, 412-13 (1st Cir.1987). It follows, then, that the common-law right of access extends to \"materials on which a court relies in determining the litigants' substantive rights.\" <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> 805 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from the prerogatives attendant to the common-law right of access to judicial records, the public and the press enjoy a constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <i>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Super. Ct.,</i> 457 U.S. 596, 603-06, 102 S.Ct. 2613, 73 L.Ed.2d 248 (1982); <i>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia,</i> 448 U.S. 555, 575-80, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980) (plurality op.). The constitutional right of access is not limited to the actual trial itself, but also encompasses most pretrial proceedings. <i>See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Super. Ct.,</i> 478 U.S. 1, 11-13, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (<i>Press-Enterprise II</i>); <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 1984); <i>see also Anderson,</i> 805 F.2d at 11 (collecting cases). We have held that this constitutional right &#8212; which serves to ensure a \"full understanding\" of criminal proceedings, thereby placing the populace in a position \"to serve as an effective check on the system\" &#8212; extends to documents and kindred materials submitted in connection with the prosecution and defense of criminal proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Pokaski,</i> 868 F.2d 497, 502 (1st Cir.1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the two rights of access are not coterminous, courts have employed much the same type of screen in evaluating their applicability to particular claims. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Soussoudis</i> (<i>In re Wash. Post Co.</i>), 807 F.2d 383, 390 (4th Cir.1986). This overlap is understandable because the jurisprudence discussing the First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings has been derived in large measure from the jurisprudence that has shaped the common-law right of access. <i>See Anderson,</i> 805 F.2d at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. ANALYSIS: THE FIRST PETITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first mandamus petition attacks both the District of Rhode Island's overall treatment of legal memoranda and the trial court's handling of those memoranda in the Cianci case. We address these points separately. First, however, we focus on the applicable standards of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standards of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the common ancestry shared by the two rights of access, the standards of review referable to those rights differ. On the one hand, the denial of a claimed right of access under the common law engenders review for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 13. A district court can abuse its discretion by \"ignoring a material factor that deserves significant weight, relying on an improper factor, or, even if it mulls only the proper mix of factors, by making a serious mistake in judgment.\" <i>Siedle,</i> 147 F.3d at 10. Since \"only the most compelling reasons can justify non-disclosure of judicial records\" that come within the scope of the common-law right of access, <i>Standard Fin. Mgmt.,</i> 830 F.2d at 410 (citation omitted), this review is more rigorous than garden-variety abuse of discretion review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, constitutional access claims engender de novo review. <i>In re State-Record Co.,</i> 917 F.2d 124, 127 (4th Cir.1990). In such cases, the presumption in favor of access can only be overcome \"by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\" <i>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Super. Ct.,</i> 464 U.S. 501, 510, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629 (1984) (<i>Press-Enterprise I</i>). This last requirement adds a new dimension and makes the First Amendment standard even more stringent than the common-law standard. Thus, courts have tended to employ the First Amendment standard in situations in which both rights of access are implicated. <i>E.g., In re Wash. Post Co.,</i> 807 F.2d at 390.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the legal memoranda that parties are required to file in conjunction with motions submitted in the District of Rhode Island. The local rules specify that those memoranda must contain the critical elements of the parties' arguments. <i>See</i> D.R.I. R. 12(a)(1)-(2). It follows that those memoranda constitute materials on which a court is meant to rely in determining the parties' substantive rights. In a criminal case, therefore, they are subject to both common-law and First Amendment rights of access. Accordingly, we review the district court's treatment of them under the First Amendment's heightened standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Traditional Practice.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent notes, correctly, that legal memoranda in the Cianci case have been made available to the public so long as they do not contain restricted information. Building on that foundation, he argues that the District of Rhode Island's traditional method of treating memoranda is not properly before us. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has made clear that its handling of legal memoranda in the Cianci case represents an ad hoc exception to the District of Rhode Island's standard practice. Absent mandamus review, the constitutional questions stemming from this standard practice &#8212; a practice that amounts to a blanket nonfiling policy &#8212; are likely to recur and to evade effective resolution. Moreover, an immediate adjudication of the matter will clarify matters for judges, litigants, lawyers, and journalists in a wide range of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On suitable occasions, we have employed advisory mandamus to resolve issues \"which are both novel and of great public importance.\" <i>In re Recticel Foam Corp.,</i> 859 F.2d 1000, 1005 n. 4 (1st Cir.1988). The considerations enumerated above lead us to conclude that the blanket nonfiling policy is a suitable candidate for advisory mandamus. <i>E.g., Schlagenhauf v. Holder,</i> 379 U.S. 104, 109-12, 85 S.Ct. 234, 13 L.Ed.2d 152 (1964); <i>Horn,</i> 29 F.3d at 769-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that we have an institutional interest in oversight of the District of Rhode Island's standard practice vis-a-vis the handling of legal memoranda, we turn to the validity of that practice. Motions and objections filed in the District of Rhode Island typically become part of the case file (and, thus, available for public inspection) at the moment they are filed in the clerk's office. Legal memoranda submitted in conjunction with such motions are treated differently: those memoranda do not become part of the case file, but, rather, go directly to the judge to whom the case is assigned. This leaves the question of access solely in the discretion of the trial judge and places on persons desiring access the onus of initiating action. Whether viewed as a restriction on access or as a practical inconvenience, this protocol reverses the constitutional presumption of public access to documents submitted in conjunction with criminal proceedings. <i>Cf. Pokaski,</i> 868 F.2d at 507 (indicating that a statute that restricts public access to judicial records in criminal cases by \"plac[ing] on the public the burden of overcoming inertia\" is impermissible).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent attempts to justify the blanket nonfiling policy on five bases. First, the legal memoranda are directed to the judge. Second, and relatedly, routing memoranda directly to the judge's chambers lessens the need for the judge to requisition the entire case file. Third, incorporating memoranda into the case files maintained in the clerk's office would \"needlessly burden ... already taxed storage facilities.\" Fourth, a blanket nonfiling policy serves to discourage overzealous counsel from attempting to gain an \"unfair tactical advantage\" by improperly influencing the public. Finally, memoranda submitted in connection with criminal proceedings might disclose grand jury testimony or refer to other matters prejudicial to a defendant's right to a fair trial. None of these reasons justify the constitutional intrusion that results from the District of Rhode Island's standard practice of treating legal memoranda as presumptively nonpublic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent's first asserted justification proves too much. Although legal memoranda are directed to the judge, so are virtually all the other papers filed in the case (including motions and objections). The second asserted justification is no justification at all: requiring legal memoranda to be filed in the clerk's office would not mean that the judge would have to haul the entire case file into chambers whenever he or she wished to check a particular point. Copying is a routine exercise in most clerks' offices, and at any rate the district court's local rules require counsel to file memoranda in duplicate. <i>See</i> D.R.I. R. 12(d). That would permit placing one copy in the case file and routing the other directly to the judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the third asserted justification withstand scrutiny. While storage limitations may well have prompted the adoption of the blanket nonfiling policy two decades ago, the recently-completed renovation of the Federal Courthouse in Providence, coupled with the court's acquisition of the adjacent Pastore Building, have eliminated any intractable problem in that regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are equally unpersuaded that the court's policy of keeping all legal memoranda hidden from public view is warranted based upon hypothetical concerns about overzealous counsel behaving badly. Judges deal every day with the need to ensure that lawyers play fair and square, and we are unwilling to assume, without hard evidence, that lawyers who practice in the District of Rhode Island are so unruly that ordinary antidotes to fractiousness (e.g., sanctions, contempt, loss of the right to practice) will prove impuissant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the district court's fifth concern, we acknowledge that specific cases may pose greater risks of prejudicial disclosures (and, thus, may warrant special treatment). But there is no need to discard the baby with the bath water. Safeguards against prejudice can be implemented on a case-specific basis. Where a particularized need for restricting public access to legal memoranda exists, that need can be addressed by the tailoring of appropriate relief. As contrasted with the District of Rhode Island's existing practice of treating all legal memoranda as presumptively nonpublic, this would be a considerably less restrictive, but equally effective, means for dealing with the specter of potential prejudice. <i>Cf. Pokaski,</i> 868 F.2d at 506-07 (rejecting blanket sealing rule on ground that case-by-case evaluation of defendants' sealing requests represented a viable less restrictive means).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy &#8212; its standard practice of refusing to place memoranda submitted in conjunction with motions on file in the clerk's office when tendered &#8212; violates the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Procedure Employed Here.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Cianci case, the trial court deviated from the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy. Thus, its methodology invites a separate analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional right of public access is a qualified right that may be outweighed by competing interests in a given case. <i>Press-Enterprise I,</i> 464 U.S. at 511 n. 10, 104 S.Ct. 819; <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d at 52. Certainly, in a case in which public attention is quite high, a court deliberating about whether to restrict broadly public access to materials submitted in connection with criminal proceedings ordinarily ought to afford interested parties an opportunity to be heard on the question of impoundment. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Antar,</i> 38 F.3d 1348, 1361 n. 18 (3d Cir.1994). The court would normally be expected to identify and balance the competing interests involved, and weigh reasonable alternatives to sealing, making findings where necessary. <i>In re State-Record Co.,</i> 917 F.2d at 127-29; <i>In re Wash. Post Co.,</i> 807 F.2d at 391.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, THE JOURNAL has not complained about a lack of notice, so we turn to the task of identifying and balancing the competing interests involved. The district court clearly registered its concern that the unrestrained disclosure of certain types of information about the Cianci case would create a substantial risk of prejudicing the parties' right to a fair trial. This disquietude impelled the court to implement, and then fine-tune, the non-dissemination order. An accused's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial plainly rises to the level of a compelling interest. <i>See Press-Enterprise I,</i> 464 U.S. at 508, 104 S.Ct. 819. When that right collides headon with the public's right of access to judicial records, the defendant's fair trial right takes precedence. <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That does not mean, however, that the public's (and the media's) right to know can be frustrated by the mere invocation of a threat to the accused's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. A court faced with an impending collision between these rights must, on a case-specific basis, construct a balance. <i>Press-Enterprise I,</i> 464 U.S. at 510-11 &amp; n. 10, 104 S.Ct. 819. That weighing must proceed on the assumption that restrictions on access to presumptively public judicial documents should be imposed only if a substantial likelihood exists that the accused's right to a fair trial will otherwise be prejudiced. <i>Press-Enterprise II,</i> 478 U.S. at 14, 106 S.Ct. 2735. We caution that this inquiry requires specific findings; the First Amendment right of public access is too precious to be foreclosed by conclusory assertions or unsupported speculation. <i>United States v. Kirk</i> (<i>In re Memphis Publ'g Co.</i>), 887 F.2d 646, 648-49 (6th Cir.1989); <i>In re Wash. Post Co.,</i> 807 F.2d at 392-93 &amp; n. 9; <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 746 F.2d 964, 972 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Political corruption cases tend to attract widespread media attention, and the Cianci case is a paradigmatic example. Here, moreover, the district court cited book and verse, cataloguing specific incidents that fueled its concerns that the defendants' ability to receive a fair trial was in danger of being substantively compromised by unrestrained disclosures. The court alluded specifically to leaks of information in violation of Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and misbehavior by the lead prosecutor. In view of the notoriety of the case and the incidents recounted by the district court, we are convinced that the court's perception of a threat to the defendants' fair trial rights was objectively reasonable. <i>See Gannett Co. v. DePasquale,</i> 443 U.S. 368, 392-93, 99 S.Ct. 2898, 61 L.Ed.2d 608 (1979) (concluding that the trial court properly appraised legitimate concerns that open proceeding posed reasonable probability of prejudice to defendants' fair trial rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the defendants' fair trial rights represent a compelling interest, we next must decide whether the non-dissemination order is drawn as narrowly as practicable. The threshold question is whether a trial court, in a particular case, can adopt a procedure that reverses the presumption of public access and <i>automatically</i> seals all subsequent filings until the judge determines that a specific document poses no undue risk to the defendant's fair trial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE JOURNAL argues that the decision in <i>Associated Press v. United States Dist. Ct.,</i> 705 F.2d 1143 (9th Cir.1983), requires that this question be answered in the negative. In that case, the district court, responding to extensive press coverage of a high-profile criminal matter, issued a sua sponte order directing the parties to submit all future filings under seal in order to permit the court \"to initially review them and to make a determination with regard to disclosure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1144. The trial court subsequently imposed a 48-hour time limit within which it would rule upon the need for a given filing to remain sealed. Id. at 1145. The Ninth Circuit nonetheless struck down the procedure and directed the district court to vacate its order. <i>Id.</i> at 1147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, <i>Associated Press</i> is a horse of a different hue. There, the court of appeals concluded that the trial court had failed to make specific findings showing that \"access to pretrial documents will create a substantial probability of irreparable damage to defendants' fair trial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1146. The presence of such findings here readily distinguishes this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find more helpful the opinion in <i>United States v. McVeigh,</i> 119 F.3d 806 (10th Cir.1997). There, the court acknowledged that a high-profile criminal case may \"impose[ ] unique demands on the trial court, and require[ ] the court to establish procedures for dealing effectively, efficiently and fairly with recurring issues such as whether documents should be placed under seal or redacted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 813. This is exactly what transpired here. In response to a cognizable threat to the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights, the district court adopted a practical procedure that enabled it effectively and efficiently to safeguard those rights. Nothing in the case law prevents a court from establishing this sort of prophylaxis. And given the circumstances of this case, the district court's implementation of a general procedure to seal all memoranda temporarily appears narrowly tailored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning our attention to the specifics of the non-dissemination order, we hold that the district court's insistence on reviewing each memorandum before deciding whether it should remain under seal did not constitute reversible error. Although we question the court's apparent reluctance to rely on counsel to separate wheat from chaff in accordance with the non-dissemination order &#8212; experience teaches that most lawyers will cooperate with the court and, in all events, will be loath to defy a court order &#8212; nothing precludes the district court from assuming that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that we regard the non-dissemination order as a textbook model. We have four specific concerns. First, where, as here, a court undertakes to screen documents before they are placed in the case file, the procedure should incorporate a specific timetable obligating the court to perform its self-imposed screening responsibilities promptly and to render a timely decision as to whether a particular document is fit for public disclosure. Second, and relatedly, the court below decided to refrain from reviewing each individual memorandum to decide whether it could be made available to the public until after the time had expired for the submission of any possible reply memorandum. This unnecessarily prolongs the process. Each individual memorandum either contains restricted information (in which case it is subject to redaction or sealing) or it does not (in which case it does not pose a threat to the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights). Third, the order contains no provision as to whether the court intends to unseal retained memoranda at some point after the trial has ended (and if so, when).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we think that the district court's refusal to consider redaction on a document-by-document basis is insupportable. Courts have an obligation to consider all reasonable alternatives to foreclosing the constitutional right of access. <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d at 56. Redaction constitutes a time-tested means of minimizing any intrusion on that right. <i>See United States v. Amodeo,</i> 44 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.1995) (stating \"that it is proper for a district court, after weighing competing interests, to edit and redact a judicial document in order to allow access to appropriate portions of the document\"); <i>see also United States v. Biaggi</i> (<i>In re N.Y. Times</i>), 828 F.2d 110, 116 (2d Cir.1987) (rejecting \"wholesale sealing\" of papers partly because \"limited redaction [might] be appropriate\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, our ability to assess whether the district court was justified in refusing to redact the 11 documents that remain sealed is hampered by a lack of specific findings. <i>See In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d at 56 (requiring a trial court that rejects alternatives to sealing to make specific findings to facilitate appellate review). The court did say, generally, that \"in those rare cases where counsel find it necessary to refer to grand jury matters or other matters not properly disclosable, those references are almost invariably dispersed throughout the memoranda and inextricably intertwined with the references to applicable legal authority.\" D. Ct. Op. at 13. But the First Amendment requires consideration of the feasibility of redaction on a document-by-document basis, and the court's blanket characterization falls well short of this benchmark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having pointed out these defects in the non-dissemination order, we leave the matter of correction to the district court. Consistent with the core purpose of advisory mandamus, the principal value of our rulings is in terms of future cases. In respect to the Cianci case itself, the court is at the end of a lengthy trial; once the dust has settled, we are confident that the district court will set a reasonable timetable for determining whether previously submitted memoranda are to be placed on file in the clerk's office (with or without redaction); and, as to any memorandum withheld from filing, will enter specific findings as to the need for that restriction and the impracticality of redaction as an alternative to sealing. Within a reasonable time after the Cianci case and all related proceedings have ended &#8212; there is a \"severed\" defendant yet to be tried &#8212; we anticipate that the district court will consider the release of all documents and other materials then remaining under seal. Should the district court fail to act in a timely manner to effectuate the principles endorsed in this opinion&#8212;a contingency that we doubt will occur&#8212;THE JOURNAL is free to petition for ancillary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. ANALYSIS: THE SECOND PETITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next grapple with THE JOURNAL'S request for copies of the videotapes and audiotapes played at trial. In <i>Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn,</i> 420 U.S. 469, 494-97, 95 S.Ct. 1029, 43 L.Ed.2d 328 (1975), the Supreme Court concluded that the media has a First Amendment right to publish information contained in court records that are open to public inspection. A few years later, however, the Court rejected the argument that the First Amendment right of access allowed the media to obtain copies of tapes that had been entered into evidence at a criminal trial. <i>Warner Communications,</i> 435 U.S. at 608-10, 98 S.Ct. 1306. Elaborating on this point, the Justices explained that the constitutional right to attend criminal trials morphed into a right to attend the trial sessions at which the tapes were played and to report upon what was seen and heard in the courtroom, but did not confer the right to replicate evidentiary materials in the custody of the court. <i>Id.</i> at 609, 98 S.Ct. 1306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Warner Communications</i> is directly applicable here. As in that case, the district court has not restricted media access to, or the publication of, any information in the public domain. Indeed, the district court has gone to great lengths to facilitate access to the trial proceedings by, for example, reserving seats in the courtroom for members of the press and providing an overflow room for remote viewing. By affording interested members of the media ample opportunity to see and hear the tapes as they are played for the jury, the court has fulfilled its pertinent First Amendment obligations. <i>See United States v. Beckham,</i> 789 F.2d 401, 407 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The demise of THE JOURNAL'S First Amendment claim does not end the matter. The question remains whether the common-law right to inspect and copy judicial documents affords a basis for relief. As said, this right of access extends to \"materials on which a court relies in determining the litigants' substantive rights.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 805 F.2d at 13. Thus, videotapes and audiotapes on which a court relies in the determination of substantive rights are within its reach. <i>See United States v. Graham,</i> 257 F.3d 143, 151-53 (2d Cir.2001). Because the videotapes and audiotapes that THE JOURNAL seeks to copy have been admitted into evidence, they fall into this category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the question reduces to whether the common-law right of access is fulfilled by permitting the press and the public to see and hear such tapes, but not to copy them. To answer this question, THE JOURNAL cites a plethora of instances in which courts have allowed media outlets to obtain copies of tapes used in judicial proceedings. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 155-56; <i>United States v. Myers</i> (<i>In re Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.</i>), 635 F.2d 945, 952-54 (2d Cir.1980). But this compendium only serves to prove that a trial court <i>may</i> allow the media to copy tapes that have been admitted into evidence; none of the constituent cases stands for the much different proposition that a trial court <i>must</i> afford such access.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, this case offers a unique twist. Here, the government has not merely played individual tapes, but, rather, has used cutting-edge technology (the Sanctions software) to play for the jury medleys of selected excerpts from the universe of taped material stored on its laptop computer. As a result, there is no electronic medium &#8212; no tape or CD-ROM &#8212; currently in existence that contains the precise medleys of taped excerpts that have been played in open court. Consequently, we must decide whether the common-law right of access compels a court to create (or order the creation of) a new medium that contains only taped excerpts that have been played in open court. This is a question of first impression at the appellate level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, the common-law right of access permitted the public to copy the contents of written documents. <i>In re Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,</i> 635 F.2d at 950. Over time, the right has been extended to accommodate technological advancements in document reproduction such as photography, photocopying, and the replication of videotapes and audiotapes. <i>Id.</i> Invariably, however, these accommodations have covered materials that are \"in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 952.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, the media seeks access to materials that do not exist in readily reproducible form, a new variable enters the equation. We are reluctant to hold that the common-law right of access necessarily compels the creation (and, thus, the copying) of such materials. We prefer instead to leave this decision, like many other decisions as to how best to effectuate the common-law right of access, to the informed discretion of the trial court, so that it may be exercised with due regard for the idiosyncratic facts and circumstances of a specific case. <i>See Warner Communications,</i> 435 U.S. at 599, 98 S.Ct. 1306; <i>Anderson,</i> 805 F.2d at 13. This approach seems especially appropriate here because the task of assessing whether the creation of an excerpt-only recording entails mere reproduction as opposed to extensive editing demands a particularized, fact-intensive inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the ruling below. The district court denied THE JOURNAL'S motion, holding that the common-law right of access did not mandate the creation of something not already in existence (i.e., a tape or CD-ROM containing only those excerpts played in open court) and finding replication infeasible. In this regard, the court made a number of specific findings highlighting difficulties inherent in THE JOURNAL'S proposals for physical access to the taped excerpts. The court concluded, for example, that editing the source material to create a tape or CD-ROM containing only those excerpts played at trial was a far more daunting task than merely duplicating existing source materials. The court also found that the editing required to create tapes or CD-ROMs containing only the hundreds of taped conversations being played in open court would impose an appreciable burden on the court's staff, the parties, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline THE JOURNAL'S invitation to second-guess these findings. In the first place, the parties' representations as to how the software operates and how difficult it would be to reproduce the evidence seen and heard by the jurors are sharply conflicting. As a result, the record before us is hopelessly imprecise &#8212; and the Sanctions software package is not part of it. In the second place, the fact that the public and the press have had ample opportunity to see and hear the evidentiary tapes when those tapes were played in open court during trial takes much of the sting out of the district court's decision. Given these considerations, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying THE JOURNAL'S request to compel the creation and production of excerpt-only tapes or CD-ROMs mimicking the materials actually played to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Cf. Valley Broad. Co. v. United States Dist. Ct.,</i> 798 F.2d 1289, 1295 &amp; n. 8 (9th Cir.1986) (explaining that substantial administrative burdens alone may justify denial of access).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE JOURNAL has a fallback position. It argues that the medleys of excerpts can be rerecorded as they are played in open court. The district court rejected this proposal based upon the clerk of court's representation that it was infeasible to tap into the audio/video feed to the broadcast monitors to rerecord the materials as they were being played in open court. The clerk explained that consultations with the court's technical staff and representatives of the vendor that had installed the courtroom presentation system had not yielded a practicable and cost-effective method of rerecording the audio/video transmission to the overflow room. The district court accepted this representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE JOURNAL disputes the accuracy of the clerk's conclusion. Its position rests on a supplementary affidavit submitted on the eve of oral argument in this court. That affidavit suggests the existence of what THE JOURNAL describes as a technologically feasible method of rerecording the audio and video excerpts as they are played in open court. We decline to consider this belated proffer. <i>See United States v. Slade,</i> 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"). THE JOURNAL is, of course, free to ask the district court to evaluate this new proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A high-profile, multi-defendant political corruption case is bound to test the mettle of the most experienced trial judge. We admire the manner in which Chief Judge Torres has responded to that challenge. Although we, with a luxury of time that district judges rarely enjoy, have concluded that the court's non-dissemination order must be modified in certain respects, that conclusion in no way detracts from our overall assessment of the district court's exemplary performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we strike down the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy for the handling of legal memoranda. We uphold the district court's non-dissemination order, but direct the court, should it enter such orders in future cases, to include certain specified safeguards. As to the Cianci case itself, we leave the specifies of corrective action to the district court, consistent with the teachings of this opinion. Finally, we deem the district court's refusal to provide THE JOURNAL with copies of videotapes and audiotapes an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion, given the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This was not THE JOURNAL'S first expression of dissatisfaction with the district court's handling of access to documents in the Cianci case. THE JOURNAL earlier had sought access to an FBI agent's affidavit submitted in support of a request for a search warrant. Based upon its determination that public disclosure of the affidavit's contents prior to trial would prejudice the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights, the district court denied THE JOURNAL'S motion<i>United States v. Cianci,</i> 175 F.Supp.2d 194, 198, 205 (D.R.I.2001).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although the non-dissemination order applied to more than legal memoranda (e.g., it imposed stringent restrictions on extrajudicial statements by the parties and their counsel), THE JOURNAL has only challenged the order insofar as it pertains to the treatment of legal memoranda. Consequently, we express no opinion anent any other feature of the non-dissemination order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Along with its mandamus petitions, THE JOURNAL prudently filed a protective appeal. In view of our decision to exercise mandamus jurisdiction, we will follow the course charted in<i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 920 F.2d at 90, and enter a separate order dismissing that appeal as moot.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This holding comports with case law from our sister circuits<i>E.g., United States v. Biaggi</i> (<i>In re N.Y. Times</i>), 828 F.2d 110, 114 (2d Cir.1987); <i>United States v. Soussoudis</i> (<i>In re Wash. Post Co.</i>), 807 F.2d 383, 389-90 (4th Cir.1986). We note, however, that the Supreme Court has not yet passed upon whether the constitutional right of access in criminal proceedings extends to judicial records.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the Supreme Court has not established whether the constitutional right of access attaches to civil cases in general, the common-law right of access extends to judicial records in civil proceedings<i>Standard Fin. Mgmt.,</i> 830 F.2d at 408 &amp; n. 4. As said, that right encompasses legal memoranda. Because none of the respondent's rationales for rendering legal memoranda presumptively nonpublic rise to the level of a compelling reason sufficient to justify the nondisclosure of those documents, our invalidation of the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy vis-a-vis legal memoranda applies in civil as well as criminal proceedings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We understand that written transcripts of the tapes have been marked as exhibits for identification in the Cianci trial. At first blush, it would seem that providing the media with copies of these transcripts might represent a relatively straightforward means of furthering access without imposing any significant burden upon the district court or the litigants. THE JOURNAL, however, did not raise the matter of the transcripts in either of its mandamus petitions, and, therefore, we decline to order this relief<i>Cf. Pratt v. United States,</i> 129 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir.1997) (\"It is firmly settled in this circuit that arguments not advanced and developed in an appellant's brief are deemed waived.\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(\"Buddy\") Cianci, Jr., and several codefendants. During the trial, a daily newspaper filed serial mandamus petitions seeking to remediate perceived violations of First Amendment and common-law rights of access to documents, videotapes, and other materials that comprise part of the court record. These petitions present, in essence, three important questions (some of novel impression).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first question pertains to public access to memoranda of law that counsel are required by local rule to submit in connection with motions. These memoranda contain the substance of a movant's argument or a nonmovant's opposition: pertinent facts, case law, statutory references, and legal reasoning. As to this question, we conclude that the District of Rhode Island's longstanding practice of refusing to place these memoranda in the case file, available for public perusal, violates the First Amendment. The second question pertains to the manner in which the district court has handled such memoranda in the Cianci case. We uphold most &#8212; though not all &#8212; aspects of the praxis employed by the district court. The third question involves the newspaper's request for copies of videotape and audiotape evidence introduced at the trial. Given the circumstances, we conclude that the district court's refusal to accede to this request did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the two petitions share a common nucleus of operative fact, they constitute discrete requests for relief. Accordingly, we describe each petition separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The First Petition.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 2, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted Mayor Cianci, along with five other individuals, on a variety of charges. The linchpin of the indictment was a RICO conspiracy count that, in effect, charged the defendants with operating City Hall as a racketeering enterprise that demanded bribes, sometimes thinly disguised as \"campaign contributions,\" as a prerequisite to doing business with the municipality and its agencies. The indictment itself came as no surprise: some details of the federal probe, dubbed \"Operation Plunder Dome,\" had surfaced earlier, and a number of other persons already had been indicted on related charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both before and after the Cianci indictment, Operation Plunder Dome received pervasive publicity. During the grand jury investigation that culminated in this indictment, leaked information proved to be a persistent problem. To cite one example, a local television station broadcast a videotape that had been presented to the grand jury as evidence. To cite another, an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) played an FBI surveillance tape for several of his friends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cianci indictment brought heightened attention to the scandal. Determined to ensure the protagonists' right to a fair trial, the district court sanctioned the wayward AUSA, appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether criminal contempt charges should be brought against whomever was responsible for the grand jury leaks, and reminded counsel of their obligation to refrain from publicly disseminating information that threatened the integrity of the upcoming trial. See D.R.I. R. 39 (precluding release of information if there exists a \"reasonable likelihood that it imposes a serious and imminent threat of interference with a trial or action\"); R.I. R. Prof'l Conduct, R. 3.6 (precluding extrajudicial statements that have a \"substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The capstone of the court's efforts was the issuance, on May 15, 2001, of a non-dissemination order. Citing the \"intense media coverage\" surrounding the Cianci case, the court foresaw \"a substantial risk of prejudicing the parties' right to a fair trial.\" To diminish that risk, the court prohibited the dissemination of, inter alia, any information regarding the testimony, character, credibility, or reputation of any witness; any information presented to the grand jury; and any information concerning plea negotiations. The order (which contained an exception for information \"presented at trial or during the course of any hearing conducted in open court\") was to remain in effect pending the disposition of all charges against all defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same order, the court instituted a procedure with respect to the filing of any documents that might contain references to restricted information. Each such document was to be filed under seal, accompanied by a separate descriptive document that, inter alia, stated the reasons why the submitted document should be sealed. The court, acting sua sponte or on the motion of any party, could order any document to be unsealed if it determined that, notwithstanding any references to restricted information, insufficient justification existed for keeping that document confidential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2001, the district court issued an order amending this procedure (we henceforth refer to the May 15 order, as modified by the May 23 order, as the non-dissemination order). The May 23 order changed the ground rules in three respects. First, counsel were instructed to refrain from making any reference to restricted information in motions or oppositions to motions. Second, the author of any legal memorandum submitted in connection with a motion was directed to file a certification as to whether the memorandum contained information subject to the non-dissemination order. Third, the order stated that if the court's subsequent review of any particular legal memorandum revealed that the memorandum contained no restricted information, it would be placed on file in the clerk's office and made available for public inspection. The order made clear, however, that the court would not undertake to \"redact or edit any memorandum.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's treatment of legal memoranda in the Cianci case represented a departure from the prevailing practice in the District of Rhode Island. Although the court's local rules seem to provide for the filing in the clerk's office of legal memoranda supporting or opposing motions, <i>see</i> D.R.I. R. 12(a)(1)-(2), the District of Rhode Island has a longstanding practice &#8212; dating back to the early 1980s &#8212; of docketing such memoranda but not placing them in the case files maintained by the clerk's office. Instead, they are transmitted directly to the judge to whom the case is assigned and kept in the judge's chambers (inaccessible to public scrutiny except upon request). We discuss the propriety of this practice <i>infra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cianci case generated a blizzard of paper, and numerous documents were submitted to the court in accordance with the procedures established by the non-dissemination order. The state's major newspaper, THE PROVIDENCE JOURNAL (THE JOURNAL), chafed under this regime. On February 19, 2002, THE JOURNAL filed a motion seeking access to 42 previously filed memoranda that it claimed had not yet been made public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In the same motion, THE JOURNAL sought further modifications of the non-dissemination order, asserting that the district court's general practice of denying access to legal memoranda reversed the presumption of openness applicable to judicial records. THE JOURNAL implored the court to deem all such memoranda public when filed unless, in a particular instance, a motion to seal was docketed and the court, after individualized inquiry, made specific record findings justifying confidentiality. THE JOURNAL also asked the court to consider redaction on a document-by-document basis as a less restrictive means of balancing the need for confidentiality against the public's right to know.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the start of trial, the district court denied virtually all of THE JOURNAL'S requests. <i>See United States v. Cianci,</i> Crim. No. 00-083-T, slip op. at 14 (D.R.I. Mar. 15, 2002) (unpublished) [hereinafter \"D. Ct. Op.\"]. After outlining the traditional treatment of legal memoranda in the District of Rhode Island, <i>id.</i> at 1-4, the court described the special procedures that it had instituted in the Cianci case and noted that 11 of the 42 memoranda at issue already had been placed on file in the clerk's office, <i>id.</i> at 4-5. Of the remaining 31 memoranda, 17 (related to discovery motions) had been referred to a magistrate judge; 3 dealt with mundane matters that the court believed were of no conceivable interest to THE JOURNAL; and the final 11 could not \"properly be made part of the public record before trial\" because they referred to \"grand jury matters and/or matters, the dissemination of which would prejudice the parties' rights to a fair trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6-7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court then denied most aspects of THE JOURNAL'S request to modify the non-dissemination order. The court characterized its treatment of legal memoranda in the Cianci case as \"perfectly consistent\" with THE JOURNAL'S proposal to make all legal memoranda public unless otherwise directed by the court. <i>Id.</i> at 9. It rejected the suggested reinstitution of formal motions to seal on the ground that the suggestion already had proven unworkable. <i>Id.</i> Relatedly, the court expressed its unwillingness to rely exclusively on counsel's representations in determining whether to place legal memoranda on file in the clerk's office. <i>Id.</i> at 11-12. The court reiterated that redaction was infeasible both because the forbidden matters were \"almost invariably dispersed throughout the memoranda and inextricably intertwined with the references to applicable legal authority,\" and because the mechanics of redaction would squander scarce judicial resources. <i>Id.</i> at 13. Finally, the court agreed to amend the non-dissemination order to furnish a specific, on-the-record finding in support of any subsequent decision to withhold a particular memorandum. <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial commenced on April 23, 2002. Two days later, THE JOURNAL filed a mandamus petition with this court seeking: (1) access to legal memoranda previously submitted in the Cianci case but not yet made public; (2) a directive requiring all future memoranda to be placed on file in the clerk's office on the date of submission; and (3) modification of the non-dissemination order to require redaction when feasible (as a less restrictive alternative to sealing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Second Petition.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second mandamus petition centers on 71 videotapes and audiotapes of secretly recorded conversations with various bureaucrats (including some of the defendants). Putting this petition into perspective requires an understanding of how the parties presented these videotapes and audiotapes during the Cianci trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preparation for trial, the government transferred the entire contents of the 71 tapes onto CD-ROMs. After loading the CD-ROMs onto the hard drive of a laptop computer, the government employed a software program called Sanctions to excerpt conversations for playback. Using this technology, the government introduced selected passages from these conversations into evidence in the course of trial. As the excerpts were played on the government's laptop computer, they were simultaneously broadcast via the district court's state-of-the-art audiovisual system to monitors in both the courtroom and a remote viewing room (the overflow room). As a taped excerpt was played, a transcript was simultaneously scrolled across the bottom of the screen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, the media sought copies of the videotape and audiotape evidence. Discussions ensued between representatives of the press and David DiMarzio, the clerk of court, regarding possible methods by which the tapes could be copied and distributed to the media after they had been introduced into evidence. The clerk initially suggested that the parties could be required to submit an extra copy of each tape and the associated transcript for delivery to the media at an appropriate time. The district court vetoed this suggestion. Next, the media representatives proposed that the clerk's office copy the exhibits for the media. The clerk rebuffed this proposal on the ground that copying might damage the original tapes. At that point, the negotiations stalled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the trial began, THE JOURNAL moved for access to copies of the videotape and audiotape evidence. The court held a hearing that focused on the practicalities of complying with that request. THE JOURNAL argued that other courts, in other criminal trials, had provided copies of taped evidence to the media in one of three ways: (1) by requiring court staff to copy the tapes; (2) by requiring the parties to submit duplicates; or (3) by rerecording the tapes as they were being played to the jury in open court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruling from the bench, the district court scotched all three options. The court rejected the first based on concerns expressed by the clerk. It rejected the second because it was unwilling to impose upon the parties the \"significant undertaking\" of creating and supplying extra copies of the taped evidence. It rejected the third option based upon the clerk's representation that there was no feasible way to rerecord the tapes as they were being played over the court's evidence presentation system. In a written addendum, the court delineated an additional reason for its decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The recordings being presented are in the form of audio and video tapes that include not only the conversations that have been played for the jury; but, also, additional conversations that have not and may not be admitted into evidence. Moreover, the Court is informed that the same is true with respect to the C.D. ROM's being used by counsel. Thus, providing <i>The Providence Journal</i> with recordings of the conversations played for the jury would require both editing and duplication of the tapes being offered in order to create something that does not presently exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 26, 2002, THE JOURNAL filed its second petition for a writ of mandamus. This petition sought to require the district court to supply the press with copies of all videotape and audiotape evidence played to the jury during the Cianci trial on a contemporaneous basis. We consolidated THE JOURNAL'S two mandamus petitions for hearing. The district judge, through counsel, filed an opposition to each petition. We heard oral argument while the Cianci trial was ongoing (the district court sent the Cianci case to the jury on June 12, 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a threshold question as to whether THE JOURNAL should be proceeding by appeal or by mandamus. <i>Compare, e.g., United States v. Ladd</i> (<i>In re Associated Press</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759727\"><a href=\"/opinion/759727/in-re-associated-press-chicago-tribune-company-illinois-press/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 507 (7th Cir.1998) (appeal), <i>with, e.g., Oregonian Publ'g Co. v.

In the circumstances of this case, however, all roads lead to Rome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, \"[a] federal court of appeals has the power to treat an attempted appeal from an unappealable (or possibly unappealable) order as a petition for a writ of mandamus.\" <i>United States v.

On this basis, we exercised mandamus jurisdiction in <i>United States v. Hurley</i> (<i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552333\"><a href=\"/opinion/552333/in-re-globe-newspaper-company-united-states-of-america-v-edmund-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1990). In that case, a newspaper sought access to records relating to a criminal trial. The district court rejected both the newspaper's demand for access and its motion to intervene. <i>Id.</i> at 90. The newspaper pursued an appeal and simultaneously petitioned for a writ of mandamus. <i>Id.</i> We declined to decide the jurisdictional question, but, rather, granted relief under the aegis of the All Writs Act and dismissed the appeal as moot. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitions now before us are of the same general character as the petition in <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.</i> Here, as there, the petitions pose important questions bearing upon the constitutional and common-law rights of public access to judicial records in criminal proceedings. Here, as there, the petitions are consonant with the historic use of mandamus as a means to check ostensible judicial usurpations of power. <i>See In re Pearson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604120\"><a href=\"/opinion/604120/in-re-donald-pearson/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 656 (1st Cir.1993). Because we believe that the issues raised by THE JOURNAL are worthy candidates for mandamus review, we exercise our discretion to entertain both petitions under our mandamus jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

ANALYSIS: THE FIRST PETITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first mandamus petition attacks both the District of Rhode Island's overall treatment of legal memoranda and the trial court's handling of those memoranda in the Cianci case. We address these points separately. First, however, we focus on the applicable standards of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standards of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the common ancestry shared by the two rights of access, the standards of review referable to those rights differ. On the one hand, the denial of a claimed right of access under the common law engenders review for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 13. A district court can abuse its discretion by \"ignoring a material factor that deserves significant weight, relying on an improper factor, or, even if it mulls only the proper mix of factors, by making a serious mistake in judgment.\" <i>Siedle,</i> 147 F.3d at 10. Since \"only the most compelling reasons can justify non-disclosure of judicial records\" that come within the scope of the common-law right of access, <i>Standard Fin. Mgmt.,</i> 830 F.2d at 410 (citation omitted), this review is more rigorous than garden-variety abuse of discretion review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, constitutional access claims engender de novo review. <i>In re State-Record Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span>, 127 (4th Cir.1990).

This last requirement adds a new dimension and makes the First Amendment standard even more stringent than the common-law standard. Thus, courts have tended to employ the First Amendment standard in situations in which both rights of access are implicated. <i>E.g., In re Wash. Post Co.,</i> 807 F.2d at 390.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the legal memoranda that parties are required to file in conjunction with motions submitted in the District of Rhode Island. The local rules specify that those memoranda must contain the critical elements of the parties' arguments. <i>See</i> D.R.I. R. 12(a)(1)-(2). It follows that those memoranda constitute materials on which a court is meant to rely in determining the parties' substantive rights. In a criminal case, therefore, they are subject to both common-law and First Amendment rights of access. Accordingly, we review the district court's treatment of them under the First Amendment's heightened standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Traditional Practice.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent notes, correctly, that legal memoranda in the Cianci case have been made available to the public so long as they do not contain restricted information. Building on that foundation, he argues that the District of Rhode Island's traditional method of treating memoranda is not properly before us. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has made clear that its handling of legal memoranda in the Cianci case represents an ad hoc exception to the District of Rhode Island's standard practice. Absent mandamus review, the constitutional questions stemming from this standard practice &#8212; a practice that amounts to a blanket nonfiling policy &#8212; are likely to recur and to evade effective resolution. Moreover, an immediate adjudication of the matter will clarify matters for judges, litigants, lawyers, and journalists in a wide range of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On suitable occasions, we have employed advisory mandamus to resolve issues \"which are both novel and of great public importance.\" <i>In re Recticel Foam Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513181\"><a href=\"/opinion/513181/in-re-recticel-foam-corporation-in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1005 n. 4 (1st Cir.1988). The considerations enumerated above lead us to conclude that the blanket nonfiling policy is a suitable candidate for advisory mandamus. <i>E.g., Schlagenhauf v. Holder,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span>, 109-12, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></span> (1964); <i>Horn,</i> 29 F.3d at 769-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that we have an institutional interest in oversight of the District of Rhode Island's standard practice vis-a-vis the handling of legal memoranda, we turn to the validity of that practice. Motions and objections filed in the District of Rhode Island typically become part of the case file (and, thus, available for public inspection) at the moment they are filed in the clerk's office. Legal memoranda submitted in conjunction with such motions are treated differently: those memoranda do not become part of the case file, but, rather, go directly to the judge to whom the case is assigned. This leaves the question of access solely in the discretion of the trial judge and places on persons desiring access the onus of initiating action. Whether viewed as a restriction on access or as a practical inconvenience, this protocol reverses the constitutional presumption of public access to documents submitted in conjunction with criminal proceedings. <i>Cf. Pokaski,</i> 868 F.2d at 507 (indicating that a statute that restricts public access to judicial records in criminal cases by \"plac[ing] on the public the burden of overcoming inertia\" is impermissible).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent attempts to justify the blanket nonfiling policy on five bases. First, the legal memoranda are directed to the judge. Second, and relatedly, routing memoranda directly to the judge's chambers lessens the need for the judge to requisition the entire case file. Third, incorporating memoranda into the case files maintained in the clerk's office would \"needlessly burden ... already taxed storage facilities.\" Fourth, a blanket nonfiling policy serves to discourage overzealous counsel from attempting to gain an \"unfair tactical advantage\" by improperly influencing the public. Finally, memoranda submitted in connection with criminal proceedings might disclose grand jury testimony or refer to other matters prejudicial to a defendant's right to a fair trial. None of these reasons justify the constitutional intrusion that results from the District of Rhode Island's standard practice of treating legal memoranda as presumptively nonpublic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent's first asserted justification proves too much. Although legal memoranda are directed to the judge, so are virtually all the other papers filed in the case (including motions and objections). The second asserted justification is no justification at all: requiring legal memoranda to be filed in the clerk's office would not mean that the judge would have to haul the entire case file into chambers whenever he or she wished to check a particular point. Copying is a routine exercise in most clerks' offices, and at any rate the district court's local rules require counsel to file memoranda in duplicate. <i>See</i> D.R.I. R. 12(d). That would permit placing one copy in the case file and routing the other directly to the judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the third asserted justification withstand scrutiny. While storage limitations may well have prompted the adoption of the blanket nonfiling policy two decades ago, the recently-completed renovation of the Federal Courthouse in Providence, coupled with the court's acquisition of the adjacent Pastore Building, have eliminated any intractable problem in that regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are equally unpersuaded that the court's policy of keeping all legal memoranda hidden from public view is warranted based upon hypothetical concerns about overzealous counsel behaving badly. Judges deal every day with the need to ensure that lawyers play fair and square, and we are unwilling to assume, without hard evidence, that lawyers who practice in the District of Rhode Island are so unruly that ordinary antidotes to fractiousness (e.g., sanctions, contempt, loss of the right to practice) will prove impuissant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the district court's fifth concern, we acknowledge that specific cases may pose greater risks of prejudicial disclosures (and, thus, may warrant special treatment). But there is no need to discard the baby with the bath water. Safeguards against prejudice can be implemented on a case-specific basis. Where a particularized need for restricting public access to legal memoranda exists, that need can be addressed by the tailoring of appropriate relief. As contrasted with the District of Rhode Island's existing practice of treating all legal memoranda as presumptively nonpublic, this would be a considerably less restrictive, but equally effective, means for dealing with the specter of potential prejudice. <i>Cf. Pokaski,</i> 868 F.2d at 506-07 (rejecting blanket sealing rule on ground that case-by-case evaluation of defendants' sealing requests represented a viable less restrictive means).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold, therefore, that the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy &#8212; its standard practice of refusing to place memoranda submitted in conjunction with motions on file in the clerk's office when tendered &#8212; violates the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Procedure Employed Here.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Cianci case, the trial court deviated from the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>; <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d at 52. Certainly, in a case in which public attention is quite high, a court deliberating about whether to restrict broadly public access to materials submitted in connection with criminal proceedings ordinarily ought to afford interested parties an opportunity to be heard on the question of impoundment. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Antar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681306\"><a href=\"/opinion/681306/united-states-v-eddie-antar-mitchell-antar-allen-antar-eddie-gindi/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span></a></span>, 1361 n. 18 (3d Cir.1994). The court would normally be expected to identify and balance the competing interests involved, and weigh reasonable alternatives to sealing, making findings where necessary. <i>In re State-Record Co.,</i> 917 F.2d at 127-29; <i>In re Wash. Post Co.,</i> 807 F.2d at 391.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, THE JOURNAL has not complained about a lack of notice, so we turn to the task of identifying and balancing the competing interests involved. The district court clearly registered its concern that the unrestrained disclosure of certain types of information about the Cianci case would create a substantial risk of prejudicing the parties' right to a fair trial. This disquietude impelled the court to implement, and then fine-tune, the non-dissemination order. An accused's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial plainly rises to the level of a compelling interest. <i>See Press-Enterprise I,</i> 464 U.S. at 508, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111063\"><a href=\"/opinion/111063/press-enterprise-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-riverside-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>. When that right collides headon with the public's right of access to judicial records, the defendant's fair trial right takes precedence. <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That does not mean, however, that the public's (and the media's) right to know can be frustrated by the mere invocation of a threat to the accused's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. A court faced with an impending collision between these rights must, on a case-specific basis, construct a balance. <i>Press-Enterprise I,</i> 464 U.S. at 510-11 &amp; n. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111063\"><a href=\"/opinion/111063/press-enterprise-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-riverside-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>. That weighing must proceed on the assumption that restrictions on access to presumptively public judicial documents should be imposed only if a substantial likelihood exists that the accused's right to a fair trial will otherwise be prejudiced. <i>Press-Enterprise II,</i> 478 U.S. at 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111735\"><a href=\"/opinion/111735/press-enterprise-co-v-superior-court-of-cal-county-of-riverside/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We caution that this inquiry requires specific findings; the First Amendment right of public access is too precious to be foreclosed by conclusory assertions or unsupported speculation. <i>United States v.

Here, moreover, the district court cited book and verse, cataloguing specific incidents that fueled its concerns that the defendants' ability to receive a fair trial was in danger of being substantively compromised by unrestrained disclosures. The court alluded specifically to leaks of information in violation of Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and misbehavior by the lead prosecutor. In view of the notoriety of the case and the incidents recounted by the district court, we are convinced that the court's perception of a threat to the defendants' fair trial rights was objectively reasonable. <i>See Gannett Co. v.

The threshold question is whether a trial court, in a particular case, can adopt a procedure that reverses the presumption of public access and <i>automatically</i> seals all subsequent filings until the judge determines that a specific document poses no undue risk to the defendant's fair trial rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE JOURNAL argues that the decision in <i>Associated Press v. United States Dist. Ct.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1143</span></span> (9th Cir.1983), requires that this question be answered in the negative. In that case, the district court, responding to extensive press coverage of a high-profile criminal matter, issued a sua sponte order directing the parties to submit all future filings under seal in order to permit the court \"to initially review them and to make a determination with regard to disclosure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1144. The trial court subsequently imposed a 48-hour time limit within which it would rule upon the need for a given filing to remain sealed. Id. at 1145. The Ninth Circuit nonetheless struck down the procedure and directed the district court to vacate its order. <i>Id.</i> at 1147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, <i>Associated Press</i> is a horse of a different hue. There, the court of appeals concluded that the trial court had failed to make specific findings showing that \"access to pretrial documents will create a substantial probability of irreparable damage to defendants' fair trial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1146. The presence of such findings here readily distinguishes this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find more helpful the opinion in <i>United States v.

There, the court acknowledged that a high-profile criminal case may \"impose[ ] unique demands on the trial court, and require[ ] the court to establish procedures for dealing effectively, efficiently and fairly with recurring issues such as whether documents should be placed under seal or redacted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 813. This is exactly what transpired here. In response to a cognizable threat to the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights, the district court adopted a practical procedure that enabled it effectively and efficiently to safeguard those rights. Nothing in the case law prevents a court from establishing this sort of prophylaxis. And given the circumstances of this case, the district court's implementation of a general procedure to seal all memoranda temporarily appears narrowly tailored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning our attention to the specifics of the non-dissemination order, we hold that the district court's insistence on reviewing each memorandum before deciding whether it should remain under seal did not constitute reversible error. Although we question the court's apparent reluctance to rely on counsel to separate wheat from chaff in accordance with the non-dissemination order &#8212; experience teaches that most lawyers will cooperate with the court and, in all events, will be loath to defy a court order &#8212; nothing precludes the district court from assuming that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that we regard the non-dissemination order as a textbook model. We have four specific concerns. First, where, as here, a court undertakes to screen documents before they are placed in the case file, the procedure should incorporate a specific timetable obligating the court to perform its self-imposed screening responsibilities promptly and to render a timely decision as to whether a particular document is fit for public disclosure. Second, and relatedly, the court below decided to refrain from reviewing each individual memorandum to decide whether it could be made available to the public until after the time had expired for the submission of any possible reply memorandum. This unnecessarily prolongs the process. Each individual memorandum either contains restricted information (in which case it is subject to redaction or sealing) or it does not (in which case it does not pose a threat to the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights). Third, the order contains no provision as to whether the court intends to unseal retained memoranda at some point after the trial has ended (and if so, when).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we think that the district court's refusal to consider redaction on a document-by-document basis is insupportable. Courts have an obligation to consider all reasonable alternatives to foreclosing the constitutional right of access. <i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 729 F.2d at 56. Redaction constitutes a time-tested means of minimizing any intrusion on that right. <i>See United States v. Amodeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686445\"><a href=\"/opinion/686445/united-states-v-anthony-r-amodeo-sr-chick-president-and-business/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 147 (2d Cir.1995) (stating \"that it is proper for a district court, after weighing competing interests, to edit and redact a judicial document in order to allow access to appropriate portions of the document\"); <i>see also United States v.

The court did say, generally, that \"in those rare cases where counsel find it necessary to refer to grand jury matters or other matters not properly disclosable, those references are almost invariably dispersed throughout the memoranda and inextricably intertwined with the references to applicable legal authority.\" D. Ct. Op. at 13. But the First Amendment requires consideration of the feasibility of redaction on a document-by-document basis, and the court's blanket characterization falls well short of this benchmark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having pointed out these defects in the non-dissemination order, we leave the matter of correction to the district court. Consistent with the core purpose of advisory mandamus, the principal value of our rulings is in terms of future cases. In respect to the Cianci case itself, the court is at the end of a lengthy trial; once the dust has settled, we are confident that the district court will set a reasonable timetable for determining whether previously submitted memoranda are to be placed on file in the clerk's office (with or without redaction); and, as to any memorandum withheld from filing, will enter specific findings as to the need for that restriction and the impracticality of redaction as an alternative to sealing. Within a reasonable time after the Cianci case and all related proceedings have ended &#8212; there is a \"severed\" defendant yet to be tried &#8212; we anticipate that the district court will consider the release of all documents and other materials then remaining under seal. Should the district court fail to act in a timely manner to effectuate the principles endorsed in this opinion&#8212;a contingency that we doubt will occur&#8212;THE JOURNAL is free to petition for ancillary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span> (1975), the Supreme Court concluded that the media has a First Amendment right to publish information contained in court records that are open to public inspection. A few years later, however, the Court rejected the argument that the First Amendment right of access allowed the media to obtain copies of tapes that had been entered into evidence at a criminal trial. <i>Warner Communications,</i> 435 U.S. at 608-10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109830\"><a href=\"/opinion/109830/nixon-v-warner-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Elaborating on this point, the Justices explained that the constitutional right to attend criminal trials morphed into a right to attend the trial sessions at which the tapes were played and to report upon what was seen and heard in the courtroom, but did not confer the right to replicate evidentiary materials in the custody of the court. <i>Id.</i> at 609, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109830\"><a href=\"/opinion/109830/nixon-v-warner-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As in that case, the district court has not restricted media access to, or the publication of, any information in the public domain. Indeed, the district court has gone to great lengths to facilitate access to the trial proceedings by, for example, reserving seats in the courtroom for members of the press and providing an overflow room for remote viewing. By affording interested members of the media ample opportunity to see and hear the tapes as they are played for the jury, the court has fulfilled its pertinent First Amendment obligations. <i>See United States v. Beckham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469117\"><a href=\"/opinion/469117/united-states-v-charles-beckham-v-post-newsweek-stations-michigan-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 407 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The demise of THE JOURNAL'S First Amendment claim does not end the matter. The question remains whether the common-law right to inspect and copy judicial documents affords a basis for relief. As said, this right of access extends to \"materials on which a court relies in determining the litigants' substantive rights.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 805 F.2d at 13. Thus, videotapes and audiotapes on which a court relies in the determination of substantive rights are within its reach. <i>See United States v. Graham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774021\"><a href=\"/opinion/774021/united-states-v-darryl-t-graham-anthony-f-leonardo-jr-albert-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 151-53 (2d Cir.2001). Because the videotapes and audiotapes that THE JOURNAL seeks to copy have been admitted into evidence, they fall into this category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the question reduces to whether the common-law right of access is fulfilled by permitting the press and the public to see and hear such tapes, but not to copy them. To answer this question, THE JOURNAL cites a plethora of instances in which courts have allowed media outlets to obtain copies of tapes used in judicial proceedings. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 155-56; <i>United States v. Myers</i> (<i>In re Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384700\"><a href=\"/opinion/384700/in-re-application-of-national-broadcasting-company-inc-applicants-/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span>, 952-54 (2d Cir.1980). But this compendium only serves to prove that a trial court <i>may</i> allow the media to copy tapes that have been admitted into evidence; none of the constituent cases stands for the much different proposition that a trial court <i>must</i> afford such access.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, this case offers a unique twist. Here, the government has not merely played individual tapes, but, rather, has used cutting-edge technology (the Sanctions software) to play for the jury medleys of selected excerpts from the universe of taped material stored on its laptop computer. As a result, there is no electronic medium &#8212; no tape or CD-ROM &#8212; currently in existence that contains the precise medleys of taped excerpts that have been played in open court. Consequently, we must decide whether the common-law right of access compels a court to create (or order the creation of) a new medium that contains only taped excerpts that have been played in open court. This is a question of first impression at the appellate level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, the common-law right of access permitted the public to copy the contents of written documents. <i>In re Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,</i> 635 F.2d at 950. Over time, the right has been extended to accommodate technological advancements in document reproduction such as photography, photocopying, and the replication of videotapes and audiotapes. <i>Id.</i> Invariably, however, these accommodations have covered materials that are \"in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.\" <i>Id.</i> at 952.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When, as now, the media seeks access to materials that do not exist in readily reproducible form, a new variable enters the equation. We are reluctant to hold that the common-law right of access necessarily compels the creation (and, thus, the copying) of such materials. We prefer instead to leave this decision, like many other decisions as to how best to effectuate the common-law right of access, to the informed discretion of the trial court, so that it may be exercised with due regard for the idiosyncratic facts and circumstances of a specific case. <i>See Warner Communications,</i> 435 U.S. at 599, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109830\"><a href=\"/opinion/109830/nixon-v-warner-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>; <i>Anderson,</i> 805 F.2d at 13. This approach seems especially appropriate here because the task of assessing whether the creation of an excerpt-only recording entails mere reproduction as opposed to extensive editing demands a particularized, fact-intensive inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the ruling below. The district court denied THE JOURNAL'S motion, holding that the common-law right of access did not mandate the creation of something not already in existence (i.e., a tape or CD-ROM containing only those excerpts played in open court) and finding replication infeasible. In this regard, the court made a number of specific findings highlighting difficulties inherent in THE JOURNAL'S proposals for physical access to the taped excerpts. The court concluded, for example, that editing the source material to create a tape or CD-ROM containing only those excerpts played at trial was a far more daunting task than merely duplicating existing source materials. The court also found that the editing required to create tapes or CD-ROMs containing only the hundreds of taped conversations being played in open court would impose an appreciable burden on the court's staff, the parties, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline THE JOURNAL'S invitation to second-guess these findings. In the first place, the parties' representations as to how the software operates and how difficult it would be to reproduce the evidence seen and heard by the jurors are sharply conflicting. As a result, the record before us is hopelessly imprecise &#8212; and the Sanctions software package is not part of it. In the second place, the fact that the public and the press have had ample opportunity to see and hear the evidentiary tapes when those tapes were played in open court during trial takes much of the sting out of the district court's decision. Given these considerations, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying THE JOURNAL'S request to compel the creation and production of excerpt-only tapes or CD-ROMs mimicking the materials actually played to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Cf. Valley Broad. Co. v. United States Dist. Ct.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474913\"><a href=\"/opinion/474913/valley-broadcasting-company-v-united-states-district-court-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1295 &amp; n. 8 (9th Cir.1986) (explaining that substantial administrative burdens alone may justify denial of access).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE JOURNAL has a fallback position. It argues that the medleys of excerpts can be rerecorded as they are played in open court. The district court rejected this proposal based upon the clerk of court's representation that it was infeasible to tap into the audio/video feed to the broadcast monitors to rerecord the materials as they were being played in open court. The clerk explained that consultations with the court's technical staff and representatives of the vendor that had installed the courtroom presentation system had not yielded a practicable and cost-effective method of rerecording the audio/video transmission to the overflow room. The district court accepted this representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE JOURNAL disputes the accuracy of the clerk's conclusion. Its position rests on a supplementary affidavit submitted on the eve of oral argument in this court. That affidavit suggests the existence of what THE JOURNAL describes as a technologically feasible method of rerecording the audio and video excerpts as they are played in open court. We decline to consider this belated proffer. <i>See United States v. Slade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"). THE JOURNAL is, of course, free to ask the district court to evaluate this new proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A high-profile, multi-defendant political corruption case is bound to test the mettle of the most experienced trial judge. We admire the manner in which Chief Judge Torres has responded to that challenge. Although we, with a luxury of time that district judges rarely enjoy, have concluded that the court's non-dissemination order must be modified in certain respects, that conclusion in no way detracts from our overall assessment of the district court's exemplary performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we strike down the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy for the handling of legal memoranda. We uphold the district court's non-dissemination order, but direct the court, should it enter such orders in future cases, to include certain specified safeguards. As to the Cianci case itself, we leave the specifies of corrective action to the district court, consistent with the teachings of this opinion. Finally, we deem the district court's refusal to provide THE JOURNAL with copies of videotapes and audiotapes an appropriate exercise of the court's discretion, given the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This was not THE JOURNAL'S first expression of dissatisfaction with the district court's handling of access to documents in the Cianci case. THE JOURNAL earlier had sought access to an FBI agent's affidavit submitted in support of a request for a search warrant. Based upon its determination that public disclosure of the affidavit's contents prior to trial would prejudice the defendants' Sixth Amendment rights, the district court denied THE JOURNAL'S motion<i>United States v. Cianci,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419133\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419133/united-states-v-cianci/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 198, 205 (D.R.I.2001).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although the non-dissemination order applied to more than legal memoranda (e.g., it imposed stringent restrictions on extrajudicial statements by the parties and their counsel), THE JOURNAL has only challenged the order insofar as it pertains to the treatment of legal memoranda. Consequently, we express no opinion anent any other feature of the non-dissemination order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Along with its mandamus petitions, THE JOURNAL prudently filed a protective appeal. In view of our decision to exercise mandamus jurisdiction, we will follow the course charted in<i>In re Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 920 F.2d at 90, and enter a separate order dismissing that appeal as moot.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This holding comports with case law from our sister circuits<i>E.g., United States v. Biaggi</i> (<i>In re N.Y. Times</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493896\"><a href=\"/opinion/493896/in-re-the-matter-of-the-new-york-times-company-new-york-news-inc-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 114 (2d Cir.1987); <i>United States v. Soussoudis</i> (<i>In re Wash. Post Co.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480562\"><a href=\"/opinion/480562/in-re-washington-post-company-reporters-committee-for-freedom-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 389-90 (4th Cir.1986). We note, however, that the Supreme Court has not yet passed upon whether the constitutional right of access in criminal proceedings extends to judicial records.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the Supreme Court has not established whether the constitutional right of access attaches to civil cases in general, the common-law right of access extends to judicial records in civil proceedings<i>Standard Fin. Mgmt.,</i> 830 F.2d at 408 &amp; n. 4. As said, that right encompasses legal memoranda. Because none of the respondent's rationales for rendering legal memoranda presumptively nonpublic rise to the level of a compelling reason sufficient to justify the nondisclosure of those documents, our invalidation of the District of Rhode Island's blanket nonfiling policy vis-a-vis legal memoranda applies in civil as well as criminal proceedings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We understand that written transcripts of the tapes have been marked as exhibits for identification in the Cianci trial. At first blush, it would seem that providing the media with copies of these transcripts might represent a relatively straightforward means of furthering access without imposing any significant burden upon the district court or the litigants. THE JOURNAL, however, did not raise the matter of the transcripts in either of its mandamus petitions, and, therefore, we decline to order this relief<i>Cf. Pratt v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197639\"><a href=\"/opinion/197639/pratt-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1997) (\"It is firmly settled in this circuit that arguments not advanced and developed in an appellant's brief are deemed waived.\").</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
