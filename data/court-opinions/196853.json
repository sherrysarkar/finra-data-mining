In  No. 96-1048, plaintiff  Alfred Gallant\r                           \r\n\nappeals  from a court  order dated December  20, 1995 denying\r\n\nhis  motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP).  As plaintiff\r                                                    \r\n\npaid the filing fee  that same day, his appeal  is frivolous.\r\n\nPlaintiff's  motions to  proceed  IFP on  appeal are  denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\nappellee's motion for summary disposition is allowed, and the\r                                                                \r\n\nchallenged district  court order is summarily  affirmed.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLoc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n     In  No.  96-1162,  plaintiff  appeals  from  a  judgment\r\n\ndismissing, on the ground  of frivolousness, his action under\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983  against the state court judge  who presided\r\n\nover his state  habeas proceedings.  For  the reasons recited\r\n\nby  the district court in  its order dated  February 7, 1996,\r\n\nthe  judgment  is summarily  affirmed.    See Loc.  R.  27.1.\r                                                         \r\n\nPlaintiff's  motions  to  proceed   IFP  on  appeal  and  for\r\n\nappointment of counsel are denied.  \r                                             \r\n\n     In  No.  96-1005,  plaintiff  seeks  a  certificate   of\r\n\nprobable   cause in order to appeal from the district court's\r\n\ndenial  of his petition for a writ  of habeas corpus.  Having\r\n\nreviewed the record in full, we discern only one issue of any\r\n\nconceivable  merit: whether  plaintiff was  improperly denied\r\n\nhis   Sixth  Amendment  right  of  self-representation  under\r\n\nFaretta  v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).  The trial court\r                                  \r\n\nrejected this claim on the ground that plaintiff's request to\r\n\nproceed pro se had not been \"intelligently\" made; it noted in\r                          \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthis  regard  that   plaintiff  was  suffering  from   mental\r\n\nimpairments  and had  disavowed any  intention of  mounting a\r\n\ndefense  in order to \"protest\"  what he regarded  as a \"sham\"\r\n\ntrial.  The  Maine Supreme Judicial  Court (SJC) affirmed  on\r\n\nthe   ground  that   plaintiff's   request   had   not   been\r\n\n\"unequivocally\"  advanced.   See State  v. Gallant,  595 A.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n413,  416 (Me.  1991).   As  we find  that the  trial court's\r\n\nrationale is immune from challenge in a federal habeas corpus\r\n\nproceeding,  we need not address the grounds relied on by the\r\n\nSJC. \r\n\n     A review of the record makes clear that the trial court,\r\n\nalthough deeming plaintiff mentally competent to stand trial,\r\n\nconsidered  him  mentally   incompetent  to  defend   himself\r\n\neffectively.  Such  a determination runs afoul  of Godinez v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMoran, 509 U.S.  389 (1993),  where the Court  held that  the\r                 \r\n\ncompetency  standard  for waiving  the  right  to counsel  is\r\n\nidentical  to  that  for  standing trial.    Yet  plaintiff's\r\n\nconviction and sentence had become final prior to issuance of\r\n\nthe Godinez decision.  And the  Godinez holding, we conclude,\r                                                   \r\n\nconstitutes a \"new rule\" that, under Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n288  (1989), cannot  be  applied retroactively  by a  federal\r\n\nhabeas court. \r\n\n     \"[A] case announces  a new  rule if the  result was  not\r\n\ndictated by  precedent existing  at the time  the defendant's\r                    \r\n\nconviction became final.\"  Caspari v. Bohlen, 114 S. Ct. 948,\r                                                        \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n953  (1994) (quoting Teague, 489 U.S. at 301).  \"The question\r                                       \r\n\nis 'whether a state court considering [the defendant's] claim\r\n\nat  the time  his  conviction became  final  would have  felt\r\n\ncompelled  by existing  precedent to  conclude that  the rule\r\n\n[he]  seeks was  required by  the Constitution.'\"   Goeke  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nBranch, 115  S. Ct. 1275,  1277 (1995) (per  curiam) (quoting\r                  \r\n\nSaffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 488 (1990)).  \r                           \r\n\n     Here, we cannot say that the state court would have felt\r\n\ncompelled,  prior  to Godinez,  to  deem  the two  competency\r                                         \r\n\nstandards  equivalent.    The  Godinez  Court  itself,  after\r                                                  \r\n\nsurveying  the caselaw, took note of the divergent views that\r\n\nthen prevailed.   See 509 U.S. at 395 n.5.   And this circuit\r                                 \r\n\nwas one  of the ones there identified as adhering to the view\r\n\nthat  the two  competency standards  might not  be identical.\r\n\nSee  United States v. Campbell,  874 F.2d 838,  846 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1989) (observing that \"the competency required to stand trial\r\n\nmay not always be coterminous with the  capacity necessary to\r\n\nproceed pro se\") (quoted in part in Godinez, 509 U.S. at  395\r                                                       \r\n\nn.5); see also  United States  v. Pryor, 960  F.2d 1, 2  (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1992) (finding of competency to waive counsel \"more than\r\n\ncovered\" competency to stand trial). \r\n\n     In turn, neither  of the \"two  narrow exceptions to  the\r\n\nnonretroactivity  principle\" applies here.   Caspari,  114 S.\r                                                                \r\n\nCt.  at 956.   The  first pertains  to  new rules  that place\r\n\ncertain types  of private  conduct \"beyond  the power of  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncriminal law-making authority to proscribe,\" Teague, 489 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 307 (internal quotation  omitted); this is inapplicable on\r\n\nits  face.    The  second pertains  to  \"watershed  rules  of\r\n\ncriminal procedure implicating  the fundamental fairness  and\r\n\naccuracy of the criminal proceeding.\"  Caspari, 114 S. Ct. at\r                                                          \r\n\n956 (internal quotations omitted).  It is not certain whether\r\n\nFaretta itself  would fit  into this  second category.1   But\r                                                                  1\r                   \r\n\nhowever this may be,  it is apparent to  us that the  Godinez\r                                                                         \r\n\ndecision,  which simply  fine-tunes  the competency  standard\r\n\nunderlying   Faretta,   is   not   \"such   a   groundbreaking\r                                \r\n\noccurrence,\"  Caspari, 114 S. Ct.  at 956, as  to trigger the\r                                 \r\n\nsecond Teague exception.\r                         \r\n\n     We have considered plaintiff's remaining allegations and\r\n\nfind  them  even less  availing.    Accordingly, inasmuch  as\r\n\nplaintiff has  failed to make  a \"substantial showing  of the\r\n\ndenial of  a federal  right,\" Barefoot  v. Estelle, 463  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n880,  893  (1983),  the  application  for  a  certificate  of\r\n\nprobable cause is denied  and the appeal is terminated.   The\r                                                                  \r\n\nmotions  to  proceed on  appeal  IFP and  for  appointment of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1   The Sixth Amendment right  to self-representation, for\r               1\r\nall  its importance  in upholding  \"the inestimable  worth of\r\nfree  choice,\"  Faretta, 422  U.S.  at  834, is  plainly  not\r                                   \r\ndesigned  to enhance  the  reliability  of the  truth-finding\r\nprocess;  as  the  Faretta  Court noted,  \"in  most  criminal\r                                      \r\nprosecutions  defendants could  better defend  with counsel's\r\nguidance than by  their own unskilled efforts,\"  id.  Indeed,\r                                                                \r\nvarious  courts declined  to give  retroactive effect  to the\r\nFaretta  decision itself  primarily  for this  reason.

For the reasons recited by the district court in its order dated February 7, 1996, the judgment is summarily affirmed.   See Loc.  R. 27.1.

Having reviewed the record in full, we discern only one issue of any conceivable merit:  whether plaintiff was improperly denied his Sixth Amendment right of self-representation under Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).   The trial court rejected this claim on the ground that plaintiff's request to proceed pro se had not been \"intelligently\" made;  it noted in this regard that plaintiff was suffering from mental impairments and had disavowed any intention of mounting a defense in order to \"protest\" what he regarded as a \"sham\" trial.   The Maine Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed on the ground that plaintiff's request had not been \"unequivocally\" advanced.  See State v. Gallant, 595 A.2d 413, 416 (Me.1991).

Yet plaintiff's conviction and sentence had become final prior to issuance of the Godinez decision.   And the Godinez holding, we conclude, constitutes a \"new rule\" that, under Teague v.

The Godinez Court itself, after surveying the caselaw, took note of the divergent views that then prevailed.   See 509 U.S. at 395 n. 5.

It is not certain whether Faretta itself would fit into this second category.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  But however this may be, it is apparent to us that the Godinez decision, which simply fine-tunes the competency standard underlying Faretta, is not \"such a groundbreaking occurrence,\" Caspari, 114 S.Ct. at 956, as to trigger the second Teague exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered plaintiff's remaining allegations and find them even less availing.

As plaintiff paid the filing fee that same day, his appeal is frivolous.   Plaintiff's motions to proceed IFP on appeal are denied, appellee's motion for summary disposition is allowed, and the challenged district court order is summarily affirmed.   See Loc.

For the reasons recited by the district court in its order dated February 7, 1996, the judgment is summarily affirmed.   See Loc.  R. 27.1.   Plaintiff's motions to proceed IFP on appeal and for appointment of counsel are denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In No. 96-1005, plaintiff seeks a certificate of probable cause in order to appeal from the district court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.   Having reviewed the record in full, we discern only one issue of any conceivable merit:  whether plaintiff was improperly denied his Sixth Amendment right of self-representation under Faretta v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span> (1975).   The trial court rejected this claim on the ground that plaintiff's request to proceed pro se had not been \"intelligently\" made;  it noted in this regard that plaintiff was suffering from mental impairments and had disavowed any intention of mounting a defense in order to \"protest\" what he regarded as a \"sham\" trial.   The Maine Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed on the ground that plaintiff's request had not been \"unequivocally\" advanced.  See State v. Gallant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2179292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2179292/state-v-gallant/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 416 (Me.1991).
