Brady Violation\r                                         \r\n\n          The first argument is that the government's failure\r\n\nto disclose prior  to trial the identity  of the confidential\r\n\ninformant Miguel Morel, violated  Brady v.

[T]he decision to\r\n\nadmit the testimony or  evidence is within the  discretion of\r\n\nthe  trial judge.\"   United States v.  Reis, 788  F.2d 54, 58\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1986); see  also United States v.

Morel testified  on  cross-examination  that  the\r\n\nmoney  he earned  as an  informant for  the Drug  Enforcement\r\n\nAdministration  (\"DEA\") was his main source  of income.  Even\r\n\nnow, appellant has failed to identify any additional evidence\r\n\nthat  could have been  used to  further impeach  the witness.\r\n\nThe  government's failure to  disclose Morel's identity prior\r\n\nto trial does not undermine confidence in the jury's verdict.\r\n\nSee  Kyles, 115  S. Ct.  at 1566.   Therefore,  there was  no\r                      \r\n\nconstitutional violation.\r\n\n          II.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r                                                      \r\n\n          To establish  a violation of  21 U.S.C.    846, the\r\n\ngovernment is required to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, in\r\n\naddition to the existence of the conspiracy itself, an intent\r\n\non the  part  of the  defendant:   \"to  agree and  . .  .  to\r\n\neffectuate  the commission  of  the substantive  offense.   A\r\n\ndefendant need not have  had the intent personally  to commit\r\n\nthe substantive crime.\"  United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611,\r                                                           \r\n\n615  (1st Cir. 1994), cert.  denied, 115 S.  Ct. 1118 (1995).\r                                               \r\n\nThe government establishes  the requisite  intent by  proving\r\n\nbeyond  a reasonable  doubt that  the defendant  \"agree[d] to\r\n\nundertake  activities  that  facilitate[d]  commission  of  a\r\n\nsubstantive offense, [notwithstanding that he did] not intend\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nto  commit  the offense  himself.\"   Id.1   \"[T]he Government\r                                                    1\r                                                    \r\n\nneed  not  prove   the  commission  of  any  overt   acts  in\r\n\nfurtherance of  the conspiracy.\"   United States  v. Shabani,\r                                                                        \r\n\n115 S. Ct. 382, 385 (1994).\r\n\n          \"When a criminal defendant undertakes a sufficiency\r\n\nchallenge, all the evidence,  direct and circumstantial, must\r\n\nbe viewed  from the  government's coign  of vantage, and  the\r\n\nviewer must accept all reasonable inferences from it that are\r\n\nconsistent  with the  verdict.\"   United States v.  Valle, 72\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 210, 216  (1st Cir.  1995). The  government's burden  of\r\n\nproof \"may  be satisfied  by either direct  or circumstantial\r\n\nevidence,  or any  combination  thereof.\"   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r                   \r\n\n          The evidence  presented to the jury  was sufficient\r\n\nto sustain defendant's guilty  verdict.  The record contains,\r\n\namong  other evidence, accounts  of frequent meetings between\r\n\nMorel, Domingo Peguero and  appellant in which they discussed\r\n\ndrugs and,  specifically, ways to \"make  some transactions of\r\n\ncrack.\"   Morel  recounted a  specific conversation  in which\r\n\nappellant said that  he had  contacts in New  York who  could\r\n\nsupply crack  to Morel's  contacts in  Boston.   The evidence\r\n\nalso  included  the  transcript  of  a  telephone  call  from\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Defendant  argues that  the  evidence does  not show  \"an\r               1\r\nintent  on  the defendant's  part to  engage  in the  sale of\r\ncrack.\" Appellant's  Brief,  p.  15.    No  such  showing  is\r\nrequired,however.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nappellant to Morel, made  for the purpose of  notifying Morel\r\n\nthat Peguero was in Boston \"doing business\" and that \"in case\r\n\nthese  people call you, tell  them to hold  on until Monday.\"\r\n\nDEA  agents  testified  that   during  the  October  30  drug\r\n\ntransaction, appellant was circlingthe area in Peguero's car.\r\n\n          \"[I]t is not a pre-requisite of conviction that the\r\n\nprosecution  adduce  evidence to  preclude  'every reasonable\r\n\nhypothesis of innocence.'\"  United States v.  Montas, 41 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n775,  779  (1st Cir.  1994), cert.  denied,  115 S.  Ct. 1986\r                                                      \r\n\n(1995).     In  addition,   this  court  must   \"resolve  all\r\n\ncredibility disputes in the  verdict's favor.\"  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Taylor, 54  F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir. 1995).   Our review of\r                     \r\n\nthe record persuades us that a rational jury could have found\r\n\nbeyond   a  reasonable   doubt   that   the  government   had\r\n\nsuccessfully proved the essential elements  of the conspiracy\r\n\ncharge.\r\n\n          III.  Failure to Grant Mistrial\r                                                     \r\n\n          Appellant's  final argument  is  that the  district\r\n\ncourt  erred  in  not  granting  a mistrial  because  of  the\r\n\ntestimony by DEA agent John D. Adams that  he had purchased a\r\n\nfirearm  from  Peguero.    \"[B]ecause  mistrials  are  strong\r\n\nmedicine,  . .  .  it  is only  rarely  --  and in  extremely\r\n\ncompelling circumstances -- that an appellate panel, informed\r\n\nby a cold record, will venture to reverse a trial judge's on-\r\n\nthe-spot  decision  that  the  interests of  justice  do  not\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nrequire aborting an ongoing trial.\"  United States v. Pierro,\r                                                                        \r\n\n32 F.3d  611, 617 (1st Cir.  1994), cert. denied,  115 S. Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n919 (1995).   In United  States v. Sepulveda,  15 F.3d  1161,\r                                                        \r\n\n1184-85  (1st Cir.  1993),  cert.  denied,  114 S.  Ct.  2714\r                                                     \r\n\n(1994), this  court identified  three factors that  should be\r\n\nconsidered in reviewing a district court's decision to deny a\r\n\nmistrial: 1) the appropriateness of the curative instruction,\r\n\n2)  the  swiftness  of  the  judicial  response, and  3)  the\r\n\npresumption  that  jurors  will  follow  a   direct  curative\r\n\ninstruction.\r\n\n          In  this case, consideration of the three Sepulveda\r                                                                         \r\n\nfactors indicates  that there was  no abuse of  discretion in\r\n\nthe  district  court's decision  to  deny a  mistrial  or its\r\n\nfailure to  revisit the issue  sua sponte  at the end  of the\r                                                     \r\n\ntrial.    The  court's  curative instructions,  given  almost\r\n\nimmediately after  the  testimony in  question,  were  swift,\r\n\nclear and direct.  There was no room for misinterpretation by\r\n\nthe jurors regarding the meaning of the court's instructions.\r\n\nFinally, appellant's claim that  the evidence against him was\r\n\nso weak that  the jurors  must have relied  upon the  firearm\r\n\ntestimony is belied by  the record.  As discussed  above, the\r\n\nevidence was sufficient to support the conviction.  Appellant\r\n\nhas failed  to rebut the  presumption that the  jury followed\r\n\nthe court's curative instructions.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n          Appellant's  conviction is summarily affirmed.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLoc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n",

Whitley, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1565 (1995).   The Brady rule does not require the prosecution to reveal before trial the names of all witnesses who will testify against the defendant.  See Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977).  \"There is no requirement under F.R.Crim.

Even now, appellant has failed to identify any additional evidence that could have been used to further impeach the witness.   The government's failure to disclose Morel's identity prior to trial does not undermine confidence in the jury's verdict.  See Kyles, 115 S.Ct. at 1566.

Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1184-85 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 2714 (1994), this court identified three factors that should be considered in reviewing a district court's decision to deny a mistrial:  1) the appropriateness of the curative instruction, 2) the swiftness of the judicial response, and 3) the presumption that jurors will follow a direct curative instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, consideration of the three Sepulveda factors indicates that there was no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision to deny a mistrial or its failure to revisit the issue sua sponte at the end of the trial.   The court's curative instructions, given almost immediately after the testimony in question, were swift, clear and direct.   There was no room for misinterpretation by the jurors regarding the meaning of the court's instructions.   Finally, appellant's claim that the evidence against him was so weak that the jurors must have relied upon the firearm testimony is belied by the record.

Brady Violation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first argument is that the government's failure to disclose prior to trial the identity of the confidential informant Miguel Morel, violated Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span> (1963).  \"[F]avorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, 'if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.' \"  Kyles v. Whitley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span>, 1565 (1995).   The Brady rule does not require the prosecution to reveal before trial the names of all witnesses who will testify against the defendant.  See Weatherford v. Bursey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109590\"><a href=\"/opinion/109590/weatherford-v-bursey/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 559 (1977).  \"There is no requirement under F.R.Crim. P. 16 or otherwise in the law, mandating the disclosure to the defense of the identity of the government's trial witnesses....  [T]he decision to admit the testimony or evidence is within the discretion of the trial judge.\"  United States v. Reis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468533\"><a href=\"/opinion/468533/united-states-v-daniel-reis/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1986);  see also United States v. Edwards, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689162\"><a href=\"/opinion/689162/united-states-v-albert-edwards-and-terry-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span>, 843 (7th Cir.1995) (\"It is well-settled that the Constitution does not require pretrial disclosure of prosecution witnesses.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has failed to show a reasonable probability that if he had been informed of Morel's identity prior to trial, the result of the proceeding would have been different.   Morel testified on cross-examination that the money he earned as an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") was his main source of income.   Even now, appellant has failed to identify any additional evidence that could have been used to further impeach the witness.   The government's failure to disclose Morel's identity prior to trial does not undermine confidence in the jury's verdict.  See Kyles, 115 S.Ct. at 1566.   Therefore, there was no constitutional violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish a violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, the government is required to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, in addition to the existence of the conspiracy itself, an intent on the part of the defendant:  \"to agree and ... to effectuate the commission of the substantive offense.   A defendant need not have had the intent personally to commit the substantive crime.\"  United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></span> (1995).
