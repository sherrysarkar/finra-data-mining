Masteralexis for appellant.\r\nRobert P. Corcoran, with whom Gleeson &amp; Corcoran was on brief,\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n               April 9, 1999\r\n                                           SHADUR, Senior District Judge.  This labor dispute\r\npresents a collision at the intersection of judicial doctrines that\r\nin this instance would operate at cross-purposes:  on the one hand\r\nthe doctrine of complete federal preemption, and on the other hand\r\nboth the limitations on that doctrine and the independent principle\r\nof judicial estoppel.  Appellant Joseph Lydon (\"Lydon\") has sought\r\nto resolve his quarrel with his employer, appellee Boston Sand and\r\nGravel Co. (\"Boston Sand\"), in two successive forums:  first by an\r\nattempted arbitration between Lydon's union and Boston Sand\r\npursuant to their collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"), and then\r\nby Lydon's lawsuit in a Massachusetts state court pursuant to that\r\nstate's workers' compensation laws.  \r\nWhen Lydon initially filed his grievance under the CBA,\r\nleading in turn to the union's invocation of the arbitration\r\nremedy, Boston Sand successfully argued before the arbitrator that\r\nthe parties had already agreed his claims should instead be decided\r\nunder state statutes.  When Lydon then did file suit in a state\r\ncourt, Boston Sand removed the case to federal court, urging that\r\nLydon's state law claims were preempted by federal labor laws.\r\nFinding that the state law claims were indeed preempted,\r\nthe district court entered a summary judgment of dismissal in favor\r\nof Boston Sand.  For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold\r\nthat while Lydon's claims might ordinarily be preempted, they are\r\nnot preempted here because of Boston Sand's prior litigating\r\nposition.  We therefore remand this case to the district court with\r\na direction that it be remanded to the state court of origin.\r\n                    Facts\r\nBoston Sand hired Lydon as a cement truck driver in 1984. \r\nIn July 1991 Lydon suffered a work-related neck injury that\r\nprevented him from working.  He received weekly workers'\r\ncompensation payments until May 1993, when he settled his claim and\r\nreceived a lump sum payment that was projected to cover four years\r\nof weekly payments based on Lydon's expected period of disability.\r\nDuring those four years Lydon was presumed as a matter of\r\nMassachusetts law (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152,  148) to be unable to\r\nwork.  Nonetheless Lydon did some driving for another concrete\r\ncompany, Sherman Concrete, from fall 1993 to spring 1995.\r\nIn April 1995 Lydon attempted to return to work for\r\nBoston Sand.  After a physician determined that he was physically\r\nable to do so, Lydon met with Vice President David McNeil\r\n(\"McNeil\") and attempted to substantiate his physical ability to\r\nreturn to work by noting his interim job with Sherman Concrete. \r\nMcNeil informed Lydon that because he had worked for another\r\ncompany for a year and a half, Boston Sand considered Lydon to have\r\nquit his job and forfeited his seniority rights.  Lydon's union,\r\nTeamsters Local 379, then presented a written request for Lydon's\r\nreinstatement, which Boston Sand denied.\r\nThat request led to an exchange of letters between the\r\nunion's attorneys and Boston Sand's attorneys.  In December 1995\r\nunion attorney Paul Kelly (\"Kelly\") wrote to Boston Sand attorney\r\nRobert Corcoran (\"Corcoran\") that a worker who received a lump sum\r\nsettlement and was absent from work because of the state statutory\r\npresumption of incapacity, but who then wished to return to work,\r\nhad no remedy under the CBA and that such a claim can arise only\r\nunder statutory law.  Corcoran responded the following month by\r\nagreeing with Kelly's assessment but taking it a step further,\r\nstating:\r\n  It is Boston Sand's position that an\r\n  injured worker claiming a right of\r\n  reinstatement following a lump sum\r\n  settlement can assert such a claim only in\r\n  court under the statute, and not as a\r\n  grievance under the contract.\r\n\nKelly confirmed a few weeks later by writing back that the union\r\nwas in agreement that \"the reinstatement rights of workers who\r\nenter into lump sum agreements are not covered by the collective\r\nbargaining agreement and, as such, must be asserted in judicial\r\nproceedings.\"\r\nAfter the May 1997 expiration of the four-year statutory\r\npresumption of Lydon's incapacity to work, his private attorney\r\nthreatened to sue Boston Sand under the state workers' compensation\r\nstatute.  That threat led to negotiations that resulted in Lydon's\r\nreturning to work on August 11, 1997, but with seniority preference\r\nonly over those hired in or after July 1997.  That minimal\r\npreference left Lydon significantly farther down on the seniority\r\nlist--with an accompanying loss of benefits--than he would have\r\nbeen if he had been reinstated with the seniority rights of his\r\noriginal 1984 date of hire.\r\nOn August 17, 1997 the union filed a grievance against\r\nBoston Sand, claiming that its refusal to grant Lydon seniority\r\nbased on his 1984 date of hire violated the CBA.  That grievance\r\nproceeded to arbitration, where the arbitrator held that the\r\ndispute was not arbitrable because the parties had previously\r\nagreed (in the already-described 1995-96 exchange of letters) that\r\nreinstatement rights, which the arbitrator determined included both\r\nrehiring and seniority, were not covered by the CBA and could be\r\nenforced only under state statutes.  In the face of the explicit\r\nreferences to \"reinstatement rights\" in the letters, the arbitrator\r\nrejected Lydon's argument that the 1995-96 agreement covered only\r\nrehiring and not seniority.  Further, the arbitrator agreed\r\nsubstantively with the parties' exchange of letters in finding that\r\nthe CBA did not at all address the rights of workers who received\r\nlump sump settlements, so that it could not be considered\r\ninconsistent with the state statute.\r\nLydon then filed a civil suit in Massachusetts state\r\ncourt, claiming that Boston Sand violated Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152,\r\n75A and 75B because it discriminated against him by failing to\r\nreinstate his original seniority rights when he started back to\r\nwork.  As stated earlier, Boston Sand removed the suit to federal\r\ncourt on the predicate that the state law claims were preempted by\r\nSection 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.  185\r\n(\"Section 301\").\r\nLydon's appeal disputes the district court's entry of \r\nsummary judgment in favor of Boston Sand on that ground.  As\r\nalways, our review of the district court's award of summary\r\njudgment is de novo (Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry., 100 F.3d\r\n228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996)).\r\n             Preemption Doctrine\r\nCertain aspects of federal labor law have long been\r\nconstrued to preempt the field--they not only provide for federal\r\njurisdiction over contract disputes but also prohibit certain state\r\nlaw actions in the same subject area.  In the labor law context,\r\nthe statutory foundation for such complete preemption is found in\r\nSection 301(a):\r\nSuits for violation of contracts between\r\nan employer and a labor organization\r\nrepresenting employees in an industry\r\naffecting commerce as defined in this\r\nchapter . . . may be brought in any\r\ndistrict court of the United States having\r\njurisdiction of the parties, without\r\nrespect to the amount in controversy or\r\nwithout regard to the citizenship of the\r\nparties.\r\n\nFrom those simple words, a complex preemption\r\njurisprudence has grown in stages.  Initially state courts were\r\nsimply prevented from applying local rather than federal law in\r\ndeciding contract disputes about CBAs (see Teamsters Local 174 v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95 (1962)), but then the doctrine was\r\nextended to preempt state law remedies whenever resolution of a\r\nplaintiff's claim is substantially dependent on analysis of a CBA's\r\nterms (Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202 (1985)).  Such\r\npreemption is necessary, according to the Supreme Court, to retain\r\nconsistency in the interpretation of terms common to CBAs and to\r\nprevent parties from relabeling as state law claims their actions\r\nthat in actuality arise under a CBA (see, e.g., Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U.S. 107, 122-23 (1994)).\r\nNonetheless the doctrine does not preclude all state law\r\nclaims that are somehow linked to a labor dispute.  Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S. 399, 405-06 (1988)\r\n(emphasis added) states the test for determining whether a\r\nparticular state remedy has been preempted by federal law:\r\n[I]f the resolution of a state-law claim\r\ndepends upon the meaning of a collective-\r\nbargaining agreement, the application of\r\nstate law (which might lead to\r\ninconsistent results since there could be\r\nas many state-law principles as there are\r\nStates) is pre-empted and federal labor-\r\nlaw principles--necessarily uniform\r\nthroughout the Nation--must be employed to\r\nresolve the dispute.\r\n\nMere parallelism between a state law claim and a federal contract\r\nclaim does not necessarily require state court interpretation of\r\nthe CBA--that is, as long as the state claim can be resolved\r\nwithout construing the agreement itself, it is not preempted by\r\nSection 301 (id. at 409-10).  Furthermore, \"the bare fact that a\r\ncollective-bargaining agreement will be consulted in the course of\r\nstate-law litigation plainly does not require the claim to be\r\nextinguished\" (Livadas, 512 U.S. at 124, citing and thereafter\r\nquoting from Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413 n.12).  \r\nCourts confronted with state law claims must therefore\r\nlocate the line between the need for mere consultation of a CBA,\r\nwhich does not demand federal preemption, and more active\r\ninterpretation of that agreement, which does preempt the state law\r\nclaims.  As we have said of that dichotomy, \"[o]ur premise is that\r\nthis means a real interpretive dispute\" (Martin v. Shaw's\r\nSupermarkets, Inc., 105 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 1997)(emphasis in\r\noriginal)).  Our task here, then, is to determine the extent to\r\nwhich the analysis of Lydon's state causes of action under Sections\r\n75A and 75B is dependent on the CBA.\r\nWe have twice before addressed the preemptive effect of\r\nfederal labor law over those same state provisions.  In Martin, 105\r\nF.3d at 44 we found both Sections 75A and 75B preempted by federal\r\nlabor law, and in Magerer v. John Sexton &amp; Co., 912 F.2d 525, 529-\r\n30 (1st Cir. 1990) we found Section 75B preempted.  Both  cases\r\nfound the claims preempted because of a proviso present in each\r\nstatutory section:\r\nIn the event that any right set forth in\r\nthis section is inconsistent with an\r\napplicable collective bargaining\r\nagreement, such agreement will prevail.\r\n\nMartin, 105 F.3d at 44 and Magerer, 912 F.2d at 529\r\nreasoned that the quoted provision required courts to interpret the\r\nrelevant CBA to determine whether it was inconsistent with the\r\nstate statute.  So even if the state cause of action did not itself\r\nrequire the court to construe the CBA, the inconsistency clauses of\r\nthe state statutes would require such interpretation.  Thus, for\r\nexample, Martin's state claims were held preempted \"not because the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the state\r\nclaims asserted, but because it may be so and requires\r\ninterpretation\" (Martin, 105 F.3d at 44 (emphasis in original)). \r\nMartin recognized that its analysis would result in preemption of\r\nSection 75A and 75B claims in some troubling cases that would not\r\notherwise be precluded (id.).  But it went on to observe that\r\neither the legislature or the unions could avoid that problem by\r\nmodifying the statutes or the CBAs (id.)--neither of which occurred\r\nin this case.  Accordingly, Boston Sand urges this Court to follow\r\nthe rationale of Martin and Magerer and to find Lydon's claims\r\npreempted as well.\r\nMatters are not so easy as Boston Sand would have it, for\r\nthis case presents an interesting twist to the preemption analysis: \r\nHere the arbitrator chosen by the parties has already held--\r\npointing expressly to Boston Sand's attorney Corcoran's letter\r\ntaking that position--that the parties had agreed in 1995-96 that\r\nthe CBA did not apply to (indeed, did not even attempt to address)\r\nLydon's claims.  Furthermore, the arbitrator (on whom the parties\r\nhave conferred the authority to interpret the CBA) found that\r\nbecause the CBA did not purport to cover reinstatement of workers\r\nwho received lump sum settlements for a workers' compensation\r\nclaim, the CBA and the statute could not be inconsistent.\r\nWith that conclusion having been arrived at pursuant to\r\nthe parties' agreement, neither the district court nor we have any\r\noccasion to interpret the CBA or the parties' 1995-96 letter-based\r\nagreement to determine the already-resolved question of whether the\r\nstate statutory remedies are consistent or inconsistent with those\r\nprovided in the CBA.  That determination has already been made--\r\nfirst by the parties, then by the arbitrator.  Neither Martin nor\r\nMagerer requires us to find Lydon's claims preempted.\r\nBoston Sand further argues, however, that the substance\r\nof Lydon's discrimination claims would require more than mere\r\nreference to the CBA.  It argues that resolution of the state law\r\nclaims would require both reliance on a duty created by the CBA \r\nand interpretation of the CBA's seniority provisions.  In an effort\r\nto support that contention, Boston Sand cites Flibotte v. Pennsylvania Truck Lines, Inc., 131 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1997):\r\nA state-law claim can \"depend\" on the\r\n\"meaning\" of a collective bargaining\r\nagreement in two ways.  First, a claim so\r\nqualifies if it alleges conduct that\r\narguably constitutes a breach of a duty\r\nthat arises pursuant to a collective\r\nbargaining agreement.  See United\r\nSteelworkers v. Rawson, 495 U.S. 362, 369\r\n(1990)(\"[A] state-law tort action against\r\nan employer may be pre-empted by  301 if\r\nthe duty to the employee of which the tort\r\nis a violation is created by a\r\ncollective-bargaining agreement and\r\nwithout existence independent of the\r\nagreement.\").  Second, a claim so\r\nqualifies if its resolution arguably\r\nhinges upon an interpretation of the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement.  SeeAllis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S.\r\n202, 220 (1985)(finding section 301\r\npreemption \"when resolution of a state-law\r\nclaim is substantially dependent upon\r\nanalysis of the term of an agreement made\r\nbetween the parties in a labor contract\"). \r\nIf a state-law claim depends on the\r\nmeaning of the collective bargaining\r\nagreement in either of these ways--that\r\nis, under Rawson's \"duty\" rubric or under\r\nAllis-Chalmers's \"interpretation\"\r\nrubric--it is preempted.\r\n\nBoston Sand's position seeks to draw force from the first\r\nof those alternatives and the notion that seniority rights\r\ntypically stem from a CBA.  But again the situation before us\r\ndiffers materially from that norm, because Boston Sand has\r\npreviously agreed with the union as Lydon's representative that the\r\nCBA did not address the statutory workers' compensation issues--\r\nthat only the state statute does that and defines Lydon's rights--\r\nand because the arbitrator found that agreement (including the\r\nconsequent rights that define Lydon's place in the workforce)\r\nbinding.\r\nIndeed, the parties' express agreement that the CBA does\r\nnot cover their dispute operates here just as any stipulation about\r\nany other legal issue in a case would.  For example, had the\r\nparties stipulated in 1995 to a definition of seniority rights\r\nwithout reference to the preexisting CBA, that stipulation would\r\ncontinue to bind them at this stage of the proceedings.  Neither\r\nparty could now attempt to rely on a different definition of the\r\nterm.  In the same way, both sides here have agreed that the CBA\r\ndid not even address the issues at stake between them.  Just so,\r\none party--Boston Sand--cannot now renege on its agreement in an\r\neffort to avoid answering the other's state law claims.\r\nWe therefore reject the notion that Lydon's claims are\r\npreempted by Section 301.  Indeed, that outcome is fortified\r\n(independently, in a way) by a concept that has already been\r\nimplicated somewhat in our analysis and that we will now discuss in\r\nmore detail:  the doctrine of judicial estoppel.\r\n              Judicial Estoppel\r\nJudicial estoppel \"precludes a party from asserting a\r\nposition in one legal proceeding which is contrary to a position it\r\nhas already asserted in another\" (Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General\r\nCinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir. 1987)).  That doctrine's\r\ndual goals are to maintain the integrity of the judicial system and\r\nto protect parties from opponents' unfair strategies (id. at 214). \r\nIndeed, \"[i]f parties feel free to select contradictory positions\r\nbefore different tribunals to suit their ends, the integrity and\r\nefficacy of the courts will suffer\" (id.).  According to Patriot\r\nCinemas, id. at 212 (internal quotation marks and citations\r\nomitted), the doctrine \"should be employed when a litigant is\r\nplaying fast and loose with the courts, and when intentional self-\r\ncontradiction is being used as a means of obtaining unfair\r\nadvantage.\"  Although the doctrine varies somewhat among states and\r\namong federal circuits (18 James W. Moore et al. (Lawrence B.\r\nSolum, ed.), Moore's Federal Practice  134.30, at 134-62 to -63\r\n(3d ed. 1998)), our application of the doctrine requires that the\r\nparty being estopped have succeeded previously with a position\r\ndirectly inconsistent with the one it currently espouses (see Gensv. RTC, 112 F.3d 569, 572 (1st Cir. 1997), quoting Patriot Cinemas,\r\n834 F.2d at 212; see also Casas Office Mach., Inc. v. Mita Copystar\r\nAm., Inc., 42 F.3d 668, 676 (1st Cir. 1994)).\r\nLydon urges that judicial estoppel principles should\r\nprevent Boston Sand from arguing here that federal law is Lydon's\r\nexclusive remedy. As he points out, at the arbitration  proceeding\r\nBoston Sand succeeded with precisely the opposite argument--that\r\nthe parties had already agreed that state law provided Lydon's\r\nexclusive remedy and that the CBA did not address the issue.  \r\nBoston Sand's inconsistency is both patently unfair to\r\nLydon and destructive to the integrity of the judicial system. \r\nBoston Sand should not be allowed to argue successfully in each of\r\ntwo potential forums that Lydon's claims should be heard in the\r\nother, thereby depriving Lydon of any tribunal in which to bring\r\nhis action.  Not only does that strategy place Lydon at an unfair\r\ndisadvantage and force him to embrace inconsistent arguments, but\r\nalso it erodes the credibility of the court system and the efficacy\r\nof private arbitration agreements.  If parties are allowed to argue\r\none position to get out of arbitration and then to argue the exact\r\nopposite to avoid related court battles, the value of arbitrators\r\nas decisionmakers (a value that has repeatedly been stressed by the\r\nSupreme Court, particularly in the context of labor matters) will\r\nbe vitiated.\r\nHere Lydon filed his suit in state court in direct\r\nreliance on Boston Sand's assertions--both in the 1995-96 exchange\r\nof letters and in its arguments before the arbitrator--that it\r\nviewed the state court as the appropriate forum for the dispute. \r\nWe therefore also draw upon the judicial estoppel doctrine in\r\nholding that Boston Sand cannot be permitted to circumvent its\r\nearlier agreement with Lydon that the existing dispute should be\r\nresolved in the state courts under the state statutes (while we\r\nexpress no substantive view, of course, on the merits of the state \r\nlaw claims).  That doctrine operates, independently of the earlier\r\ndiscussion in this opinion, to hold Boston Sand to its own and the\r\narbitrator's conclusions that Lydon must present his claims in\r\nstate court and that the CBA does not purport to cover the disputed\r\nissue.\r\n         Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nWe recognize that there is something troubling about the\r\nconclusion that we have announced.  After all, if it had not been\r\nfor the parties' 1995-96 agreement and the ensuing arbitration\r\ndecision confirming that agreement, the traditional Lingle analysis\r\nwould most likely have triggered federal preemption of Lydon's\r\nclaims.  That is so because the merits of Lydon's state claims\r\ncould otherwise have required interpretation of the CBA.  For\r\nexample, assessing whether Lydon faced adverse employment\r\naction--one of the necessary elements of his discrimination claim\r\n(see MacCormack v. Boston Edison Co., 423 Mass. 652, 662, 672\r\nN.E.2d 1, 7 (1996))--might well have required interpretation of the\r\nCBA to determine whether Boston Sand had a duty to grant Lydon the\r\nbenefit of his original seniority.\r\nIf in other circumstances the Lingle line of cases could\r\nthus lead to preemption of Lydon's claims, the question is whether\r\nthe parties should be able in a sense to contract out of federal\r\njurisdiction by agreeing that the CBA is not implicated in the\r\ncase.  This is not a situation involving state-federal concurrent\r\njurisdiction, where parties often forgo potential federal\r\njurisdiction by the plaintiff choosing to sue in a state court and\r\nby the defendant simply not removing the case to a federal court. \r\nBy contrast, in the field occupied by Section 301 (broadly\r\nconstrued), Congress and the Supreme Court have determined that the\r\nfederal courts should have exclusive jurisdiction.  Not only have\r\nthey conferred jurisdiction over such claims on the federal courts,\r\nbut they have also prohibited state courts from hearing them. \r\nIndeed, for that very reason courts have been cautioned to give\r\ncareful consideration to the application of judicial estoppel when\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction is at stake (18 Charles Alan Wright et\r\nal., Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction  4477, at 784\r\n(1981 &amp; 1998 supp.)).\r\nBut those concerns do not apply here.  What the parties\r\nagreed to in prior proceedings--and what the arbitrator relied on\r\nin coming to his decision that the dispute was not arbitrable--was\r\nthat the CBA simply did not address the seniority rights of workers\r\nreturning to work after lump sum workers' compensation settlements. \r\nThus the parties agreed (and the arbitrator held) that there would\r\nbe no need for a state court to interpret the CBA, because it would\r\nfind nothing relevant to interpret in that agreement.  Or to phrase\r\nthe matter a bit differently, it is the Massachusetts statutes and\r\nnot the CBA that have been agreed by the parties to define Lydon's\r\nrights of priority vis-a-vis other employees.\r\nIn fact, any determination that would question the result\r\nhere on subject matter jurisdictional grounds would be at odds with\r\ncircuit precedent.  In Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., 926 F.2d 29, 37-41\r\n(1st Cir. 1991) we determined \"that LMRA  301 preemption . . .\r\nconcerns what law a decision maker must apply, not what forum must\r\ndecide the dispute\" (id. at 39, emphasis in original), so that the\r\npreemption doctrine did not impose a limitation on federal courts'\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction.  If as we held in Sweeney Section 301\r\npreemption is a waivable defense, it really follows a fortiori that\r\na litigant such as Boston Sand, which has not merely failed to\r\nassert (that is, has not simply waived) the issue but has actively\r\n(and successfully) advanced a position taking the issue out of the\r\nambit of Section 301, could not now contest subject matter\r\njurisdiction here.\r\nSimply put, Lydon is not stripped of his capacity to\r\nbring his claims in state court by Section 301 preemption, because\r\nit has been definitively established as between the parties that\r\nthere is no need to interpret the CBA to assess those claims.  That\r\nis what the parties have agreed to, that is what the arbitrator\r\nfound, and that is what we rely on in finding there is no Section\r\n301 preemption.\r\n                  Conclusion\r\nWe remand this case to the district court with directions\r\nto remand the case to the Superior Court of Massachusetts, Suffolk\r\nCounty.  It is so ordered.  In so doing, we express no views on the\r\nsubstantive merits of Lydon's claims.\n",

Masteralexis for appellant.\r\nRobert P. Corcoran, with whom Gleeson &amp; Corcoran was on brief,\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n               April 9, 1999\r\n                                           SHADUR, Senior District Judge.  This labor dispute\r\npresents a collision at the intersection of judicial doctrines that\r\nin this instance would operate at cross-purposes:  on the one hand\r\nthe doctrine of complete federal preemption, and on the other hand\r\nboth the limitations on that doctrine and the independent principle\r\nof judicial estoppel.  Appellant Joseph Lydon (\"Lydon\") has sought\r\nto resolve his quarrel with his employer, appellee Boston Sand and\r\nGravel Co. (\"Boston Sand\"), in two successive forums:  first by an\r\nattempted arbitration between Lydon's union and Boston Sand\r\npursuant to their collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"), and then\r\nby Lydon's lawsuit in a Massachusetts state court pursuant to that\r\nstate's workers' compensation laws.  \r\nWhen Lydon initially filed his grievance under the CBA,\r\nleading in turn to the union's invocation of the arbitration\r\nremedy, Boston Sand successfully argued before the arbitrator that\r\nthe parties had already agreed his claims should instead be decided\r\nunder state statutes.  When Lydon then did file suit in a state\r\ncourt, Boston Sand removed the case to federal court, urging that\r\nLydon's state law claims were preempted by federal labor laws.\r\nFinding that the state law claims were indeed preempted,\r\nthe district court entered a summary judgment of dismissal in favor\r\nof Boston Sand.  For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold\r\nthat while Lydon's claims might ordinarily be preempted, they are\r\nnot preempted here because of Boston Sand's prior litigating\r\nposition.  We therefore remand this case to the district court with\r\na direction that it be remanded to the state court of origin.\r\n                    Facts\r\nBoston Sand hired Lydon as a cement truck driver in 1984. \r\nIn July 1991 Lydon suffered a work-related neck injury that\r\nprevented him from working.  He received weekly workers'\r\ncompensation payments until May 1993, when he settled his claim and\r\nreceived a lump sum payment that was projected to cover four years\r\nof weekly payments based on Lydon's expected period of disability.\r\nDuring those four years Lydon was presumed as a matter of\r\nMassachusetts law (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152,  148) to be unable to\r\nwork.  Nonetheless Lydon did some driving for another concrete\r\ncompany, Sherman Concrete, from fall 1993 to spring 1995.\r\nIn April 1995 Lydon attempted to return to work for\r\nBoston Sand.  After a physician determined that he was physically\r\nable to do so, Lydon met with Vice President David McNeil\r\n(\"McNeil\") and attempted to substantiate his physical ability to\r\nreturn to work by noting his interim job with Sherman Concrete. \r\nMcNeil informed Lydon that because he had worked for another\r\ncompany for a year and a half, Boston Sand considered Lydon to have\r\nquit his job and forfeited his seniority rights.  Lydon's union,\r\nTeamsters Local 379, then presented a written request for Lydon's\r\nreinstatement, which Boston Sand denied.\r\nThat request led to an exchange of letters between the\r\nunion's attorneys and Boston Sand's attorneys.  In December 1995\r\nunion attorney Paul Kelly (\"Kelly\") wrote to Boston Sand attorney\r\nRobert Corcoran (\"Corcoran\") that a worker who received a lump sum\r\nsettlement and was absent from work because of the state statutory\r\npresumption of incapacity, but who then wished to return to work,\r\nhad no remedy under the CBA and that such a claim can arise only\r\nunder statutory law.  Corcoran responded the following month by\r\nagreeing with Kelly's assessment but taking it a step further,\r\nstating:\r\n  It is Boston Sand's position that an\r\n  injured worker claiming a right of\r\n  reinstatement following a lump sum\r\n  settlement can assert such a claim only in\r\n  court under the statute, and not as a\r\n  grievance under the contract.\r\n\nKelly confirmed a few weeks later by writing back that the union\r\nwas in agreement that \"the reinstatement rights of workers who\r\nenter into lump sum agreements are not covered by the collective\r\nbargaining agreement and, as such, must be asserted in judicial\r\nproceedings.\"\r\nAfter the May 1997 expiration of the four-year statutory\r\npresumption of Lydon's incapacity to work, his private attorney\r\nthreatened to sue Boston Sand under the state workers' compensation\r\nstatute.  That threat led to negotiations that resulted in Lydon's\r\nreturning to work on August 11, 1997, but with seniority preference\r\nonly over those hired in or after July 1997.  That minimal\r\npreference left Lydon significantly farther down on the seniority\r\nlist--with an accompanying loss of benefits--than he would have\r\nbeen if he had been reinstated with the seniority rights of his\r\noriginal 1984 date of hire.\r\nOn August 17, 1997 the union filed a grievance against\r\nBoston Sand, claiming that its refusal to grant Lydon seniority\r\nbased on his 1984 date of hire violated the CBA.  That grievance\r\nproceeded to arbitration, where the arbitrator held that the\r\ndispute was not arbitrable because the parties had previously\r\nagreed (in the already-described 1995-96 exchange of letters) that\r\nreinstatement rights, which the arbitrator determined included both\r\nrehiring and seniority, were not covered by the CBA and could be\r\nenforced only under state statutes.  In the face of the explicit\r\nreferences to \"reinstatement rights\" in the letters, the arbitrator\r\nrejected Lydon's argument that the 1995-96 agreement covered only\r\nrehiring and not seniority.  Further, the arbitrator agreed\r\nsubstantively with the parties' exchange of letters in finding that\r\nthe CBA did not at all address the rights of workers who received\r\nlump sump settlements, so that it could not be considered\r\ninconsistent with the state statute.\r\nLydon then filed a civil suit in Massachusetts state\r\ncourt, claiming that Boston Sand violated Mass. Gen. L. ch. 152,\r\n75A and 75B because it discriminated against him by failing to\r\nreinstate his original seniority rights when he started back to\r\nwork.  As stated earlier, Boston Sand removed the suit to federal\r\ncourt on the predicate that the state law claims were preempted by\r\nSection 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.  185\r\n(\"Section 301\").\r\nLydon's appeal disputes the district court's entry of \r\nsummary judgment in favor of Boston Sand on that ground.  As\r\nalways, our review of the district court's award of summary\r\njudgment is de novo (Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729694\"><a href=\"/opinion/729694/douglas-t-wightman-v-springfield-terminal-railway-company-and-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 230 (1st Cir. 1996)).\r\n             Preemption Doctrine\r\nCertain aspects of federal labor law have long been\r\nconstrued to preempt the field--they not only provide for federal\r\njurisdiction over contract disputes but also prohibit certain state\r\nlaw actions in the same subject area.  In the labor law context,\r\nthe statutory foundation for such complete preemption is found in\r\nSection 301(a):\r\nSuits for violation of contracts between\r\nan employer and a labor organization\r\nrepresenting employees in an industry\r\naffecting commerce as defined in this\r\nchapter . . . may be brought in any\r\ndistrict court of the United States having\r\njurisdiction of the parties, without\r\nrespect to the amount in controversy or\r\nwithout regard to the citizenship of the\r\nparties.\r\n\nFrom those simple words, a complex preemption\r\njurisprudence has grown in stages.  Initially state courts were\r\nsimply prevented from applying local rather than federal law in\r\ndeciding contract disputes about CBAs (see Teamsters Local 174 v. Lucas Flour Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106354\"><a href=\"/opinion/106354/teamsters-v-lucas-flour-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1962)), but then the doctrine was\r\nextended to preempt state law remedies whenever resolution of a\r\nplaintiff's claim is substantially dependent on analysis of a CBA's\r\nterms (Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111412\"><a href=\"/opinion/111412/allis-chalmers-corp-v-lueck/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985)).  Such\r\npreemption is necessary, according to the Supreme Court, to retain\r\nconsistency in the interpretation of terms common to CBAs and to\r\nprevent parties from relabeling as state law claims their actions\r\nthat in actuality arise under a CBA (see, e.g., Livadas v. Bradshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117852\"><a href=\"/opinion/117852/livadas-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 122-23 (1994)).\r\nNonetheless the doctrine does not preclude all state law\r\nclaims that are somehow linked to a labor dispute.  Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112086\"><a href=\"/opinion/112086/lingle-v-norge-div-of-magic-chef-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405-06 (1988)\r\n(emphasis added) states the test for determining whether a\r\nparticular state remedy has been preempted by federal law:\r\n[I]f the resolution of a state-law claim\r\ndepends upon the meaning of a collective-\r\nbargaining agreement, the application of\r\nstate law (which might lead to\r\ninconsistent results since there could be\r\nas many state-law principles as there are\r\nStates) is pre-empted and federal labor-\r\nlaw principles--necessarily uniform\r\nthroughout the Nation--must be employed to\r\nresolve the dispute.\r\n\nMere parallelism between a state law claim and a federal contract\r\nclaim does not necessarily require state court interpretation of\r\nthe CBA--that is, as long as the state claim can be resolved\r\nwithout construing the agreement itself, it is not preempted by\r\nSection 301 (id. at 409-10).  Furthermore, \"the bare fact that a\r\ncollective-bargaining agreement will be consulted in the course of\r\nstate-law litigation plainly does not require the claim to be\r\nextinguished\" (Livadas, 512 U.S. at 124, citing and thereafter\r\nquoting from Lingle, 486 U.S. at 413 n.12).  \r\nCourts confronted with state law claims must therefore\r\nlocate the line between the need for mere consultation of a CBA,\r\nwhich does not demand federal preemption, and more active\r\ninterpretation of that agreement, which does preempt the state law\r\nclaims.  As we have said of that dichotomy, \"[o]ur premise is that\r\nthis means a real interpretive dispute\" (Martin v. Shaw's\r\nSupermarkets, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733389\"><a href=\"/opinion/733389/theresa-martin-v-shaws-supermarkets-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (1st Cir. 1997)(emphasis in\r\noriginal)).  Our task here, then, is to determine the extent to\r\nwhich the analysis of Lydon's state causes of action under Sections\r\n75A and 75B is dependent on the CBA.\r\nWe have twice before addressed the preemptive effect of\r\nfederal labor law over those same state provisions.  In Martin, 105\r\nF.3d at 44 we found both Sections 75A and 75B preempted by federal\r\nlabor law, and in Magerer v. John Sexton &amp; Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547203\"><a href=\"/opinion/547203/david-a-magerer-v-john-sexton-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529-\r\n30 (1st Cir. 1990) we found Section 75B preempted.  Both  cases\r\nfound the claims preempted because of a proviso present in each\r\nstatutory section:\r\nIn the event that any right set forth in\r\nthis section is inconsistent with an\r\napplicable collective bargaining\r\nagreement, such agreement will prevail.\r\n\nMartin, 105 F.3d at 44 and Magerer, 912 F.2d at 529\r\nreasoned that the quoted provision required courts to interpret the\r\nrelevant CBA to determine whether it was inconsistent with the\r\nstate statute.  So even if the state cause of action did not itself\r\nrequire the court to construe the CBA, the inconsistency clauses of\r\nthe state statutes would require such interpretation.  Thus, for\r\nexample, Martin's state claims were held preempted \"not because the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the state\r\nclaims asserted, but because it may be so and requires\r\ninterpretation\" (Martin, 105 F.3d at 44 (emphasis in original)). \r\nMartin recognized that its analysis would result in preemption of\r\nSection 75A and 75B claims in some troubling cases that would not\r\notherwise be precluded (id.).  But it went on to observe that\r\neither the legislature or the unions could avoid that problem by\r\nmodifying the statutes or the CBAs (id.)--neither of which occurred\r\nin this case.  Accordingly, Boston Sand urges this Court to follow\r\nthe rationale of Martin and Magerer and to find Lydon's claims\r\npreempted as well.\r\nMatters are not so easy as Boston Sand would have it, for\r\nthis case presents an interesting twist to the preemption analysis: \r\nHere the arbitrator chosen by the parties has already held--\r\npointing expressly to Boston Sand's attorney Corcoran's letter\r\ntaking that position--that the parties had agreed in 1995-96 that\r\nthe CBA did not apply to (indeed, did not even attempt to address)\r\nLydon's claims.  Furthermore, the arbitrator (on whom the parties\r\nhave conferred the authority to interpret the CBA) found that\r\nbecause the CBA did not purport to cover reinstatement of workers\r\nwho received lump sum settlements for a workers' compensation\r\nclaim, the CBA and the statute could not be inconsistent.\r\nWith that conclusion having been arrived at pursuant to\r\nthe parties' agreement, neither the district court nor we have any\r\noccasion to interpret the CBA or the parties' 1995-96 letter-based\r\nagreement to determine the already-resolved question of whether the\r\nstate statutory remedies are consistent or inconsistent with those\r\nprovided in the CBA.  That determination has already been made--\r\nfirst by the parties, then by the arbitrator.  Neither Martin nor\r\nMagerer requires us to find Lydon's claims preempted.\r\nBoston Sand further argues, however, that the substance\r\nof Lydon's discrimination claims would require more than mere\r\nreference to the CBA.  It argues that resolution of the state law\r\nclaims would require both reliance on a duty created by the CBA \r\nand interpretation of the CBA's seniority provisions.  In an effort\r\nto support that contention, Boston Sand cites Flibotte v. Pennsylvania Truck Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748872\"><a href=\"/opinion/748872/albert-a-flibotte-v-pennsylvania-truck-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (1st Cir. 1997):\r\nA state-law claim can \"depend\" on the\r\n\"meaning\" of a collective bargaining\r\nagreement in two ways.  First, a claim so\r\nqualifies if it alleges conduct that\r\narguably constitutes a breach of a duty\r\nthat arises pursuant to a collective\r\nbargaining agreement.  See United\r\nSteelworkers v. Rawson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112426\"><a href=\"/opinion/112426/steelworkers-v-rawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369\r\n(1990)(\"[A] state-law tort action against\r\nan employer may be pre-empted by  301 if\r\nthe duty to the employee of which the tort\r\nis a violation is created by a\r\ncollective-bargaining agreement and\r\nwithout existence independent of the\r\nagreement.\").  Second, a claim so\r\nqualifies if its resolution arguably\r\nhinges upon an interpretation of the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement.  SeeAllis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111412\"><a href=\"/opinion/111412/allis-chalmers-corp-v-lueck/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220 (1985)(finding section 301\r\npreemption \"when resolution of a state-law\r\nclaim is substantially dependent upon\r\nanalysis of the term of an agreement made\r\nbetween the parties in a labor contract\"). \r\nIf a state-law claim depends on the\r\nmeaning of the collective bargaining\r\nagreement in either of these ways--that\r\nis, under Rawson's \"duty\" rubric or under\r\nAllis-Chalmers's \"interpretation\"\r\nrubric--it is preempted.\r\n\nBoston Sand's position seeks to draw force from the first\r\nof those alternatives and the notion that seniority rights\r\ntypically stem from a CBA.  But again the situation before us\r\ndiffers materially from that norm, because Boston Sand has\r\npreviously agreed with the union as Lydon's representative that the\r\nCBA did not address the statutory workers' compensation issues--\r\nthat only the state statute does that and defines Lydon's rights--\r\nand because the arbitrator found that agreement (including the\r\nconsequent rights that define Lydon's place in the workforce)\r\nbinding.\r\nIndeed, the parties' express agreement that the CBA does\r\nnot cover their dispute operates here just as any stipulation about\r\nany other legal issue in a case would.  For example, had the\r\nparties stipulated in 1995 to a definition of seniority rights\r\nwithout reference to the preexisting CBA, that stipulation would\r\ncontinue to bind them at this stage of the proceedings.  Neither\r\nparty could now attempt to rely on a different definition of the\r\nterm.  In the same way, both sides here have agreed that the CBA\r\ndid not even address the issues at stake between them.  Just so,\r\none party--Boston Sand--cannot now renege on its agreement in an\r\neffort to avoid answering the other's state law claims.\r\nWe therefore reject the notion that Lydon's claims are\r\npreempted by Section 301.  Indeed, that outcome is fortified\r\n(independently, in a way) by a concept that has already been\r\nimplicated somewhat in our analysis and that we will now discuss in\r\nmore detail:  the doctrine of judicial estoppel.\r\n              Judicial Estoppel\r\nJudicial estoppel \"precludes a party from asserting a\r\nposition in one legal proceeding which is contrary to a position it\r\nhas already asserted in another\" (Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General\r\nCinema Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498115\"><a href=\"/opinion/498115/patriot-cinemas-inc-v-general-cinema-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 212 (1st Cir. 1987)).  That doctrine's\r\ndual goals are to maintain the integrity of the judicial system and\r\nto protect parties from opponents' unfair strategies (id. at 214). \r\nIndeed, \"[i]f parties feel free to select contradictory positions\r\nbefore different tribunals to suit their ends, the integrity and\r\nefficacy of the courts will suffer\" (id.).  According to Patriot\r\nCinemas, id. at 212 (internal quotation marks and citations\r\nomitted), the doctrine \"should be employed when a litigant is\r\nplaying fast and loose with the courts, and when intentional self-\r\ncontradiction is being used as a means of obtaining unfair\r\nadvantage.\"  Although the doctrine varies somewhat among states and\r\namong federal circuits (18 James W. Moore et al. (Lawrence B.\r\nSolum, ed.), Moore's Federal Practice  134.30, at 134-62 to -63\r\n(3d ed. 1998)), our application of the doctrine requires that the\r\nparty being estopped have succeeded previously with a position\r\ndirectly inconsistent with the one it currently espouses (see Gensv. RTC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197343\"><a href=\"/opinion/197343/gens-v-resolution/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572 (1st Cir. 1997), quoting Patriot Cinemas,\r\n834 F.2d at 212; see also Casas Office Mach., Inc. v. Mita Copystar\r\nAm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 676 (1st Cir. 1994)).\r\nLydon urges that judicial estoppel principles should\r\nprevent Boston Sand from arguing here that federal law is Lydon's\r\nexclusive remedy. As he points out, at the arbitration  proceeding\r\nBoston Sand succeeded with precisely the opposite argument--that\r\nthe parties had already agreed that state law provided Lydon's\r\nexclusive remedy and that the CBA did not address the issue.  \r\nBoston Sand's inconsistency is both patently unfair to\r\nLydon and destructive to the integrity of the judicial system. \r\nBoston Sand should not be allowed to argue successfully in each of\r\ntwo potential forums that Lydon's claims should be heard in the\r\nother, thereby depriving Lydon of any tribunal in which to bring\r\nhis action.  Not only does that strategy place Lydon at an unfair\r\ndisadvantage and force him to embrace inconsistent arguments, but\r\nalso it erodes the credibility of the court system and the efficacy\r\nof private arbitration agreements.  If parties are allowed to argue\r\none position to get out of arbitration and then to argue the exact\r\nopposite to avoid related court battles, the value of arbitrators\r\nas decisionmakers (a value that has repeatedly been stressed by the\r\nSupreme Court, particularly in the context of labor matters) will\r\nbe vitiated.\r\nHere Lydon filed his suit in state court in direct\r\nreliance on Boston Sand's assertions--both in the 1995-96 exchange\r\nof letters and in its arguments before the arbitrator--that it\r\nviewed the state court as the appropriate forum for the dispute. \r\nWe therefore also draw upon the judicial estoppel doctrine in\r\nholding that Boston Sand cannot be permitted to circumvent its\r\nearlier agreement with Lydon that the existing dispute should be\r\nresolved in the state courts under the state statutes (while we\r\nexpress no substantive view, of course, on the merits of the state \r\nlaw claims).  That doctrine operates, independently of the earlier\r\ndiscussion in this opinion, to hold Boston Sand to its own and the\r\narbitrator's conclusions that Lydon must present his claims in\r\nstate court and that the CBA does not purport to cover the disputed\r\nissue.\r\n         Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nWe recognize that there is something troubling about the\r\nconclusion that we have announced.  After all, if it had not been\r\nfor the parties' 1995-96 agreement and the ensuing arbitration\r\ndecision confirming that agreement, the traditional Lingle analysis\r\nwould most likely have triggered federal preemption of Lydon's\r\nclaims.  That is so because the merits of Lydon's state claims\r\ncould otherwise have required interpretation of the CBA.  For\r\nexample, assessing whether Lydon faced adverse employment\r\naction--one of the necessary elements of his discrimination claim\r\n(see MacCormack v. Boston Edison Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 662, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1996))--might well have required interpretation of the\r\nCBA to determine whether Boston Sand had a duty to grant Lydon the\r\nbenefit of his original seniority.\r\nIf in other circumstances the Lingle line of cases could\r\nthus lead to preemption of Lydon's claims, the question is whether\r\nthe parties should be able in a sense to contract out of federal\r\njurisdiction by agreeing that the CBA is not implicated in the\r\ncase.  This is not a situation involving state-federal concurrent\r\njurisdiction, where parties often forgo potential federal\r\njurisdiction by the plaintiff choosing to sue in a state court and\r\nby the defendant simply not removing the case to a federal court. \r\nBy contrast, in the field occupied by Section 301 (broadly\r\nconstrued), Congress and the Supreme Court have determined that the\r\nfederal courts should have exclusive jurisdiction.  Not only have\r\nthey conferred jurisdiction over such claims on the federal courts,\r\nbut they have also prohibited state courts from hearing them. \r\nIndeed, for that very reason courts have been cautioned to give\r\ncareful consideration to the application of judicial estoppel when\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction is at stake (18 Charles Alan Wright et\r\nal., Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction  4477, at 784\r\n(1981 &amp; 1998 supp.)).\r\nBut those concerns do not apply here.  What the parties\r\nagreed to in prior proceedings--and what the arbitrator relied on\r\nin coming to his decision that the dispute was not arbitrable--was\r\nthat the CBA simply did not address the seniority rights of workers\r\nreturning to work after lump sum workers' compensation settlements. \r\nThus the parties agreed (and the arbitrator held) that there would\r\nbe no need for a state court to interpret the CBA, because it would\r\nfind nothing relevant to interpret in that agreement.  Or to phrase\r\nthe matter a bit differently, it is the Massachusetts statutes and\r\nnot the CBA that have been agreed by the parties to define Lydon's\r\nrights of priority vis-a-vis other employees.\r\nIn fact, any determination that would question the result\r\nhere on subject matter jurisdictional grounds would be at odds with\r\ncircuit precedent.  In Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556388\"><a href=\"/opinion/556388/dolores-sweeney-v-westvaco-company-dolores-sweeney-v-westvaco-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37-41\r\n(1st Cir. 1991) we determined \"that LMRA  301 preemption . . .\r\nconcerns what law a decision maker must apply, not what forum must\r\ndecide the dispute\" (id. at 39, emphasis in original), so that the\r\npreemption doctrine did not impose a limitation on federal courts'\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction.  If as we held in Sweeney Section 301\r\npreemption is a waivable defense, it really follows a fortiori that\r\na litigant such as Boston Sand, which has not merely failed to\r\nassert (that is, has not simply waived) the issue but has actively\r\n(and successfully) advanced a position taking the issue out of the\r\nambit of Section 301, could not now contest subject matter\r\njurisdiction here.\r\nSimply put, Lydon is not stripped of his capacity to\r\nbring his claims in state court by Section 301 preemption, because\r\nit has been definitively established as between the parties that\r\nthere is no need to interpret the CBA to assess those claims.  That\r\nis what the parties have agreed to, that is what the arbitrator\r\nfound, and that is what we rely on in finding there is no Section\r\n301 preemption.\r\n                  Conclusion\r\nWe remand this case to the district court with directions\r\nto remand the case to the Superior Court of Massachusetts, Suffolk\r\nCounty.  It is so ordered.  In so doing, we express no views on the\r\nsubstantive merits of Lydon's claims.\n</pre>",
