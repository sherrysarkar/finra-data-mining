Plaintiff-appellant  brought  this\r                                 \r\n\ndiversity action against his private  insurer alleging breach\r\n\nof contract in the denial of a claim for disability insurance\r\n\nbenefits.   The  insurer maintained  that  plaintiff was  not\r\n\n\"totally disabled\" within the meaning of the policy.   On the\r\n\nmorning of the  trial, the district  court granted a  defense\r\n\nmotion in limine to exclude  from evidence a Social  Security\r                            \r\n\nAdministration record and finding  that for a period of  time\r\n\nplaintiff was under a  \"disability\" as defined in  the Social\r\n\nSecurity   Act.    A  motion  by  plaintiff  for  a  two-week\r\n\ncontinuance  to seek additional medical testimony was denied.\r\n\nAlthough  plaintiff's counsel reported a readiness to proceed\r\n\nto trial with other medical and lay witnesses, plaintiff then\r\n\ndischarged his  counsel and  refused to put  his case  to the\r\n\njury.  Final judgment was entered for the insurer.   \r\n\n          Having reviewed  the abbreviated record  and briefs\r\n\nwith  care,  we  see   no  abuse  of  the  district   court's\r\n\nconsiderable discretion to  weigh the probative value  of the\r\n\nsocial security evidence  and determine its  admissibility in\r\n\nlight of competing  factors.  See  Fed. R. Evid. 403.   Given\r                                             \r\n\nthe circumstances,  carefully weighed and articulated  by the\r\n\ncourt,  there  also   was  no  abuse  in  the   denial  of  a\r\n\ncontinuance. \r\n\n          As  to each of  plaintiff's multiple assignments of\r\n\nerror   in  the   pretrial   proceedings,  we   apprehend  no\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nprejudicial effect  on the  outcome of the  case, and  see no\r\n\nreason to suppose that he was entitled to summary judgment as\r\n\na matter of law.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
