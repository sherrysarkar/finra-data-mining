Upon careful review of defendants' brief and the\r\nrecord, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in dismissing without prejudice, notwithstanding\r\ndefendants' motions for dismissal with prejudice.  See Puerto Rico\r\nMaritime Shipping Authority v. Leith, 668 F.2d 46, 49-51 (1st Cir.\r\n1981).  The district court was not required in all the\r\ncircumstances of this case to award fees and costs to defendants,\r\neven were we to assume that they sufficiently asked the district\r\ncourt for such awards.  See id. at 51.  And the district court\r\ncorrectly determined that defendants presented no grounds for\r\namendment of the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
