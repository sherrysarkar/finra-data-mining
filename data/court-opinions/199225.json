Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Selya, Boudin and Stahl,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Eric C.

This case involves a dispute\n\nover the simultaneous use of two similar Internet domain names\n\nby two separate entities. Defendants-appellants Northern Lights\n\nClub,   Jeff     Burgar      and      641271    Alberta       Ltd.       (collectively\n\n\"Northern      Lights\"     or      \"defendants\")        appeal       a     preliminary\n\ninjunction entered by the district court requiring the posting\n\nof a specified disclaimer on their World Wide Web site's portal\n\npage.    The court entered the injunction after finding that\n\nplaintiff-appellee Northern Light Technology, Inc. (\"Northern\n\nLight\" or \"plaintiff\") was likely to prevail on the merits of\n\nits state and federal trademark claims and its claim under the\n\nAnticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)\n\n(\"ACPA\").\n\n              Defendants     assert     three    bases    for    relief       in    this\n\ninterlocutory appeal: (1) that the district court lacks personal\n\njurisdiction, and hence the power to enjoin them; (2) that the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that the plaintiff was likely\n\nto succeed on the merits of its claims; and (3) that the\n\ninjunction currently in place is overly broad and consequently\n\ninfringes their free-speech rights.                Finding that the district\n\ncourt properly acquired jurisdiction over defendants when their\n\nagent   was    served    with      process     within   the    forum       state,    and\n\ndiscerning      no   basis      for     disturbing      the     district       court's\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdetermination on the likely success of plaintiff's suit, we\n\nuphold   the    district    court's    issuance     of    a   preliminary\n\ninjunction.    And because defendants only obliquely pressed their\n\nFirst Amendment argument before the district court, we decline\n\nto decide the issue for purposes of this appeal.\n\n                            I. Background\n\n            The facts of this case are extensively chronicled in\n\nthe district court's opinion, see Northern Light Tech., Inc. v.\n\nNorthern Lights Club, 97 F. Supp. 2d 96 (D. Mass. 2000), and so\n\nwe confine our discussion to the events relevant to this appeal.\n\nOn September 16, 1996, plaintiff registered the Internet domain\n\nname northernlight.com with Network Solutions, Inc. (\"NSI\"),\n\nwhich at that time was the organization exclusively entrusted\n\nwith the task of registering domain names on the World Wide Web.1\n\nPlaintiff   also   filed   registration   papers    for   the   \"Northern\n\nLight\" service mark with the United States Patent and Trademark\n\nOffice (\"PTO\") during that same month.2         Nearly a year later, in\n\nAugust   1997,     plaintiff    began     its      operation     of   the\n\n\n     1As they are commonly used today, Internet domain names\nserve two principal functions: (1) providing the addresses for\nhypertext markup language (\"HTML\") sites on the World Wide Web,\nand (2) permitting the dissemination of e-mail accounts with a\ncommon suffix that reflects the identity of the accounts'\nproprietor.\n     2\n     The PTO issued plaintiff a registered                trademark   for\n\"Northern Light\" on February 23, 1999.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fnorthernlight.com website (and, consequently, its use of the\n\n\"Northern Light\" mark in commerce) as a search engine.       Search\n\nengines are popular Web-retrieval tools that match a search\n\nquery submitted by an Internet user with the websites whose\n\ncontent best corresponds to the submitted search terms.        The\n\nnorthernlight.com site has remained in continuous existence as\n\na search engine since August 1997.\n\n           Defendant Jeff Burgar, a resident of High Prairie,\n\nAlberta, Canada, is the president and principal shareholder of\n\n641271 Alberta, Ltd., an Alberta corporation that owns the\n\nnorthernlights.com   domain   name.    Burgar,   a   self-described\n\n\"Internet entrepreneur,\" has, since the mid-1990s, registered\n\nthousands of \"catchy\" domain names – i.e., Internet addresses\n\nappropriating, in identical or slightly modified form, the names\n\nof popular people and organizations.    He is also the president\n\nof Northern Lights Club, an unincorporated association with a\n\nlisted address in Las Vegas, Nevada.      While Northern Lights\n\nClub's stated mission is to bring together devotees of the\n\nNorthern Lights, or aurora borealis, including businesses that\n\ntake their name from the famous celestial phenomenon, Burgar's\n\ntestimony indicates that the club has no actual individual\n\nmembers.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f         In   October    1996,    approximately   one   month   after\n\nplaintiff registered its northernlight.com website, Burgar, on\n\nbehalf   of    Northern        Lights    Club,     registered     the\n\nnorthernlights.com    domain     name   with   NSI.3    Soon    after\n\nregistration, Burgar licensed the name to FlairMail, a vanity e-\n\nmail service that he manages and that is owned by a local\n\nAlberta newspaper.4     Burgar \"believes\" that this newspaper is\n\nowned by his wife.       Under this arrangement with FlairMail,\n\ndefendants offered e-mail accounts under the northernlights.com\n\ndomain name that users could access through some other website,\n\nsuch as flairmail.com, although Internet users who attempted to\n\nvisit the northernlights.com page on the World Wide Web would\n\nfind that no such site existed.5\n\n         The two similar domain-name registrations enjoyed a\n\npeaceful coexistence until March 2, 1999, when a USA Today story\n\n\n\n    3Plaintiff does not allege that defendants had actual\nknowledge of the northernlight.com registration when they\nregistered the northernlights.com domain name.\n    4 Vanity e-mail permits a subscriber to choose both the user\nname and the domain name for their e-mail address. To use as an\nexample the service offered by defendants, an admirer of the\naurora borealis named John Doe could choose the vanity e-mail\naddress \"John.Doe@northernlights.com.\"\n    5The district court found, at the time of its March 2000\nopinion,   that  approximately   112  individuals  used   the\nnorthernlights.com domain name as part of their vanity e-mail\naddress. See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 101.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fon Internet search engines erroneously identified plaintiff's\n\nwebsite     as   northernlights.com.    After     ascertaining    that\n\ndefendants were the owners of this domain name, plaintiff's\n\nmarketing    director   contacted   Burgar   to   find   out   whether\n\ndefendants might be interested in selling it.            The parties\n\nexchanged a series of proposals and counterproposals by e-mail\n\nover a two-month period but ultimately no sales or licensing\n\nagreement was consummated.       Soon thereafter, in April 1999,\n\ndefendants posted an active page on the northernlights.com World\n\nWide Web site.     Visitors to the site saw, among other things, a\n\nsite-search function near the top of the screen that enabled\n\nusers to perform a search of the northernlights.com site for\n\nspecific words or phrases, as well as links to FlairMail and\n\nother members of the \"Northern Lights Community.\"         Plaintiff's\n\nWeb site was placed third in the list of the Northern Lights\n\nCommunity \"Business Listings.\"6 Plaintiff had not agreed to this\n\nlisting.\n\n            On July 14, 1999, plaintiff sent Burgar a cease-and-\n\ndesist letter, demanding that the northernlights.com site be\n\ndeactivated.     Defendants chose not to respond to this letter.\n\n\n\n    6Plaintiff asserts that it received approximately 300\nreferrals per day from defendants' site about the time that the\nnorthernlights.com site went online, and that this number later\nincreased to several thousand referrals per day.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fFifteen days later, plaintiff asked NSI to strip defendants of\n\nthe northernlights.com domain name based on the similarity of\n\ntheir respective marks, but NSI declined, citing the one-letter\n\ndiscrepancy   between     the     name     of    defendant's     website   and\n\nplaintiff's trademark.      On August 6, 1999, plaintiff filed the\n\ninstant lawsuit under federal and state theories of unfair\n\ncompetition, trademark infringement, and trademark dilution. In\n\nits complaint, plaintiff sought both a temporary restraining\n\norder and a preliminary injunction.             In December 1999, plaintiff\n\namended its complaint to add a claim under ACPA (which had been\n\nenacted into law less than one month earlier) and to abandon its\n\nfederal trademark-dilution claim and its state-law claims of\n\nunfair competition and trademark dilution.\n\n         Moments before the district court hearing on September\n\n1, 1999 to consider the merits of plaintiff's claims and the\n\ncourt's personal jurisdiction over defendants, plaintiff's agent\n\nphysically    served    process     upon        Burgar,   who   had   traveled\n\nvoluntarily to Boston from Alberta to witness the proceedings\n\nand to make himself available for testimony if needed.                Although\n\nthe hearing itself focused largely on the convoluted issues of\n\npersonal jurisdiction arising from Internet activities, it also\n\ntouched upon the merits of plaintiff's request for preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief.      At the end of the hearing, the district\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcourt indicated that it would issue a temporary restraining\n\norder modifying the content of the northernlights.com site to\n\nprevent further public confusion, and solicited advice from both\n\nparties as to the appropriate substance of that order.\n\n          True to its word, the district court imposed the TRO\n\nthe following day, stating that Northern Light had successfully\n\ndemonstrated probable personal jurisdiction, that it would be\n\nlikely to succeed in its trademark-infringement suit, and that\n\nthe   balance   of   hardships   and    the   public   interest   favored\n\ntemporary relief.     The court ordered that defendants remove all\n\ncontent from the northernlights.com site and post in its place\n\na blacked-out screen containing only an image of the               aurora\n\nborealis and links to three websites: (1) flairmail.com (where\n\nusers could access their northernlights.com e-mail accounts);\n\n(2) plaintiff's northernlight.com site; and (3) the content page\n\nthat formerly existed at northernlights.com, to be described,\n\nfor purposes of the link, as \"BUSINESSES THAT ARE LISTED WITH\n\nTHE NORTHERN LIGHTS COMMUNITY.\"           On the same day that this\n\nruling was issued, the parties jointly moved the court for a\n\ncontinuance of \"at least 60 days.\"             In this joint motion,\n\ndefendants acquiesced in an extension of the restraining order\n\nagainst them until discovery and further hearings in the matter\n\nwere conducted, and the parties agreed to a schedule governing\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fthe completion of discovery and the filing of any additional\n\nmotions.       The   court   granted    this   motion,    and       both    parties\n\nsubmitted further motions during this period.                  After granting\n\nseveral motions for extensions of time, the district court\n\nultimately held hearings on January 19 and 21, 2000 on the\n\npersonal-jurisdiction        issue     and   the   merits      of    plaintiff's\n\nrequest for preliminary relief.\n\n           In its written opinion issued on March 31, 2000, the\n\ndistrict court ordered, inter alia, that what had become a de\n\nfacto preliminary injunction should remain in place.7 In so\n\ndoing,   the    court   began    by    holding     that   it    had        personal\n\njurisdiction over defendants.8          It determined that plaintiff had\n\nsatisfied sections 3(c) and 3(d) of the Massachusetts Long-Arm\n\nStatute, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3, because defendants\n\n\n    7The record does not clearly reveal when the TRO became a\npreliminary injunction. At some point following the submission\nof their joint motion for continuance, the parties (and the\ndistrict court) started describing the TRO as a preliminary\ninjunction. Furthermore, in its written opinion, the district\ncourt stated that the preliminary injunction already in place\nwould not be modified. In any event, the present appeal clearly\nis from a preliminary injunction.\n    8The district court noted that its decision was responsive\nto a plethora of pretrial motions pending before it, including\nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for\nfailure to state a claim; plaintiff's initial motion for a\npreliminary injunction; defendants' motions for reconsideration\nof the temporary relief that had already been ordered; and the\nparties' motions to compel discovery and to impose sanctions.\nSee 97 F. Supp. 2d at 98.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fhad    likely     caused     tortious      injury   to   plaintiffs   in\n\nMassachusetts, both through their acts within the Commonwealth\n\n(in the form of their trademark-infringing website) and their\n\nregular solicitation of business through acts outside of the\n\nCommonwealth       (by     virtue   of,     inter   alia,   the   site's\n\n\"entice[ment]\" to users to post material).           See 97 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 104-06.      The court also found that defendants had sufficient\n\ncontacts with Massachusetts to support the exercise of specific\n\njurisdiction under International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326\n\nU.S. 310 (1945), thereby satisfying the constitutional due-\n\nprocess element of personal jurisdiction.            See Northern Light\n\nTech., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d at 106-08.\n\n          On the merits of plaintiff's suit, the district court\n\nfound that, based on the likelihood of confusion between the two\n\nwebsites because of their similar form and function, plaintiff's\n\nstate and federal trademark-infringement and unfair-competition\n\ncauses of action would probably succeed.            See id. at 109-15,\n\n120.   The court further opined that plaintiff was likely to\n\nsucceed on its ACPA claim, based on the confusing similarity of\n\nthe two domain names and proof of defendants' bad-faith intent\n\nto profit from plaintiff's northernlight.com mark.           See id. at\n\n115-20.   On the latter issue, the court reasoned that, although\n\nBurgar's initial reluctance to sell the northernlights.com site\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fand     defendants' uninterrupted use of the northernlights.com\n\nname for vanity e-mail accounts militated against a bad-faith\n\nfinding,        defendants'     historical    practice      of     \"targeting\n\ntrademarked names, creating fictional entities to register them,\n\nand offering dubious explanations for the selection of these\n\ndomain names\" ultimately tipped the scales in favor of such a\n\npreliminary determination.        Id. at 119.     Finally, the district\n\ncourt found that plaintiff had established a likelihood of\n\nirreparable harm, that the balance of hardships favored the\n\nplaintiff, and that the public interest favored the preservation\n\nof the preliminary injunction already in place.             See id. at 120-\n\n21.\n\n             On appeal, defendants dispute the district court's\n\npersonal-jurisdiction       ruling     and   aspects   of    its    decision\n\nregarding     the likelihood of plaintiff's success on the merits.\n\nDefendants also pursue their argument, not expressly considered\n\nby    the   district   court,   that   the   present   injunction     unduly\n\nburdens their First Amendment rights.\n\n                       II. Personal Jurisdiction\n\n             Defendants first challenge the injunction entered by\n\nthe district court on the ground that the court was without\n\npersonal jurisdiction to order such a remedy.            At each stage of\n\nthe proceedings, the parties have contested whether defendants'\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\factivities, both in terms of the content of their website and\n\ntheir    discussions      with    the   plaintiff          regarding         a   potential\n\nbusiness venture, meet the personal-jurisdiction criteria of the\n\nMassachusetts     Long-Arm       Statute         and    the     requirements        of   due\n\nprocess.    Plaintiff also posited a more conventional basis for\n\npersonal    jurisdiction         in   the    district         court     –    namely,     the\n\nservice    of   process    effected         upon       Burgar    just       prior   to   the\n\nSeptember 1, 1999 preliminary injunction hearing.                                We afford\n\nplenary review to the district court's determination of personal\n\njurisdiction, and may affirm its judgment for any independent\n\nreason supported by the record.                    See, e.g., Phillips Exeter\n\nAcad. v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            The district court expressly declined to consider the\n\nvalidity of personal jurisdiction based on physical service of\n\nprocess.    See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 108 n.12.                      On appeal, however,\n\nplaintiff continues to press its case that, under the doctrine\n\nof   transient    jurisdiction,             it    has     satisfactorily            created\n\njurisdiction through its service of process on Burgar prior to\n\nthe September 1, 1999 hearing.              See Burnham v. Superior Court of\n\nCal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990) (plurality opinion); Schinkel v. Maxi-\n\nHolding, Inc., 565 N.E.2d 1219, 1222-23 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991)\n\n(holding that personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts need not be\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fpredicated     on    Long-Arm        Statute   when   defendant    served   with\n\nprocess while in forum under transient-jurisdiction doctrine).\n\nDefendants dispute this proposition, claiming that this method\n\nof   service    of    process    is     fundamentally    unfair    in    that   it\n\nrepresents a trap for the unwary litigant who travels to the\n\nforum   state        solely     to     contest    the   issue     of     personal\n\njurisdiction.        Defendants also argue that permitting service of\n\nprocess under these circumstances is unwise from a public-policy\n\nperspective in that it discourages the litigant from actively\n\nassisting the district court in the jurisdictional- discovery\n\nprocess.\n\n           Although they do not specifically ask for process\n\nimmunity, defendants' argument against personal jurisdiction\n\nessentially boils down to a request that Burgar be deemed immune\n\nfrom service of process since, at the time he was served, he was\n\npresent in Massachusetts only for the purpose of attending a\n\npersonal-jurisdiction hearing in this lawsuit.                    This argument\n\nenjoys some measure of historical pedigree, albeit in a related\n\ncontext.   Long before the Supreme Court in Burnham affirmed that\n\npersonal   jurisdiction         can    be   sustained   against    a    defendant\n\nsolely on the basis of his presence in the forum state at the\n\ntime of service of process, it had recognized that some parties\n\ntemporarily in the forum state enjoy immunity from service by\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fvirtue of their status as participants in ongoing litigation.\n\nFor instance, in Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222 (1932), the Court\n\nnoted the potential peril of allowing an individual who is\n\nattending a proceeding in one suit to be served with process in\n\nconjunction with another:\n\n            [T]he due administration of justice requires\n            that a court shall not permit interference\n            with the progress of a cause pending before\n            it, by the service of process in other\n            suits, which would prevent, or the fear of\n            which   might   tend  to   discourage,   the\n            voluntary attendance of those whose presence\n            is necessary or convenient to the judicial\n            administration in the pending litigation.\n\nId. at 225 (internal citations omitted).                     Similarly, Justice\n\nScalia's    plurality    opinion       in   Burnham        referred      to   several\n\nstates'    historical     imposition          of    statutory       or    common-law\n\nprohibitions on the service of                process of those individuals\n\npresent    in   the   forum    as    parties       or   witnesses    in    unrelated\n\njudicial proceedings – a practice that led him to conclude that\n\ntransient       jurisdiction        comported       with    constitutional        due\n\nprocess.    See 495 U.S. at 613.\n\n            Accompanying the courts' repeated recognition of the\n\nvalidity of the party/witness immunity exception, however, has\n\nbeen a persistent acknowledgment of the exception's limitations.\n\nThe Lamb Court itself noted that, because the privilege exists\n\nfor the convenience of the district court in its exercise of\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fjudicial administration, rather than to protect the individual\n\nseeking to avoid service of process, courts enjoy the discretion\n\nto confer (or deny) immunity in such instances.          See 285 U.S. at\n\n225 (citing Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 130 (1916)).               Just\n\nas importantly, the extension of the privilege has been limited\n\nby the majority of courts to cases in which the party or witness\n\nwas participating in an unrelated litigation at the time that he\n\nwas served with process in the forum state.              See, e.g., ARW\n\nExploration Corp. v. Aguirre, 45 F.3d 1455, 1460 (10th Cir.\n\n1995) (denying process immunity where party was served with\n\nprocess in second lawsuit while attending deposition in first\n\nlawsuit alleging similar facts); In re Fish & Neave, 519 F.2d\n\n116, 118 (8th Cir. 1975) (similar); LaCroix v. American Horse\n\nShow Ass'n, 853 F. Supp. 992, 994-95 (N.D. Ohio 1994) (applying\n\nLamb and denying defendants' claim of entitlement to immunity\n\nbased on appearance in forum state solely to contest personal\n\njurisdiction); 4 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 1080, at 511 (2d ed. 1987) (\"There is\n\ngenerally no immunity from service of process when the suit in\n\nwhich immunity is sought is part of, or a continuation of, the\n\nsuit   for   which   the   person    claiming    immunity    is    in   the\n\njurisdiction.\");     see   also   Lamb,    285   U.S.   at   225   (\"[T]he\n\n[process-immunity] privilege should not be enlarged beyond the\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\freason upon which it is founded, and . . . should be extended or\n\nwithheld only as judicial necessities require.\").9 The rationale\n\nfor the differing-lawsuit prerequisite to process immunity in\n\nthis context is relatively straightforward: while a court can,\n\nin cases before it, choose to protect the jurisdictional status\n\nof a party or witness who is reluctant to come to the forum\n\nstate by issuing protective orders or subpoenas, it cannot wield\n\nsuch power in other cases.           The process-immunity exception\n\ntherefore fills the gap only where it needs to be filled – that\n\nis,   in   cases   where   a   district   court   wishes   to   shield   an\n\nindividual from service of process to encourage his or her\n\ntravel to the forum state, but would be unable to do so absent\n\nthe power to grant immunity.\n\n\n\n      9\n      In their brief, defendants cite to other cases, such as\nAmerican Centennial Ins. Co. v. Handal, 901 F. Supp. 892, 895\n(D.N.J. 1995), which interpret Lamb differently. Those cases\nhold that process immunity should be granted to non-residents\npresent in the forum state to participate in any litigation,\nwhether or not related to the suit for which the disputed\nservice has been effected, as long as such immunity does not\nobstruct justice in the first suit. See, e.g., Shapiro & Son\nCurtain Corp. v. Glass, 348 F.2d 460, 461-62 (2d Cir. 1965);\nNASL Marketing, Inc. v. de Vries, 94 F.R.D. 309 (S.D.N.Y. 1982);\nUnited Nations v. Adler, 90 F. Supp. 440, 441 (S.D.N.Y. 1950).\nWe reject this view, as Lamb definitively retains the\ndistinction between presence in the forum state for related and\nunrelated cases. See 285 U.S. at 225 (\"[T]he due administration\nof justice requires that a court shall not permit interference\nwith the progress of a cause pending before it by the service of\nprocess in other suits . . . .\") (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f            Turning to the facts of this case, several features of\n\ndefendants' litigation posture counsel against a finding that\n\nBurgar    is    entitled      to    process    immunity.     First,   and   most\n\napparent, is the fact that defendants have never asked the\n\ndistrict court for such immunity on behalf of Burgar, either\n\nprior to or following the hearing at which Burgar was served\n\nwith process.           In lieu of a specific request for immunity,\n\ndefendants instead have asked this court to fashion a broad, per\n\nse   rule      precluding     the    exercise    of   personal    jurisdiction\n\nwhenever the served individual is in the jurisdiction to attend\n\nlitigation-related proceedings that pertain to him or her.                    In\n\nlight of the admonitions in Lamb and other cases that process\n\nimmunity       should    be   meted     out    sparingly,    we   reject    this\n\nsuggestion. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the service\n\nof process on Burgar are not those that would ordinarily favor\n\na finding of immunity even in a case where it had been timely\n\nrequested.        Specifically,        Burgar     voluntarily     entered   into\n\nMassachusetts to attend proceedings as a spectator in the same\n\ncase in which he was served with process.                   While we need not\n\ndecide the issue, it seems apparent that under these facts, the\n\ndistrict court would have faced a relatively heavy presumption\n\nagainst granting such immunity if it actually had been sought by\n\nBurgar.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f            For these reasons, we hold that the district court\n\nproperly exercised personal jurisdiction over defendants in this\n\ncase.10     Based on this determination, we need not reach the\n\nalternate    bases     for     personal    jurisdiction        discussed   in    the\n\ndistrict court's opinion.\n\n      III. Plaintiff's Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n            Defendants' second claim in this appeal, which goes to\n\nthe   merits    of     plaintiff's       suit,    is   that     the   preliminary\n\ninjunction     should     be      dissolved     because   it    is    premised    on\n\nerroneous      findings      by    the   district      court.        Specifically,\n\ndefendants claim that the court erred as a matter of fact in\n\ndetermining that Northern Lights manifested a bad-faith intent\n\nto profit from plaintiff's mark, and as a matter of law in\n\nconcluding      that    ACPA      should   be     applied      retroactively      to\n\nencompass defendants' behavior prior to the enactment of the\n\nstatute.\n\n\n      10\n       We believe that the service of process effected upon\nBurgar    also conferred personal jurisdiction over the other\ndefendants. Burgar serves as the president of both Northern\nLights Club, an unincorporated association, and 641271 Alberta,\nLtd., a foreign corporation.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)\n(permitting personal service of process upon officers of\nunincorporated associations and foreign corporations).\n     In all events, defendants have attacked the efficacy of\nservice of process only in general. They have not attacked its\nefficacy vis-à-vis particular defendants. Consequently, we deem\nwaived any possible argument that personal service upon Burgar\nwas ineffectual as a means of bringing Northern Lights Club\nand/or 641271 Alberta, Ltd. before the court.\n\n                                         -19-\n\f                         A. Defendants' Bad Faith\n\n           Defendants vehemently contest the district court's\n\nfinding    that    the     registration      and   maintenance    of    the\n\nnorthernlights.com domain name represented a bad-faith effort to\n\nprofit from plaintiff's Northern Light trademark.            The issue of\n\nbad faith is principally relevant to the merits of plaintiff's\n\nsuit insofar as \"bad faith intent to profit from [another's]\n\nmark\" constitutes an essential element of the cause of action\n\nunder ACPA.       15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(A)(i).            In this case,\n\nhowever, it also relates, albeit tangentially, to plaintiff's\n\ntrademark-infringement claim.          This is so because the district\n\ncourt's finding with respect to defendants' intent in adopting\n\nthe   Northern    Lights    mark,    which   the   court   rendered    while\n\nconsidering one of the eight factors under the \"likelihood-of-\n\nconfusion\" test for trademark infringement, see, e.g., I.P. Lund\n\nTrading ApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 43 (1st Cir. 1998),\n\nexpressly incorporated by reference the intent findings it had\n\nmade in its ACPA analysis.          See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 114.   Thus, we\n\nmust consider the court's \"bad-faith intent to profit\" findings\n\nto the extent that they bear on the trademark-infringement\n\nclaim.    We review the district court's finding of bad faith for\n\nclear error.      See American Bd. of Psychiatry & Neurology v.\n\nJohnson-Powell, 129 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting clear-\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\ferror standard of review applies to findings of fact made in\n\nconjunction with ruling on motion for preliminary injunction)\n\n(citing Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp., 888 F.2d 215,\n\n222 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n              On appeal, defendants claim that their conduct did not\n\nmeet the statutory guidelines for a finding of bad faith, and\n\nthat even if it did, the subjective and objective reasonableness\n\nof their actions should shield them from liability.                       Defendants\n\nstress that their mere registration of multiple domain names\n\ndoes not, by itself, indicate that they were acting in bad faith\n\nwith regard to any of their individual registrations or website\n\nuses.   Defendants also assert that the statements of Burgar have\n\nbeen taken out of context by the district court, and have been\n\nunfairly used to establish Northern Lights's bad faith.\n\n              Along    with    its     inclusion      of    bad   faith     among    the\n\nessential      elements       of    the     ACPA    cause   of    action,    Congress\n\nprovided nine nonexhaustive guideposts that courts may use to\n\ndivine whether or not bad faith exists.                           See 15 U.S.C. §§\n\n1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(I)-(IX).              In addition, the statute provides an\n\n\"escape     clause\"      to        those    whose     conduct     would     otherwise\n\nconstitute bad faith if the potential infringer \"believed and\n\nhad reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the domain\n\nname    was     a     fair     use     or     otherwise      lawful.\"          Id.     §\n\n\n                                            -21-\n\f1125(d)(1)(B)(ii).         In this case, the district court determined\n\nthat   defendants'        myriad    explanations       for   their      use   of   the\n\nnorthernlights.com site – e.g., as an experimental new business\n\nmodel,    as   a   site    for     aurora    borealis    admirers,        and   as    a\n\ncompilation of businesses that contain the phrase \"Northern\n\nLights\"   –    undermined        Northern    Lights's    claim     of     subjective\n\nbelief in fair use, and hence their entitlement to the \"escape\n\nclause\" of § 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii).               See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 118-19.\n\nAdditionally, the court concluded that the defendants' numerous\n\nregistrations      of     domain    names    containing      the   trademarks        of\n\nothers, which defendants accomplished in some cases by creating\n\nfictional \"fan clubs\" so that they could present a mantle of\n\nlegitimacy in their registration requests to NSI, represented\n\npowerful evidence of             defendants' bad faith in operating the\n\nnorthernlights.com site.              This conclusion of bad faith was\n\nreinforced, according to the district court, by defendants'\n\nhistory of disregarding cease-and-desist letters from legitimate\n\ntrademark      owners,     and    their     apparent    openness     to    sell    the\n\nnorthernlight.com registration to the plaintiff at the right\n\nprice.    Id. at 119-20.\n\n              Based on our review of the record, we see no clear\n\nerror in the district court's finding that defendants will\n\nlikely be found to have acted in bad faith in operating the\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fnorthernlights.com site. 11       Although defendants are correct in\n\nasserting   that   their      multiple    registrations    alone   are   not\n\ndispositive   of   the    bad-faith      issue,   their   well-established\n\npattern of registering multiple domain names containing famous\n\ntrademarks,   such       as   rollingstones.com,      evinrude.com,      and\n\ngivenchy.com, has been made highly relevant to the determination\n\nof bad faith by the list of factors in ACPA.              See 15 U.S.C. §\n\n1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VIII) (noting as relevant factor \"the person's\n\nregistration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the\n\nperson knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of\n\nothers that are distinctive at the time of registration of such\n\ndomain names\").      Those facts are not clearly trumped by facts\n\nfavoring defendants' side of the story, such as their use of\n\nnorthernlights.com as an e-mail domain name for several years\n\nprior to the dispute with the plaintiff and Burgar's initial\n\nresistance to the plaintiff's efforts to acquire defendants'\n\ndomain-name registration.         The district court's finding that\n\ndefendants were not entitled to the \"escape clause\"            also is not\n\nclearly erroneous; as the court found, defendants' oft-changing\n\nexplanations for the purpose of the northernlights.com website\n\n\n\n     11\n      The district court found that defendants' posting of a\nwebsite at northernlights.com, rather than their initial domain-\nname registration, was the act that constituted bad-faith intent\nto profit in this case. See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 119 n.27.\n\n                                   -23-\n\fevince a lack of subjective belief in the domain name's fair\n\nuse.\n\n            Based   on   defendants'    apparent   modus   operandi   of\n\nregistering domain names containing the famous trademarks of\n\nothers in the hope that the famous trademark holder will be\n\nwilling to pay to reclaim its intellectual-property rights, the\n\ndistrict    court   reasonably   concluded    that   defendants   acted\n\naccording to script in this case. 12       Accordingly, we determine\n\nthat the district court did not err in finding that defendants\n\nwill likely be found to have acted in bad faith in operating\n\ntheir northernlights.com website.\n\n                B. Retroactive Application of ACPA\n\n            Defendants also ask that we review the district court's\n\nlegal determination that the retroactive application of ACPA to\n\nthe facts of this case is permissible.13           After reviewing the\n\n\n       12\n       Defendants claim that since they expected no revenue\nstream from the content on the northernlights.com website, they\ncould not have acted with a bad-faith intent to profit. Based\non their past practices, however, it is reasonable to conclude\nthat defendants harbored a broader, more long-term notion of\n\"profit.\" Instead, defendants likely hoped to cash in on the\nconfusion surrounding the sponsorship of the websites by finding\nfamous trademark holders willing to pay defendants to end the\ndiversion of Internet traffic from their website to defendants'\nsites.\n       13\n      As we recently noted in Hasbro, Inc. v. Clue Computing,\nInc., 232 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2000) (per curiam), courts are split\non the issue of whether recent Lanham Act provisions should be\napplied retroactively. Compare, e.g., Sporty's Farm, L.L.C. v.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fdistrict court opinion and the parties' briefs, however, we find\n\nit unnecessary to reach this issue, as even if we were to decide\n\nthe   matter    in     defendants'    favor,      it       would   not   provide      an\n\nadequate   basis       for   dissolving    the    injunction.            This   is    so\n\nbecause the district court expressly stated that its decision to\n\nimpose a preliminary injunction rested principally upon its\n\nfinding that Internet users would likely be confused by the\n\nconcomitant          existence     of      the         northernlight.com             and\n\nnorthernlights.com marks.            See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 121 (\"Before\n\nturning    to    the    balancing       factors,       I    must     emphasize       the\n\nimportance      of   the     likelihood   of     confusion         findings     to   the\n\npreliminary injunction calculus.\").                Because an ACPA violation\n\ndoes not require a showing of likely confusion,14 the district\n\ncourt's decision to enter a preliminary injunction must have\n\nbeen based on its resolution of the non-ACPA claims, such as\n\nplaintiff's trademark-infringement claim.                      In their appeal,\n\n\n\nSportsman's Market, Inc., 202 F.3d 489, 496-97 (2d Cir.)\n(concluding that ACPA should apply retroactively), cert. denied,\n120 S. Ct. 2719 (2000) with Thomas & Betts Corp. v. Panduit\nCorp., 108 F. Supp. 2d 976 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (holding that new\ntrade-dress provisions of Lanham Act should not be applied\nretroactively).\n      14\n      As the district court noted, the \"likelihood of confusion\"\ntest of trademark infringement is \"more comprehensive\" than the\n\"identical or confusingly similar\" requirement of ACPA, as it\nrequires considering factors beyond the facial similarity of the\ntwo marks. 97 F. Supp. 2d at 117.\n\n                                        -25-\n\fdefendants' only argument on the merits that does not impugn the\n\ndistrict court's ACPA findings concerns the determination that\n\nNorthern Lights acted in bad faith.   And as we have determined\n\nin Part III.A, supra, that finding was not clearly erroneous.\n\nThus, no matter how we might resolve the ACPA-retroactivity\n\nissue – and we expressly eschew doing so at this time – our\n\ndecision would fail to affect the validity of the injunction.15\n\n          In sum, we conclude that defendants have identified no\n\nbasis for overturning the preliminary injunction already in\n\nplace.   We therefore affirm its issuance by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n    15Defendants do claim that there were other \"grossly unfair\nfactual errors by the trial court\" which constituted \"an\negregious result-driven pattern of prejudice\" against them. But\nthey have failed to specify those errors in their appellate\nbriefs.\n\n                              -26-\n\f        IV. First Amendment Overbreadth of the Injunction\n\n              Defendants argue that the scope of the preliminary\n\ninjunction violates the First Amendment.                 We need not, however,\n\nconsider that issue here, for although it may have been raised\n\nbelow, defendants did no more than obliquely refer to the issue\n\nwhen    the    district      court     held    the   critical     hearing,      and\n\nsubsequently        took   part   in    the    framing    of   the    preliminary\n\ninjunction.         Because we do not find waiver, the issue can be\n\nargued in the trial on the merits.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n              Because      the    district       court    obtained         personal\n\njurisdiction over defendants when Burgar was served with process\n\nwhile   in    the    forum    state,    we     affirm,   albeit      on   different\n\ngrounds, the court's personal-jurisdiction finding.                       We find no\n\nbasis for disturbing the court's determination of likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits of plaintiff's suit, and therefore affirm\n\nthose portions of the district court's opinion.                   Finally, while\n\nnot precluding further consideration of the First Amendment\n\nissue at trial, we decline to resolve defendants' free-speech\n\nchallenge to the scope of the injunction at this time.\n\n              Affirmed.

Defendants-appellants Northern Lights Club, Jeff Burgar and 641271 Alberta Ltd. (collectively \"Northern Lights\" or \"defendants\") appeal a preliminary injunction entered by the district court requiring the posting of a specified disclaimer on their World Wide Web site's portal page. The court entered the injunction after finding that plaintiff-appellee Northern Light Technology, Inc. (\"Northern Light\" or \"plaintiff\") was likely to prevail on the merits of its state and federal trademark claims and its claim under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(d) (\"ACPA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert three bases for relief in this interlocutory appeal: (1) that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction, and hence the power to enjoin them; (2) that the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims; and (3) that the injunction currently in place is overly broad and consequently infringes their free-speech rights. Finding that the district court properly acquired jurisdiction over defendants when their agent was served with process within the forum state, and discerning no basis for disturbing the district court's determination on the likely success of plaintiff's suit, we uphold the district court's issuance of a preliminary injunction. And because defendants only obliquely pressed their First Amendment argument before the district court, we decline to decide the issue for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are extensively chronicled in the district court's opinion, see Northern Light Tech., Inc. v. Northern Lights Club, 97 F. Supp. 2d 96 (D. Mass. 2000), and so we confine our discussion to the events relevant to this appeal. On September 16, 1996, plaintiff registered the Internet domain name northernlight.com with Network Solutions, Inc. (\"NSI\"), which at that time was the organization exclusively entrusted with the task of registering domain names on the World Wide Web.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Plaintiff also filed registration papers for the \"Northern Light\" service mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") during that same month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nearly a year later, in August 1997, plaintiff began its operation of the northernlight.com website (and, consequently, its use of the \"Northern Light\" mark in commerce) as a search engine. Search engines are popular Web-retrieval tools that match a search query submitted by an Internet user with the websites whose content best corresponds to the submitted search terms. The northernlight.com site has remained in continuous existence as a search engine since August 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Jeff Burgar, a resident of High Prairie, Alberta, Canada, is the president and principal shareholder of 641271 Alberta, Ltd., an Alberta corporation that owns the northernlights.com domain name. Burgar, a self-described \"Internet entrepreneur,\" has, since the mid-1990s, registered thousands of \"catchy\" domain names - i.e., Internet addresses appropriating, in identical or slightly modified form, the names of popular people and organizations. He is also the president of Northern Lights Club, an unincorporated association with a listed address in Las Vegas, Nevada. While Northern Lights Club's stated mission is to bring together devotees of the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, including businesses that take their name from the famous celestial phenomenon, Burgar's testimony indicates that the club has no actual individual members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1996, approximately one month after plaintiff registered its northernlight.com website, Burgar, on behalf of Northern Lights Club, registered the northernlights.com domain name with NSI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Soon after registration, Burgar licensed the name to FlairMail, a vanity e-mail service that he manages and that is owned by a local Alberta newspaper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Burgar \"believes\" that this newspaper is owned by his wife. Under this arrangement with FlairMail, defendants offered e-mail accounts under the northernlights.com domain name that users could access through some other website, such as flairmail.com, although Internet users who attempted to visit the northernlights.com page on the World Wide Web would find that no such site existed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two similar domain-name registrations enjoyed a peaceful coexistence until March 2, 1999, when a USA Today story on Internet search engines erroneously identified plaintiff's website as northernlights.com. After ascertaining that defendants were the owners of this domain name, plaintiff's marketing director contacted Burgar to find out whether defendants might be interested in selling it. The parties exchanged a series of proposals and counterproposals by e-mail over a two-month period but ultimately no sales or licensing agreement was consummated. Soon thereafter, in April 1999, defendants posted an active page on the northernlights.com World Wide Web site. Visitors to the site saw, among other things, a site-search function near the top of the screen that enabled users to perform a search of the northernlights.com site for specific words or phrases, as well as links to FlairMail and other members of the \"Northern Lights Community.\" Plaintiff's Web site was placed third in the list of the Northern Lights Community \"Business Listings.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Plaintiff had not agreed to this listing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 14, 1999, plaintiff sent Burgar a cease-and-desist letter, demanding that the northernlights.com site be deactivated. Defendants chose not to respond to this letter. Fifteen days later, plaintiff asked NSI to strip defendants of the northernlights.com domain name based on the similarity of their respective marks, but NSI declined, citing the one-letter discrepancy between the name of defendant's website and plaintiff's trademark. On August 6, 1999, plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit under federal and state theories of unfair competition, trademark infringement, and trademark dilution. In its complaint, plaintiff sought both a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. In December 1999, plaintiff amended its complaint to add a claim under ACPA (which had been enacted into law less than one month earlier) and to abandon its federal trademark-dilution claim and its state-law claims of unfair competition and trademark dilution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moments before the district court hearing on September 1, 1999 to consider the merits of plaintiff's claims and the court's personal jurisdiction over defendants, plaintiff's agent physically served process upon Burgar, who had traveled voluntarily to Boston from Alberta to witness the proceedings and to make himself available for testimony if needed. Although the hearing itself focused largely on the convoluted issues of personal jurisdiction arising from Internet activities, it also touched upon the merits of plaintiff's request for preliminary injunctive relief. At the end of the hearing, the district court indicated that it would issue a temporary restraining order modifying the content of the northernlights.com site to prevent further public confusion, and solicited advice from both parties as to the appropriate substance of that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True to its word, the district court imposed the TRO the following day, stating that Northern Light had successfully demonstrated probable personal jurisdiction, that it would be likely to succeed in its trademark-infringement suit, and that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored temporary relief. The court ordered that defendants remove all content from the northernlights.com site and post in its place a blacked-out screen containing only an image of the auroraborealis and links to three websites: (1) flairmail.com (where users could access their northernlights.com e-mail accounts); (2) plaintiff's northernlight.com site; and (3) the content page that formerly existed at northernlights.com, to be described, for purposes of the link, as \"BUSINESSES THAT ARE LISTED WITH THE NORTHERN LIGHTS COMMUNITY.\" On the same day that this ruling was issued, the parties jointly moved the court for a continuance of \"at least 60 days.\" In this joint motion, defendants acquiesced in an extension of the restraining order against them until discovery and further hearings in the matter were conducted, and the parties agreed to a schedule governing the completion of discovery and the filing of any additional motions. The court granted this motion, and both parties submitted further motions during this period. After granting several motions for extensions of time, the district court ultimately held hearings on January 19 and 21, 2000 on the personal-jurisdiction issue and the merits of plaintiff's request for preliminary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its written opinion issued on March 31, 2000, the district court ordered, inter alia, that what had become a defacto preliminary injunction should remain in place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In so doing, the court began by holding that it had personal jurisdiction over defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It determined that plaintiff had satisfied sections 3(c) and 3(d) of the Massachusetts Long-Arm Statute, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, &#167; 3, because defendants had likely caused tortious injury to plaintiffs in Massachusetts, both through their acts within the Commonwealth (in the form of their trademark-infringing website) and their regular solicitation of business through acts outside of the Commonwealth (by virtue of, inter alia, the site's \"entice[ment]\" to users to post material). See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 104-06. The court also found that defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts to support the exercise of specific jurisdiction under International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), thereby satisfying the constitutional due-process element of personal jurisdiction. See Northern Light Tech., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d at 106-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits of plaintiff's suit, the district court found that, based on the likelihood of confusion between the two websites because of their similar form and function, plaintiff's state and federal trademark-infringement and unfair-competition causes of action would probably succeed. See id. at 109-15, 120. The court further opined that plaintiff was likely to succeed on its ACPA claim, based on the confusing similarity of the two domain names and proof of defendants' bad-faith intent to profit from plaintiff's northernlight.com mark. See id. at 115-20. On the latter issue, the court reasoned that, although Burgar's initial reluctance to sell the northernlights.com site and defendants' uninterrupted use of the northernlights.com name for vanity e-mail accounts militated against a bad-faith finding, defendants' historical practice of \"targeting trademarked names, creating fictional entities to register them, and offering dubious explanations for the selection of these domain names\" ultimately tipped the scales in favor of such a preliminary determination. Id. at 119. Finally, the district court found that plaintiff had established a likelihood of irreparable harm, that the balance of hardships favored the plaintiff, and that the public interest favored the preservation of the preliminary injunction already in place. See id. at 120-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants dispute the district court's personal-jurisdiction ruling and aspects of its decision regarding the likelihood of plaintiff's success on the merits. Defendants also pursue their argument, not expressly considered by the district court, that the present injunction unduly burdens their First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants first challenge the injunction entered by the district court on the ground that the court was without personal jurisdiction to order such a remedy. At each stage of the proceedings, the parties have contested whether defendants' activities, both in terms of the content of their website and their discussions with the plaintiff regarding a potential business venture, meet the personal-jurisdiction criteria of the Massachusetts Long-Arm Statute and the requirements of due process. Plaintiff also posited a more conventional basis for personal jurisdiction in the district court - namely, the service of process effected upon Burgar just prior to the September 1, 1999 preliminary injunction hearing. We afford plenary review to the district court's determination of personal jurisdiction, and may affirm its judgment for any independent reason supported by the record. See, e.g., Phillips Exeter Acad. v. Howard Phillips Fund, Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 288 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court expressly declined to consider the validity of personal jurisdiction based on physical service of process. See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 108 n.12. On appeal, however, plaintiff continues to press its case that, under the doctrine of transient jurisdiction, it has satisfactorily created jurisdiction through its service of process on Burgar prior to the September 1, 1999 hearing. See Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990) (plurality opinion); Schinkel v. Maxi-Holding, Inc., 565 N.E.2d 1219, 1222-23 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991) (holding that personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts need not be predicated on Long-Arm Statute when defendant served with process while in forum under transient-jurisdiction doctrine). Defendants dispute this proposition, claiming that this method of service of process is fundamentally unfair in that it represents a trap for the unwary litigant who travels to the forum state solely to contest the issue of personal jurisdiction. Defendants also argue that permitting service of process under these circumstances is unwise from a public-policy perspective in that it discourages the litigant from actively assisting the district court in the jurisdictional- discovery process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they do not specifically ask for process immunity, defendants' argument against personal jurisdiction essentially boils down to a request that Burgar be deemed immune from service of process since, at the time he was served, he was present in Massachusetts only for the purpose of attending a personal-jurisdiction hearing in this lawsuit. This argument enjoys some measure of historical pedigree, albeit in a related context. Long before the Supreme Court in Burnham affirmed that personal jurisdiction can be sustained against a defendant solely on the basis of his presence in the forum state at the time of service of process, it had recognized that some parties temporarily in the forum state enjoy immunity from service by virtue of their status as participants in ongoing litigation. For instance, in Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U.S. 222 (1932), the Court noted the potential peril of allowing an individual who is attending a proceeding in one suit to be served with process in conjunction with another:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he due administration of justice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a cause pending before it, by the service of process in other suits, which would prevent, or the fear of which might tend to discourage, the voluntary attendance of those whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the pending litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 225 (internal citations omitted). Similarly, Justice Scalia's plurality opinion in Burnham referred to several states' historical imposition of statutory or common-law prohibitions on the service of process of those individuals present in the forum as parties or witnesses in unrelated judicial proceedings - a practice that led him to conclude that transient jurisdiction comported with constitutional due process. See 495 U.S. at 613.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accompanying the courts' repeated recognition of the validity of the party/witness immunity exception, however, has been a persistent acknowledgment of the exception's limitations. The Lamb Court itself noted that, because the privilege exists for the convenience of the district court in its exercise of judicial administration, rather than to protect the individual seeking to avoid service of process, courts enjoy the discretion to confer (or deny) immunity in such instances. See 285 U.S. at 225 (citing Stewart v. Ramsay, 242 U.S. 128, 130 (1916)). Just as importantly, the extension of the privilege has been limited by the majority of courts to cases in which the party or witness was participating in an unrelated litigation at the time that he was served with process in the forum state. See, e.g., ARW Exploration Corp. v. Aguirre, 45 F.3d 1455, 1460 (10th Cir. 1995) (denying process immunity where party was served with process in second lawsuit while attending deposition in first lawsuit alleging similar facts); In re Fish &amp; Neave, 519 F.2d 116, 118 (8th Cir. 1975) (similar); LaCroix v. American Horse Show Ass'n, 853 F. Supp. 992, 994-95 (N.D. Ohio 1994) (applying Lamb and denying defendants' claim of entitlement to immunity based on appearance in forum state solely to contest personal jurisdiction); 4 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1080, at 511 (2d ed. 1987) (\"There is generally no immunity from service of process when the suit in which immunity is sought is part of, or a continuation of, the suit for which the person claiming immunity is in the jurisdiction.\"); see also Lamb, 285 U.S. at 225 (\"[T]he [process-immunity] privilege should not be enlarged beyond the reason upon which it is founded, and . . . should be extended or withheld only as judicial necessities require.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The rationale for the differing-lawsuit prerequisite to process immunity in this context is relatively straightforward: while a court can, in cases before it, choose to protect the jurisdictional status of a party or witness who is reluctant to come to the forum state by issuing protective orders or subpoenas, it cannot wield such power in other cases. The process-immunity exception therefore fills the gap only where it needs to be filled - that is, in cases where a district court wishes to shield an individual from service of process to encourage his or her travel to the forum state, but would be unable to do so absent the power to grant immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the facts of this case, several features of defendants' litigation posture counsel against a finding that Burgar is entitled to process immunity. First, and most apparent, is the fact that defendants have never asked the district court for such immunity on behalf of Burgar, either prior to or following the hearing at which Burgar was served with process. In lieu of a specific request for immunity, defendants instead have asked this court to fashion a broad, perse rule precluding the exercise of personal jurisdiction whenever the served individual is in the jurisdiction to attend litigation-related proceedings that pertain to him or her. In light of the admonitions in Lamb and other cases that process immunity should be meted out sparingly, we reject this suggestion. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the service of process on Burgar are not those that would ordinarily favor a finding of immunity even in a case where it had been timely requested. Specifically, Burgar voluntarily entered into Massachusetts to attend proceedings as a spectator in the same case in which he was served with process. While we need not decide the issue, it seems apparent that under these facts, the district court would have faced a relatively heavy presumption against granting such immunity if it actually had been sought by Burgar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that the district court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over defendants in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Based on this determination, we need not reach the alternate bases for personal jurisdiction discussed in the district court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Plaintiff's Likelihood of Success on the Merits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' second claim in this appeal, which goes to the merits of plaintiff's suit, is that the preliminary injunction should be dissolved because it is premised on erroneous findings by the district court. Specifically, defendants claim that the court erred as a matter of fact in determining that Northern Lights manifested a bad-faith intent to profit from plaintiff's mark, and as a matter of law in concluding that ACPA should be applied retroactively to encompass defendants' behavior prior to the enactment of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Defendants' Bad Faith</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants vehemently contest the district court's finding that the registration and maintenance of the northernlights.com domain name represented a bad-faith effort to profit from plaintiff's Northern Light trademark. The issue of bad faith is principally relevant to the merits of plaintiff's suit insofar as \"bad faith intent to profit from [another's] mark\" constitutes an essential element of the cause of action under ACPA. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(d)(1)(A)(i). In this case, however, it also relates, albeit tangentially, to plaintiff's trademark-infringement claim. This is so because the district court's finding with respect to defendants' intent in adopting the Northern Lights mark, which the court rendered while considering one of the eight factors under the \"likelihood-of-confusion\" test for trademark infringement, see, e.g., I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 43 (1st Cir. 1998), expressly incorporated by reference the intent findings it had made in its ACPA analysis. See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 114. Thus, we must consider the court's \"bad-faith intent to profit\" findings to the extent that they bear on the trademark-infringement claim. We review the district court's finding of bad faith for clear error. See American Bd. of Psychiatry &amp; Neurology v. Johnson-Powell, 129 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting clear-error standard of review applies to findings of fact made in conjunction with ruling on motion for preliminary injunction) (citing Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp., 888 F.2d 215, 222 (1st Cir. 1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants claim that their conduct did not meet the statutory guidelines for a finding of bad faith, and that even if it did, the subjective and objective reasonableness of their actions should shield them from liability. Defendants stress that their mere registration of multiple domain names does not, by itself, indicate that they were acting in bad faith with regard to any of their individual registrations or website uses. Defendants also assert that the statements of Burgar have been taken out of context by the district court, and have been unfairly used to establish Northern Lights's bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with its inclusion of bad faith among the essential elements of the ACPA cause of action, Congress provided nine nonexhaustive guideposts that courts may use to divine whether or not bad faith exists. See 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(I)-(IX). In addition, the statute provides an \"escape clause\" to those whose conduct would otherwise constitute bad faith if the potential infringer \"believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the domain name was a fair use or otherwise lawful.\" Id. &#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii). In this case, the district court determined that defendants' myriad explanations for their use of the northernlights.com site - e.g., as an experimental new business model, as a site for aurora borealis admirers, and as a compilation of businesses that contain the phrase \"Northern Lights\" - undermined Northern Lights's claim of subjective belief in fair use, and hence their entitlement to the \"escape clause\" of &#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii). See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 118-19. Additionally, the court concluded that the defendants' numerous registrations of domain names containing the trademarks of others, which defendants accomplished in some cases by creating fictional \"fan clubs\" so that they could present a mantle of legitimacy in their registration requests to NSI, represented powerful evidence of defendants' bad faith in operating the northernlights.com site. This conclusion of bad faith was reinforced, according to the district court, by defendants' history of disregarding cease-and-desist letters from legitimate trademark owners, and their apparent openness to sell the northernlight.com registration to the plaintiff at the right price. Id. at 119-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our review of the record, we see no clear error in the district court's finding that defendants will likely be found to have acted in bad faith in operating the northernlights.com site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Although defendants are correct in asserting that their multiple registrations alone are not dispositive of the bad-faith issue, their well-established pattern of registering multiple domain names containing famoustrademarks, such as rollingstones.com, evinrude.com, and givenchy.com, has been made highly relevant to the determination of bad faith by the list of factors in ACPA. See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VIII) (noting as relevant factor \"the person's registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of registration of such domain names\"). Those facts are not clearly trumped by facts favoring defendants' side of the story, such as their use of northernlights.com as an e-mail domain name for several years prior to the dispute with the plaintiff and Burgar's initial resistance to the plaintiff's efforts to acquire defendants' domain-name registration. The district court's finding that defendants were not entitled to the \"escape clause\" also is not clearly erroneous; as the court found, defendants' oft-changing explanations for the purpose of the northernlights.com website evince a lack of subjective belief in the domain name's fair use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on defendants' apparent modus operandi of registering domain names containing the famous trademarks of others in the hope that the famous trademark holder will be willing to pay to reclaim its intellectual-property rights, the district court reasonably concluded that defendants acted according to script in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Accordingly, we determine that the district court did not err in finding that defendants will likely be found to have acted in bad faith in operating their northernlights.com website.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Retroactive Application of ACPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also ask that we review the district court's legal determination that the retroactive application of ACPA to the facts of this case is permissible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> After reviewing the district court opinion and the parties' briefs, however, we find it unnecessary to reach this issue, as even if we were to decide the matter in defendants' favor, it would not provide an adequate basis for dissolving the injunction. This is so because the district court expressly stated that its decision to impose a preliminary injunction rested principally upon its finding that Internet users would likely be confused by the concomitant existence of the northernlight.com and northernlights.com marks. See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 121 (\"Before turning to the balancing factors, I must emphasize the importance of the likelihood of confusion findings to the preliminary injunction calculus.\"). Because an ACPA violation does not require a showing of likely confusion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> the district court's decision to enter a preliminary injunction must have been based on its resolution of the non-ACPA claims, such as plaintiff's trademark-infringement claim. In their appeal, defendants' only argument on the merits that does not impugn the district court's ACPA findings concerns the determination that Northern Lights acted in bad faith. And as we have determined in Part III.A, supra, that finding was not clearly erroneous. Thus, no matter how we might resolve the ACPA-retroactivity issue - and we expressly eschew doing so at this time - our decision would fail to affect the validity of the injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that defendants have identified no basis for overturning the preliminary injunction already in place. We therefore affirm its issuance by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. First Amendment Overbreadth of the Injunction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the scope of the preliminary injunction violates the First Amendment. We need not, however, consider that issue here, for although it may have been raised below, defendants did no more than obliquely refer to the issue when the district court held the critical hearing, and subsequently took part in the framing of the preliminary injunction. Because we do not find waiver, the issue can be argued in the trial on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court obtained personal jurisdiction over defendants when Burgar was served with process while in the forum state, we affirm, albeit on different grounds, the court's personal-jurisdiction finding. We find no basis for disturbing the court's determination of likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiff's suit, and therefore affirm those portions of the district court's opinion. Finally, while not precluding further consideration of the First Amendment issue at trial, we decline to resolve defendants' free-speech challenge to the scope of the injunction at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Those cases hold that process immunity should be granted to non-residents present in the forum state to participate in any litigation, whether or not related to the suit for which the disputed service has been effected, as long as such immunity does not obstruct justice in the first suit.

Defendants-appellants Northern Lights Club, Jeff Burgar and 641271 Alberta Ltd. (collectively \"Northern Lights\" or \"defendants\") appeal a preliminary injunction entered by the district court requiring the posting of a specified disclaimer on their World Wide Web site's portal page. The court entered the injunction after finding that plaintiff-appellee Northern Light Technology, Inc. (\"Northern Light\" or \"plaintiff\") was likely to prevail on the merits of its state and federal trademark claims and its claim under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(d) (\"ACPA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants assert three bases for relief in this interlocutory appeal: (1) that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction, and hence the power to enjoin them; (2) that the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims; and (3) that the injunction currently in place is overly broad and consequently infringes their free-speech rights. Finding that the district court properly acquired jurisdiction over defendants when their agent was served with process within the forum state, and discerning no basis for disturbing the district court's determination on the likely success of plaintiff's suit, we uphold the district court's issuance of a preliminary injunction. And because defendants only obliquely pressed their First Amendment argument before the district court, we decline to decide the issue for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are extensively chronicled in the district court's opinion, see Northern Light Tech., Inc. v. Northern Lights Club, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2339874\"><a href=\"/opinion/2339874/northern-light-technology-v-northern-lights-club/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (D. Mass. 2000), and so we confine our discussion to the events relevant to this appeal. On September 16, 1996, plaintiff registered the Internet domain name northernlight.com with Network Solutions, Inc. (\"NSI\"), which at that time was the organization exclusively entrusted with the task of registering domain names on the World Wide Web.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Plaintiff also filed registration papers for the \"Northern Light\" service mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") during that same month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Nearly a year later, in August 1997, plaintiff began its operation of the northernlight.com website (and, consequently, its use of the \"Northern Light\" mark in commerce) as a search engine. Search engines are popular Web-retrieval tools that match a search query submitted by an Internet user with the websites whose content best corresponds to the submitted search terms. The northernlight.com site has remained in continuous existence as a search engine since August 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Jeff Burgar, a resident of High Prairie, Alberta, Canada, is the president and principal shareholder of 641271 Alberta, Ltd., an Alberta corporation that owns the northernlights.com domain name. Burgar, a self-described \"Internet entrepreneur,\" has, since the mid-1990s, registered thousands of \"catchy\" domain names - i.e., Internet addresses appropriating, in identical or slightly modified form, the names of popular people and organizations. He is also the president of Northern Lights Club, an unincorporated association with a listed address in Las Vegas, Nevada. While Northern Lights Club's stated mission is to bring together devotees of the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, including businesses that take their name from the famous celestial phenomenon, Burgar's testimony indicates that the club has no actual individual members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1996, approximately one month after plaintiff registered its northernlight.com website, Burgar, on behalf of Northern Lights Club, registered the northernlights.com domain name with NSI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Soon after registration, Burgar licensed the name to FlairMail, a vanity e-mail service that he manages and that is owned by a local Alberta newspaper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Burgar \"believes\" that this newspaper is owned by his wife. Under this arrangement with FlairMail, defendants offered e-mail accounts under the northernlights.com domain name that users could access through some other website, such as flairmail.com, although Internet users who attempted to visit the northernlights.com page on the World Wide Web would find that no such site existed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two similar domain-name registrations enjoyed a peaceful coexistence until March 2, 1999, when a USA Today story on Internet search engines erroneously identified plaintiff's website as northernlights.com. After ascertaining that defendants were the owners of this domain name, plaintiff's marketing director contacted Burgar to find out whether defendants might be interested in selling it. The parties exchanged a series of proposals and counterproposals by e-mail over a two-month period but ultimately no sales or licensing agreement was consummated. Soon thereafter, in April 1999, defendants posted an active page on the northernlights.com World Wide Web site. Visitors to the site saw, among other things, a site-search function near the top of the screen that enabled users to perform a search of the northernlights.com site for specific words or phrases, as well as links to FlairMail and other members of the \"Northern Lights Community.\" Plaintiff's Web site was placed third in the list of the Northern Lights Community \"Business Listings.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Plaintiff had not agreed to this listing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 14, 1999, plaintiff sent Burgar a cease-and-desist letter, demanding that the northernlights.com site be deactivated. Defendants chose not to respond to this letter. Fifteen days later, plaintiff asked NSI to strip defendants of the northernlights.com domain name based on the similarity of their respective marks, but NSI declined, citing the one-letter discrepancy between the name of defendant's website and plaintiff's trademark. On August 6, 1999, plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit under federal and state theories of unfair competition, trademark infringement, and trademark dilution. In its complaint, plaintiff sought both a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. In December 1999, plaintiff amended its complaint to add a claim under ACPA (which had been enacted into law less than one month earlier) and to abandon its federal trademark-dilution claim and its state-law claims of unfair competition and trademark dilution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moments before the district court hearing on September 1, 1999 to consider the merits of plaintiff's claims and the court's personal jurisdiction over defendants, plaintiff's agent physically served process upon Burgar, who had traveled voluntarily to Boston from Alberta to witness the proceedings and to make himself available for testimony if needed. Although the hearing itself focused largely on the convoluted issues of personal jurisdiction arising from Internet activities, it also touched upon the merits of plaintiff's request for preliminary injunctive relief. At the end of the hearing, the district court indicated that it would issue a temporary restraining order modifying the content of the northernlights.com site to prevent further public confusion, and solicited advice from both parties as to the appropriate substance of that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True to its word, the district court imposed the TRO the following day, stating that Northern Light had successfully demonstrated probable personal jurisdiction, that it would be likely to succeed in its trademark-infringement suit, and that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored temporary relief. The court ordered that defendants remove all content from the northernlights.com site and post in its place a blacked-out screen containing only an image of the auroraborealis and links to three websites: (1) flairmail.com (where users could access their northernlights.com e-mail accounts); (2) plaintiff's northernlight.com site; and (3) the content page that formerly existed at northernlights.com, to be described, for purposes of the link, as \"BUSINESSES THAT ARE LISTED WITH THE NORTHERN LIGHTS COMMUNITY.\" On the same day that this ruling was issued, the parties jointly moved the court for a continuance of \"at least 60 days.\" In this joint motion, defendants acquiesced in an extension of the restraining order against them until discovery and further hearings in the matter were conducted, and the parties agreed to a schedule governing the completion of discovery and the filing of any additional motions. The court granted this motion, and both parties submitted further motions during this period. After granting several motions for extensions of time, the district court ultimately held hearings on January 19 and 21, 2000 on the personal-jurisdiction issue and the merits of plaintiff's request for preliminary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its written opinion issued on March 31, 2000, the district court ordered, inter alia, that what had become a defacto preliminary injunction should remain in place.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In so doing, the court began by holding that it had personal jurisdiction over defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> It determined that plaintiff had satisfied sections 3(c) and 3(d) of the Massachusetts Long-Arm Statute, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, &#167; 3, because defendants had likely caused tortious injury to plaintiffs in Massachusetts, both through their acts within the Commonwealth (in the form of their trademark-infringing website) and their regular solicitation of business through acts outside of the Commonwealth (by virtue of, inter alia, the site's \"entice[ment]\" to users to post material). See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 104-06. The court also found that defendants had sufficient contacts with Massachusetts to support the exercise of specific jurisdiction under International Shoe Co. v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span> (1945), thereby satisfying the constitutional due-process element of personal jurisdiction. See Northern Light Tech., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d at 106-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits of plaintiff's suit, the district court found that, based on the likelihood of confusion between the two websites because of their similar form and function, plaintiff's state and federal trademark-infringement and unfair-competition causes of action would probably succeed. See id. at 109-15, 120. The court further opined that plaintiff was likely to succeed on its ACPA claim, based on the confusing similarity of the two domain names and proof of defendants' bad-faith intent to profit from plaintiff's northernlight.com mark. See id. at 115-20. On the latter issue, the court reasoned that, although Burgar's initial reluctance to sell the northernlights.com site and defendants' uninterrupted use of the northernlights.com name for vanity e-mail accounts militated against a bad-faith finding, defendants' historical practice of \"targeting trademarked names, creating fictional entities to register them, and offering dubious explanations for the selection of these domain names\" ultimately tipped the scales in favor of such a preliminary determination. Id. at 119. Finally, the district court found that plaintiff had established a likelihood of irreparable harm, that the balance of hardships favored the plaintiff, and that the public interest favored the preservation of the preliminary injunction already in place. See id. at 120-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants dispute the district court's personal-jurisdiction ruling and aspects of its decision regarding the likelihood of plaintiff's success on the merits. Defendants also pursue their argument, not expressly considered by the district court, that the present injunction unduly burdens their First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants first challenge the injunction entered by the district court on the ground that the court was without personal jurisdiction to order such a remedy. At each stage of the proceedings, the parties have contested whether defendants' activities, both in terms of the content of their website and their discussions with the plaintiff regarding a potential business venture, meet the personal-jurisdiction criteria of the Massachusetts Long-Arm Statute and the requirements of due process. Plaintiff also posited a more conventional basis for personal jurisdiction in the district court - namely, the service of process effected upon Burgar just prior to the September 1, 1999 preliminary injunction hearing. We afford plenary review to the district court's determination of personal jurisdiction, and may affirm its judgment for any independent reason supported by the record.

App. Ct. 1991) (holding that personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts need not be predicated on Long-Arm Statute when defendant served with process while in forum under transient-jurisdiction doctrine). Defendants dispute this proposition, claiming that this method of service of process is fundamentally unfair in that it represents a trap for the unwary litigant who travels to the forum state solely to contest the issue of personal jurisdiction. Defendants also argue that permitting service of process under these circumstances is unwise from a public-policy perspective in that it discourages the litigant from actively assisting the district court in the jurisdictional- discovery process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although they do not specifically ask for process immunity, defendants' argument against personal jurisdiction essentially boils down to a request that Burgar be deemed immune from service of process since, at the time he was served, he was present in Massachusetts only for the purpose of attending a personal-jurisdiction hearing in this lawsuit. This argument enjoys some measure of historical pedigree, albeit in a related context. Long before the Supreme Court in Burnham affirmed that personal jurisdiction can be sustained against a defendant solely on the basis of his presence in the forum state at the time of service of process, it had recognized that some parties temporarily in the forum state enjoy immunity from service by virtue of their status as participants in ongoing litigation. For instance, in Lamb v. Schmitt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101882\"><a href=\"/opinion/101882/lamb-v-schmitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1932), the Court noted the potential peril of allowing an individual who is attending a proceeding in one suit to be served with process in conjunction with another:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he due administration of justice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a cause pending before it, by the service of process in other suits, which would prevent, or the fear of which might tend to discourage, the voluntary attendance of those whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the pending litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 225 (internal citations omitted). Similarly, Justice Scalia's plurality opinion in Burnham referred to several states' historical imposition of statutory or common-law prohibitions on the service of process of those individuals present in the forum as parties or witnesses in unrelated judicial proceedings - a practice that led him to conclude that transient jurisdiction comported with constitutional due process. See 495 U.S. at 613.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accompanying the courts' repeated recognition of the validity of the party/witness immunity exception, however, has been a persistent acknowledgment of the exception's limitations. The Lamb Court itself noted that, because the privilege exists for the convenience of the district court in its exercise of judicial administration, rather than to protect the individual seeking to avoid service of process, courts enjoy the discretion to confer (or deny) immunity in such instances. See 285 U.S. at 225 (citing Stewart v. Ramsay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98803\"><a href=\"/opinion/98803/stewart-v-ramsay/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 130 (1916)). Just as importantly, the extension of the privilege has been limited by the majority of courts to cases in which the party or witness was participating in an unrelated litigation at the time that he was served with process in the forum state.

Aguirre, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1455</span></span>, 1460 (10th Cir. 1995) (denying process immunity where party was served with process in second lawsuit while attending deposition in first lawsuit alleging similar facts); In re Fish &amp; Neave, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328758\"><a href=\"/opinion/328758/in-re-subpoenas-addressed-to-fish-neave-and-winthrop-stimson-putnam/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span>, 118 (8th Cir. 1975) (similar); LaCroix v.

Ohio 1994) (applying Lamb and denying defendants' claim of entitlement to immunity based on appearance in forum state solely to contest personal jurisdiction); 4 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1080, at 511 (2d ed. 1987) (\"There is generally no immunity from service of process when the suit in which immunity is sought is part of, or a continuation of, the suit for which the person claiming immunity is in the jurisdiction.\"); see also Lamb, 285 U.S. at 225 (\"[T]he [process-immunity] privilege should not be enlarged beyond the reason upon which it is founded, and . . . should be extended or withheld only as judicial necessities require.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The rationale for the differing-lawsuit prerequisite to process immunity in this context is relatively straightforward: while a court can, in cases before it, choose to protect the jurisdictional status of a party or witness who is reluctant to come to the forum state by issuing protective orders or subpoenas, it cannot wield such power in other cases. The process-immunity exception therefore fills the gap only where it needs to be filled - that is, in cases where a district court wishes to shield an individual from service of process to encourage his or her travel to the forum state, but would be unable to do so absent the power to grant immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the facts of this case, several features of defendants' litigation posture counsel against a finding that Burgar is entitled to process immunity. First, and most apparent, is the fact that defendants have never asked the district court for such immunity on behalf of Burgar, either prior to or following the hearing at which Burgar was served with process. In lieu of a specific request for immunity, defendants instead have asked this court to fashion a broad, perse rule precluding the exercise of personal jurisdiction whenever the served individual is in the jurisdiction to attend litigation-related proceedings that pertain to him or her. In light of the admonitions in Lamb and other cases that process immunity should be meted out sparingly, we reject this suggestion. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the service of process on Burgar are not those that would ordinarily favor a finding of immunity even in a case where it had been timely requested. Specifically, Burgar voluntarily entered into Massachusetts to attend proceedings as a spectator in the same case in which he was served with process. While we need not decide the issue, it seems apparent that under these facts, the district court would have faced a relatively heavy presumption against granting such immunity if it actually had been sought by Burgar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that the district court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over defendants in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Based on this determination, we need not reach the alternate bases for personal jurisdiction discussed in the district court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Plaintiff's Likelihood of Success on the Merits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' second claim in this appeal, which goes to the merits of plaintiff's suit, is that the preliminary injunction should be dissolved because it is premised on erroneous findings by the district court. Specifically, defendants claim that the court erred as a matter of fact in determining that Northern Lights manifested a bad-faith intent to profit from plaintiff's mark, and as a matter of law in concluding that ACPA should be applied retroactively to encompass defendants' behavior prior to the enactment of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Defendants' Bad Faith</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants vehemently contest the district court's finding that the registration and maintenance of the northernlights.com domain name represented a bad-faith effort to profit from plaintiff's Northern Light trademark. The issue of bad faith is principally relevant to the merits of plaintiff's suit insofar as \"bad faith intent to profit from [another's] mark\" constitutes an essential element of the cause of action under ACPA. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(d)(1)(A)(i). In this case, however, it also relates, albeit tangentially, to plaintiff's trademark-infringement claim. This is so because the district court's finding with respect to defendants' intent in adopting the Northern Lights mark, which the court rendered while considering one of the eight factors under the \"likelihood-of-confusion\" test for trademark infringement, see, e.g., I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198254\"><a href=\"/opinion/198254/kroni-inc-v-kohler-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1998), expressly incorporated by reference the intent findings it had made in its ACPA analysis. See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 114. Thus, we must consider the court's \"bad-faith intent to profit\" findings to the extent that they bear on the trademark-infringement claim. We review the district court's finding of bad faith for clear error. See American Bd. of Psychiatry &amp; Neurology v. Johnson-Powell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197616\"><a href=\"/opinion/197616/american-board-v-johnson-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting clear-error standard of review applies to findings of fact made in conjunction with ruling on motion for preliminary injunction) (citing Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531209\"><a href=\"/opinion/531209/the-keds-corp-v-renee-international-trading-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir. 1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, defendants claim that their conduct did not meet the statutory guidelines for a finding of bad faith, and that even if it did, the subjective and objective reasonableness of their actions should shield them from liability. Defendants stress that their mere registration of multiple domain names does not, by itself, indicate that they were acting in bad faith with regard to any of their individual registrations or website uses. Defendants also assert that the statements of Burgar have been taken out of context by the district court, and have been unfairly used to establish Northern Lights's bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along with its inclusion of bad faith among the essential elements of the ACPA cause of action, Congress provided nine nonexhaustive guideposts that courts may use to divine whether or not bad faith exists. See 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(I)-(IX). In addition, the statute provides an \"escape clause\" to those whose conduct would otherwise constitute bad faith if the potential infringer \"believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the domain name was a fair use or otherwise lawful.\" Id. &#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii). In this case, the district court determined that defendants' myriad explanations for their use of the northernlights.com site - e.g., as an experimental new business model, as a site for aurora borealis admirers, and as a compilation of businesses that contain the phrase \"Northern Lights\" - undermined Northern Lights's claim of subjective belief in fair use, and hence their entitlement to the \"escape clause\" of &#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii). See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 118-19. Additionally, the court concluded that the defendants' numerous registrations of domain names containing the trademarks of others, which defendants accomplished in some cases by creating fictional \"fan clubs\" so that they could present a mantle of legitimacy in their registration requests to NSI, represented powerful evidence of defendants' bad faith in operating the northernlights.com site. This conclusion of bad faith was reinforced, according to the district court, by defendants' history of disregarding cease-and-desist letters from legitimate trademark owners, and their apparent openness to sell the northernlight.com registration to the plaintiff at the right price. Id. at 119-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our review of the record, we see no clear error in the district court's finding that defendants will likely be found to have acted in bad faith in operating the northernlights.com site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Although defendants are correct in asserting that their multiple registrations alone are not dispositive of the bad-faith issue, their well-established pattern of registering multiple domain names containing famoustrademarks, such as rollingstones.com, evinrude.com, and givenchy.com, has been made highly relevant to the determination of bad faith by the list of factors in ACPA. See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VIII) (noting as relevant factor \"the person's registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of registration of such domain names\"). Those facts are not clearly trumped by facts favoring defendants' side of the story, such as their use of northernlights.com as an e-mail domain name for several years prior to the dispute with the plaintiff and Burgar's initial resistance to the plaintiff's efforts to acquire defendants' domain-name registration. The district court's finding that defendants were not entitled to the \"escape clause\" also is not clearly erroneous; as the court found, defendants' oft-changing explanations for the purpose of the northernlights.com website evince a lack of subjective belief in the domain name's fair use.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on defendants' apparent modus operandi of registering domain names containing the famous trademarks of others in the hope that the famous trademark holder will be willing to pay to reclaim its intellectual-property rights, the district court reasonably concluded that defendants acted according to script in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Accordingly, we determine that the district court did not err in finding that defendants will likely be found to have acted in bad faith in operating their northernlights.com website.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Retroactive Application of ACPA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also ask that we review the district court's legal determination that the retroactive application of ACPA to the facts of this case is permissible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> After reviewing the district court opinion and the parties' briefs, however, we find it unnecessary to reach this issue, as even if we were to decide the matter in defendants' favor, it would not provide an adequate basis for dissolving the injunction. This is so because the district court expressly stated that its decision to impose a preliminary injunction rested principally upon its finding that Internet users would likely be confused by the concomitant existence of the northernlight.com and northernlights.com marks. See 97 F. Supp. 2d at 121 (\"Before turning to the balancing factors, I must emphasize the importance of the likelihood of confusion findings to the preliminary injunction calculus.\"). Because an ACPA violation does not require a showing of likely confusion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> the district court's decision to enter a preliminary injunction must have been based on its resolution of the non-ACPA claims, such as plaintiff's trademark-infringement claim. In their appeal, defendants' only argument on the merits that does not impugn the district court's ACPA findings concerns the determination that Northern Lights acted in bad faith. And as we have determined in Part III.A, supra, that finding was not clearly erroneous. Thus, no matter how we might resolve the ACPA-retroactivity issue - and we expressly eschew doing so at this time - our decision would fail to affect the validity of the injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that defendants have identified no basis for overturning the preliminary injunction already in place. We therefore affirm its issuance by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. First Amendment Overbreadth of the Injunction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the scope of the preliminary injunction violates the First Amendment. We need not, however, consider that issue here, for although it may have been raised below, defendants did no more than obliquely refer to the issue when the district court held the critical hearing, and subsequently took part in the framing of the preliminary injunction. Because we do not find waiver, the issue can be argued in the trial on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court obtained personal jurisdiction over defendants when Burgar was served with process while in the forum state, we affirm, albeit on different grounds, the court's personal-jurisdiction finding. We find no basis for disturbing the court's determination of likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiff's suit, and therefore affirm those portions of the district court's opinion. Finally, while not precluding further consideration of the First Amendment issue at trial, we decline to resolve defendants' free-speech challenge to the scope of the injunction at this time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Those cases hold that process immunity should be granted to non-residents present in the forum state to participate in any litigation, whether or not related to the suit for which the disputed service has been effected, as long as such immunity does not obstruct justice in the first suit.
