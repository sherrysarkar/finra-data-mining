Convicted  on drug  charges,  Jose  Ivan\r                            \r\n\nMontanez-Anaya   appeals  a  district   court  judgment  that\r\n\nsummarily dismissed  his motion to vacate  his sentence under\r\n\n28  U.S.C.    2255.    Appellant maintains  that  his defense\r\n\ncounsel rendered  ineffective assistance  by failing to  have\r\n\nappellant  testify  in  support  of  his  claim  for a  minor\r\n\nparticipant   adjustment  under  U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b)  and  by\r\n\nfailing to  seek  a departure  under U.S.S.G.   5H1.4 on  the\r\n\nground  that appellant has  the human  immunodeficiency virus\r\n\n(HIV).1\r                  1\r\n\n     This court  has thoroughly  reviewed the record  and the\r\n\nparties' briefs on  appeal.  Although the  district court did\r\n\nnot expressly  address these claims, we agree  that they were\r\n\nproperly dismissed.  The  testimony that appellant might have\r\n\noffered  at  sentencing  does  not  show  that  there   is  a\r\n\nreasonable probability  that he  would have received  a minor\r\n\nparticipant adjustment  had he testified.   Moreover, none of\r\n\nthe  cases that  appellant has  cited support  his contention\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1In relevant part,  5H1.4 provides that,\r               1\r\n\n     Physical  condition ... is  not ordinarily relevant\r\n     in determining whether a sentence should be outside\r\n     the  applicable  guideline   range.    However,  an\r\n     extraordinary  physical impairment may  be a reason\r\n     to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline\r\n     range;  e.g., in  the  case of  a seriously  infirm\r                             \r\n     defendant, home  detention may be  as efficient as,\r\n     and less costly than, imprisonment.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthat he was entitled to this adjustment as a  matter of law.2\r                                                                        2\r\n\nDefense  counsel did not  render constitutionally ineffective\r\n\nassistance in failing to have appellant testify in support of\r\n\nhis request for a minor participant adjustment.  \r\n\n     We further discern no error in defense counsel's failure\r\n\nto seek a  5H1.4 departure.  Having  AIDS or being HIV+ alone\r\n\nwill not support  such a departure  absent evidence that  the\r\n\ndefendant's  condition  has  resulted  in  an  \"extraordinary\r\n\nphysical impairment.\"  See, e.g., United States v.
