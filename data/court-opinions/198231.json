Jorge J. Solano-Moreta\r\ncontends, among other things, that the district court erred in\r\ndenying his requests to withdraw his guilty plea.  We affirm his\r\nconviction.\r\n                            I\r\n                                         On June 7, 1995, thirty-seven defendants, including\r\nSolano-Moreta, were indicted in connection with a violent drug\r\nconspiracy.  On May 29, 1996, the day that he was scheduled to\r\ngo to trial, Solano-Moreta, the alleged leader of the\r\norganization, pled guilty to engaging in a continuing criminal\r\nenterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C.  848(a) and (b) and to\r\ncarrying firearms in relation to a drug trafficking crime in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1) and (2).\r\n    Ultimately, only eight of the defendants went to\r\ntrial.  On August 8, 1996, the jury convicted three of these\r\ndefendants and acquitted five.\r\n    Solano-Moreta filed a motion to withdraw his guilty\r\nplea in early December 1996, asserting that an agreement outside\r\nthe bounds of the plea agreement had induced his plea and that\r\nhis former counsel had not moved to challenge audiotapes or\r\nexplained the plea agreement fully.  The court held evidentiary\r\nhearings on December 19 and December 27, 1996 and denied the\r\nmotion on January 23, 1997.\r\n    When Solano-Moreta appeared for sentencing, he again\r\ninformed the court that he wished to withdraw his plea; with the\r\nassistance of new counsel, another motion to that effect was\r\nfiled on May 21, 1997.  In addition to requesting\r\nreconsideration of the court's previous rulings, this motion\r\nadded further claims of involuntariness, claimed that previous\r\ncounsel had an unexplored conflict of interest, and asserted\r\nthat the indictment was defective.  On December 10, 1997, after\r\nyet another evidentiary hearing, the motion was denied.\r\n    Pursuant to the terms of a Federal Rule of Criminal\r\nProcedure 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement, which the court accepted\r\nat sentencing, Solano-Moreta was sentenced to 540 months\r\nimprisonment.\r\n                            II\r\n                                         Solano-Moreta focuses his arguments on appeal on the\r\ndistrict court's denial of his plea withdrawal motions.  In\r\nconsidering whether a defendant has made an affirmative showing\r\nof a \"fair and just reason\" for withdrawal of a guilty plea\r\nbefore sentencing, Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e), the district court\r\nmust consider all of the circumstances, focusing particularly on\r\nthe plausibility of the reasons prompting the change of plea,\r\nthe timing of the defendant's motion, the existence or\r\nnonexistence of an assertion of innocence, and whether the plea\r\n\"appropriately may be characterized as involuntary, in derogation\r\nof the requirements imposed by Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, or otherwise\r\nlegally suspect.\"  United States v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17,\r\n23 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 711 (1997); see\r\nalso United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1537 (1st Cir.\r\n1989).  If these factors tilt in favor of the defendant, the\r\ncourt must also assess the prejudice to the government.  SeeUnited States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 371 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).\r\n    A district court's ruling on such a motion is reviewed\r\nonly for \"demonstrable abuse of discretion.\"  Sanchez-Barreto, 93\r\nF.3d at 23.  In addition, \"[t]he trial court's subsidiary\r\nfactfinding in connection with plea-withdrawal motions can be\r\nset aside only for clear error.\"  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1538.\r\n    As a preliminary matter, although Solano-Moreta makes\r\nnumerous allegations that ineffective assistance by two of his\r\nthree previous counsel prevented him from withdrawing his plea\r\nor from going to trial in the first instance, we decline to\r\naddress the ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.  The\r\ndistrict court ruled on some of Solano-Moreta's specific claims\r\nof ineffectiveness and made factual findings relevant to the\r\nperformance of counsel in the course of deciding the motions for\r\nwithdrawal of the guilty pleas.  Nevertheless, we conclude after\r\na careful review that the record on the various ineffective\r\nassistance claims is not fully developed.  (We note, as well,\r\nthat Solano-Moreta has not aided matters by presenting several\r\nof his arguments on this topic to this Court in a cursory\r\nmanner.)  Accordingly, we decline to address the ineffective\r\nassistance claims.  See United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29 F.3d\r\n771, 776 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Ordinarily, a collateral proceeding\r\n. . . is the proper forum for fact-bound ineffective assistance\r\nclaims.\").\r\n    Putting these claims aside, then, we find that the\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying Solano-\r\nMoreta's motions to withdraw his guilty plea.  The court\r\ndetermined in two well-reasoned written opinions that all of the\r\nrelevant factors weighed against permitting withdrawal.  The\r\ncourt found that Solano-Moreta's plea was fully voluntary and\r\nthat his reasons for withdrawal were implausible.  The court\r\nspecifically held that no outside agreement binding on the\r\ngovernment existed (and that, even if Solano-Moreta's counsel\r\ntold him otherwise, any reliance on those statements was not\r\nreasonable); that there was no support in the record for his\r\nclaim that the indictment was defective; that he understood the\r\nplea agreement; and that there was no showing that his\r\ncompetence to plead was affected by prescription medication or\r\nany physical or psychological condition.  The court also found\r\nthat Solano-Moreta's requests to counsel to move for withdrawal\r\nimmediately after his guilty plea did not somehow cure his\r\nunreasonable delay in filing his motion, since, even if he\r\n\"considered [moving for withdrawal] . . . prior to December 1996,\r\nit was always disregarded [as] he explored a more convenient\r\npath or legal strategy.\"  Finally, the court declined to credit\r\nany claim of innocence based on its observation that Solano-\r\nMoreta had perjured himself.\r\n    Solano-Moreta repeats here many of the same arguments\r\nhe advanced to the district court, but he provides no basis for\r\nthis court to question the district court's factual findings or\r\nits weighing of the factors.  \"Confronted with an attempt at\r\nplea retraction, the trial judge must make an idiocratic,\r\nparticularistic, factbound assessment -- an assessment which is\r\nfacilitated because the judge has overseen pretrial proceedings,\r\nconducted the Rule 11 inquiries, accepted the original guilty\r\nplea, and heard at first hand the reasons bearing on its\r\nwithdrawal.\"  Pellerito, 878 F.2d at 1538.  Many of the findings\r\nat issue here are based on the district court's observation of\r\nthe demeanor of the defendant and the credibility of various\r\nwitnesses.  In this case, we will not second-guess these first-\r\nhand observations, especially since the district court's\r\nconsideration of Solano-Moreta's claims was particularly careful\r\nand thorough.\r\n    Finally, we also reject Solano-Moreta's challenge to\r\nthe district court's acceptance of his plea agreement at\r\nsentencing.  \"Before accepting a plea agreement that contains a\r\nspecific sentence under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(C), a\r\nsentencing court is required to satisfy itself either that: \r\n'the agreed sentence is within the applicable guideline range;\r\nor (2) the agreed sentence departs from the applicable guideline\r\nrange for justifiable reasons.'\"  United States v. Carrozza, 4\r\nF.3d 70, 87 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting U.S.S.G.  6B1.2(c)). \r\nIgnoring the second of the two options provided by  6B1.2(c) of\r\nthe guidelines, Solano-Moreta rests his challenge on the bare\r\nassertion that the stipulated sentence exceeded the guideline\r\nrange set forth in the pre-sentence report.  Accordingly, he has\r\nmade no showing that the district court erred in accepting the\r\nplea agreement and imposing the 540-month sentence that he\r\nacceded to when he signed it.  Nor has he made any showing that\r\nthe court erred in refusing to \"mitigat[e]\" his sentence.\r\n    We have considered all of defendant's arguments\r\nproperly presented on direct appeal and find them without merit. \r\nDefendant's conviction is affirmed.\n",
