R. Civ.  P.  11(c)(1)(B), dated  August  8, 1996\r\n\n(Appeal  No. 96-2005). We  affirm the district  court in both\r\n\ncases and deny the parties' requests for oral argument.\r\n\n     I. Amended Order and Judgment (Appeal No. 96-1590)\r                                                                   \r\n\n     A. Jurisdiction\r                                \r\n\n     The  district court  correctly  ruled that  the judgment\r\n\nentered by the Court \"fits within the description in Kokkanen\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Guardian Life Ins. Co.,  511 U.S. 375 (1994), of judgments\r                                     \r\n\nin which the Court has retained jurisdiction for  purposes of\r\n\nenforcement.\"   Memorandum  and Order  on  Motion to  Enforce\r\n\nJudgment.  In this case,  \"the parties' obligation to  comply\r\n\nwith the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part\r\n\nof the  order.\"   Kokkanen, 511  U.S. at 381.   The  district\r                                      \r\n\ncourt's Agreement  for Judgment  and  Order incorporated  the\r\n\nparties'   settlement   agreement   by   ordering   Parigian,\r\n\nindividually and as  trustee of the  Trust, to make  specific\r\n\npayments  to appellees,  Richard  G.  LeBlanc  and  Nancy  E.\r\n\nLeBlanc (\"the  LeBlancs\").  Therefore,  it is  clear that  \"a\r\n\nbreach of  the agreement [is]  a violation of the  order, and\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nancillary  jurisdiction  to  enforce  the  agreement  .  .  .\r\n\nexist[s].\"  Id.\r                           \r\n\n     B. Whether the Trust is Bound by the Amended Judgment\r                                                                      \r\n\n     The  counterclaim  itself is  ambiguous  with regard  to\r\n\nwhether Parigian, in his capacity as trustee of the Trust, is\r\n\na counterclaim defendant.  The  rest of the record,  however,\r\n\nstrongly   suggests   that   the   parties   understood   the\r\n\ncounterclaim  to  be  against  Parigian individually  and  as\r\n\ntrustee.   The counterclaim  was based on  a promissory  note\r\n\nexecuted  by Parigian,  individually  and  as  trustee.    In\r\n\nanswering the  counterclaim, Parigian  identified himself  as\r\n\n\"Defendant-in-counterclaim,  John  E.  Parigian and  John  E.\r\n\nParigian as trustee of Clifton Heights Realty Trust.\"\r\n\n     While  the  counterclaim  was  ambiguous  about  whether\r\n\nParigian was included  in both capacities, the  Agreement for\r\n\nJudgment   and  Order  was  not.    The  Agreement  announced\r\n\n\"[j]udgment  for  the Plaintiffs-in-Counterclaim  Richard  G.\r\n\nLeBlanc   and  Nancy  E.  LeBlanc  ('the  LeBlancs')  on  the\r\n\nCounterclaim   against   Defendant-in-Counterclaim   John  E.\r\n\nParigian,  individually and as Trustee of the Clifton Heights\r\n\nRealty  Trust (collectively  'Parigian'),  in  the amount  of\r\n\n$213,125.00.\"  By agreeing to  the entry of that Judgment and\r\n\nOrder, Parigian  waived the  right to appeal  from it.   \"[A]\r\n\nparty who has agreed to  the entry of a judgment without  any\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nreservation  may not thereafter  seek to upset  the judgment,\r\n\nsave  for lack  of actual  consent  or a  failure of  subject\r\n\nmatter jurisdiction.\"  Cotto v. United States, 993 F.2d  274,\r                                                         \r\n\n279 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n     Finally, even  if Parigian had  not waived the  right to\r\n\nappeal, we would affirm the district court's ruling that \"the\r\n\nterms of the Agreement identifying Parigian as trustee of the\r\n\nClifton Heights Realty Trust supersede any failure to plead a\r\n\ncompulsory counterclaim. . . .  [T]he pleadings may be deemed\r\n\nto  have  been amended  so  as  to  allow for  the  aforesaid\r\n\naction.\"  Memorandum and Order on Motion to Enforce Judgment.\r\n\nUnder  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  15(b),  implied consent  to amend  a\r\n\npleading may  be found where  a claim is  \"introduced outside\r\n\nthe complaint [or counterclaim] . . . and then treated by the\r\n\nopposing party  as having  been pleaded,  either through  his\r\n\neffective  engagement  of  the claim  or  through  his silent\r\n\nacquiescence.\"   Rodriguez v.  Doral Mortgage Corp.,  57 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1168, 1172 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n     In  this case,  the issue  of  Parigian's obligation  as\r\n\ntrustee  was introduced by the attachment to the counterclaim\r\n\nof  a promissory  note  (which  the  counterclaim  sought  to\r\n\nenforce) executed by  Parigian in his individual  and trustee\r\n\ncapacities.    Parigian clearly  treated the  counterclaim as\r\n\nthough  it  had named  him  in  his  capacity as  trustee  by\r\n\nanswering it in both capacities  and by agreeing to the terms\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof  the  Agreement  for Judgment  and  Order  which expressly\r\n\nincluded   Parigian   in  both   capacities.     Under  these\r\n\ncircumstances,  amendment of the  counterclaim could not have\r\n\nprejudiced Parigian and  there was no abuse  of discretion by\r\n\nthe district  court in finding  an implied  amendment of  the\r\n\ncounterclaim.  See  Lynch v. Dukakis, 719 F.2d  504, 509 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1983).\r\n\n     II. Sanction (Appeal No. 96-2005)\r                                                  \r\n\n     \"It is  apodictic that  a district  court's decision  to\r\n\nimpose Rule  11 sanctions  is reviewable  under an  abuse-of-\r\n\ndiscretion  rubric.   Because the  decision  about whether  a\r\n\nlitigant's  (or  lawyer's) actions  merit  the imposition  of\r\n\nsanctions  is  heavily  dependent upon  the  district court's\r\n\nfirst-hand knowledge of  the case and its  nuances, appellate\r\n\nreview is deferential.  Thus,  a party protesting an order in\r\n\nrespect  to sanctions bears a formidable burden in attempting\r\n\nto convince  the court  of appeals  that  the district  judge\r\n\nerred  in finding  that Rule  11  was or  was not  violated.\"\r\n\nNavarro-Ayala v. Nunez,  968 F.2d 1421, 1425 (1st  Cir. 1992)\r                                  \r\n\n(citations omitted).\r\n\n     Parigian has not overcome that formidable burden in this\r\n\ncase.  The record fully supports the district court's finding\r\n\nthat Parigian violated Fed. R.  Civ. P. 11(b)(2) and (3) when\r\n\nhe represented to  the court that  \"[the LeBlancs] are  fully\r\n\nsecured  in  their  position  as  mortgage  holder  upon  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nproperty which is  valued at in excess of  $800,000.\"  At the\r\n\ntime that he made that  statement, the Agreement for Judgment\r\n\nand Order  had entered.  It has  consistently been Parigian's\r\n\nposition  that the  mortgage  became  a  nullity  after  that\r\n\njudgment  entered.   The  district court  did  not abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in  determining that  Parigian's conduct  violated\r\n\nRule 11. 1\r                     1\r\n\n     The district  court's Amended Order and  Judgment, dated\r\n\nApril 19, 1996, and the district court's Memorandum and Order\r\n\nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P.  11(c)(1)(B), dated August 8, 1996, are\r\n\naffirmed.   Appellees' Motion  to Schedule  Oral Argument  is\r                    \r\n\ndenied.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1  Although Parigian  has not specifically  challenged the\r               1\r\namount of  the sanction,  we note that  the district  court's\r\nfindings  fully justify  the  sanction  amount  which  \"falls\r\nwithin the  minimum range  reasonably required  to deter  the\r\nabusive behavior.\"  Navarro-Ayala, 968 F.2d at 1426.\r                                             \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

Parigian clearly  treated the  counterclaim as\r\n\nthough  it  had named  him  in  his  capacity as  trustee  by\r\n\nanswering it in both capacities  and by agreeing to the terms\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof  the  Agreement  for Judgment  and  Order  which expressly\r\n\nincluded   Parigian   in  both   capacities.     Under  these\r\n\ncircumstances,  amendment of the  counterclaim could not have\r\n\nprejudiced Parigian and  there was no abuse  of discretion by\r\n\nthe district  court in finding  an implied  amendment of  the\r\n\ncounterclaim.

The record fully supports the district court's finding\r\n\nthat Parigian violated Fed. R.  Civ.
