SMITH,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n        [Hon. Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nTheodore A. Barone with whom William F. Sullivan was on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\nF. Mark Terison, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Jay P.\r\nMcCloskey, United States Attorney, and Jonathan A. Toof, Assistant\r\nU.S. Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 10, 1998\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  A three-count indictment \r\ncharged Stuart L. Smith with drug conspiracy, criminal forfeiture\r\non the drug count, and tax conspiracy.  After severance of the tax\r\nconspiracy charge, Smith was acquitted of drug conspiracy and\r\ntherefore forfeited no property.  Smith was then tried for tax\r\nconspiracy, i.e., conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue\r\nService (IRS).  Evidence of drug trafficking was admitted in the\r\ntax conspiracy trial to demonstrate receipt of revenue that was not\r\nreported to the IRS.  Smith was convicted and now appeals.  He\r\nargues that the district court erred in refusing to inform the jury\r\nof his acquittal on the drug conspiracy charge and in barring his\r\ncross-examination of prosecution witnesses on their knowledge of\r\nhis acquittal.  Finally, Smith contends that the district court\r\nshould have instructed the jury that failure to file tax returns\r\nwas an insufficient basis upon which to convict him of tax\r\nconspiracy.  We find no error and affirm.\r\n                  I.  Relevant Facts\r\nWe have described the procedural background of this case\r\nbefore, see United States v. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir. \r\n1996), and present only a review of the relevant facts here.  \r\nIn the tax conspiracy trial, the government introduced\r\nevidence that Smith paid no taxes from 1986 through April 1994, the\r\nperiod charged in the indictment.  The government's theory was that\r\nduring this period Smith derived substantial income from\r\ndistributing marijuana and had a tacit agreement with the others\r\ninvolved in the drug distribution activity not to report this\r\nincome to the IRS.  To prove its theory, the government relied\r\nheavily on evidence of Smith's participation in the drug\r\ntrafficking.  Much of this evidence duplicated that introduced in\r\nthe drug conspiracy trial.  In addition, a number of witnesses who\r\ndid not testify in the earlier trial testified to their involvement\r\nin the marijuana distribution.  They identified Smith as either an\r\nactive participant in marijuana trafficking or a recipient of drug\r\nproceeds.  Other evidence introduced by the government in support\r\nof its case against Smith included:  (1) a cash purchase by Smith\r\nof a boat and equipment for $17,000; (2) flights in which Smith had\r\nfirst class tickets; (3) a calendar showing periodic payments by a\r\ncodefendant to Smith of money that witnesses linked directly to\r\ndrug proceeds; (4) a check signed by Smith for a stock purchase of\r\n$10,000; (5) a bank account with an initial deposit in 1990 of\r\n$10,000 and another with an initial deposit in 1993 of $30,000; and\r\n(6) an IRS agent's testimony that a search of IRS records revealed\r\nthat Smith filed no individual tax returns during the charged\r\nperiod.   \r\nSmith admitted that he did not file individual tax returns\r\nduring the charged period and that he derived income during this\r\nperiod.  He denied, however, receiving money from or having\r\nknowledge of a drug conspiracy.  He testified that he generated\r\nincome in legitimate ways, such as renting and buying property,\r\nselling antiques, frames and collectibles, and investigating\r\nbuilding lots and delivering money for a codefendant's real estate\r\nbusiness.  His former wife confirmed that Smith generated cash\r\nincome from his lawful businesses, and testified that she had never\r\nseen evidence that he was involved in a drug conspiracy.\r\n                    II.  Analysis\r\nWe begin with Smith's claim that the court erred in refusing\r\nhis request for a jury instruction on his acquittal in the earlier\r\ndrug conspiracy trial.  We review challenges to jury instructions\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800,\r\n809 (1st Cir. 1996).  \"We must look at the instructions in light of\r\nthe evidence and determine whether they fairly and adequately\r\nsubmit the issues in the case to the jury.\"  Id. (citations\r\nomitted).\r\nIn its instructions to the jury, the district court declined\r\nto inform the jury of Smith's acquittal on drug conspiracy charges,\r\nbut the court did provide fairly comprehensive instructions\r\nconcerning the drug conspiracy evidence.  In its preliminary\r\ninstructions, the court stated, \"What I want you to clearly\r\nunderstand is that [the defendant] is not on trial here for having\r\ncommitted any drug offense, any conspiracy or any trafficking or\r\npossession, or anything of that kind.\"  And, in final instructions\r\nafter argument from both parties, the court stated:\r\n     I want to make it very clear to you that you cannot\r\nconsider that this defendant is or was in the past guilty\r\nof a drug conspiracy offense, that is, the subject of\r\nanother count of the superseding indictment and about\r\nwhich you have heard some testimony. \r\n     You have heard some references in this evidence to\r\nthese other proceedings against this defendant . . . ,\r\nand I instruct you again in the strongest terms that you\r\nmay not consider in any way or indulge in any speculation\r\nwhatsover about those proceedings in deliberating upon\r\nyour verdict in this case . . . .  Anything that happened\r\nwith respect to that charge including the disposition is\r\nwholly irrelevant to the disposition of the charge of\r\nparticipation by this defendant in a tax conspiracy. . .\r\n.\r\n     . . . .\r\n     . . . [W]hat you cannot do is to reach or use any\r\nconclusion that the defendant is guilty of a drug\r\nconspiracy offense in determining whether he is guilty of\r\nthis tax conspiracy offense.  You must treat the\r\ndefendant as not guilty of any offense of drug conspiracy\r\nthroughout your deliberations.  \r\n     . . . .   \r\n     Accordingly, you may use any evidence that you have\r\nheard about drug trafficking in this case as you see fit\r\nto find the facts of the case as that evidence is\r\nrelevant to the issues generated by all the evidence and\r\nthe instructions in this tax conspiracy case, as long as\r\nyou do not treat the defendant as guilty of participating\r\nin a conspiracy with intent to distribute marijuana.\r\n\n(emphasis added).   \r\n\nSmith objects specifically to the court's statements, \"you\r\ncannot consider that this Defendant is or was in the past guilty of\r\na drug conspiracy claim,\" and \"You must treat the Defendant as not\r\nguilty of any offense of drug conspiracy throughout your\r\ndeliberations.\"  He argues that this language, combined with the\r\nplentiful evidence of his participation in drug trafficking,\r\ncreated a substantial risk that the jury believed he had been found\r\nguilty of drug conspiracy in the earlier trial and that it\r\nconvicted him for tax conspiracy on those grounds.  Smith maintains\r\nthat this risk could have been avoided by an instruction informing\r\nthe jury of his acquittal.\r\nIn support of this position, Smith relies heavily on Dowlingv. United States, 493 U.S. 342 (1990), in which the district court\r\nallowed the introduction of evidence relating to an earlier trial\r\nof the defendant, Reuben Dowling, but also instructed the jury that\r\nthe trial had resulted in an acquittal.  Dowling was a bank robbery\r\ncase in which a witness, Vena Henry, identified Dowling as the\r\nperson who burgled her home on a previous occasion.  She had\r\ntestified to the same in the trial in which Dowling was acquitted. \r\nOn appeal, Dowling argued that admission of the burglary testimony\r\ntherefore violated his double jeopardy and due process rights.  The\r\nSupreme Court disagreed.  The Court explained, inter alia, that the\r\ncategory of infractions that violate fundamental fairness is very\r\nnarrow.  It then stated, in language upon which Smith hooks his\r\nargument, \"Especially in light of the limiting instructions\r\nprovided by the trial judge, we cannot hold that the introduction\r\nof Henry's testimony merits this kind of condemnation.\"  Dowling,\r\n493 U.S. at 353.  Directly thereafter, the Court reviewed carefully\r\nDowling's arguments, dispelling each in turn; none of these\r\narguments concerned the acquittal instruction.  The Court did not\r\ndirectly refer to the acquittal instruction in any portion of its\r\ndue process discussion, and mentioned the limiting instruction only\r\nin the above quoted sentence. \r\nSmith reads Dowling as holding that an acquittal instruction\r\nis essential to avoid fundamental unfairness to a defendant against\r\nwhom evidence of acquitted conduct has been introduced at trial. \r\nDowling, however, cannot bear the weight Smith assigns to it.  We\r\nemphasize, as the Seventh Circuit has recently done in United\r\nStates v. Tirrell, 120 F.3d 670, 677 (7th Cir. 1997), that the\r\nSupreme Court's holding in Dowling does not require that the jury\r\nbe told of an acquittal.  As the acquittal instruction was given\r\nrather than excluded by the district court, Dowling never addressed\r\nthe issue now before us.\r\nMoreover, the sentence in Dowling that begins, \"Especially in\r\nlight of the limiting instructions,\" does not identify the language\r\nto which \"limiting instruction\" refers.  We know only, from the\r\nsection of the opinion laying forth the background of the case,\r\nthat \"[w]hen Henry left the stand, the District Court instructed\r\nthe jury that petitioner had been acquitted of robbing Henry, and\r\nemphasized the limited purpose for which Henry's testimony was\r\nbeing offered.  The court reiterated that admonition in its final\r\ncharge to the jury.\"  Dowling, 493 U.S. at 346.  In referring to\r\n\"limiting instructions,\" the Court may have meant only the\r\ninstructions on the limited purpose of Henry's testimony and not\r\nthe portion on acquittal.  In any case, the opinion does not say\r\nthat without the instructions a due process violation would have\r\noccurred.  The Court simply observes that the limiting instructions\r\n-- however they may be defined -- reinforce the conclusion that the\r\ndefendant's rights were not violated.  \r\nDowling therefore does not foreclose us from concluding, like\r\nthe Seventh Circuit in Tirrell, 120 F.3d 670, and the Eighth\r\nCircuit in United States v. Riley, 684 F.2d 542, 546 (8th Cir.\r\n1982), that an acquittal instruction is not required when evidence\r\nof acquitted conduct is introduced.  Stating that it \"'afford[ed]\r\nsubstantial deference to a district court's decision to exclude'\r\nevidence of an acquittal,\" the court in Tirrell found no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the trial court's exclusion of the acquittal\r\ninstruction.  120 F.3d at 678 (quoting United States v. Jones, 808\r\nF.2d 561, 566-67 (7th Cir. 1986)).  The court reasoned that the\r\nfact of acquittal was irrelevant to the present charge and\r\ncommented that the trial court excluded references to the earlier\r\ntrial and to defendant's conviction in yet another trial.  Id.  In\r\nRiley too, the court found no abuse, reasoning that defendant's\r\nacquittal on one charge of violating the Mann Act on a date not\r\ncharged in the present case was not relevant.  Riley, 684 F.2d at\r\n546.\r\nTurning to the specific language used by the district court in\r\ninstructing the jury on how it should weigh the evidence of Smith's\r\ndrug trafficking, we do not agree that the phrases identified by\r\nSmith created a misimpression curable only with an acquittal\r\ninstruction.  The phrase that gives us pause is \"you cannot\r\nconsider that this Defendant is or was guilty of any offense of\r\ndrug conspiracy throughout your deliberations.\"  Had the court used\r\n\"whether\" in place of \"that,\" or \"is not\" in place of \"was,\" there\r\nwould be no cause whatever for concern.  Standing alone, the\r\nsentence might be understood to indicate that Smith had been found\r\nguilty of drug conspiracy.  But in context, and given the court's\r\nwarning to the jury that it \"should not indulge in any speculation\r\nwhatsoever about . . . [the drug] proceedings,\" we do not think\r\nsuch an interpretation reasonable.  Smith also objects to the\r\ncourt's statement that the jury \"must treat the defendant as not\r\nguilty of any offense of drug conspiracy throughout your\r\ndeliberations,\" apparently reading \"treat\" as analogous to\r\n\"pretend.\"  In fact, \"treat\" means \"to act or behave toward a\r\nperson in some specified way\" or \"to consider or regard in a\r\nspecified way.\"  Random House Dictionary 2015 (2d ed. 1983). \r\nSimply put, the court emphasized that the jury could not view Smith\r\nas guilty of a drug conspiracy, and could not allow speculation on\r\nthe outcome of the drug conspiracy trial to affect deliberations in\r\nthe tax conspiracy case.  \r\nWe have no reason to believe that the jury did anything other\r\nthan follow the directives given by the trial court.  We \"must\r\npresume that jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attend\r\nclosely the particular language of the trial court's instructions\r\nin a criminal case, and that they follow those instructions.\" \r\nUnited States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1287 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n(citations omitted).  We therefore find no abuse.\r\nSmith also argues that the court erred in barring him from\r\ncross-examining prosecution witnesses on their knowledge of his\r\nprior acquittal.  Determining the scope of cross-examination is a\r\nmatter within the district court's discretion, and will not be\r\ndisturbed absent abuse.  See United States v. Morla-Trinidad, 100\r\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996).  \"When a witness' credibility is in\r\nissue, the trial court may impose limits on cross-examination as\r\nlong as the court grants the defendant sufficient leeway to\r\nestablish 'a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity,\r\nbias, and motivation.'\"  United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d\r\n22, 28 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d\r\n230, 254 (1st Cir. 1989)).\r\nSmith's impeachment theory was that the witnesses, who were\r\nfriends and co-conspirators, testified against him in the tax\r\nconspiracy trial after not having done so in the earlier case\r\nbecause they knew that he faced a lesser penalty as a result of the\r\nacquittal.  Assuming that Smith had developed this theory, for\r\nwhich he provided no support, cross-examination on acquittal would\r\nhave opened the discussion to complicated sentencing issues. \r\nAlso, the jury would have had to sort through the meaning of a\r\nlegal judgment of acquittal.  See United States v. Kerley, 643 F.2d\r\n299, 300-01 (5th Cir. 1981) (no abuse of discretion in barring\r\ncross-examination on a prior acquittal because an acquittal does\r\nnot demonstrate innocence, and because the probative value of the\r\nevidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or\r\nconfusion).  Most importantly, that the witnesses may have been\r\nmore inclined to testify because they believed the remaining risk\r\nto Smith to be relatively small is not itself a motive to testify. \r\nRather, the motive was lesser punishment for the witnesses\r\nthemselves.  As the district court allowed Smith to cross-examine\r\nthe witnesses on incentives they received from the government,\r\nSmith was able to provide the jury with a reasonably complete\r\npicture of their motivation to testify, without unduly complicating\r\nthe issues.  The limitation on the cross-examination was therefore\r\na reasonable way of avoiding confusion without prejudicing the\r\ndefendant, and was entirely within the court's discretion.\r\nFinally, Smith argues that the district court erred in\r\nrefusing to instruct the jury that it could not convict based only\r\non the failure to file tax returns.  A full reading of the\r\ninstructions on tax conspiracy and a review of the evidence\r\npresented at trial reveal that the instructions given adequately\r\nexplained the law.  Mitchell, 85 F.3d at 809.  The instructions\r\ncould not reasonably be construed to permit a finding of guilt\r\nbased only on the failure to file.  For example, the court\r\nemphasized the conspiracy aspect of the charge, defining conspiracy\r\nas \"a kind of partnership for criminal purposes in which each\r\nmember becomes the agent of every other member of the conspiracy,\"\r\nand explaining, \"[t]he gist or core of the offense is a combination\r\nor an agreement to disobey or to disregard the law,\" and \"[w]e\r\ncannot conspire with ourselves.\"  And, in describing the crime with\r\nwhich Smith was charged, the court stated, \r\n[T]he purpose of the statute which makes it a crime to\r\nimpair, impede or obstruct the lawful functions of, in\r\nthis case the Internal Revenue Service, or to wilfully\r\nagree to do so is to prohibit taxpayers or other persons\r\nfrom hindering the efforts of the Internal Revenue\r\nService to obtain information potentially available to it\r\nand to which it is entitled in the performance of\r\ngovernmental functions.\r\n\nFinally, Smith's failure to file by no means made up the bulk of\r\nthe government's evidence.  Rather, the government's case\r\nemphasized large cash payments, receipt of money connected to drug\r\ndistribution, a fairly expensive lifestyle, and limited or no\r\napparent legitimate income.  Given the emphasis on these facts and\r\nthe language of the instructions, we do not believe that the jury\r\nreasonably could have concluded that it could convict on the basis\r\nof failure to file alone. \r\nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district\r\ncourt is affirmed.\r\n",

Smith maintains that this risk could have been avoided by an instruction informing the jury of his acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of this position, Smith relies heavily on Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990), in which the district court allowed the introduction of evidence relating to an earlier trial of the defendant, Reuben Dowling, but also instructed the jury that the trial had resulted in an acquittal.  Dowling was a bank robbery case in which a witness, Vena Henry, identified Dowling as the person who burgled her home on a previous occasion.  She had testified to the same in the trial in which Dowling was acquitted.  On appeal, Dowling argued that admission of the burglary testimony therefore violated his double jeopardy and due process rights.  The Supreme Court disagreed.  The Court explained, inter alia, that the category of infractions that violate fundamental fairness is very narrow.  It then stated, in language upon which Smith hooks his argument, \"Especially in light of the limiting instructions provided by the trial judge, we cannot hold that the introduction of Henry's testimony merits this kind of condemnation.\"  Dowling, 493 U.S. at 353, 110 S.Ct. 668.   Directly thereafter, the Court reviewed carefully Dowling's arguments, dispelling each in turn;  none of these arguments concerned the acquittal instruction.  The Court did not directly refer to the acquittal instruction in any portion of its due process discussion, and mentioned the limiting instruction only in the above quoted sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith reads Dowling as holding that an acquittal instruction is essential to avoid fundamental unfairness to a defendant against whom evidence of acquitted conduct has been introduced at trial.  Dowling, however, cannot bear the weight Smith assigns to it.  We emphasize, as the Seventh Circuit has recently done in United States v. Tirrell, 120 F.3d 670, 677 (7th Cir.1997), that the Supreme Court's holding in Dowling does not require that the jury be told of an acquittal.  As the acquittal instruction was given rather than excluded by the district court, Dowling never addressed the issue now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the sentence in Dowling that begins, \"Especially in light of the limiting instructions,\" does not identify the language to which \"limiting instruction\" refers.  We know only, from the section of the opinion laying forth the background of the case, that \"[w]hen Henry left the stand, the District Court instructed the jury that petitioner had been acquitted of robbing Henry, and emphasized the limited purpose for which Henry's testimony was being offered.  The court reiterated that admonition in its final charge to the jury.\"  Dowling, 493 U.S. at 346, 110 S.Ct. 668.   In referring to \"limiting instructions,\" the Court may have meant only the instructions on the limited purpose of Henry's testimony and not the portion on acquittal.  In any case, the opinion does not say that without the instructions a due process violation would have occurred.  The Court simply observes that the limiting instructions--however they may be defined--reinforce the conclusion that the defendant's rights were not violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dowling therefore does not foreclose us from concluding, like the Seventh Circuit in Tirrell, 120 F.3d 670, and the Eighth Circuit in United States v. Riley, 684 F.2d 542, 546 (8th Cir.1982), that an acquittal instruction is not required when evidence of acquitted conduct is introduced.  Stating that it \" 'afford[ed] substantial deference to a district court's decision to exclude' evidence of an acquittal,\" the court in Tirrell found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's exclusion of the acquittal instruction.  120 F.3d at 678 (quoting United States v. Jones, 808 F.2d 561, 566-67 (7th Cir.1986)).  The court reasoned that the fact of acquittal was irrelevant to the present charge and commented that the trial court excluded references to the earlier trial and to defendant's conviction in yet another trial.  Id. In Riley too, the court found no abuse, reasoning that defendant's acquittal on one charge of violating the Mann Act on a date not charged in the present case was not relevant.  Riley, 684 F.2d at 546.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the specific language used by the district court in instructing the jury on how it should weigh the evidence of Smith's drug trafficking, we do not agree that the phrases identified by Smith created a misimpression curable only with an acquittal instruction.  The phrase that gives us pause is \"you cannot consider that this Defendant is or was guilty of any offense of drug conspiracy throughout your deliberations.\"   Had the court used \"whether\" in place of \"that,\" or \"is not\" in place of \"was,\" there would be no cause whatever for concern.  Standing alone, the sentence might be understood to indicate that Smith had been found guilty of drug conspiracy.  But in context, and given the court's warning to the jury that it \"should not indulge in any speculation whatsoever about ... [the drug] proceedings,\" we do not think such an interpretation reasonable.  Smith also objects to the court's statement that the jury \"must treat the defendant as not guilty of any offense of drug conspiracy throughout your deliberations,\" apparently reading \"treat\" as analogous to \"pretend.\"   In fact, \"treat\" means \"to act or behave toward a person in some specified way\" or \"to consider or regard in a specified way.\"   Random House Dictionary 2015 (2d ed.1983).  Simply put, the court emphasized that the jury could not view Smith as guilty of a drug conspiracy, and could not allow speculation on the outcome of the drug conspiracy trial to affect deliberations in the tax conspiracy case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no reason to believe that the jury did anything other than follow the directives given by the trial court.  We \"must presume that jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attend closely the particular language of the trial court's instructions in a criminal case, and that they follow those instructions.\"  United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1287 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted).  We therefore find no abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith also argues that the court erred in barring him from cross-examining prosecution witnesses on their knowledge of his prior acquittal.  Determining the scope of cross-examination is a matter within the district court's discretion, and will not be disturbed absent abuse.  See United States v. Morla-Trinidad, 100 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1996).  \"When a witness' credibility is in issue, the trial court may impose limits on cross-examination as long as the court grants the defendant sufficient leeway to establish 'a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation.' \"  United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's impeachment theory was that the witnesses, who were friends and co-conspirators, testified against him in the tax conspiracy trial after not having done so in the earlier case because they knew that he faced a lesser penalty as a result of the acquittal.  Assuming that Smith had developed this theory, for which he provided no support, cross-examination on acquittal would have opened the discussion to complicated sentencing issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Also, the jury would have had to sort through the meaning of a legal judgment of acquittal.  See United States v. Kerley, 643 F.2d 299, 300-01 (5th Cir.1981) (no abuse of discretion in barring cross-examination on a prior acquittal because an acquittal does not demonstrate innocence, and because the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion).  Most importantly, that the witnesses may have been more inclined to testify because they believed the remaining risk to Smith to be relatively small is not itself a motive to testify.  Rather, the motive was lesser punishment for the witnesses themselves.  As the district court allowed Smith to cross-examine the witnesses on incentives they received from the government, Smith was able to provide the jury with a reasonably complete picture of their motivation to testify, without unduly complicating the issues.  The limitation on the cross-examination was therefore a reasonable way of avoiding confusion without prejudicing the defendant, and was entirely within the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Smith argues that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it could not convict based only on the failure to file tax returns.  A full reading of the instructions on tax conspiracy and a review of the evidence presented at trial reveal that the instructions given adequately explained the law.  Mitchell, 85 F.3d at 809.   The instructions could not reasonably be construed to permit a finding of guilt based only on the failure to file.  For example, the court emphasized the conspiracy aspect of the charge, defining conspiracy as \"a kind of partnership for criminal purposes in which each member becomes the agent of every other member of the conspiracy,\" and explaining, \"[t]he gist or core of the offense is a combination or an agreement to disobey or to disregard the law,\" and \"[w]e cannot conspire with ourselves.\"   And, in describing the crime with which Smith was charged, the court stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[T]he purpose of the statute which makes it a crime to impair, impede or obstruct the lawful functions of, in this case the Internal Revenue Service, or to wilfully agree to do so is to prohibit taxpayers or other persons from hindering the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service to obtain information potentially available to it and to which it is entitled in the performance of governmental functions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Smith's failure to file by no means made up the bulk of the government's evidence.  Rather, the government's case emphasized large cash payments, receipt of money connected to drug distribution, a fairly expensive lifestyle, and limited or no apparent legitimate income.  Given the emphasis on these facts and the language of the instructions, we do not believe that the jury reasonably could have concluded that it could convict on the basis of failure to file alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For instance, had Smith asked the witnesses if the acquittal influenced their willingness to testify, the government could have explored what the witnesses believed would be the consequences to Smith of a finding of guilty for tax conspiracy with and without a drug conspiracy conviction</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Smith with drug conspiracy, criminal forfeiture on the drug count, and tax conspiracy.  After severance of the tax conspiracy charge, Smith was acquitted of drug conspiracy and therefore forfeited no property.  Smith was then tried for tax conspiracy, i.e., conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Evidence of drug trafficking was admitted in the tax conspiracy trial to demonstrate receipt of revenue that was not reported to the IRS.  Smith was convicted and now appeals.  He argues that the district court erred in refusing to inform the jury of his acquittal on the drug conspiracy charge and in barring his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses on their knowledge of his acquittal.  Finally, Smith contends that the district court should have instructed the jury that failure to file tax returns was an insufficient basis upon which to convict him of tax conspiracy.  We find no error and affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Relevant Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have described the procedural background of this case before, see United States v. Morris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197063\"><a href=\"/opinion/197063/united-states-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 478 (1st Cir.1996), and present only a review of the relevant facts here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the tax conspiracy trial, the government introduced evidence that Smith paid no taxes from 1986 through April 1994, the period charged in the indictment.  The government's theory was that during this period Smith derived substantial income from distributing marijuana and had a tacit agreement with the others involved in the drug distribution activity not to report this income to the IRS.  To prove its theory, the government relied heavily on evidence of Smith's participation in the drug trafficking.  Much of this evidence duplicated that introduced in the drug conspiracy trial.  In addition, a number of witnesses who did not testify in the earlier trial testified to their involvement in the marijuana distribution.  They identified Smith as either an active participant in marijuana trafficking or a recipient of drug proceeds.  Other evidence introduced by the government in support of its case against Smith included:  (1) a cash purchase by Smith of a boat and equipment for $17,000;  (2) flights in which Smith had first class tickets;  (3) a calendar showing periodic payments by a codefendant to Smith of money that witnesses linked directly to drug proceeds;  (4) a check signed by Smith for a stock purchase of $10,000;  (5) a bank account with an initial deposit in 1990 of $10,000 and another with an initial deposit in 1993 of $30,000;  and (6) an IRS agent's testimony that a search of IRS records revealed that Smith filed no individual tax returns during the charged period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith admitted that he did not file individual tax returns during the charged period and that he derived income during this period.  He denied, however, receiving money from or having knowledge of a drug conspiracy.  He testified that he generated income in legitimate ways, such as renting and buying property, selling antiques, frames and collectibles, and investigating building lots and delivering money for a codefendant's real estate business.  His former wife confirmed that Smith generated cash income from his lawful businesses, and testified that she had never seen evidence that he was involved in a drug conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Smith's claim that the court erred in refusing his request for a jury instruction on his acquittal in the earlier drug conspiracy trial.  We review challenges to jury instructions for abuse of discretion.  United States v.

In its preliminary instructions, the court stated, \"What I want you to clearly understand is that [the defendant] is not on trial here for having committed any drug offense, any conspiracy or any trafficking or possession, or anything of that kind.\"   And, in final instructions after argument from both parties, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I want to make it very clear to you that you cannot consider that this defendant is or was in the past guilty of a drug conspiracy offense, that is, the subject of another count of the superseding indictment and about which you have heard some testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have heard some references in this evidence to these other proceedings against this defendant ..., and I instruct you again in the strongest terms that you may not consider in any way or indulge in any speculation whatsover about those proceedings in deliberating upon your verdict in this case....

The court reasoned that the fact of acquittal was irrelevant to the present charge and commented that the trial court excluded references to the earlier trial and to defendant's conviction in yet another trial.  Id. In Riley too, the court found no abuse, reasoning that defendant's acquittal on one charge of violating the Mann Act on a date not charged in the present case was not relevant.  Riley, 684 F.2d at 546.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the specific language used by the district court in instructing the jury on how it should weigh the evidence of Smith's drug trafficking, we do not agree that the phrases identified by Smith created a misimpression curable only with an acquittal instruction.  The phrase that gives us pause is \"you cannot consider that this Defendant is or was guilty of any offense of drug conspiracy throughout your deliberations.\"   Had the court used \"whether\" in place of \"that,\" or \"is not\" in place of \"was,\" there would be no cause whatever for concern.  Standing alone, the sentence might be understood to indicate that Smith had been found guilty of drug conspiracy.  But in context, and given the court's warning to the jury that it \"should not indulge in any speculation whatsoever about ... [the drug] proceedings,\" we do not think such an interpretation reasonable.  Smith also objects to the court's statement that the jury \"must treat the defendant as not guilty of any offense of drug conspiracy throughout your deliberations,\" apparently reading \"treat\" as analogous to \"pretend.\"   In fact, \"treat\" means \"to act or behave toward a person in some specified way\" or \"to consider or regard in a specified way.\"   Random House Dictionary 2015 (2d ed.1983).  Simply put, the court emphasized that the jury could not view Smith as guilty of a drug conspiracy, and could not allow speculation on the outcome of the drug conspiracy trial to affect deliberations in the tax conspiracy case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no reason to believe that the jury did anything other than follow the directives given by the trial court.  We \"must presume that jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attend closely the particular language of the trial court's instructions in a criminal case, and that they follow those instructions.\"  United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted).  We therefore find no abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith also argues that the court erred in barring him from cross-examining prosecution witnesses on their knowledge of his prior acquittal.  Determining the scope of cross-examination is a matter within the district court's discretion, and will not be disturbed absent abuse.  See United States v. Morla-Trinidad, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197073\"><a href=\"/opinion/197073/united-states-v-morla-trinidad/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1996).  \"When a witness' credibility is in issue, the trial court may impose limits on cross-examination as long as the court grants the defendant sufficient leeway to establish 'a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation.' \"  United States v. Laboy-Delgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196771\"><a href=\"/opinion/196771/united-states-v-laboy-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 254 (1st Cir.1990)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's impeachment theory was that the witnesses, who were friends and co-conspirators, testified against him in the tax conspiracy trial after not having done so in the earlier case because they knew that he faced a lesser penalty as a result of the acquittal.  Assuming that Smith had developed this theory, for which he provided no support, cross-examination on acquittal would have opened the discussion to complicated sentencing issues.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Also, the jury would have had to sort through the meaning of a legal judgment of acquittal.  See United States v. Kerley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388105\"><a href=\"/opinion/388105/united-states-v-lawrence-w-kerley/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 300-01 (5th Cir.1981) (no abuse of discretion in barring cross-examination on a prior acquittal because an acquittal does not demonstrate innocence, and because the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion).  Most importantly, that the witnesses may have been more inclined to testify because they believed the remaining risk to Smith to be relatively small is not itself a motive to testify.  Rather, the motive was lesser punishment for the witnesses themselves.  As the district court allowed Smith to cross-examine the witnesses on incentives they received from the government, Smith was able to provide the jury with a reasonably complete picture of their motivation to testify, without unduly complicating the issues.  The limitation on the cross-examination was therefore a reasonable way of avoiding confusion without prejudicing the defendant, and was entirely within the court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Smith argues that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it could not convict based only on the failure to file tax returns.  A full reading of the instructions on tax conspiracy and a review of the evidence presented at trial reveal that the instructions given adequately explained the law.  Mitchell, 85 F.3d at 809.   The instructions could not reasonably be construed to permit a finding of guilt based only on the failure to file.  For example, the court emphasized the conspiracy aspect of the charge, defining conspiracy as \"a kind of partnership for criminal purposes in which each member becomes the agent of every other member of the conspiracy,\" and explaining, \"[t]he gist or core of the offense is a combination or an agreement to disobey or to disregard the law,\" and \"[w]e cannot conspire with ourselves.\"   And, in describing the crime with which Smith was charged, the court stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[T]he purpose of the statute which makes it a crime to impair, impede or obstruct the lawful functions of, in this case the Internal Revenue Service, or to wilfully agree to do so is to prohibit taxpayers or other persons from hindering the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service to obtain information potentially available to it and to which it is entitled in the performance of governmental functions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Smith's failure to file by no means made up the bulk of the government's evidence.  Rather, the government's case emphasized large cash payments, receipt of money connected to drug distribution, a fairly expensive lifestyle, and limited or no apparent legitimate income.  Given the emphasis on these facts and the language of the instructions, we do not believe that the jury reasonably could have concluded that it could convict on the basis of failure to file alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For instance, had Smith asked the witnesses if the acquittal influenced their willingness to testify, the government could have explored what the witnesses believed would be the consequences to Smith of a finding of guilty for tax conspiracy with and without a drug conspiracy conviction</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
