In 1990, Jose  Figueroa Alvarez filed\r                                \r\n\nan  application  for  Social  Security  disability  benefits,\r\n\nalleging disability due to lower back pain.  After a hearing,\r\n\nthe administrative law  judge (ALJ) denied  Figueroa's claim,\r\n\nconcluding  that he could perform his past relevant work as a\r\n\nsecurity  guard,  and  the  Appeals  Council  denied  review.\r\n\nFigueroa then appealed to  the district court, which affirmed\r\n\nthe decision.  He  now seeks review in  this court.   Because\r\n\nFigueroa's  specific objections on  appeal are meritless, and\r\n\nbecause  our  review of  the  record  shows that  substantial\r\n\nevidence supports the finding that Figueroa was not disabled,\r\n\nwe affirm.  \r\n\n          In  his  decision,  the  ALJ  determined  that  the\r\n\nmedical evidence of record showed  that Figueroa has a severe\r\n\nmusculoskeletal condition, but  not one meeting or  equalling\r\n\nthe conditions listed in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1.\r\n\nSpecifically, a CT scan showed lumbar spine spondylolysis and\r\n\nspondylolisthesis  at the  L4-L5 level and  posterior bulging\r\n\nwith  small central  disc herniation  and compression  of the\r\n\ndural sac at that level.  The ALJ  found that Figueroa's back\r\n\ncondition was  compatible with  episodic pain,  but concluded\r\n\nthat the evidence did  not establish a medically determinable\r\n\nbasis for  the degree of  pain alleged.   He also  found that\r\n\nFigueroa's back condition had not limited his neurological or\r\n\northopedic  functioning since  Figueroa had  always exhibited\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ngood range of  motion and no  muscle weakness.   Nonetheless,\r\n\nthe  ALJ determined that Figueroa could no longer perform his\r\n\nprior  medium exertional  level  job as  warehouseman  and/or\r\n\nfingerlift operator.   Because  he found that  Figueroa could\r\n\nstill perform light work, however,  the ALJ concluded that he\r\n\ncould perform his past  relevant work as a security  guard, a\r\n\njob Figueroa had held from 1983-86 and again in 1990.\r\n\n                         DISCUSSION\r                                               \r\n\n          On appeal,  Figueroa claims that the  ALJ failed to\r\n\nconsider  his   allegations  of  disabling   pain,  erred  in\r\n\nconcluding  that  he  could return  to  his  past  work as  a\r\n\nsecurity guard,  and denied  him disability benefits  without\r\n\nconsidering evidence in his favor.  \r\n\n          A.  Allegations of Disabling Pain\r                                                       \r\n\n          In  support of  his  claim that  the ALJ  failed to\r\n\nconsider  his allegations of  disabling pain, Figueroa states\r\n\nfirst  that  he  constantly  and  persistently  complained to\r\n\nexamining physicians  of severe disabling pain.   He suggests\r\n\nthat  the ALJ  ignored that  evidence.   The record  does not\r\n\nsubstantiate his claim.\r\n\n          First,  there are  significant  gaps in  Figueroa's\r\n\nmedical records between December  1988, when he first injured\r\n\nhis back, and October 1991, when the hearing took  place.  We\r\n\nhave  found  no  medical  records  indicating  that  Figueroa\r\n\ncomplained of  pain to  examining physicians for  the periods\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nfrom May 1989 to  December 1989, February 1990 to  June 1990,\r\n\nor March 1991 to October 1991.1  \r\n\n          Second, as the transcript shows, at the hearing the\r\n\nALJ elicited Figueroa's testimony  on relevant aspects of the\r\n\npain  he alleged,  as required  under Avery  v. Secretary  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nHealth  and Human Services, 797 F.2d 19, 29 (1st Cir. 1986).2\r                                      \r\n\nIn his decision, the  ALJ took account of that  testimony and\r\n\nstated  that  Figueroa's  \"salient  complaint\" was  pain  and\r\n\ndecreased sensation in his right leg.  In view of the medical\r\n\nevidence, however,  the ALJ  did not fully  credit Figueroa's\r\n\nallegations of pain.  He noted the gaps in Figueroa's medical\r\n\ntreatment history, including the fact  that he had not sought\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The record contains an  August 1989 report of the  Puerto\r\nRico Industrial  Commission in which  the Commission reported\r\nthat  Figueroa alleged pain in his lower right back and right\r\nhip.   Apparently, because of Figueroa's  allegation of pain,\r\nthe Commission overturned the State Insurance Fund's May 1989\r\ndischarge of Figueroa  as \"cured and without disability.\"  In\r\nFebruary or March 1991,  the State Insurance Fund determined,\r\nunder  the  applicable  worker's compensation  law,  that  in\r\nDecember  1988 Figueroa  had  sustained a  partial  permanent\r\ndisability of 15 %  of his \"general physiological functions.\"\r\nAlthough disability determinations  by other agencies  may be\r\nconsidered  by  the Secretary,  they  are not  binding.   See\r                                                                         \r\nMandrell v. Weinberger, 511 F.2d 1102, 1103 (10th  Cir. 1975)\r                                  \r\n(Veterans'   Administration   disability   determination   is\r\nentitled  to  consideration,  but   is  not  binding  on  the\r\nSecretary).\r\n\n2.  Under  Avery, the  ALJ was required  to inquire  into the\r                            \r\nnature, location, onset,  duration, frequency, radiation, and\r\nintensity  of   the  pain  in  question;   the  factors  that\r\nprecipitated  or  aggravated  the  pain;  the  type,  dosage,\r\neffectiveness, and  adverse side effects of  pain medication;\r\ntreatment  for  the  pain  other  than  medication;  and  the\r\nclaimant's functional restrictions and daily activities.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nany treatment after February 1991.   He concluded that, while\r\n\nFigueroa's  back condition  could cause  pain on  an episodic\r\n\nbasis,  the pain had proven treatable and had not limited his\r\n\nfunctioning significantly, except to the extent that he could\r\n\nnot perform medium or heavy work.  \r\n\n          Besides  the  gaps  in Figueroa's  medical  record,\r\n\nother  evidence  supports  the ALJ's  conclusion.    Although\r\n\nFigueroa testified that his pain was constant  and strong, he\r\n\nalso said  that medication  \"alleviate[d]\" the pain  and that\r\n\nmassaging  his leg  alleviated  painful cramping  during  the\r\n\nnight.   He testified that his medication gave him heartburn,\r\n\nand  for  that  reason  it  had  been  changed;  his  current\r\n\nmedication allegedly had side effects, too, but Figueroa gave\r\n\nno specifics and acknowledged that  he took it anyway because\r\n\nit \"at  least relieve[s] the pain a  little.\"3  The ALJ noted\r\n\nthat Figueroa appeared in no distress at the hearing and that\r\n\nhe walked adequately with no assistive device.  Figueroa also\r\n\ntestified that he  could walk for 30 meters,  that one of his\r\n\ndaily activities was  walking around  his yard,  and that  he\r\n\nwalked around the house when  leg pain woke him up at  night.\r\n\nA  consulting  neurologist  reported  in  January  1991  that\r\n\nFigueroa had back pain syndrome, but that he could do tip toe\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  In  his decision,  the ALJ  stated that  Figueroa's pills\r\ncaused  numbness,  but  we   found  nothing  in  the  hearing\r\ntranscript to support  that statement, and so assume  that it\r\nwas inadvertent error.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ngait, walk  on his heels  and squat  on his  knees; that  his\r\n\nforward lumbar flexion was 80 degrees forward and his lateral\r\n\nlumbar  flexion  was  20   degrees;4  that  his  Lasegue  was\r\n\nnegative5 and  his straight leg raising was  90 degrees; that\r\n\nhe  had no motor weakness  and no muscle  atrophy although he\r\n\nhad minimal  paravertebral muscle  spasm; and that  there was\r\n\ndecreased sensation  in his right leg  without any anatomical\r\n\ndistribution.   In  February and  June 1991,  Social Security\r\n\nphysicians reviewed  Figueroa's medical records  and assessed\r\n\nhis  residual functional  capacity  (RFC).6   Each  indicated\r\n\nthat, despite his back  condition, Figueroa could perform the\r\n\nexertional requirements of light work:  he could occasionally\r\n\nlift  or  carry 20  pounds and  frequently  lift or  carry 10\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Accompanying range of motion charts show that full lumbar\r\nflexion forward  is 90 degrees  and that full  lateral lumbar\r\nflexion is 20 degrees. \r\n\n5.  This apparently  means that Figueroa suffered  no pain or\r\nlimitation of  movement  when raising  his  legs while  in  a\r\nsupine position.   See Blakiston's  Gould Medical  Dictionary\r                                                                         \r\n743 (4th  ed. 1979) (Lasegue's  sign becomes positive  when a\r\nsupine  patient raises  his entire  lower extremity  with his\r\nknees  in  full extension  and suffers  pain or  muscle spasm\r\nresulting in limitation of movement at a particular  angle of\r\nelevation).\r\n\n6.  Among  other things,  the  medical opinion  request  form\r\nunderlying the February RFC assessment noted Figueroa's claim\r\nof  pain, his  minimal paravertebral muscle  spasm, decreased\r\nsensory  sensation  in  his  right   leg  without  anatomical\r\ndistribution,  and  his  original  back injury  and  CT  scan\r\nresults.   The  medical opinion  request form  underlying the\r\nJune  RFC  assessment noted,  among  other  things, his  back\r\ncondition, decreased sensation in  his right leg, and minimal\r\nparavertebral muscle spasm.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\npounds;  he could stand, walk and sit with normal breaks each\r\n\nfor  a total of  about 6 hours  in an 8-hour  workday; and he\r\n\ncould push or  pull without limit.  See 20  C.F.R.   404.1567\r                                                   \r\n\n(the  physical exertional requirements of light work comprise\r\n\nthe ability  to lift no more  than 20 pounds at  a time while\r\n\nfrequently lifting  or carrying objects  up to 10  pounds, to\r\n\nwalk  or stand a  good deal, or  to perform some  pushing and\r\n\npulling of arm  or leg  controls if the  job mostly  required\r\n\nsitting); SSR 83-10 (\"[T]he full range of light work involves\r\n\nstanding or walking, off and on, for a total of approximately\r\n\n6  hours   of  an   8-hour  workday.     Sitting  may   occur\r\n\nintermittently during  the remaining  time.\").  Figueroa  has\r\n\nnot  submitted any  physician's evaluation  or other  medical\r\n\nreport which contradicts the  neurologist's assessment of his\r\n\ncondition  as of  January 1991,  nor any  residual functional\r\n\ncapacity evaluation which contradicts the two RFC assessments\r\n\nindicating that he could perform light work.  \r\n\n          B.  Past Relevant Work\r                                            \r\n\n          Figueroa objects  to the  ALJ's conclusion that  he\r\n\ncould perform his past relevant work of security guard, which\r\n\nis  classified as light exertional  work.  See  U.S. Dep't of\r                                                          \r\n\nLabor, Dictionary of Occupational  Titles (DOT) 269 (4th rev.\r                                                          \r\n\ned. 1991).   In support thereof, Figueroa  cites the postural\r\n\nlimitations  described in  the  Secretary's RFC  assessments.\r\n\nBoth  assessments indicated  that, given his  back condition,\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nFigueroa could only occasionally climb  stairs, stoop, crouch\r\n\nand  crawl.7   Figueroa  argues that  the  ALJ, as  a layman,\r\n\ncould not evaluate how  his postural limitations would affect\r\n\nhis  ability  to  perform  the  work  of  a  security  guard,\r\n\nsuggesting that the  ALJ needed the guidance  of a vocational\r\n\nexpert.  \r\n\n          We disagree.   Figueroa bore the  burden of showing\r\n\nthat he  could no longer perform his former job.  In order to\r\n\nmeet  that  burden,  he   needed  to  provide  \"some  minimal\r\n\ninformation about  the activities that [his]  past usual work\r\n\nrequired[.]\"    Santiago v.  Secretary  of  Health and  Human\r                                                                         \r\n\nServices, 944 F.2d  1, 5  (1st Cir. 1991);  accord Dudley  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSecretary  of Health  and Human Services,  816 F.2d  792, 794\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1987)  (per curiam).  But  Figueroa never testified\r\n\nthat his prior work as security guard required  any climbing,\r\n\nstooping,  crouching and  crawling, let  alone doing  so more\r\n\nthan  occasionally, nor does  anything we  have found  in the\r\n\nrecord  suggest  that  this is  true.    Thus,  there was  no\r\n\nevidence  before  the ALJ  to  show that  Figueroa  could not\r\n\nperform  his  past job  as a  security  guard because  of his\r\n\npostural limitations.  Nor  are climbing, stooping, crouching\r\n\nand crawling listed as  physical requirements of the security\r\n\nguard job in  the relevant vocational publication.   See U.S.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.

Heckler, 760  F.2d 369, 373  (1st Cir. 1985)  (an ALJ may\r                       \r\n\nrely  on vocational  publications  in determining  whether  a\r\n\nclaimant could return to past work where the claimant had the\r\n\nopportunity to, but did not, testify about the demands of her\r\n\nprior job).  \r\n\n          Figueroa  next  suggests   that  the  ALJ   ignored\r\n\nsignificant evidence  in determining that he  could return to\r\n\nhis work as a security  guard.  Figueroa points first to  his\r\n\ntestimony that he  could not continue  working as a  security\r\n\nguard.  At  the hearing,  Figueroa testified that  he had  to\r\n\nleave  his  security  guard   position  in  June  1990  after\r\n\nreinjuring his  back.  He also testified that he had tried to\r\n\nreturn to  work recently,  but that  he had  to quit  after a\r\n\nmonth because he was  required to stand all the  time, making\r\n\nhis leg and  heel numb.9   Furthermore, Figueroa stated  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  The record does not show conclusively that this job was a\r\nsecurity guard position.  Figueroa described his unsuccessful\r\nattempt  to work  again  in response  to  the ALJ's  question\r\nwhether he  had worked  as a  security guard  elsewhere after\r\nJune  1990,  suggesting that  the  job was  a  security guard\r\nposition.  But, when the ALJ then concluded that Figueroa had\r\nworked   as  a  security  guard  for  five  months  in  1990,\r\nFigueroa's   attorney  presented  a  letter  certifying  only\r\nFigueroa's previous  employment as  a security guard  for the\r\nfour-month  period from February to  June 1990.   The rest of\r\nthe  attorney's response  is listed as  \"inaudible.\"   In his\r\ndecision,  the  ALJ  reports  that Figueroa  alleged  at  the\r\nhearing  that he  worked as  a security  guard for  only four\r\nmonths,  but that in his written submissions to the agency he\r\nstated that he  had also  worked from 1983-86  as a  security\r\nguard.  This  suggests that the ALJ's understanding  was that\r\nFigueroa's   unsuccessful  one-month  employment  was  not  a\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nhe  could stand only for about  25-30 minutes, then he had to\r\n\nmove his legs or stand  on his toes.  Figueroa  also suggests\r\n\nthat the ALJ ignored medical records from April 1989 and June\r\n\n1990 which  indicated that  he had difficulty  in standing.10\r\n\n          The fact  that Figueroa  had to leave  his security\r\n\nguard job in June 1990 or that he complained of difficulty in\r\n\nstanding  in April 1989 and June 1990 is not very significant\r\n\nsince the  record indicates that his  back condition improved\r\n\nafterwards  and that  it had  not significantly  affected his\r\n\nlegs.    In  September  1990, a  neurosurgeon  reported  that\r\n\nFigueroa's back pain did not radiate to his legs  and that he\r\n\nhad  very infrequent  cramps; he found  that Figueroa  had no\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nsecurity  guard  position.    Figueroa's  brief  contains   a\r\nconfusing  passage  on  this  point, but  seems  intended  to\r\nconfirm the ALJ's understanding.  \r\n     Even if the job  in question were a security  guard job,\r\nhowever, Figueroa's  testimony at  most showed that  he could\r\nnot  return  to a  specific  security  guard job  because  it\r\nrequired him to stand continuously.  He did not show that the\r\ntypical security guard job  entails standing for greater than\r\nsix hours a day.  Thus,  even if his allegation that he could\r\nnot  stand for  a prolonged  period were  fully credited,  he\r\nstill  failed  to  show  that  his  inability  to  stand  for\r\nprolonged periods  would prevent his  returning to work  as a\r\nsecurity  guard.  See Pelletier v. Secretary of HEW, 525 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n158, 160 (1st Cir. 1975) (a claimant  did not meet her burden\r\nof  proof by  showing  that a  particular  past job  entailed\r\nexposure  to smoke and fumes;  she was required  to show that\r\nsuch  exposure would  be  a condition  of  her type  of  work\r\ngenerally).  \r\n\n10.  The records  stated that he complained  of difficulty in\r\nsitting for prolonged periods of time, too, but Figueroa does\r\nnot   allege  the  ALJ  erred  by  failing  to  consider  his\r\ndifficulty in sitting.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\ndiminished  sensation or edema in his legs and that he walked\r\n\nwith a  normal  gait;  his  sensory  and  motor  systems  and\r\n\nreflexes were within  normal limits; his heel  to toe walking\r\n\nwas excellent;  there was  no objective radiculopathy.11   By\r\n\nDecember 1990,  a State Insurance Fund  physician advised him\r\n\nthat he could return to work.  In January 1991, Figueroa told\r\n\nthe consulting  neurologist that  he had  difficulty sitting,\r                                                                        \r\n\nbut he  did  not complain  about difficulty  in standing  for\r\n\nprolonged  periods.    Although  the  neurologist found  that\r\n\nFigueroa had decreased  sensation in his  right leg, he  also\r\n\nfound that  Figueroa  had no  motor  weakness and  no  muscle\r\n\natrophy.    The uncontradicted  February  and  June 1991  RFC\r\n\nassessments both indicated that  Figueroa could stand or walk\r\n\nfor  six hours  out  of an  eight-hour  workday.12   Figueroa\r\n\nnever  sought any treatment for numbness in his legs in 1991.\r\n\nAt the  hearing, Figueroa appeared to  attribute the numbness\r\n\nin his legs to  the pain he suffered, but, as  noted earlier,\r\n\nhe  also  said  that   his  medications  and  hand  massaging\r\n\nalleviated the pain.   In addition, he suggested  that moving\r\n\nhis  legs or standing  on his toes  helped relieve discomfort\r\n\ncaused by  prolonged standing.  Under  the circumstances, the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  Radiculopathy  is  defined  as  \"disease  of  the  nerve\r\nroots.\"  See  Dorland's Illustrated  Medical Dictionary  1405\r                                                                   \r\n(27th ed. 1988).\r\n\n12.  Neither  physician marked the box on  the RFC form which\r\nindicated that  Figueroa  should alternate  periodically  his\r\nsitting and standing in order to relieve pain or discomfort.\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nALJ's apparent failure fully to  credit Figueroa's allegation\r\n\nthat he could  not stand  for prolonged periods  of time  was\r\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.13\r\n\n          C.  Failure to Consider Whole Record\r                                                          \r\n\n          Figueroa claims  that the ALJ relied exclusively on\r\n\nevidence   favorable  to   the   Secretary  and   disregarded\r\n\n\"overwhelming evidence\"  in the record which  established his\r\n\ndisability.    As   our  discussion  above  shows,   however,\r\n\nsubstantial  evidence  in  the  record  supported  the  ALJ's\r\n\ndecision.  Two uncontradicted RFC assessments indicated  that\r\n\nFigueroa could  perform light work that  entailed standing or\r\n\nwalking for six hours out of an eight-hour workday.  Some six\r\n\nmonths  after Figueroa had reinjured his back in June 1990, a\r\n\nState Insurance Fund physician found  that he could return to\r\n\nwork.    There  was  no  evidence  that  Figueroa sought  any\r\n\ntreatment for pain or numbness after February 1991, and there\r\n\nwas evidence  that  he was  able  to relieve  the  discomfort\r\n\noccasioned by his back condition.\r\n\n          Affirmed. \r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  Figueroa also states that  \"another telling fact\" is the\r\nfact  that he  wears an  orthopedic girdle,  but he  does not\r\ndevelop that argument and  so we do not consider  it further.\r\nSee  United States  v.

After a hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) denied Figueroa's claim, concluding that he could perform his past relevant work as a security guard, and the Appeals Council denied review.  Figueroa then appealed to the district court, which affirmed the decision.  He now seeks review in this court.  Because Figueroa's specific objections on appeal are meritless, and because our review of the record shows that substantial evidence supports the finding that Figueroa was not disabled, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his decision, the ALJ determined that the medical evidence of record showed that Figueroa has a severe musculoskeletal condition, but not one meeting or equalling the conditions listed in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt.  P, App. 1. Specifically, a CT scan showed lumbar spine spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis at the L4-L5 level and posterior bulging with small central disc herniation and compression of the dural sac at that level.  The ALJ found that Figueroa's back condition was compatible with episodic pain, but concluded that the evidence did not establish a medically determinable basis for the degree of pain alleged.  He also found that Figueroa's back condition had not limited his neurological or orthopedic functioning since Figueroa had always exhibited good range of motion and no muscle weakness.  Nonetheless, the ALJ determined that Figueroa could no longer perform his prior medium exertional level job as warehouseman and/or fingerlift operator.  Because he found that Figueroa could still perform light work, however, the ALJ concluded that he could perform his past relevant work as a security guard, a job Figueroa had held from 1983-86 and again in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Figueroa claims that the ALJ failed to consider his allegations of disabling pain, erred in concluding that he could return to his past work as a security guard, and denied him disability benefits without considering evidence in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Allegations of Disabling Pain</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his claim that the ALJ failed to consider his allegations of disabling pain, Figueroa states first that he constantly and persistently complained to examining physicians of severe disabling pain.  He suggests that the ALJ ignored that evidence.  The record does not substantiate his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there are significant gaps in Figueroa's medical records between December 1988, when he first injured his back, and October 1991, when the hearing took place.  We have found no medical records indicating that Figueroa complained of pain to examining physicians for the periods from May 1989 to December 1989, February 1990 to June 1990, or March 1991 to October 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as the transcript shows, at the hearing the ALJ elicited Figueroa's testimony on relevant aspects of the pain he alleged, as required under Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 797 F.2d 19, 29 (1st Cir.1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In his decision, the ALJ took account of that testimony and stated that Figueroa's \"salient complaint\" was pain and decreased sensation in his right leg.  In view of the medical evidence, however, the ALJ did not fully credit Figueroa's allegations of pain.  He noted the gaps in Figueroa's medical treatment history, including the fact that he had not sought any treatment after February 1991.  He concluded that, while Figueroa's back condition could cause pain on an episodic basis, the pain had proven treatable and had not limited his functioning significantly, except to the extent that he could not perform medium or heavy work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the gaps in Figueroa's medical record, other evidence supports the ALJ's conclusion.  Although Figueroa testified that his pain was constant and strong, he also said that medication \"alleviate[d]\" the pain and that massaging his leg alleviated painful cramping during the night.  He testified that his medication gave him heartburn, and for that reason it had been changed;  his current medication allegedly had side effects, too, but Figueroa gave no specifics and acknowledged that he took it anyway because it \"at least relieve[s] the pain a little.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The ALJ noted that Figueroa appeared in no distress at the hearing and that he walked adequately with no assistive device.  Figueroa also testified that he could walk for 30 meters, that one of his daily activities was walking around his yard, and that he walked around the house when leg pain woke him up at night.  A consulting neurologist reported in January 1991 that Figueroa had back pain syndrome, but that he could do tip toe gait, walk on his heels and squat on his knees;  that his forward lumbar flexion was 80 degrees forward and his lateral lumbar flexion was 20 degrees;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> that his Lasegue was negative<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and his straight leg raising was 90 degrees;  that he had no motor weakness and no muscle atrophy although he had minimal paravertebral muscle spasm;  and that there was decreased sensation in his right leg without any anatomical distribution.  In February and June 1991, Social Security physicians reviewed Figueroa's medical records and assessed his residual functional capacity (RFC).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Each indicated that, despite his back condition, Figueroa could perform the exertional requirements of light work:  he could occasionally lift or carry 20 pounds and frequently lift or carry 10 pounds;  he could stand, walk and sit with normal breaks each for a total of about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday;  and he could push or pull without limit.  See 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1567 (the physical exertional requirements of light work comprise the ability to lift no more than 20 pounds at a time while frequently lifting or carrying objects up to 10 pounds, to walk or stand a good deal, or to perform some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls if the job mostly required sitting);  SSR 83-10 (\"[T]he full range of light work involves standing or walking, off and on, for a total of approximately 6 hours of an 8-hour workday.  Sitting may occur intermittently during the remaining time.\").  Figueroa has not submitted any physician's evaluation or other medical report which contradicts the neurologist's assessment of his condition as of January 1991, nor any residual functional capacity evaluation which contradicts the two RFC assessments indicating that he could perform light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Past Relevant Work</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa objects to the ALJ's conclusion that he could perform his past relevant work of security guard, which is classified as light exertional work.  See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT ) 269 (4th rev. ed. 1991).  In support thereof, Figueroa cites the postural limitations described in the Secretary's RFC assessments.  Both assessments indicated that, given his back condition, Figueroa could only occasionally climb stairs, stoop, crouch and crawl.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Figueroa argues that the ALJ, as a layman, could not evaluate how his postural limitations would affect his ability to perform the work of a security guard, suggesting that the ALJ needed the guidance of a vocational expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Figueroa bore the burden of showing that he could no longer perform his former job.  In order to meet that burden, he needed to provide \"some minimal information about the activities that [his] past usual work required[.]\"  Santiago v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 944 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1991);  accord Dudley v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 816 F.2d 792, 794 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam).  But Figueroa never testified that his prior work as security guard required any climbing, stooping, crouching and crawling, let alone doing so more than occasionally, nor does anything we have found in the record suggest that this is true.  Thus, there was no evidence before the ALJ to show that Figueroa could not perform his past job as a security guard because of his postural limitations.  Nor are climbing, stooping, crouching and crawling listed as physical requirements of the security guard job in the relevant vocational publication.  See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles (SCO ) Pt. A, at 45;  App.  C, at C-3 (1993) (the physical demand components of climbing, stooping, crouching and crawling are \"not present\" in the security guard job);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> see also SSR 83-14 (stating that relatively few jobs in the national economy require climbing and that workers performing light exertional jobs would not have to crouch and would have to stoop only occasionally to perform substantially all the exertional requirements of most light jobs).  Since Figueroa never met his burden of showing that his postural limitations prevented him from returning to his past work as security guard, and the SCO indicates that his postural limitations would not prevent him from performing the security guard job as usually performed in the national economy, the ALJ had no obligation to consult a vocational expert.  See Musgrave v. Sullivan, 966 F.2d 1371, 1376 (10th Cir.1992) (an ALJ has no obligation to seek vocational expert testimony where a claimant has not established a disability that prevents him from performing his past relevant work);  see also SSR 82-61 (stating that vocational experts may be necessary in determining how a job is usually performed where the vocational resource materials are insufficient);  compare Gray v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 369, 373 (1st Cir.1985) (an ALJ may rely on vocational publications in determining whether a claimant could return to past work where the claimant had the opportunity to, but did not, testify about the demands of her prior job).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa next suggests that the ALJ ignored significant evidence in determining that he could return to his work as a security guard.  Figueroa points first to his testimony that he could not continue working as a security guard.  At the hearing, Figueroa testified that he had to leave his security guard position in June 1990 after reinjuring his back.  He also testified that he had tried to return to work recently, but that he had to quit after a month because he was required to stand all the time, making his leg and heel numb.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Furthermore, Figueroa stated that he could stand only for about 25-30 minutes, then he had to move his legs or stand on his toes.  Figueroa also suggests that the ALJ ignored medical records from April 1989 and June 1990 which indicated that he had difficulty in standing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Figueroa had to leave his security guard job in June 1990 or that he complained of difficulty in standing in April 1989 and June 1990 is not very significant since the record indicates that his back condition improved afterwards and that it had not significantly affected his legs.  In September 1990, a neurosurgeon reported that Figueroa's back pain did not radiate to his legs and that he had very infrequent cramps;  he found that Figueroa had no diminished sensation or edema in his legs and that he walked with a normal gait;  his sensory and motor systems and reflexes were within normal limits;  his heel to toe walking was excellent;  there was no objective radiculopathy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  By December 1990, a State Insurance Fund physician advised him that he could return to work.  In January 1991, Figueroa told the consulting neurologist that he had difficulty sitting, but he did not complain about difficulty in standing for prolonged periods.  Although the neurologist found that Figueroa had decreased sensation in his right leg, he also found that Figueroa had no motor weakness and no muscle atrophy.  The uncontradicted February and June 1991 RFC assessments both indicated that Figueroa could stand or walk for six hours out of an eight-hour workday.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Figueroa never sought any treatment for numbness in his legs in 1991.  At the hearing, Figueroa appeared to attribute the numbness in his legs to the pain he suffered, but, as noted earlier, he also said that his medications and hand massaging alleviated the pain.  In addition, he suggested that moving his legs or standing on his toes helped relieve discomfort caused by prolonged standing.  Under the circumstances, the ALJ's apparent failure fully to credit Figueroa's allegation that he could not stand for prolonged periods of time was supported by substantial evidence in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Failure to Consider Whole Record</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa claims that the ALJ relied exclusively on evidence favorable to the Secretary and disregarded \"overwhelming evidence\" in the record which established his disability.  As our discussion above shows, however, substantial evidence in the record supported the ALJ's decision.  Two uncontradicted RFC assessments indicated that Figueroa could perform light work that entailed standing or walking for six hours out of an eight-hour workday.  Some six months after Figueroa had reinjured his back in June 1990, a State Insurance Fund physician found that he could return to work.  There was no evidence that Figueroa sought any treatment for pain or numbness after February 1991, and there was evidence that he was able to relieve the discomfort occasioned by his back condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record contains an August 1989 report of the Puerto Rico Industrial Commission in which the Commission reported that Figueroa alleged pain in his lower right back and right hip.  Apparently, because of Figueroa's allegation of pain, the Commission overturned the State Insurance Fund's May 1989 discharge of Figueroa as \"cured and without disability.\"  In February or March 1991, the State Insurance Fund determined, under the applicable worker's compensation law, that in December 1988 Figueroa had sustained a partial permanent disability of 15 % of his \"general physiological functions.\"  Although disability determinations by other agencies may be considered by the Secretary, they are not binding.

Figueroa described his unsuccessful attempt to work again in response to the ALJ's question whether he had worked as a security guard elsewhere after June 1990, suggesting that the job was a security guard position.  But, when the ALJ then concluded that Figueroa had worked as a security guard for five months in 1990, Figueroa's attorney presented a letter certifying only Figueroa's previous employment as a security guard for the four-month period from February to June 1990.  The rest of the attorney's response is listed as \"inaudible.\"  In his decision, the ALJ reports that Figueroa alleged at the hearing that he worked as a security guard for only four months, but that in his written submissions to the agency he stated that he had also worked from 1983-86 as a security guard.  This suggests that the ALJ's understanding was that Figueroa's unsuccessful one-month employment was not a security guard position.  Figueroa's brief contains a confusing passage on this point, but seems intended to confirm the ALJ's understanding</p>\n        <p>Even if the job in question were a security guard job, however, Figueroa's testimony at most showed that he could not return to a specific security guard job because it required him to stand continuously.  He did not show that the typical security guard job entails standing for greater than six hours a day.  Thus, even if his allegation that he could not stand for a prolonged period were fully credited, he still failed to show that his inability to stand for prolonged periods would prevent his returning to work as a security guard.  See Pelletier v. Secretary of HEW, 525 F.2d 158, 160 (1st Cir.1975) (a claimant did not meet her burden of proof by showing that a particular past job entailed exposure to smoke and fumes;  she was required to show that such exposure would be a condition of her type of work generally).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The records stated that he complained of difficulty in sitting for prolonged periods of time, too, but Figueroa does not allege the ALJ erred by failing to consider his difficulty in sitting</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Radiculopathy is defined as \"disease of the nerve roots.\"  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1405 (27th ed. 1988)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Neither physician marked the box on the RFC form which indicated that Figueroa should alternate periodically his sitting and standing in order to relieve pain or discomfort</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Figueroa also states that \"another telling fact\" is the fact that he wears an orthopedic girdle, but he does not develop that argument and so we do not consider it further.

After a hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) denied Figueroa's claim, concluding that he could perform his past relevant work as a security guard, and the Appeals Council denied review.  Figueroa then appealed to the district court, which affirmed the decision.  He now seeks review in this court.  Because Figueroa's specific objections on appeal are meritless, and because our review of the record shows that substantial evidence supports the finding that Figueroa was not disabled, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his decision, the ALJ determined that the medical evidence of record showed that Figueroa has a severe musculoskeletal condition, but not one meeting or equalling the conditions listed in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt.  P, App. 1. Specifically, a CT scan showed lumbar spine spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis at the L4-L5 level and posterior bulging with small central disc herniation and compression of the dural sac at that level.  The ALJ found that Figueroa's back condition was compatible with episodic pain, but concluded that the evidence did not establish a medically determinable basis for the degree of pain alleged.  He also found that Figueroa's back condition had not limited his neurological or orthopedic functioning since Figueroa had always exhibited good range of motion and no muscle weakness.  Nonetheless, the ALJ determined that Figueroa could no longer perform his prior medium exertional level job as warehouseman and/or fingerlift operator.  Because he found that Figueroa could still perform light work, however, the ALJ concluded that he could perform his past relevant work as a security guard, a job Figueroa had held from 1983-86 and again in 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Figueroa claims that the ALJ failed to consider his allegations of disabling pain, erred in concluding that he could return to his past work as a security guard, and denied him disability benefits without considering evidence in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Allegations of Disabling Pain</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his claim that the ALJ failed to consider his allegations of disabling pain, Figueroa states first that he constantly and persistently complained to examining physicians of severe disabling pain.  He suggests that the ALJ ignored that evidence.  The record does not substantiate his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there are significant gaps in Figueroa's medical records between December 1988, when he first injured his back, and October 1991, when the hearing took place.  We have found no medical records indicating that Figueroa complained of pain to examining physicians for the periods from May 1989 to December 1989, February 1990 to June 1990, or March 1991 to October 1991.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as the transcript shows, at the hearing the ALJ elicited Figueroa's testimony on relevant aspects of the pain he alleged, as required under Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474185\"><a href=\"/opinion/474185/14-socsecrepser-301-unemplinsrep-cch-16883-ernest-s-avery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In his decision, the ALJ took account of that testimony and stated that Figueroa's \"salient complaint\" was pain and decreased sensation in his right leg.  In view of the medical evidence, however, the ALJ did not fully credit Figueroa's allegations of pain.  He noted the gaps in Figueroa's medical treatment history, including the fact that he had not sought any treatment after February 1991.  He concluded that, while Figueroa's back condition could cause pain on an episodic basis, the pain had proven treatable and had not limited his functioning significantly, except to the extent that he could not perform medium or heavy work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the gaps in Figueroa's medical record, other evidence supports the ALJ's conclusion.  Although Figueroa testified that his pain was constant and strong, he also said that medication \"alleviate[d]\" the pain and that massaging his leg alleviated painful cramping during the night.  He testified that his medication gave him heartburn, and for that reason it had been changed;  his current medication allegedly had side effects, too, but Figueroa gave no specifics and acknowledged that he took it anyway because it \"at least relieve[s] the pain a little.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The ALJ noted that Figueroa appeared in no distress at the hearing and that he walked adequately with no assistive device.  Figueroa also testified that he could walk for 30 meters, that one of his daily activities was walking around his yard, and that he walked around the house when leg pain woke him up at night.  A consulting neurologist reported in January 1991 that Figueroa had back pain syndrome, but that he could do tip toe gait, walk on his heels and squat on his knees;  that his forward lumbar flexion was 80 degrees forward and his lateral lumbar flexion was 20 degrees;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> that his Lasegue was negative<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and his straight leg raising was 90 degrees;  that he had no motor weakness and no muscle atrophy although he had minimal paravertebral muscle spasm;  and that there was decreased sensation in his right leg without any anatomical distribution.  In February and June 1991, Social Security physicians reviewed Figueroa's medical records and assessed his residual functional capacity (RFC).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Each indicated that, despite his back condition, Figueroa could perform the exertional requirements of light work:  he could occasionally lift or carry 20 pounds and frequently lift or carry 10 pounds;  he could stand, walk and sit with normal breaks each for a total of about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday;  and he could push or pull without limit.  See 20 C.F.R. Sec. 404.1567 (the physical exertional requirements of light work comprise the ability to lift no more than 20 pounds at a time while frequently lifting or carrying objects up to 10 pounds, to walk or stand a good deal, or to perform some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls if the job mostly required sitting);  SSR 83-10 (\"[T]he full range of light work involves standing or walking, off and on, for a total of approximately 6 hours of an 8-hour workday.  Sitting may occur intermittently during the remaining time.\").  Figueroa has not submitted any physician's evaluation or other medical report which contradicts the neurologist's assessment of his condition as of January 1991, nor any residual functional capacity evaluation which contradicts the two RFC assessments indicating that he could perform light work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Past Relevant Work</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa objects to the ALJ's conclusion that he could perform his past relevant work of security guard, which is classified as light exertional work.  See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT ) 269 (4th rev. ed. 1991).  In support thereof, Figueroa cites the postural limitations described in the Secretary's RFC assessments.  Both assessments indicated that, given his back condition, Figueroa could only occasionally climb stairs, stoop, crouch and crawl.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Figueroa argues that the ALJ, as a layman, could not evaluate how his postural limitations would affect his ability to perform the work of a security guard, suggesting that the ALJ needed the guidance of a vocational expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Figueroa bore the burden of showing that he could no longer perform his former job.  In order to meet that burden, he needed to provide \"some minimal information about the activities that [his] past usual work required[.]\"  Santiago v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567917\"><a href=\"/opinion/567917/35-socsecrepser-4-unemplinsrep-cch-p-16272a-luz-m-santiago-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1991);  accord Dudley v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487124\"><a href=\"/opinion/487124/17-socsecrepser-473-unemplinsrep-cch-17321-leroy-dudley-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 794 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam).  But Figueroa never testified that his prior work as security guard required any climbing, stooping, crouching and crawling, let alone doing so more than occasionally, nor does anything we have found in the record suggest that this is true.  Thus, there was no evidence before the ALJ to show that Figueroa could not perform his past job as a security guard because of his postural limitations.  Nor are climbing, stooping, crouching and crawling listed as physical requirements of the security guard job in the relevant vocational publication.  See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles (SCO ) Pt. A, at 45;  App.  C, at C-3 (1993) (the physical demand components of climbing, stooping, crouching and crawling are \"not present\" in the security guard job);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> see also SSR 83-14 (stating that relatively few jobs in the national economy require climbing and that workers performing light exertional jobs would not have to crouch and would have to stoop only occasionally to perform substantially all the exertional requirements of most light jobs).  Since Figueroa never met his burden of showing that his postural limitations prevented him from returning to his past work as security guard, and the SCO indicates that his postural limitations would not prevent him from performing the security guard job as usually performed in the national economy, the ALJ had no obligation to consult a vocational expert.  See Musgrave v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584603\"><a href=\"/opinion/584603/david-w-musgrave-v-louis-w-sullivan-md-secretary-of-health-and-human/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></a></span>, 1376 (10th Cir.1992) (an ALJ has no obligation to seek vocational expert testimony where a claimant has not established a disability that prevents him from performing his past relevant work);  see also SSR 82-61 (stating that vocational experts may be necessary in determining how a job is usually performed where the vocational resource materials are insufficient);  compare Gray v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451515\"><a href=\"/opinion/451515/9-socsecrepser-262-unemplinsrep-cch-16051-elaine-gray-v-margaret/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, 373 (1st Cir.1985) (an ALJ may rely on vocational publications in determining whether a claimant could return to past work where the claimant had the opportunity to, but did not, testify about the demands of her prior job).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa next suggests that the ALJ ignored significant evidence in determining that he could return to his work as a security guard.  Figueroa points first to his testimony that he could not continue working as a security guard.  At the hearing, Figueroa testified that he had to leave his security guard position in June 1990 after reinjuring his back.  He also testified that he had tried to return to work recently, but that he had to quit after a month because he was required to stand all the time, making his leg and heel numb.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Furthermore, Figueroa stated that he could stand only for about 25-30 minutes, then he had to move his legs or stand on his toes.  Figueroa also suggests that the ALJ ignored medical records from April 1989 and June 1990 which indicated that he had difficulty in standing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Figueroa had to leave his security guard job in June 1990 or that he complained of difficulty in standing in April 1989 and June 1990 is not very significant since the record indicates that his back condition improved afterwards and that it had not significantly affected his legs.  In September 1990, a neurosurgeon reported that Figueroa's back pain did not radiate to his legs and that he had very infrequent cramps;  he found that Figueroa had no diminished sensation or edema in his legs and that he walked with a normal gait;  his sensory and motor systems and reflexes were within normal limits;  his heel to toe walking was excellent;  there was no objective radiculopathy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  By December 1990, a State Insurance Fund physician advised him that he could return to work.  In January 1991, Figueroa told the consulting neurologist that he had difficulty sitting, but he did not complain about difficulty in standing for prolonged periods.  Although the neurologist found that Figueroa had decreased sensation in his right leg, he also found that Figueroa had no motor weakness and no muscle atrophy.  The uncontradicted February and June 1991 RFC assessments both indicated that Figueroa could stand or walk for six hours out of an eight-hour workday.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Figueroa never sought any treatment for numbness in his legs in 1991.  At the hearing, Figueroa appeared to attribute the numbness in his legs to the pain he suffered, but, as noted earlier, he also said that his medications and hand massaging alleviated the pain.  In addition, he suggested that moving his legs or standing on his toes helped relieve discomfort caused by prolonged standing.  Under the circumstances, the ALJ's apparent failure fully to credit Figueroa's allegation that he could not stand for prolonged periods of time was supported by substantial evidence in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Failure to Consider Whole Record</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa claims that the ALJ relied exclusively on evidence favorable to the Secretary and disregarded \"overwhelming evidence\" in the record which established his disability.  As our discussion above shows, however, substantial evidence in the record supported the ALJ's decision.  Two uncontradicted RFC assessments indicated that Figueroa could perform light work that entailed standing or walking for six hours out of an eight-hour workday.  Some six months after Figueroa had reinjured his back in June 1990, a State Insurance Fund physician found that he could return to work.  There was no evidence that Figueroa sought any treatment for pain or numbness after February 1991, and there was evidence that he was able to relieve the discomfort occasioned by his back condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record contains an August 1989 report of the Puerto Rico Industrial Commission in which the Commission reported that Figueroa alleged pain in his lower right back and right hip.  Apparently, because of Figueroa's allegation of pain, the Commission overturned the State Insurance Fund's May 1989 discharge of Figueroa as \"cured and without disability.\"  In February or March 1991, the State Insurance Fund determined, under the applicable worker's compensation law, that in December 1988 Figueroa had sustained a partial permanent disability of 15 % of his \"general physiological functions.\"  Although disability determinations by other agencies may be considered by the Secretary, they are not binding.

Figueroa described his unsuccessful attempt to work again in response to the ALJ's question whether he had worked as a security guard elsewhere after June 1990, suggesting that the job was a security guard position.  But, when the ALJ then concluded that Figueroa had worked as a security guard for five months in 1990, Figueroa's attorney presented a letter certifying only Figueroa's previous employment as a security guard for the four-month period from February to June 1990.  The rest of the attorney's response is listed as \"inaudible.\"  In his decision, the ALJ reports that Figueroa alleged at the hearing that he worked as a security guard for only four months, but that in his written submissions to the agency he stated that he had also worked from 1983-86 as a security guard.  This suggests that the ALJ's understanding was that Figueroa's unsuccessful one-month employment was not a security guard position.  Figueroa's brief contains a confusing passage on this point, but seems intended to confirm the ALJ's understanding</p>\n        <p>Even if the job in question were a security guard job, however, Figueroa's testimony at most showed that he could not return to a specific security guard job because it required him to stand continuously.  He did not show that the typical security guard job entails standing for greater than six hours a day.  Thus, even if his allegation that he could not stand for a prolonged period were fully credited, he still failed to show that his inability to stand for prolonged periods would prevent his returning to work as a security guard.
