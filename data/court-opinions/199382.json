George A. O’Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     James L. Sultan, Catherine J. Hinton, and Rankin & Sultan\non Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant’s Appeal from\nDetention Order.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Emily R.\nSchulman, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        April 24, 2001\n\f              Per Curiam.     Appellant Rana Nazar Hussain appeals\n\n from a district court order that denied his motion to revoke\n\n a pretrial detention order.            Having thoroughly reviewed the\n\n appellant's     submissions       to    this   court   in   light    of    our\n\n independent     standard     of    review,      see    United     States    v.\n\n O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 814 (1st Cir. 1990), we affirm the\n\n district court's decision to detain appellant based on the\n\n risk of flight.\n\n              Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was arrested\n\n at Logan Airport and subsequently indicted on charges of\n\n conspiring to import heroin and aiding and abetting said\n\n importation in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 963, 952 and 18\n\n U.S.C.   §    2.     These     offenses        trigger      the   statutory\n\n presumption that \"no condition or combination of conditions\n\n will reasonably assure the appearance of the ... [appellant]\n\n at trial or the safety of any person or the community.\"                     18\n\n U.S.C. § 3142(e).1     This presumption is particularly heavy\n\n in this case, because the government's evidence suggests\n\n that appellant previously had acted as the \"controller\" of\n\n\n\n    1   As the government does not contend that appellant's\nrelease would result in any danger, our review is limited to the\nrisk of flight issue.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f a successful heroin-smuggle.2      Moreover, both appellant and\n\n his    co-defendant   made    incriminating   statements   to   the\n\n authorities, thus the weight of the government's evidence\n\n appears to be strong.        On this record, we see no basis to\n\n disturb the district court's finding that appellant faces an\n\n \"uphill battle\" in his motion to suppress his own custodial\n\n statements.3\n\n\n\n    2   Appellant's contention that the government violates his\nright to due process by relying on informant information to show\nhis participation in a prior smuggle was not raised below.\nTherefore, the objection is not properly before us. See, United\nStates v. Perez-Franco, 839 F.2d 867, 871 (1 st Cir. 1988)(per\ncuriam). Moreover, the objection flies in the face of the well-\nestablished principle that courts may consider and credit\nreliable hearsay evidence in making determinations under the\nBail Reform Act. See, e.g., United States v. Acevedo-Ramos,\n755 F.2d 203, 208 (1 st Cir. 1985).       It is equally well-\nestablished that bail hearings are not intended to serve as\ndiscovery expeditions. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 79\nF.3d 1208, 1210 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Acevedo-Ramos, id.; United\nStates v. Suppa, 799 F.2d 115, 120 (3d Cir. 1986). Accordingly,\nwe decline appellant's invitation to become embroiled in the\ndiscovery dispute that is pending in the district court as a\nresult of appellant's motion for reconsideration of Magistrate\nJudge Cohen's January 12, 2001, Memorandum and Order denying\nappellant access to informant information.\n    3  We recognize the possibility that the government's case\nmight be weakened if appellant's motion to suppress succeeds in\nexcluding some or all of his custodial statements.         This\npossibility does not provide a sound reason to overturn the\ndistrict court's detention order. Should appellant succeed in\nhis motion to suppress or in his motion for reconsideration of\nMagistrate Judge Cohen's January 12, 2001 discovery order, he\nmay renew his request for bail before the district court. See\nUnited States v.   Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir.\n1987)(per curiam); 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f).\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          To be sure, the presumption of flight is somewhat\n\nweakened by the evidence that appellant has marshaled that\n\nattests to his reputation as a prominent Pakistani film\n\ndistributor, his good standing in his family and religious\n\ncommunity, and his lack of a criminal record.         The district\n\ncourt supportably deemed this evidence outweighed by that\n\nwhich showed that appellant and his co-defendant were caught\n\nsmuggling almost 28 pounds of heroin and that appellant has\n\nno significant ties to the United States or Massachusetts.\n\nIndeed, given the seriousness of the charges and the 10-year\n\nmandatory minimum sentence that appellant would face if\n\nconvicted, the strength of appellant's commercial and family\n\nties to Pakistan would appear to reinforce his incentive to\n\nflee.   The Consul General's offer to serve as appellant's\n\ncustodian could not reasonably assure appellant's appearance\n\nat trial since his additional occupation as a real estate\n\ninvestor precludes him from being at home during the work\n\nweek and electronic monitoring is not always effective.\n\n          A final housekeeping remark is necessary.             The\n\nunsealed appendix of exhibits that appellant has filed in\n\nthis court includes two items that technically remain sealed\n\nin the district court.         Those items are the transcript of\n\nthe   September   13,   2000   hearing   before   Magistrate   Judge\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fCohen, and Magistrate Judge Cohen's Memorandum and Order of\n\nthat same date.      In response to this court's order, defense\n\ncounsel    has    filed     the   attached     \"Appellant's      Statement\n\nRespecting Previously Sealed Exhibits\",                  which indicates\n\nthat the need for sealing no longer exists.                 We direct the\n\ndistrict    court     to     review    the      attached      \"Appellant's\n\nStatement...\" and to enter an order which indicates whether\n\nor   not   Magistrate       Judge     Cohen's     September     13,    2000\n\nMemorandum and Order (docket entry #4) and the transcript of\n\ndefendant Hussain's September 13, 2000 initial appearance\n\n(docket    entry    unassigned)       shall     remain      sealed.     The\n\nappellant's      appendix    shall    remain    in   this    court's   safe\n\npending receipt of the district court's order.\n\n\n\n           The district court's order requiring appellant\n\nHussain's pretrial detention is affirmed. See Local Rule\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
