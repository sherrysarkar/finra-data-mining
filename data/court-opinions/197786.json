In   a   joint   trial,  petitioners\r                                \r\n\nRenaldo  Pledger,  Sean Dixon,  Edwin  Carmichael  and Steven\r\n\nWadlington were each convicted of multiple  offenses stemming\r\n\nfrom  their involvement  in  a large-scale  drug distribution\r\n\nring  in Boston, Massachusetts.  On direct appeal, this court\r\n\naffirmed after rejecting  a multitude of challenges  to their\r\n\nconvictions and sentences.  See United States v. Whiting,  28\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d  1296 (1st  Cir. 1994).    Petitioners thereafter  filed\r\n\nseparate motions  for habeas relief  under 28 U.S.C.    2255,\r\n\nadvancing a  plethora of new  claims.  In each  instance, the\r\n\ndistrict  court denied relief  and then  declined to  issue a\r\n\ncertificate   of  appealability  (CAP).    See  28  U.S.C.   \r                                                          \r\n\n2253(c)(1).  Petitioners  have now submitted CAP  requests to\r\n\nthis court.  \r\n\n     In order to qualify for  a CAP, a habeas petitioner must\r\n\nmake \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\r\n\nright,\" id.   2253(c)(2)--i.e., a showing that the issues are\r                       \r\n\ndebatable among reasonable jurists, that a court could decide\r                                                                  \r\n\nthem in  a different  fashion, or that  they are  adequate to\r\n\ndeserve encouragement to proceed further, see, e.g., Barefoot\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Estelle,  463 U.S.  880,  893  n.4  (1983).   Because  we\r                       \r\n\nconclude  that none  of the  petitioners  has satisfied  this\r\n\nstandard, the CAP applications will be denied and the appeals\r\n\nterminated.  \r\r\n\n     Petitioners have presented  an assortment of overlapping\r\n\ncontentions, which we  have divided into two  categories.  We\r\n\nwill  first  address  a  pair  of  joint  challenges  to  the\r\n\nconvictions and sentences, and will then consider a number of\r\n\nindividual claims.  Because most of the claims either consist\r\n\nof,  or  are  accompanied   by,  complaints  of   ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of  counsel  (IAC), and  because  they  all prove\r\n\nunavailing  on the  merits,  we need  not  pause to  consider\r\n\nwhether they each  are cognizable  in the  habeas context  or\r\n\nwhether any are subject to procedural default.\r\n\n                         Joint Claims\r                                                 \r\n\n     1.   All four  petitioners contend  that the  government\r\n\nwithheld  notes of  witness interviews  in  violation of  its\r\n\nobligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83  (1963), and\r                                               \r\n\nthe  Jencks Act,  18 U.S.C.    3500.   It is  undisputed that\r\n\nseveral government  witnesses engaged in  debriefing sessions\r\n\nprior to  trial at  which prosecutor  Kelly  and DEA  special\r\n\nagent Murphy took handwritten notes.  During trial, the court\r\n\nrejected  defense requests  for disclosure of  such material.\r\n\nSome  time later, petitioners gained possession of notes that\r\n\nthe prosecutor had  taken of one  interview with the  witness\r\n\nAnser   Adams.     Insisting  that   those  notes   contained\r\n\nexculpatory  and  impeachment  material  and  were  otherwise\r\n\ndiscoverable under the Jencks Act, petitioners argue that the\r\n\ngovernment was  remiss in not  turning over all notes  of all\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nwitness interviews.  The district court justifiably concluded\r\n\notherwise. \r\n\n     The  Jencks Act  claim is entirely  unavailing.   As the\r\n\nnotes were never  adopted by the witness and  did not involve\r\n\ngrand  jury testimony, they  would fall within  the statute's\r\n\npurview  only  if  they provided  a  \"substantially verbatim\"\r\n\naccount of what had been said.  18 U.S.C.   3500(e)(2).  Such\r\n\nan  account must  reflect the  witness' own words  \"fully and\r\n\nwithout distortion.\"  Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343,\r                                                          \r\n\n352  (1959); accord,  e.g., United  States  v. Neal,  36 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1190,  1198 (1st  Cir. 1994),  cert. denied,  117 S.

The  notes  here  did  not do  so.    Instead,  they\r\n\nevidenced \"substantial  selection of material\"  and contained\r\n\nthe  prosecutor's  \"own interpretations  or  impressions\" and\r\n\nwere thus \"not to be produced.\"  Palermo, 360 U.S. at 352-53;\r                                                    \r\n\naccord, e.g., United  States v.

Ct. 130 (1996).\r                  \r\n\n     Nor have petitioners  explained how the notes  were both\r\n\n\"favorable\" and \"material\"  to the defense, United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBrimage, 115 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S.

It  suffices here to  observe\r                              \r\n\nthat  evidence  is  \"material\"  if  there  is  \"a  reasonable\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nprobability  that, had  the evidence  been  disclosed to  the\r\n\ndefense,  the  result  of  the  proceeding  would  have  been\r\n\ndifferent.\"   United States v.

A habeas  petitioner is\r                                              \r\n\nnot  entitled to an evidentiary  hearing where, as here, \"his\r\n\nallegations are 'vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible.'\"\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nDavid v.

All  petitioners but Pledger challenge  the quantity\r\n\nof  drugs  for  which  they  were  each  held  accountable at\r\n\nsentencing.  They  contend, inter alia, that  the court erred\r                                                  \r\n\nby  failing to make  individualized findings in  this regard.\r\n\nThey  also  complain  of counsel's  failure  to  pursue these\r\n\nmatters, particularly in  light of a clarifying  amendment to\r\n\nthe guidelines  that was adopted  during the pendency  of the\r\n\nappeal.  We perceive no  error; indeed, we rejected a related\r\n\nset of arguments on direct appeal.\r\n\n     In order  to calculate the  quantity of drugs  for which\r\n\neach  petitioner  was  responsible, so  as  to  determine the\r\n\napplicable base  offense level, the sentencing  court engaged\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1   Our rejection  of the Brady/Jencks  Act claims  on the\r               1                              \r\nmerits disposes of  the subsidiary IAC  claims.  The  further\r\nsuggestion in  this regard  that the  prosecution engaged  in\r\nintentional misconduct is totally without record support.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nin   a  two-step  process.    It  first  estimated  that  the\r\n\norganization as  a whole  had distributed  an average  of two\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine per week during its existence.   Relying\r\n\non the \"relevant  conduct\" provision in U.S.S.G.    1B1.3, it\r\n\nthen multiplied this figure by  the number of weeks that each\r\n\npetitioner  had been involved.  On direct appeal, petitioners\r\n\nchallenged  the  two-kilograms-per-week  estimate, contending\r\n\nthat it lacked evidentiary  support, see Whiting, 28 F.3d  at\r                                                            \r\n\n1303-05;  we disagreed, describing  the court's finding  as a\r\n\n\"conservative  estimate [that] left a fair margin of safety,\"\r\n\nid. at 1305.   Petitioners now argue that the court  erred by\r               \r\n\nattributing  that estimate  to  each  of  them  without  more\r\n\nparticularized   inquiries   into    what   quantities   were\r\n\nforeseeable and  were within  the scope  of their  respective\r\n\nagreements.\r\n\n     Petitioners' precise complaint is difficult to identify.\r\n\nTo the  extent they are alleging that the court automatically\r\n\nsaddled each of  them with the full amount  of drugs involved\r\n\nin the conspiracy  without further inquiry,  thereby applying\r\n\nan  erroneous  legal standard,  they  are  mistaken.   As  we\r\n\nexplained  in  the  earlier appeal,  petitioners  \"were  held\r\n\nresponsible  at  sentencing   for  'drugs  [they]  personally\r\n\nhandled  or  anticipated handling,  and,  under  the relevant\r\n\nconduct  rubric, for drugs  involved in additional  acts that\r                                                                         \r\n\nwere reasonably foreseeable  by [them] and were  committed in\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nfurtherance  of the conspiracy.'\"   Whiting, 28  F.3d at 1304\r                                                       \r\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1161,  1197  (1st Cir.  1993)).2    To  the extent  they  are\r                                           2\r\n\nalleging  that the  court's  findings of  foreseeability were\r\n\nunsupported  by the evidence (or that  counsel should have so\r\n\ncontended), they fare  no better.   Three of the  petitioners\r\n\n(Pledger,  Dixon and Wadlington)  did voice such  a challenge\r\n\nbelow,  and  Wadlington  pursued it  on  appeal--all  without\r\n\nsuccess.   See  Whiting,  supra,  slip op.  at  72-74.   More\r                                           \r\n\nimportant, there has been no showing how the court's findings\r\n\nin this regard might possibly have constituted clear error.\r\n\n     Petitioners'  reliance on the  1992 revision of    1B1.3\r\n\n(amendment 439) likewise proves unavailing.   It is true that\r\n\nthis  amendment was clarifying in nature  and thus could have\r\n\nbeen invoked on  direct appeal.  See, e.g.,  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLaCroix, 28 F.3d 223, 227  n.4 (1st Cir. 1994); United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 74 n.2 (1st Cir. 1993).  Yet we fail\r                        \r\n\nto see how  petitioners would have  benefited from doing  so,\r\n\nmuch less  how their  attorneys can be  thought derelict  for\r\n\nhaving failed  to do so.   Both the  1990 version of    1B1.3\r\n\n(which  was applied  at  sentencing)  and  the  1992  version\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2   The presentence  reports applied  the same  standard--\r               2\r\nstating  that each petitioner was being \"held accountable for\r\nthe drugs sold by the enterprise, that is, for the conduct of\r\nothers  in  furtherance  of  the  execution  of  the  jointly\r\nundertaken conspiracy that was reasonably foreseeable by this\r\ndefendant, during the time of his involvement in the criminal\r\nenterprise.\" \r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nrequired that  relevant conduct be  \"reasonably foreseeable.\"\r\n\nAnd both required  that it be \"in furtherance  of the jointly\r\n\nundertaken  criminal activity.\"   As here relevant,  what the\r\n\n1992 amendment did was elaborate  on this latter criterion by\r\n\nexplaining that \"the court must first determine the  scope of\r\n\nthe  criminal  activity  the particular  defendant  agreed to\r\n\njointly  undertake (i.e., the  scope of the  specific conduct\r                                    \r\n\nand  objectives  embraced  by  the  defendant's  agreement).\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.3, comment. (n.2) (1992).  \r\n\n     Yet  this merely fleshed  out the  preexisting standard.\r\n\nThe  earlier version likewise  had referred to  conduct being\r\n\n\"within  the  scope of  the  defendant's agreement.\"    See  \r                                                                       \r\n\n1B1.3, comment. (n.1) (1990).  Prior to the amendment, we had\r\n\nexplained that  \"the measure of a  defendant's accountability\r\n\nfor drug transactions in which he was not personally involved\r\n\nis usually congruent with the scope of his agreement with the\r\n\nother  participants  in  the  criminal  enterprise.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Garcia, 954  F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1992).   We have\r                            \r\n\nsince  indicated  that  \"application  note  2  [of  the  1992\r\n\namendment], read as a whole,  appears to use 'in furtherance'\r\n\nand 'within the scope' interchangeably.\"  LaCroix, 28 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n227 n.5.  Most important, petitioners have offered no factual\r\n\nsupport for the  assertion that their colleagues'  drug sales\r\n\n\"were  outside the scope  of [petitioners'] agreement[s], or,\r\n\nput another way, that those  transactions were other than  in\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nfurtherance  of the  jointly  undertaken criminal  activity.\"\r\n\nId. at 228.3\r                       3\r               \r\n\n                      Individual Claims\r                                                   \r\n\n     1.  Wadlington  was convicted, among other  offenses, of\r\n\npossessing  an unregistered shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C.\r\n\n   5861(d).  The  statutory definition of  \"firearm\" required\r\n\nproof that the shotgun possessed two characteristics: that it\r\n\nhad a  barrel length of  less than  18 inches, or  an overall\r\n\nlength of less than 24 inches, and  that it could fire (or be\r\n\nrestored to fire) shotgun shells.  In its charge to the jury,\r\n\nthe court inadvertently omitted this definition--an oversight\r\n\nthat  neither  side  brought to  its  attention.   Wadlington\r\n\nraised  the  matter  on direct  appeal  but  without success.\r\n\nSubjecting the issue to plain-error scrutiny due to  the lack\r\n\nof objection below, we  held that the error had  not caused a\r\n\n\"miscarriage of justice\" or seriously affected \"the fairness,\r\n\nintegrity or  public  reputation  of  judicial  proceedings.\"\r\n\nWhiting, 28 F.3d at 1309 (quoting United States v. Olano, 507\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 725,  736 (1993)).   In so concluding, we  observed that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   3 A  trio of  subsidiary claims  likewise  miss the  mark.\r               3\r\nPetitioners contend that the court  failed to notify them  of\r\nits  tentative findings before  imposing sentence,  as called\r\nfor by  U.S.S.G.    6A1.3(b) (1990).    The record  indicates\r\notherwise.  They assert that the drug-quantity information on\r\nwhich the court relied was inherently unreliable; we rejected\r\nan identical claim on direct appeal.  See Whiting, 28 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n1305.   And  petitioners  insist  that  counsel  should  have\r\nrequested an evidentiary hearing  prior to sentencing;  under\r\nthe circumstances, we find neither substandard performance by\r\ncounsel nor prejudice resulting therefrom. \r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nthe   \"undisputed  evidence\"   showed   that  the   statutory\r\n\ndefinition had  been met--meaning  that there  was \"no  risk\"\r\n\nthat  the  omission had  \"resulted  in the  conviction  of an\r\n\ninnocent man.\"  Id.\r                               \r\n\n     Wadlington now raises the same  issue by means of an IAC\r\n\nclaim,  complaining of  counsel's failure  to  object to  the\r\n\nomission.  An IAC claim  requires a showing of both deficient\r\n\nperformance and prejudice.   The Supreme Court  has described\r\n\nthe  prejudice element as  follows: \"The defendant  must show\r\n\nthat   there  is  a  reasonable  probability  that,  but  for\r\n\ncounsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\r\n\nwould  have been  different.  A  reasonable probability  is a\r\n\nprobability  sufficient   to  undermine  confidence   in  the\r\n\noutcome.\"   Strickland  v.  Washington,  466  U.S.  668,  694\r                                                  \r\n\n(1984).      No   such  reasonable   probability   has   been\r\n\ndemonstrated; to the contrary, as we earlier concluded, it is\r\n\n\"clear that  the jury  would readily  have  convicted\" had  a\r\n\nproper instruction been given.  Whiting, 28 F.3d at 1309.\r                                                   \r\n\n     2.   Dixon  complains  of  improper  advice  from  trial\r\n\ncounsel.  Specifically,  he contends that he  wished to plead\r\n\nguilty   to   his  substantive   distribution   charge  while\r\n\nproceeding  to  trial  on  his  conspiracy  charge,  but  was\r\n\nmistakenly  informed  he  could  not  do  so.     Since  this\r\n\nallegation is presented in purely conclusory  form, dismissal\r\n\nwas appropriate.  See David,     F.3d at    , 1998 WL  at *6.\r                                       \r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nMoreover, even if this allegation were true, Dixon has failed\r\n\nto  explain,  and we  are  unable  to  perceive, how  he  was\r\n\nprejudiced.  The indictment charged (and the evidence showed)\r\n\nthat his distribution offense was committed in furtherance of\r\n\nthe conspiracy.   As a  result, a  guilty plea to  the former\r\n\nwould only have augmented the proof of his involvement in the\r\n\nlatter.  Nor would there  have been any discernible effect on\r\n\nDixon's  sentence;   the   considerable   evidence   of   his\r\n\nparticipation in the  conspiracy meant that,  even if he  had\r\n\nbeen acquitted on the conspiracy count,  the relevant-conduct\r\n\nprovision might well have yielded the same outcome.\r\n\n     3.   Wadlington criticizes his attorney for advising him\r\n\nnot to take the witness  stand.  Yet when \"[u]naccompanied by\r\n\ncoercion,  legal advice concerning  exercise of the  right to\r\n\ntestify  infringes no right ... but simply discharges defense\r\n\ncounsel's  ethical responsibility to  the accused.\"   Lema v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited States, 987 F.2d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 1993); accord, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nBucuvalas v.

Carmichael argues that  his attorney was  remiss in\r\n\neffectively  abandoning a  pretrial  motion  for  a  bill  of\r\n\nparticulars  concerning his money  laundering charge.   As he\r\n\nnotes, we  declined  on direct  appeal  to address  an  issue\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\ninvolving  that  motion  because of  counsel's  action.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWhiting, slip op. at 66.  Yet no prejudice thereby ensued; we\r                   \r\n\nwent on to observe that \"[h]ad counsel properly preserved the\r\n\nissue,  the  government's  provision  of  the  Western  Union\r\n\ntransfers would be sufficient to avoid any actual surprise or\r\n\nprejudice.\"   Id.  Carmichael's more general complaints about\r                             \r\n\nthe extent of  preparation performed by counsel  are likewise\r\n\nunavailing.\r\n\n     5.  Pledger objects to the  performance of his appellate\r\n\ncounsel.   Specifically,  he argues  that  counsel failed  to\r\n\npursue a  claim that the  process of selecting  counties from\r\n\nwhich the petit  jury pool was chosen operated  in a racially\r\n\ndiscriminatory manner.  Yet the determination of which issues\r\n\nhave  the best  chance  of  succeeding  on  appeal  obviously\r\n\nentails  the exercise  of  professional  judgment.   Judicial\r\n\nscrutiny  thereof \"must  be highly  deferential,\" Strickland,\r                                                                        \r\n\n466 U.S.  at 689--particularly where, as here, there has been\r\n\nno  showing that  the  claim  has any  colorable  merit.

Pledger challenges the district court's alternative\r\n\nholding  that his petition was time-barred under AEDPA's one-\r\n\nyear statute of  limitations.  He contends  that the \"mailbox\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   4   Several  of  the other  petitioners  also complain  of\r               4\r\ncounsel's failure to pursue certain  claims on appeal.  As we\r\nhave determined each of those underlying claims to be without\r\nmerit,  the attorneys'  conduct  in  this  regard  cannot  be\r\nfaulted.\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nrule\" governing the timing of a notice of appeal filed by  an\r\n\ninmate confined in  an institution, see Houston  v.

Pledger's further  contention--that\r\n\nAEDPA  is  inapplicable   whenever  the  underlying  criminal\r\n\nconviction  preceded its effective date, even when the habeas\r\n\npetition  was filed thereafter--is  meritless.

Petitioners thereafter  filed\r\n\nseparate motions  for habeas relief  under 28 U.S.C.    2255,\r\n\nadvancing a  plethora of new  claims.  In each  instance, the\r\n\ndistrict  court denied relief  and then  declined to  issue a\r\n\ncertificate   of  appealability  (CAP).    See  28  U.S.C.   \r                                                          \r\n\n2253(c)(1).  Petitioners  have now submitted CAP  requests to\r\n\nthis court.  \r\n\n     In order to qualify for  a CAP, a habeas petitioner must\r\n\nmake \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\r\n\nright,\" id.   2253(c)(2)--i.e., a showing that the issues are\r                       \r\n\ndebatable among reasonable jurists, that a court could decide\r                                                                  \r\n\nthem in  a different  fashion, or that  they are  adequate to\r\n\ndeserve encouragement to proceed further, see, e.g., Barefoot\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Because  we\r                       \r\n\nconclude  that none  of the  petitioners  has satisfied  this\r\n\nstandard, the CAP applications will be denied and the appeals\r\n\nterminated.  \r\r\n\n     Petitioners have presented  an assortment of overlapping\r\n\ncontentions, which we  have divided into two  categories.  We\r\n\nwill  first  address  a  pair  of  joint  challenges  to  the\r\n\nconvictions and sentences, and will then consider a number of\r\n\nindividual claims.  Because most of the claims either consist\r\n\nof,  or  are  accompanied   by,  complaints  of   ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of  counsel  (IAC), and  because  they  all prove\r\n\nunavailing  on the  merits,  we need  not  pause to  consider\r\n\nwhether they each  are cognizable  in the  habeas context  or\r\n\nwhether any are subject to procedural default.\r\n\n                         Joint Claims\r                                                 \r\n\n     1.

It is  undisputed that\r\n\nseveral government  witnesses engaged in  debriefing sessions\r\n\nprior to  trial at  which prosecutor  Kelly  and DEA  special\r\n\nagent Murphy took handwritten notes.  During trial, the court\r\n\nrejected  defense requests  for disclosure of  such material.\r\n\nSome  time later, petitioners gained possession of notes that\r\n\nthe prosecutor had  taken of one  interview with the  witness\r\n\nAnser   Adams.     Insisting  that   those  notes   contained\r\n\nexculpatory  and  impeachment  material  and  were  otherwise\r\n\ndiscoverable under the Jencks Act, petitioners argue that the\r\n\ngovernment was  remiss in not  turning over all notes  of all\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nwitness interviews.  The district court justifiably concluded\r\n\notherwise. \r\n\n     The  Jencks Act  claim is entirely  unavailing.   As the\r\n\nnotes were never  adopted by the witness and  did not involve\r\n\ngrand  jury testimony, they  would fall within  the statute's\r\n\npurview  only  if  they provided  a  \"substantially verbatim\"\r\n\naccount of what had been said.  18 U.S.C.   3500(e)(2).

We perceive no  error; indeed, we rejected a related\r\n\nset of arguments on direct appeal.\r\n\n     In order  to calculate the  quantity of drugs  for which\r\n\neach  petitioner  was  responsible, so  as  to  determine the\r\n\napplicable base  offense level, the sentencing  court engaged\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1   Our rejection  of the Brady/Jencks  Act claims  on the\r               1                              \r\nmerits disposes of  the subsidiary IAC  claims.  The  further\r\nsuggestion in  this regard  that the  prosecution engaged  in\r\nintentional misconduct is totally without record support.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nin   a  two-step  process.    It  first  estimated  that  the\r\n\norganization as  a whole  had distributed  an average  of two\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine per week during its existence.   Relying\r\n\non the \"relevant  conduct\" provision in U.S.S.G.    1B1.3, it\r\n\nthen multiplied this figure by  the number of weeks that each\r\n\npetitioner  had been involved.  On direct appeal, petitioners\r\n\nchallenged  the  two-kilograms-per-week  estimate, contending\r\n\nthat it lacked evidentiary  support, see Whiting, 28 F.3d  at\r                                                            \r\n\n1303-05;  we disagreed, describing  the court's finding  as a\r\n\n\"conservative  estimate [that] left a fair margin of safety,\"\r\n\nid. at 1305.   Petitioners now argue that the court  erred by\r               \r\n\nattributing  that estimate  to  each  of  them  without  more\r\n\nparticularized   inquiries   into    what   quantities   were\r\n\nforeseeable and  were within  the scope  of their  respective\r\n\nagreements.\r\n\n     Petitioners' precise complaint is difficult to identify.\r\n\nTo the  extent they are alleging that the court automatically\r\n\nsaddled each of  them with the full amount  of drugs involved\r\n\nin the conspiracy  without further inquiry,  thereby applying\r\n\nan  erroneous  legal standard,  they  are  mistaken.   As  we\r\n\nexplained  in  the  earlier appeal,  petitioners  \"were  held\r\n\nresponsible  at  sentencing   for  'drugs  [they]  personally\r\n\nhandled  or  anticipated handling,  and,  under  the relevant\r\n\nconduct  rubric, for drugs  involved in additional  acts that\r                                                                         \r\n\nwere reasonably foreseeable  by [them] and were  committed in\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nfurtherance  of the conspiracy.'\"   Whiting, 28  F.3d at 1304\r                                                       \r\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting United States v.

The  statutory definition of  \"firearm\" required\r\n\nproof that the shotgun possessed two characteristics: that it\r\n\nhad a  barrel length of  less than  18 inches, or  an overall\r\n\nlength of less than 24 inches, and  that it could fire (or be\r\n\nrestored to fire) shotgun shells.

The record  indicates\r\notherwise.  They assert that the drug-quantity information on\r\nwhich the court relied was inherently unreliable; we rejected\r\nan identical claim on direct appeal.

Since  this\r\n\nallegation is presented in purely conclusory  form, dismissal\r\n\nwas appropriate.  See David,     F.3d at    , 1998 WL  at *6.\r                                       \r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nMoreover, even if this allegation were true, Dixon has failed\r\n\nto  explain,  and we  are  unable  to  perceive, how  he  was\r\n\nprejudiced.  The indictment charged (and the evidence showed)\r\n\nthat his distribution offense was committed in furtherance of\r\n\nthe conspiracy.   As a  result, a  guilty plea to  the former\r\n\nwould only have augmented the proof of his involvement in the\r\n\nlatter.  Nor would there  have been any discernible effect on\r\n\nDixon's  sentence;   the   considerable   evidence   of   his\r\n\nparticipation in the  conspiracy meant that,  even if he  had\r\n\nbeen acquitted on the conspiracy count,  the relevant-conduct\r\n\nprovision might well have yielded the same outcome.\r\n\n     3.
