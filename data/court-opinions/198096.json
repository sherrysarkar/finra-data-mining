Upon careful review of appellant's brief, we\r\nconclude that this appeal presents no substantial issue and is\r\nappropriate for summary disposition.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1. \r\nAccordingly, we sever this appeal (No. 98-1210) from the other\r\nappeals (Nos. 98-1211 and 98-1212) with which it previously was\r\nconsolidated.\r\nNotwithstanding defendant's inference of a retaliatory motive\r\nfor the district court's choice of a sentence in the middle of the\r\napplicable guideline range, this court has no jurisdiction to\r\nreview a sentence within the applicable range, if that range was\r\ncorrectly determined.  United States v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d\r\n256, 261 (1st Cir. 1992).  Here, the sentence was within the\r\napplicable range, as to which there is no dispute.  Therefore, we\r\nlack jurisdiction to consider this appeal.\r\nAppeal dismissed.\r\n\n                          -2-\n",
