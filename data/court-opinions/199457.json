Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     David Michaud on brief pro se.\n     Sean M. Perrin and Devine, Millimet & Branch on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                        June 14, 2001\n\f           Per   Curiam.   Pro    se    appellant,   David     Michaud,\n\nobjects to the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nagainst him in his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against two\n\npolice officers and their municipal employer.              After careful\n\nreview of the record, in particular the parties' summary\n\njudgment submissions, we conclude that his claims of error\n\nlack merit.   We affirm, essentially for the reasons given by\n\nthe district court in its Order dated October 31, 2000.               We\n\nmake only the following additional comment.\n\n           We see no need to determine whether the district\n\ncourt erroneously declined to consider certain claims on the\n\nground that they had been dismissed pursuant to a prior\n\norder by a magistrate judge.            As the record establishes,\n\nsummary judgment on these claims in favor of defendants\n\nwould have been warranted, in any event.               There was no\n\nfactual basis for the claim that defendants had violated\n\nMichaud's First Amendment rights when his then estranged\n\nwife, Linda Michaud, who was the custodial parent, sent him\n\naway from her father's residence without letting him visit\n\nhis children on June 13, 1996.            In an affidavit, Michaud\n\ninformed the district court that his visitation hours on the\n\nday   in   question   concluded    at    5   p.m.,   and    defendants'\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\faffidavits establish that he arrived at his father-in-law's\n\nhouse at approximately 5:20 p.m.              That is, the undisputed\n\nfacts establish that Michaud had no right to visit with his\n\nchildren at the time in question.\n\n            In addition, there was no factual basis for the\n\nclaim that defendants made false reports to an assistant\n\nstate attorney general, thereby obtaining, without probable\n\ncause, his authorization to wiretap Michaud's telephone\n\nconversation     with   his    wife   on     June   13,    1996.      During\n\ndiscovery, defendants gave sworn responses to Michaud's\n\ninterrogatories, stating unequivocally that they had never\n\nknowingly    made   false     reports   to    the   attorney       general's\n\noffice.     In   responding      to   defendants'         interrogatories,\n\nMichaud declined to even identify the defendants' alleged\n\nfalsehoods.      Accordingly, summary judgment in defendants'\n\nfavor was warranted.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
