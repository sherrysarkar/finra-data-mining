As Gilday failed to generate a\r\n\ntrialworthy issue with respect to any claim, we affirm the district\r\n\ncourt judgment.\r\n\n                                I\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND\r\n\n          After killing a Boston police officer during a 1970 bank\r\n\nrobbery in Brighton, Massachusetts, Gilday was convicted of first\r\n\ndegree murder and armed robbery, for which he is now serving\r\n\nconcurrent life sentences at the Bay State Correctional Center in\r\n\nNorfolk, Massachusetts. In 1974, Gilday commenced a civil rights\r\n\naction in federal district court against various FBI and DOC offi-\r\n\ncials, \r                see \r                    Gilday v. \r                              Webster, No. 74-4169-C, alleging interference\r\n\nwith attorney-client communications in violation of the Sixth and\r\n\nFourteenth Amendments, and violations of the federal and state\r\n\nwiretap statutes, 18 U.S.C.

Gilday alleged that federal and state officials\r\n\nwere opening his prison mail and intercepting his telephone\r\n\ncommunications in a coordinated effort to gather information\r\n\nregarding others involved in the Brighton bank robbery.\r\n\n          Approximately ten years later, Gilday and four DOC\r\n\nofficials entered into a stipulation (\"settlement stipulation\")\r\n\nwhich led to the following permanent injunction against the DOC and\r\n\nthe defendant DOC officials on September 12, 1984 (\"the    Gilday\r\n\ninjunction\"):\r\n\n                      PERMANENT INJUNCTION \r\n\n          Having reviewed and approved the Settle-\r\n          ment Stipulation dated September 10,\r\n          1984, and after hearing, it is hereby\r\n          ORDERED, DECREED AND ADJUDGED as follows:\r\n               1.

Boone, 657 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1981). \r\n\n     Gilday proceeded with the action against the nonsettling DOC\r\nofficials. \r\n\n                             3\r\r\n\n               and \r                            as \r                               they \r                                    have \r                                         been \r                                              construed\r\n               or \r                           may \r                               be \r                                  construed \r                                            in \r                                               reported\r\n               decisions that are binding  in\r\n               this Court  or  in  the  state\r\n               courts of Massachusetts.\r\n\n               2.   [mail restrictions]\r\n\n               3.   This \r                                  Permanent \r                                            Injunction,\r\n               entered pursuant to the settle-\r\n               ment stipulation dated Septem-\r\n               ber 10, 1984, shall operate\r\n               prospectively only; it   shall\r\n               not prejudice  the  rights  of\r\n               nonsettling defendants or,  of\r\n               its  own  force,  affect   the\r\n               rights of  inmates other  than\r\n               William Gilday.\r\n\n(Emphasis added.)\r\n\n          Over the next ten years, however, developments in\r\n\nelectronic technology, as well as inmate ingenuity, prompted\r\n\nincreased prison-telephone abuses, such as acquiring merchandise\r\n\nby fraud, promoting drug violations, soliciting murder, harassing\r\n\ncrime victims, witnesses, and public officials, facilitating escape\r\n\nplots, violating court restraining orders, and threatening domestic\r\n\nviolence. The DOC responded in 1993 by inviting telephone-system\r\n\nvendors to furnish, install, and maintain an advanced prison\r\n\ntelephone system designed to deter inmate abuses by monitoring,\r\n\nrecording, and \"detailing\" their calls. \r\n\n          Ultimately, NET contracted to produce, install, and\r\n\n     For example, one DOC inmate alone managed to mischarge 271 so-\r\ncalled \"third-party\" calls to a single business firm in one month.\r\nSee infra note 19.\r\n\n     Call \"detailing\" involves recording such billing-related\r\nmatters as the number called and the duration of the call.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nmaintain an inmate telephone system for all DOC facilities, which\r\n\nbecame known as the Massachusetts Inmate Telephone System (\"MITS\"),\r\n\nto supply both local and long distance service and remit to the DOC\r\n\nforty percent of the gross revenues from inmate calls. NET in turn\r\n\nsubcontracted with AT&amp;T to furnish long distance MITS service. A\r\n\nthird company, Telematic Corporation, contracted with AT&amp;T and NET\r\n\nto provide the electronic equipment and software needed to\r\n\nprovision the system.\r\n\n          On April 8, 1994, the DOC promulgated new inmate\r\n\ntelephone regulations, see 103 C.M.R. SS 482.00   et seq. (\"MITS\r\n\nRegulations\"), \"establish[ing] Department procedures regarding\r\n\naccess to, use of and the monitoring and/or recording of inmate\r\n\ntelephones.\" Id. S 482.01. Under the MITS Regulations, a personal\r\n\nidentification number (\"PIN\") is randomly assigned to each inmate.\r\n\nThe inmate must dial the assigned PIN immediately before dialing\r\n\nthe telephone number, whereupon an automatic operator completes the\r\n\nconnection. No more than fifteen designated parties are accessible\r\n\nwith any PIN: ten friends and family members and five attorneys.\r\n\nSee id. S 482.07(3)(c); Bender Aff. q 8. The right to call\r\n\ndesignated attorneys may not be suspended or curtailed except\r\n\nduring an institutional emergency,   see  id. SS 482.08-482.09,\r\n\nwhereas the right to call other designated parties is subject to\r\n\ndisciplinary restriction, see  id. SS 482.07(3)(h), 482.09. In\r\n\naddition, all inmates are allowed to call three prison legal-\r\n\nservice organizations. \r\n\n          Stickers on all MITS telephones alert inmates to the\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nmonitoring/recording regime. All inmate calls, except pre-\r\n\nauthorized attorney calls and legal-service organization calls, are\r\n\nautomatically recorded. Certain \"detailing\" information is\r\n\nrecorded on all calls either attempted or completed. Finally, all\r\n\nexcept attorney and legal-service organization calls may be\r\n\nsubjected to concurrent monitoring (\r                                             i.e., listened in on) by autho-\r\n\nrized DOC personnel, either at random or for investigative\r\n\npurposes.  See id. S 482.07(3)(d). \r\n\n          In order to obtain an individual PIN, the inmate must\r\n\ncomplete and sign a \"Number Request Form,\" designating the attorney\r\n\nand nonattorney telephone numbers which may be called. The form\r\n\nadvises inmates that their \"acceptance and use of a PIN and use of\r\n\ninmate telephones shall be deemed as consent to the conditions and\r\n\nrestrictions placed upon inmate telephone calls, including call\r\n\nmonitoring, recording, and call detail.\" All inmate calls must be\r\n\nplaced \"collect.\"  Id. S 482.07(3)(a). Each call begins with a\r\n\nrecorded message    audible by both parties    that the call has\r\n\nbeen placed \"collect\" by a DOC inmate and is subject to recordation\r\n\nand \"detailing.\" See \r                               id. S 482.07(3)(g); Kennedy Aff. q 10. Both\r\n\nparties hear the entire message, but there can be no communication\r\n\nuntil the collect call has been accepted by the person called. \r                                                                        See\r\n\n103 C.M.R. S 482.07(3)(f); Bender Aff. q 11. \r\n\n          Gilday declined to submit a PIN request form, on the\r\n\nground that the MITS contravenes the federal and state wiretap\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nstatutes and therefore violates the Gilday injunction. At about\r\n\nthe same time, Gilday mailed AT&amp;T and NET copies of the    Gilday\r\n\ninjunction entered September 12, 1984, \r                                                see \r                                                    supra pp. 3-4, advising\r\n\nthat their provision of MITS services would violate the injunction.\r\n\n          Shortly thereafter Gilday petitioned the federal district\r\n\ncourt for a contempt citation against AT&amp;T, NET, and various DOC\r\n\nofficials, claiming that the defendants were \"endeavoring to\r\n\nintercept\" his telephone communications. Although neither AT&amp;T nor\r\n\nNET was privy to the Gilday injunction, Gilday asserted that both\r\n\nreceived actual notice by mail,   supra pp. 6-7, and therefore\r\n\nknowingly aided and abetted the alleged violations by the DOC\r\n\ndefendants. Finally, Gilday alleged, the defendants were depriving\r\n\nhim of his \"federal right to be free of any interception of his\r\n\nwire communications,\" as well as his Sixth Amendment right to\r\n\ncounsel and his Fourteenth Amendment right of access to the courts,\r\n\nby restricting consultation with counsel regarding six pending\r\n\njudicial proceedings. \r\n\n          The district court entered summary judgment for the\r\n\ndefendants, on the ground that the Gilday injunction bans neither\r\n\nmonitoring nor recording, but only \"interceptions.\" It noted that\r\n\nno secretive, nonconsensual monitoring or recording     hence no\r\n\n     Consequently, for the most part Gilday has been without\r\ntelephone access since the MITS went into operation. Under a\r\nstipulation among the parties, however, he has been allowed limited\r\ntelephone use in order to communicate with counsel regarding his\r\nunrelated appeal in Gilday v. Callahan, 866 F.Supp. 611 (D. Mass.\r\n1994), \r                aff'd, 59 F.3d 257 (1st Cir. 1995), \r                                                   cert. \r                                                         denied, 116 S. Ct.\r\n1269 (1996).\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n\"interception\" \r                           had occurred under either wiretap statute, since\r\n\nall recording and monitoring is well advertised as required by the\r\n\nMITS Regulations.  See supra p. 6. The district court reasoned\r\n\nthat inmates render the MITS monitoring/recording regime consensual\r\n\nby executing the request form and utilizing the MITS. And since it\r\n\nfound the term \"interception\" ambiguous at best, the district court\r\n\ndetermined to resolve any interpretive doubts favorably to the\r\n\ndefendants. Finally, it dismissed the Gilday claims relating to\r\n\ncall \"detailing,\" on the ground that \r                                              Langton v. \r                                                         Hogan, 71 F.3d 930\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995), had already endorsed the MITS practice in this\r\n\nregard. Accordingly, it concluded that the attendant recording and\r\n\nmonitoring did not constitute an \"interception\" under either the\r\n\nfederal or state wiretap statute, thus did not contravene the\r\n\nGilday injunction.\r\n\n          Thereafter, the district court dismissed the section 1983\r\n\nclaims as well, on the ground that Gilday retained all mail\r\n\nprivileges, access to a prison law library, the right to meet with\r\n\ncounsel and, under the MITS regulations, the right to conduct\r\n\nunmonitored telephone communications with five attorneys and three\r\n\nlegal-service organizations. \r\n\n     The district court likewise determined that the defendant DOC\r\nofficials came within the \"law enforcement\" exceptions to the\r\nrespective wiretap statutes.    See 18 U.S.C. S 2510(5)(a)(ii)\r\n(excluding interceptions by an \"investigative or law enforcement\r\nofficer in the ordinary course of his duties\"); Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r\n272, S 99(D)(1)(c) (exempting federal law enforcement officials);\r\nsee also, e.g., United \r                                 States v.  Sababu, 891 F.2d 1308, 1328-29\r\n(7th Cir. 1989) (concluding that a prison monitoring regime,\r\nconducted as part of an \"institutionalized, ongoing policy[,]\" does\r\nnot constitute \"interception\").\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n                               II\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.

Thus, as the district court ruling on the petition for\r\n\nmodification in  Langton neither addressed nor implicated the\r\n\nquestion whether the MITS violates either the state or federal\r\n\nwiretap statute, see  Langton, No. 79-2167-Z, 1995 WL 96948, it\r\n\nneither \"actually\" nor \"necessarily\" determined that the MITS\r\n\nregime violated the  Langton injunction, let alone the     Gilday\r\n\ninjunction. See \r                          Grella, 42 F.3d at 30 (stating that \"the determi-\r\n\nnation of the issue must have been essential to the judgment\");\r\n\nsee also NLRB v.

Claim Preclusion\r\n\n          Gilday next contends that the 1984 consent decree\r\n\nprecludes the DOC defendants from claiming that the MITS does not\r\n\nviolate the Gilday injunction, because our decision in Langton v.\r\n\nHogan, 71 F.3d 930, 933-35 (1st Cir. 1995), involving a similar\r\n\n     Furthermore, a determination that the MITS violated the\r\nLangton injunction    with its materially different language and\r\ndiscrete purpose, see infra, pp. 12-25    could not constitute a\r\ndetermination that the \r                                Gilday injunction, with its less restrictive\r\nlanguage and scope, see infra p. 25, had been violated.\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\ninjunction, held that the DOC was precluded from contesting the\r\n\nmeaning of the same state and federal wiretap statutes there\r\n\ninvolved without first obtaining a court order modifying the\r\n\ninjunction. Once again we are unable to agree, as the     Langton\r\n\npanel decision is inapposite for several reasons. \r\n\n          First, although the parties to a consent decree are bound\r\n\nby traditional preclusion principles and may not litigate claims\r\n\nnecessarily resolved by the decree, see id. at 933-34, the Gilday\r\n\ninjunction    unlike the Langton injunction    expressly provided\r\n\nthat reported decisions authoritatively construing the relevant\r\n\nstate and federal wiretap statutes (hereinafter: \"authoritative\r\n\ndecisions\") were to control their future construction for all\r\n\npurposes material to the  Gilday injunction.   See supra pp. 3-4\r\n\n(\"All [DOC agents] are enjoined permanently . . . from . . .\r\n\nendeavoring to intercept . . . any wire communication by or to\r\n\n[Gilday] . . . except as specifically permitted by these statutes\r\n\n. . . \r               as \r                  they have been construed or \r                                              may \r                                                  be \r                                                     construed \r                                                               in [authori-\r\n\ntative decisions].\"). (Emphasis added.) Thus, the construction\r\n\nsuggested by Gilday would ignore language expressly limiting the\r\n\nscope of the \r                      Gilday injunction.

(quoting Armour \r                              &amp; \r                                 Co., 402 U.S. at 681) (internal citation\r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          On the other hand, in the present case the consent decree\r\n\nsecured Gilday a substantial independent benefit unavailable to the\r\n\nLangton plaintiffs. As the district court recognized, Gilday had\r\n\nalleged in his 1974 action against the DOC that he was the target\r\n\nof two secret federal and state law enforcement efforts, directed\r\n\nby the FBI and code-named \"STOP\" and \"GILROB,\" aimed at gathering\r\n\ninformation about his as-yet unapprehended accomplices in the\r\n\nBrighton bank robbery.   See supra p. 3. In securing the 1984\r\n\nconsent decree, therefore, Gilday obtained permanent injunctive\r\n\nrelief from any  DOC  participation in current or future wire-\r\n\ncommunication interceptions unlawfully directed against him by\r\n\nthese state and federal law enforcement agencies    consideration\r\n\nunavailable to the \r                            Langton litigants. Accordingly, notwithstanding\r\n\nthat the \r                  Gilday consent decree permitted the DOC to litigate future\r\n\nunresolved issues relating to the meaning of the applicable wiretap\r\n\nstatutes, Gilday obtained substantial consideration for entering\r\n\ninto the settlement with the DOC. Thus, the        Langton panel\r\n\nmajority's concerns over a lack of meaningful consideration for the\r\n\nLangton plaintiffs' consent are not implicated to the same degree\r\n\nin the present context. \r\n\n          Finally, the   Langton and    Gilday cases presented\r\n\nthemselves in materially different ways on appeal. The    Langton\r\n\npanel was asked to review,  inter alia, a district court ruling\r\n\ndenying a DOC petition to modify the Langton injunction.  See id.\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\nat 931. On appeal, the DOC claimed that the district court had\r\n\nbroadened the injunction impermissibly in favor of the    Langton\r\n\ninmates.  Id. at 933. The   Langton panel majority first decided\r\n\nthat the parties had relinquished their respective rights to\r\n\nlitigate the meaning of the wiretap statutes underlying the\r\n\ninjunction, and then determined that no authoritative decision,\r\n\nexisting at the time the Langton injunction issued, specifically\r\n\nsupported the challenged MITS monitoring and recording practices.\r\n\n          Finally, the   Langton majority went on to survey\r\n\nsubsequent decisional law, simply noting    without resolving the\r\n\nmerits    that \"reasonable [competing] arguments can be advanced\"\r\n\nas to whether the challenged MITS monitoring and recording regime\r\n\nviolated the federal wiretap statute. Id. at 935-37; see \r                                                                   also \r                                                                        id.\r\n\nat 940 (\"Nor does the panel majority hold that the present regime\r\n\nis unlawful under the federal and state statutes but only that\r\n\nreasonable arguments can be made on both sides.\") (Boudin, J.,\r\n\ndissenting) (emphasis in original). Thus, the   Langton majority\r\n\nsimply decided that the DOC had failed to carry its burden of\r\n\ndemonstrating any change in the law, or the facts, which would\r\n\nwarrant modification of the injunction.      See  id. at 937-38\r\n\n(sustaining modification ruling as \"appropriately tailored to the\r\n\nonly changes in law or in fact disclosed on the record before the\r\n\ndistrict court\"). \r\n\n          In the present case, on the other hand, Gilday alleges\r\n\nDOC violations of an injunction which expressly contemplates that\r\n\nauthoritative decisions subsequent to the  Gilday injunction may\r\n\n                               15\r\r\n\ndetermine whether a violation has occurred.  See supra pp. 12-13.\r\n\nMoreover, since the \r                             Langton panel majority never reached the merits\r\n\nregarding the lawfulness of the MITS regime under either wiretap\r\n\nstatute, see  supra p. 15, we may consider afresh whether the\r\n\nchallenged MITS practices violate the \r                                               Gilday injunction. Finally,\r\n\nwe are required to review the district court's summary judgment\r\n\nruling against Gilday \r                               de \r                                  novo.  See \r                                            Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 874-75. \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the DOC is\r\n\nentitled to litigate the meaning of the applicable wiretap\r\n\nstatutes. \r\n\n     3.   The Gilday Injunction\r\n\n          Gilday argues that the DOC defendants violated the \r                                                                     Gilday\r\n\ninjunction by endeavoring to monitor and record his wire communica-\r\n\ntions in violation of the state and federal wiretap statutes. The\r\n\nlinchpin in this argument is that no authoritative decision\r\n\n\"specifically\" construes either the federal or state wiretap\r\n\nstatute to \"permit\" the inmate-telephone system established under\r\n\nthe MITS. In other words, Gilday argues that the injunction is\r\n\nviolated absent an authoritative decision validating either the\r\n\nMITS regime itself or substantially similar practices in a\r\n\ncomparable prison context. At its most particular level, this\r\n\ncontention would necessitate an authoritative decision declaring\r\n\nthe challenged MITS practices compatible with the applicable\r\n\nwiretap statutes.\r\n\n          We test this contention against the language employed in\r\n\nthe Gilday injunction, viewed in its unique litigation context,\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nincluding the particular circumstances surrounding its formation\r\n\nand the basic purposes it was designed to serve.

See infra pp. 25-27, 29-30. Therefore, Gilday's\r\n\ninsistent contention on appeal \r                                           that \r                                               no MITS practice can ever be\r\n\nallowed under the     Gilday injunction unless it has been\r\n\n\"specifically permitted\" beforehand by an authoritative decision \r                                                                           \r\n\ncannot succeed.\r\n\n          Moreover, even assuming Gilday were to demonstrate an\r\n\n\"interception,\" the injunction expressly excepts from its reach any\r\n\npractice \"specifically permitted\" under the wiretap statutes as\r\n\nconstrued in authoritative decisions, see supra pp. 3-4, and the\r\n\n                               17\r\r\n\nterm \"specifically permitted\" is susceptible to various reasonable\r\n\ninterpretations.  On the one hand, \"specifically permitted\" may be\r\n\nread to require an authoritative decision that the MITS regime, \r                                                                         as\r\n\napplied directly to Gilday, comports with the applicable wiretap\r\n\nstatutes.

Under such a reading, an authoritative\r\n\ndecision would be unavailing to the DOC defendants unless it\r\n\nexplicitly addressed the MITS monitoring and recording of wire\r\n\ncommunications involving Gilday.

Thus, the Langton panel majority reasoned that the consent\r\n\ndecree was to be construed as requiring the DOC defendants to\r\n\nrefrain, \r                  in \r                     perpetuity, \r                                 from \r                                      contesting \r                                                the \r                                                    meaning \r                                                            of \r                                                               the \r                                                                   relevant\r\n\nstate and  federal wiretap  statutes \"as construed in reported\r\n\ndecisions that [were] binding in [the federal district court] or in\r\n\nthe state courts of Massachusetts\"    at  the  time  the  Langton\r\n\ninjunction was entered, see id. at 931, 933-35, as distinguished\r\n\nfrom merely requiring the DOC defendants to refrain from unlawful\r\n\ninterceptions. As the  Langton panel majority viewed the matter,\r\n\nany other approach threatened to render the terms of the  Langton\r\n\ninjunction \"illusory    stating nothing beyond what was already\r\n\nforbidden by law \r                          before \r                                 the \r                                     Permanent \r                                              Injunction \r                                                         was \r                                                             entered.\"  Id.\r\n\nat 933 (emphasis added); but see id. at 940 (Boudin, J., dissent-\r\n\n                               22\r\r\n\ning); see also supra pp. 13-14.\r\n\n          The panel majority relied as well on the final section in\r\n\nthe \r             Langton injunction, which stated in terms similar to the \r                                                                     Gilday\r\n\ninjunction, see supra p. 4, that the injunction \"shall not of its\r\n\nown force affect the rights of inmates of the Department other than\r\n\nWilliam Langton and David LeBlanc.\"  See Langton, 71 F.3d at 933.\r\n\nIt reasoned that had the DOC promised merely to obey the law, no\r\n\npurpose would have been served by the quoted provision.  See id.\r\n\n          Once again, however, the two cases presented themselves\r\n\non appeal in materially different postures. First, as discussed\r\n\nsupra pp. 14-16, the repeated observation by the   Langton panel\r\n\nmajority, see Langton, 71 F.3d at 933-37    that no then-existing\r\n\nauthoritative decision specifically permitted the challenged MITS\r\n\npractices and that the \r                                Langton decree would be rendered meaningless\r\n\nwere it to be construed as a mere promise to obey the law     is\r\n\ninapposite to the instant context. That is, central to the present\r\n\nanalysis is the explicit language in the \r                                                 Gilday injunction (\"or \r                                                                        may\r\n\nbe construed in reported decisions\"),  see  supra p. 4 (emphasis\r\n\nadded)    nowhere to be found in the  Langton injunction, see 71\r\n\nF.3d at 931    which in no sense purports to prohibit either (i)\r\n\nthese parties from litigating open questions as to the meaning of\r\n\nthe applicable wiretap statutes, or (ii) our consideration of later\r\n\nauthoritative decisions upholding monitoring and recording\r\n\npractices of the kind prescribed by the MITS, \r                                                       see \r                                                           infra pp. 45-48.\r\n\nSecond, since the settlement stipulation and the consent decree in\r\n\nGilday were entered into while the parties in Langton were still\r\n\n                               23\r\r\n\nlitigating the initial action which led to the \r                                                        Langton injunction,\r\n\nparagraph 3 in the   Gilday injunction ( viz., \"[t]his Permanent\r\n\nInjunction . . . shall not . . . affect the rights of inmates other\r\n\nthan William Gilday[,]\") served the discrete purpose of not\r\n\ndisturbing the rights of the Langton inmates whose initial action\r\n\nagainst the DOC was to remain in litigation for two months after\r\n\nthe consent decree was entered in Gilday.\r\n\n          Accordingly, unlike the corresponding provision in the\r\n\nLangton injunction, paragraph 3 in the     Gilday injunction is\r\n\nentirely consistent with the view that the \r                                                   Gilday injunction simply\r\n\ncontemplates that the DOC not violate the applicable wiretap\r\n\nstatutes. For these reasons we conclude, notwithstanding their\r\n\nsimilarities, that the  Gilday injunction is substantially less\r\n\nrestrictive in scope than the   Langton injunction, in that it\r\n\nunambiguously enjoins only   unlawful recording and monitoring\r\n\npractices by the DOC.\r\n\n      The \r                   Gilday injunction was entered on September 12, 1984; the\r\nLangton injunction, on November 16, 1984.\r\n\n      It is noteworthy as well that the complaint in the action\r\nwhich gave rise to the Gilday injunction alleged that Gilday \"has\r\nnever consented, nor upon information and belief has any person\r\nwith whom he communicated consented, that wire communications to or\r\nfrom him be intercepted or monitored in any way.\" Second Amended\r\nComplaint, Gilday v. Webster, \r                                        et \r                                           al., No. 74-4169-C. The Gilday\r\ncomplaint in the present action indicates that his concern in the\r\nformer action was not with   all interceptions of his telephone\r\ncalls, however, but only with interceptions unlawful under the\r\napplicable wiretap statutes because allegedly conducted without the\r\nrequisite consent. Thus, the more narrow concern reflected in the\r\npresent complaint comports with the view that the Gilday settlement\r\nstipulation and consent decree were meant to ban only    unlawful\r\ninterceptions. \r\n\n                               24\r\r\n\n          A.   The Massachusetts Wiretap Act\r\n\n          We must now consider whether Gilday demonstrated by\r\n\n\"clear and convincing evidence,\" Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16, that the\r\n\nchallenged MITS practices constitute unlawful interceptions under\r\n\nthe applicable wiretap statutes, beginning with the Massachusetts\r\n\nWiretap Act, bearing in mind that it was for Gilday to show that\r\n\nthe DOC defendants \"violated a clear and unambiguous order that\r\n\nleft no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was to be expected\"\r\n\nand that the defendants were \"'able to ascertain from the four\r\n\ncorners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.'\"  Id. at\r\n\n17 (quoting Drywall \r                              Tapers, 889 F.2d at 395). First, we inquire\r\n\nwhether the monitoring, recording, and call \"detailing\" practices\r\n\nprescribed by the MITS Regulations are \"interceptions\" under the\r\n\nMassachusetts Wiretap Act, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, S 99(B)(4).\r\n\nSecond, should Gilday successfully surmount the first hurdle, we\r\n\ndetermine whether any such interpretation is nevertheless permitted\r\n\nunder any authoritative decision binding on the federal district\r\n\ncourt. Finally, we conclude that Gilday failed to prove either\r\n\nthat the monitoring and recording practices conducted pursuant to\r\n\nthe MITS constitute \"interceptions\" under the Massachusetts Wiretap\r\n\nAct, or that the MITS call \"detailing\" practices were clearly\r\n\nprohibited under the Gilday injunction.\r\n\n          1.   Monitoring and Recording\r\n\n          We begin by noting that the Gilday injunction prohibits\r\n\nonly \"interceptions\" under the applicable statutes and not call\r\n\nmonitoring, recording, or \"detailing\" \r                                               per \r                                                   se. The term \"intercep-\r\n\n                               25\r\r\n\ntion,\" as used in the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, \"means to \r                                                                   secretly\r\n\nhear, \r               secretly record, or aid another to \r                                                  secretly hear or \r                                                                   secretly\r\n\nrecord, the contents of any wire or oral communication through the\r\n\nuse of any intercepting device . . . .\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, S\r\n\n99(B)(4) (emphasis added).\r\n\n          The Massachusetts courts have interpreted this \"secrecy\"\r\n\nrequirement literally.  See  Commonwealth v. Jackson, 349 N.E.2d\r\n\n337, 339-40 (Mass. 1976) (holding that secrecy is essential to\r\n\nestablishing a violation of Massachusetts Wiretap Act); see  also\r\n\nDistrict Attorney v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 399 N.E.2d 866,\r\n\n869 (Mass. 1980) (stating that \r                                       secret recordation of incoming calls\r\n\nviolates Massachusetts Wiretap Act). A secretive interception\r\n\noccurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act unless both parties to\r\n\na wire \"communication\" had \"actual knowledge\" of the\r\n\n\"interception,\" \r                         see, \r                              e.g., \r                                    Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 340, which may be\r\n\nestablished by evidence that the parties were informed that their\r\n\nconversation was being intercepted, or by \"clear and unequivocal\r\n\nobjective manifestations of knowledge . . . sufficiently probative\r\n\nof a person's state of mind as to allow an inference of knowledge.\"\r\n\nId.\r\n\n          As the district court correctly concluded, the recording\r\n\nand monitoring practices at issue here were in no sense\r\n\nsurreptitious. Inmates are informed in advance, both by the MITS\r\n\nRegulations \r                        a matter of public record \r                                                     and the individualized\r\n\nPIN Request Form advisory as well, that their MITS calls will be\r\n\nmonitored and recorded. Moreover, inmates are reminded by stickers\r\n\n                               26\r\r\n\naffixed to each phone that all non-attorney calls are subject to\r\n\nthe monitoring and recording practices prescribed by the MITS\r\n\nRegulations. Finally, a prerecorded message informs  both parties\r\n\n   before the parties can communicate    that all call \"contents\"\r\n\nwill be recorded.\r\n\n          Against this backdrop, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\r\n\nCourt (\"SJC\") has decided that even inmates who \"have not consented\r\n\nto the [MITS] monitoring and recording\"       such as Gilday     \r\n\nnonetheless have been \"made aware of the procedure and its require-\r\n\nments.\"  Cacicio v. Secretary of Public Safety, 665 N.E.2d 85, 91\r\n\n(Mass. 1996) (rejecting constitutional challenge to MITS\r\n\nRegulations). Therefore, the SJC held, \"[t]he [MITS] monitoring\r\n\nand recording is not surreptitious in any sense.\"  Id.\r\n\n          Accordingly, we now hold that whatever recording and\r\n\nmonitoring of oral communications takes place under the MITS regime\r\n\ndoes not constitute an \"interception\" under the Massachusetts\r\n\nWiretap Act, as it is not secretly conducted.   See Jackson, 349\r\n\nN.E.2d at 339 (non-secret recordings not \"interceptions\" under\r\n\nMassachusetts Wiretap Act). \r\n\n          2.   Call \"Detailing\"\r\n\n          The Massachusetts Wiretap Act defines the term\r\n\n\"interception\" as a secret acquisition of \"the contents of any wire\r\n\n      The SJC did not differentiate between recording of contents\r\nand recording of billing-related features (  i.e., \"detailing\").\r\nInstead, \r                  Cacicio simply described the prerecorded message as notice\r\nto the inmate and the person called that the call would be recorded\r\nin its entirety.  See Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 88.\r\n\n                               27\r\r\n\nor oral communication \r                               through \r                                       the \r                                           use \r                                               of \r                                                  any \r                                                      intercepting \r                                                                   device .\r\n\n. . .\" Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, S 99(B)(4) (emphasis added).\r\n\nElsewhere the statute explicitly excepts certain telephone\r\n\nequipment from its definition of \"intercepting device\":\r\n\n          The term \"intercepting device\" means any\r\n          device or apparatus which is capable of . . .\r\n          recording a wire or oral communication . . .\r\n          other than any telephone or telegraph\r\n          instrument, equipment, facility, or a\r\n          component thereof . . . being used by a\r\n          communications common carrier in the ordinary\r\n          course of its business.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 272, S 99(B)(3)(b). Thus, no \"interception\"\r\n\noccurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act if the device used to\r\n\nacquire the contents of a wire communication comes within the ambit\r\n\nof the \"telephone equipment\" exception.  \r\n\n          The MITS employs a sophisticated network of computers and\r\n\nassociated telephone equipment, including \"controller boards\"    \r\n\nelectronic call processing devices attached to each prison\r\n\ntelephone \r                      supplied, installed, and maintained by NET.  The NET\r\n\nequipment automatically screens approved outside telephone numbers\r\n\nfrom unapproved numbers, routes inmate calls to approved telephone\r\n\nnumbers outside the prison, plays the prerecorded message to both\r\n\nparties, and identifies calls placed to listed attorneys so as to\r\n\n      The SJC has held that a device which records information\r\nrelating to the identity of the parties to a call or the existence\r\nof a wire communication, records the \"contents of [a] wire . . .\r\ncommunication.\"   District  \r                                     Attorney  \r                                               for  \r                                                    Plymouth  \r                                                             Dist. v.   New\r\nEngland \r                  Tel. \r                       &amp; \r                         Tel. \r                              Co., 399 N.E.2d 866 (Mass. 1980), discussed\r\ninfra pp. 33-35.\r\n\n      NET procures the telephone equipment from AT&amp;T and Telematic\r\nCorporation under various subcontracts.\r\n\n                               28\r\r\n\npreclude their monitoring and recordation. All call \"detail\" is\r\n\nrecorded automatically by the NET telephone equipment in order to\r\n\ngenerate billing reports and safeguard the NET equipment against\r\n\nfraudulent use by inmates (  i.e.,  inter alia, unapproved long\r\n\ndistance and collect calls).\r\n\n          The monthly revenue statements NET provides under its\r\n\ncontract with the DOC reflect \"detail\" on all inmate calls placed,\r\n\nincluding the number dialed, the length of the call, and other\r\n\nbilling-related and revenue-related information. In addition, the\r\n\nNET site administrator at each prison facility regularly generates\r\n\na so-called \"Fraud Report,\" listing all outside telephone numbers\r\n\nto which the total number of calls placed by inmates within the\r\n\nreporting period exceeded a specified level. The Fraud Report is\r\n\nforwarded to NET and the DOC for use in investigating fraudulent\r\n\ntelephone usage.\r\n\n      The MITS is similar to the telephone systems utilized by the\r\nBureau of Prisons, as well as in certain state prisons such as New\r\nYork and Tennessee.   See Bender Aff. q 6. However, the MITS\r\nutilizes devices far more sophisticated than the \"in-house\" devices\r\ngenerally considered by this court or the Massachusetts courts.\r\nSee, \r              e.g., \r                    Williams v. \r                                Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 275-76 (1st Cir. 1993)\r\n(involving \"custom made\" system consisting of \"small alligator\r\nclips\" and a VCR attached to a microphone cable);  Griggs-Ryan v.\r\nSmith, 904 F.2d 112, 114 (1st Cir. 1990) (involving recording\r\ndevice attached by landlady to extension telephone); Jackson, 349\r\nN.E.2d at 338 (involving cassette recorder microphone attached to\r\nearpiece in telephone receiver).\r\n\n      Among the abuses the MITS is designed to stop are so-called\r\n\"third-party\" calls placed by inmates to large outside\r\nestablishments through which the inmate can request another \r                                                                    outside\r\nline, then place a long-distance call at the expense of the\r\nestablishment whose number the inmate called in the first instance.\r\nSee, e.g., supra note 4.\r\n\n                               29\r\r\n\n          Within the above-described evidentiary framework, we now\r\n\ninquire whether the MITS call \"detailing\" conducted by NET is\r\n\nexcepted from the Massachusetts Wiretap Act definition of\r\n\n\"intercepting device\" in S 99(B)(3)(b).    See  supra pp. 28-29.\r\n\nFirst, we note that NET is a \"communication common carrier\" within\r\n\nthe contemplation of S 99(B)(3).

Coffey, 434 N.E.2d 1276, 1280 (Mass. 1982).\r\n\nSecond, Gilday does not contend that the processor computers and\r\n\ncontroller boards used by NET for billing-related purposes are not\r\n\n\"equipment . . . being used in the ordinary course of [NET's]\r\n\nbusiness.\"  See Reply Brief for the Plaintiff, Appellant at 6 n.8\r\n\n(\"Gilday does not argue that NET is precluded from using call\r\n\ndetail for billing purposes.\"). Nor does any authoritative\r\n\ndecision suggest that a communication common carrier which\r\n\n\"details\" calls in order to generate billing reports or protect its\r\n\nequipment from fraudulent abuse, does not do so in the ordinary\r\n\ncourse of its business.  Thus, Gilday has not demonstrated by\r\n\n\"clear and convincing\" evidence, \r                                          see \r                                              Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16, that any\r\n\n      We have construed the Federal Wiretap Act, which the\r\nMassachusetts statute tracked, see  Commonwealth v. Vitello, 327\r\nN.E.2d 819, 836 (1975), as conferring a \"statutory right\" upon a\r\ncommunication common carrier to intercept wire communications in\r\norder to protect its rights and property interests. United States\r\nv. \r            Pervaz, --- F.3d ---, ---, 1997 WL 336208, *5 (1st Cir.) (R.I.)\r\n(construing 18 U.S.C. S 2511(2)(a)(i), which permits an employee of\r\na wire communication services provider whose facilities are used in\r\ntransmission of wire or electronic communication, \"to intercept,\r\ndisclose, or use that communication in the normal course of his\r\nemployment while engaged in any activity which is a necessary\r\nincident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of\r\nthe rights or property of the provider of that service\").\r\n\n                               30\r\r\n\ncall \"detailing\" conducted by NET for its own billing-related\r\n\npurposes falls outside the S 99(B)(3)(b) exception for equipment\r\n\nused by it \"in the ordinary course of its business.\" Accordingly,\r\n\nno \"interception\" occurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, at\r\n\nleast by reason of the billing-related \"detailing\" conducted by\r\n\nNET.  \r\n\n          Gilday nonetheless insists, however, that the injunction\r\n\nprecludes the DOC  defendants from acquiring access to any call\r\n\n\"detail\" information and that NET therefore may not aid and abet\r\n\nthe DOC by affording access.     See Reply Brief for Plaintiff,\r\n\nAppellant at 6 n.8. Under the Regulations and the MITS \"Procedural\r\n\nStatement\" \r                       a DOC operations guideline which supplements the MITS\r\n\nRegulations \r                        authorized DOC officers may request both \"standard\"\r\n\nand \"custom\" call \"detail\" reports from NET personnel         for\r\n\ninvestigative  \r                        purposes, or, after receiving training from NET\r\n\npersonnel, print out such call \"detail\" reports themselves.\r\n\nMoreover, these \"standard\" reports may, at the DOC's option, be\r\n\nconfigured to provide call \"detail\" relating to an individual\r\n\ninmate's PIN, a particular group of inmate PINs, specific prison\r\n\ntelephones used to place calls, or particular telephone numbers\r\n\ndialed. Finally, since the record discloses no limitation on the\r\n\ndomain reserved for the so-called \"custom\" reports, we assume, at\r\n\n      Although the record is unclear as to what, if any, role AT&amp;T\r\n   as NET's subcontractor     performs in call \"detailing,\" our\r\nanalysis of the NET role in call \"detailing,\"   supra pp. 27-30,\r\nappears equally applicable to AT&amp;T, which is a communication common\r\ncarrier as well.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, S 99(B)(3)(b).\r\n\n                               31\r\r\n\nthe summary judgment stage, \r                                     see \r                                         Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 874-75, that\r\n\nNET is obligated to provide the DOC with any and all call \"detail\"\r\n\nrequested. Notwithstanding its advantageous summary judgment\r\n\nposture, however, the Gilday call \"detailing\" claim fails in\r\n\nrelation to the DOC defendants as well. \r\n\n          Gilday claims that the DOC violates the injunctive ban\r\n\nagainst \"intercepting\" or \"endeavoring to intercept\" his wire\r\n\ncommunications, see supra pp. 3-4, simply by applying the MITS\r\n\nrequirements to him; in particular, by making     his consent a\r\n\nprerequisite to utilizing the MITS. The claim is premised on\r\n\nseveral rationales: first, the MITS requirements cannot be applied\r\n\nto \r            him, since the \r                           Gilday injunction bans all \"interceptions\" of his\r\n\ncalls, absent a relevant court order, legislative authorization, or\r\n\nauthoritative decision specifically permitting the challenged MITS\r\n\npractices in their prison context; second, since    he has never\r\n\nconsented to the MITS regime, DOC call \"detailing\" cannot meet the\r\n\n\"two party consent exception\" under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, S\r\n\n99(B)(4), even assuming consent by the party called;  and third,\r\n\neven assuming he were found to have given implicit consent by\r\n\nutilizing the MITS, the injunctive ban on \"interceptions\" is\r\n\ninfringed by DOC call \"detailing,\" because it secretly records the\r\n\noutside number dialed by the inmate before the other party can\r\n\n      Section 99(B)(4) provides, in pertinent part, that the \"term\r\ninterception means to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid\r\nanother to secretly hear or secretly record the contents of any\r\nwire or oral communication . . . by any person other than a person\r\ngiven prior authority by all parties to such communication.\" Mass.\r\nGen. L. ch. 272, S 99(B)(4).\r\n\n                               32\r\r\n\nconsent; for example, should the outside phone not be answered.\r\n\nAll these contentions likewise fail.\r\n\n          As with monitoring and recording, see supra pp. 25-27,\r\n\nvirtually all call \"detailing\" conducted under the MITS regime is\r\n\nthoroughly advertised. In addition to the MITS Regulations, the\r\n\n\"Number Request Form\" itself discloses that all inmate calls are\r\n\nsubject to call \"detailing.\" Moreover, the recorded message heard\r\n\nboth by the inmate and the call recipient advises that their entire\r\n\nconversation and all \"call detail\" will be recorded. Thus,\r\n\nwhatever \"detailing\" occurs \r                                     after the call recipient is so advised\r\n\nby the recorded message comports with the Massachusetts Wiretap\r\n\nAct, as both parties have been fully informed in advance that their\r\n\nentire oral communication, as well as all \"call detail,\" will be\r\n\nrecorded.  See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 339 (non-secret recordings\r\n\nnot \"interceptions\" under Massachusetts Wiretap Act). \r\n\n          At summary judgment, however, Gilday proffered unrebutted\r\n\nevidence that the outside number dialed by the inmate is recorded\r\n\nbefore the call is answered; in other words, before the prerecorded\r\n\nmessage announcing the MITS monitoring/recording regime has been\r\n\nheard by the party who answers the call. Thus, the number called\r\n\nby the inmate will have been subjected to call \"detailing,\" whether\r\n\nor not the party called answers the phone or withholds \"consent\" to\r\n\nthe MITS recording and call \"detailing\" procedure subsequently\r\n\nannounced in the prerecorded message.  Gilday therefore contends\r\n\n      On appeal, AT&amp;T vigorously disputes that any such \"secret\"\r\ncall detailing occurs in these circumstances. Nevertheless, none\r\n\n                               33\r\r\n\nthat defendants violate the injunction by \"endeavoring\" to record\r\n\ncall \"detail\" during the \r                                  interim between the dialing of the outside\r\n\nnumber by the inmate and before the call can be answered and\r\n\naccepted    what we shall refer to as \"interim call detailing.\"\r\n\n          Gilday relies heavily on a line of SJC decisions,  see,\r\n\ne.g., District \r                         Attorney \r                                  for \r                                      Plymouth \r                                               Dist. v. New \r                                                            England \r                                                                    Tel. \r                                                                          &amp;\r\n\nTel.  \r               Co., 399 N.E.2d 866 (Mass. 1980), treating with \"pen\r\n\nregisters\" and \"call traps,\" telephone equipment consisting of\r\n\nelectronic devices which surreptitiously record, respectively, the\r\n\nnumber called or the number from which an incoming call was placed.\r\n\nThese authoritative decisions hold that such electronic devices do\r\n\nrecord call \"contents,\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts\r\n\nWiretap Act, since they acquire \"'information concerning the\r\n\nidentity of the parties to such communication or the existence . .\r\n\n. of that communication.'\"  Id. at 869 (quoting Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r\n\n272, S 99(B)(5)). Thus, \"[e]ven if the call is not completed, the\r\n\ncaller has initiated a wire communication . . . which is intended\r\n\nto cause . . . [the call recipient's] telephone to ring and the\r\n\nexistence of that communication is recorded by an intercepting\r\n\nof the defendants challenged Gilday's proffer in their opposition\r\nto summary judgment, as required by Mass. D. Ct. Local Rule 56: \r\n\n          Material facts of record set forth in the\r\n          statement required to be served by the moving\r\n          party will be deemed for purposes of the\r\n          motion to be admitted by opposing parties\r\n          unless controverted by the statement required\r\n          to be served by opposing parties.\r\n\nConsequently, we credit Gilday's assertion for summary judgment\r\npurposes.  See Carreiro v. Rhodes Gill &amp; Co., Ltd., 68 F.3d 1443,\r\n1446 &amp; n.3 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n                               34\r\r\n\ndevice.\" Id. Be this as it may, however, it gains Gilday nothing.\r\n\n          First of all, it is important to note that the SJC's\r\n\ndefinition of \"wire communication,\" \r                                             see \r                                                id., would not encompass an\r\n\nattempt by an inmate to call a number not on the preapproved MITS\r\n\nlist, since the MITS regime automatically prevents such calls from\r\n\ngetting past its \"host processors,\" the computers which control the\r\n\noutflow of inmate calls from the prison. Consequently, inmate\r\n\nattempts to dial numbers not approved under the MITS regime cannot\r\n\ncause an outside telephone to ring, because the call cannot be\r\n\nconnected to the point of reception. Accordingly, there can have\r\n\nbeen no \"wire communication,\" which is defined as \"any\r\n\ncommunication . . . by the aid of wire, cable or other like\r\n\nconnection \r                    between \r                            the \r                                point \r                                      of \r                                         origin \r                                               and \r                                                   the \r                                                       point \r                                                             of \r                                                                reception.\"\r\n\nMass.

Instead, since there can be no\r\n\nsecretive acquisition of information already provided to the DOC,\r\n\nsee \r             supra pp. 25-27 (noting that \"secretive\" interceptions presume\r\n\nlack of knowledge), Gilday simply assumes, sub silentio, that any\r\n\nputative number(s) and person(s) he might call would not already\r\n\n      In another case, the SJC declined to address a claim that the\r\nMITS violates the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, as it had not been\r\nraised below.  See Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 89 n.9. \r\n\n                               36\r\r\n\nhave been known to the DOC before the call was placed. Absent\r\n\nevidence on this critical point, however, there can have been no\r\n\nprima  facie showing that any surreptitious or secretive\r\n\n\"interception\" would occur, let alone did occur, within the meaning\r\n\nof the Massachusetts Wiretap Act.  See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 340\r\n\n(holding that a secretive \"interception\" has occurred unless both\r\n\nparties to the call had \"actual knowledge\" of the intrusion). In\r\n\nall events, as noted above, see  supra pp. 34-35, were Gilday to\r\n\ncontinue to withhold consent but attempt to place a call      or\r\n\nconsent, yet attempt to call a number not previously approved by\r\n\nthe DOC \r                    the MITS computers would screen out the attempted call.\r\n\nThus, under Massachusetts law, no \"wire communication\" could occur.\r\n\nSee Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, S 99(B)(1) (defining \"wire\r\n\ncommunication\" as any \"connection between the point of origin and\r\n\nthe point  of reception\") (emphasis added);   see  also  District\r\n\nAttorney \r                   for \r                       Plymouth \r                                Dist. v.

Thus, the present attempt to hypothesize an\r\nabstract interim call \"detailing\" violation raises no justiciable\r\ncase or controversy, as the injunction simply prohibits the DOC\r\nfrom intercepting or endeavoring to intercept any wire\r\ncommunication by Gilday.

State\r\nEnergy \r                 Resources \r                           Conservation \r                                        and \r                                            Dev. \r                                                 Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 203\r\n(1983) (declining on Article III ripeness grounds to consider\r\nconstitutionality of California law allowing State to block\r\n\n                               37\r\r\n\n          In conclusion, any attempt to dial a number not\r\n\npreviously disclosed by an inmate on the Number Request Form: (i)\r\n\nresults in no \"wire communication\" to the person called, as it\r\n\ncannot proceed beyond the prison,  see supra p. 34-35; and (ii)\r\n\nvoluntarily discloses to the DOC the number called, without any\r\n\n\"wire communication\" having taken place. Thus, interim call\r\n\n\"detailing\" under the MITS regime is neither \"secretive\" within the\r\n\nmeaning of the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, nor an \"interception\"\r\n\nwithin the scope of the   Gilday injunction. Accordingly, the\r\n\ndistrict court supportably determined that the challenged MITS\r\n\npractices did not violate the Massachusetts-law component in the\r\n\nGilday injunction.\r\n\n          Moreover, there is no basis for the conclusory contention\r\n\nthat the  Gilday injunction is violated simply by the MITS\r\n\nregulatory requirement that he, like any other inmate, consent to\r\n\nthe MITS regime, including call \"detailing,\" as a prerequisite to\r\n\nutilizing the MITS       hence, that the consent requirement\r\n\nconstitutes a coercive    endeavor to intercept Gilday's wire\r\n\ncommunications in violation of the injunction.  See supra pp. 31-\r\n\n32. First, its unstated premise that Gilday is entitled to utilize\r\n\nprison phones even though he withholds consent is groundless. As\r\n\na prison inmate, Gilday can identify no federal or state right   \r\n\nconstruction of nuclear power plants lacking adequate storage\r\ncapacity for spent nuclear fuel, because the Court \"cannot know\" if\r\nState \"will ever find a nuclear plant's storage capacity to be\r\ninadequate\");  Lincoln House, Inc. v. Dupre, 903 F.2d 845, 847-48\r\n(1st Cir. 1990) (refusing on Article III ripeness grounds to\r\naddress claim based on abstract injury \"that may not occur as\r\nanticipated or may not occur at all\").\r\n\n                               38\r\r\n\nconstitutional or otherwise \r                                        to utilize a prison phone on his own\r\n\nterms. See, \r                      e.g., \r                            Washington v. \r                                          Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1100 (6th Cir.\r\n\n1994) (stating that \"a prisoner's right to telephone access is\r\n\n'subject to rational limitations in the face of legitimate security\r\n\ninterests of the penal institution'\") (quoting Strandberg v. City\r\n\nof Helena, 791 F.2d 741, 747 (9th Cir. 1986))); see also Feely v.\r\n\nSampson, 570 F.2d 364, 374 (1st Cir. 1978) (stating that the right\r\n\nof pretrial detainees to make telephone calls, while \"not free from\r\n\ndoubt[,]\" is subject to reasonable restrictions);   Cacicio, 665\r\n\nN.E.2d at 92 (upholding MITS limitations on inmate telephone access\r\n\nas constitutional, and citing  Bellamy v. McMickens, 692 F.Supp.\r\n\n205, 214 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), for the proposition that prisoners have\r\n\nno right to unrestricted telephone use). Second, the       Gilday\r\n\ninjunction does not purport to ban call \"detailing\" lawfully\r\n\nconducted under federal and state law. See \r                                                     supra pps. 3-4, 20-25.\r\n\nAnd since MITS call \"detailing\" cannot occur absent inmate consent\r\n\n   a prerequisite to access to the MITS, see supra pp. 6-7    the\r\n\nvery least that can be said is that there is no  clearly-defined,\r\n\nsee Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17, \"interception\" under either federal or\r\n\nstate law, see supra pp. 34-37; infra pp. 45-48. Third, the verb\r\n\n\"endeavor,\" meaning \"to work with set purpose,\" or \"make an effort\"\r\n\nto accomplish a particular purpose,    see  Webster's  \r                                                                 Third  \r                                                                        New\r\n\nInternational Dictionary\r                                  748 (1986) \r                                                here, allegedly, to conduct\r\n\nunlawful interceptions of Gilday's wire communications    cannot\r\n\nbear the weight he places on it. Given the uncontroverted evidence\r\n\nthat extensive inmate fraud and criminal activity necessitated the\r\n\n                               39\r\r\n\nMITS,  see  supra p. 4, Gilday cannot demonstrate that the\r\n\nestablishment of the MITS    universally available exclusively to\r\n\ninmates \r                 who \r                     consent \r                             to \r                                its \r                                    terms (\r                                          including \r                                                    Gilday, should he elect\r\n\nto participate)    constituted an \"endeavor\" to \"detail\" Gilday's\r\n\ntelephone calls unlawfully, and thus constituted a clear violation\r\n\nof the Gilday injunction, see Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17.\r\n\n          Once again we emphasize the obvious simply because it is\r\n\nso consistently elided by Gilday, both below and on appeal: The\r\n\nGilday injunction grants Gilday \r                                         no \r                                            right \r                                                  or \r                                                     privilege \r                                                               to \r                                                                  place \r                                                                        any\r\n\ntelephone call, nor has Gilday cited any authoritative decision\r\n\nindicating that conditioning prison-telephone utilization on\r\n\ninformed prisoner consent to reasonable prison-security safeguards\r\n\nviolates a federal or state right.   See Langton, 71 F.3d at 936\r\n\n(stating: \"at the least, grounds exist for genuine dispute\" about\r\n\nwhether DOC \"defendants are authorized by law\" to require prisoner\r\n\nconsent to MITS regime) (citing \r                                         Griggs-Ryan v. \r                                                        Smith, 904 F.2d 112\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (holding that \"implied consent\" is inferred from\r\n\ncircumstances indicating that party knowingly agreed to\r\n\nsurveillance)); see also Washington, 35 F.3d at 1100 (prison may\r\n\nimpose rational limits on inmate telephone access, including\r\n\nsubjecting inmates to MITS-type system);  Strandberg, 791 F.2d at\r\n\n747 (prisoner's right to telephone access subject to reasonable\r\n\nrestrictions); \r                        Feely, 570 F.2d at 374 (right of pretrial detainees\r\n\nto place telephone calls is subject to reasonable restrictions);\r\n\nCacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 90 (upholding MITS as reasonable security\r\n\nmeasure). But \r                        cf. \r                            United States\r                                          v. \r                                            Cheely, 814 F.Supp. 1430, 1443-\r\n\n                               40\r\r\n\n44 (D. Alaska 1992) (rejecting argument that prison may deem\r\n\nconsent implied in situations where inmate must consent to terms in\r\n\norder to place calls, but finding surveillance of prison phones \"a\r\n\nnecessary price for prison security\"),  aff'd, 36 F.3d 1439 (9th\r\n\nCir. 1994).\r\n\n          In sum, the \r                               Gilday injunction does not purport to entitle\r\n\nGilday to utilize the MITS without acceding to lawful restrictions\r\n\nfounded upon reasonable prison-security measures. Furthermore,\r\n\ninmates who voluntarily withhold their consent retain their\r\n\nconstitutional right to communicate with their attorneys (and with\r\n\nfamily and friends) through prison visitations and the mail. Thus,\r\n\nit is unfounded supposition to suggest that the DOC has\r\n\n\"endeavored\" to do anything other than afford inmates the\r\n\nopportunity to utilize the MITS, subject to reasonable restrictions\r\n\ndesigned to preclude fraud, crime, and misuse of the prison\r\n\ntelephone system. Accordingly, the claim that the DOC is\r\n\n\"endeavoring\" to \"detail\" Gilday's telephone calls in violation of\r\n\nthe Gilday injunction fails.\r\n\n      We note that the Gilday call \"detailing\" contention is\r\nproblematic in another important respect, since Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r\n272, S 99(B)(3)(a), excepts from its definition of the term\r\n\"intercepting device\" any device or apparatus \"furnished to a\r\nsubscriber or user by a communications common carrier in the\r\nordinary course of its business under its tariff and being used by\r\nthe subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business.\"\r\nThe SJC has indicated that institutional efforts to ensure security\r\nconstitute activities in the \"ordinary course of business\" for S\r\n99(B)(3)(a) purposes. See \r                                    Crosland v. \r                                                Horgan, 516 N.E.2d 147, 150\r\n(Mass. 1987) (stating that preservation of security may be viewed\r\nas within hospital's \"ordinary course of business\"). Similarly,\r\nthe SJC has stated that maintenance of security is \"an essential\r\nincident to the business of a prison.\"   Id. (dicta) (describing\r\n\n                               41\r\r\n\n           Finally, even assuming, arguendo, that Gilday were to\r\n\novercome all other hurdles,  in fine his call \"detailing\" claim\r\n\nengenders substantial justiciability concerns not addressed by the\r\n\nparties. Article III, section 2, of the United States Constitution\r\n\nconfines federal court jurisdiction to actual \"cases\" and\r\n\n\"controversies.\" U.S. Const. art. III, S 2. Article III was\r\n\ndesigned to ensure that federal courts decide only disputes of \"a\r\n\nJudiciary nature,\" M. Farrand, 2 Records of the Federal Convention\r\n\nof \r             1787, at 430 (1911), thereby prohibiting advisory opinions,\r\n\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96 (1968). In order to satisfy the\r\n\n\"case or controversy\" requirement, the plaintiff must demonstrate\r\n\n\"'a personal stake in the outcome[,]'\"   City \r                                                         of \r                                                            Los \r                                                                Angeles v.\r\n\nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101 (1983) (quoting  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S.\r\n\n186, 204 (1962)), and the complaint must present a controversy\r\n\nneither \"conjectural [n]or hypothetical,\" but both \"real and\r\n\nimmediate,\" see id. at 102, without regard to the type of relief\r\n\npurport of \r                    Campiti v. \r                               Walonis, 453 F.Supp. 819, 822 (D.Mass. 1978),\r\naff'd, 611 F.2d 387 (1st Cir. 1979)). Perhaps most significantly,\r\nin response to a constitutional challenge the SJC has held that the\r\nMITS serves \"the legitimate purpose of improving the security of\r\nthe Massachusetts correctional system\" by acting as a \"deterrent\r\nagainst improper use\" of prison telephones. \r                                                     Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at\r\n90.\r\n     Thus, it can be concluded, with considerable confidence in our\r\njudgment, that the issue as to whether corrections officials may\r\nintercept MITS calls in the \"ordinary course of [prison] business,\"\r\nunder the protection of S 99(B)(3)(a), is     at the  very  least\r\nreasonably debatable, and, therefore, that Gilday's contention\r\ncomes a cropper. See \r                               Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17 (stating that injunction\r\nmust leave \"no reasonable doubt\" what conduct is prohibited); see\r\nalso Langton, 71 F.3d at 936 (finding \"reasonably debatable\" the\r\nissue as to whether MITS monitoring comes within the \"ordinary\r\ncourse of business of a law enforcement officer\" as defined by\r\nFederal Wiretap Act).\r\n\n                               42\r\r\n\nsought, \r                 see \r                     Skelly Oil\r                                v. \r                                   Phillips Petroleum Co.\r                                                        , 339 U.S. 667, 671\r\n\n(1950). \r\n\n          Among the showings required under the \"case or\r\n\ncontroversy\" requirement is \"ripeness,\" which governs \r                                                              when a proper\r\n\nparty may bring a justiciable action consistent with Article III.\r\n\nSee Thomas v.

Nor\r\n\ncan it simply be \r                          presumed that the DOC will \"detail\" unlawfully any\r\n\ncall to which Gilday might be a party in the future, nor even that\r\n\nhe would dial a number which might prompt a call \"detail\" report.\r\n\nSee Pacific \r                      Gas \r                          &amp; \r                             Elec. \r                                   Co., 461 U.S. at 200.

Title III\r\n\n          Although the Federal Wiretap Act (Title III, Omnibus\r\n\nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C.

To re-\r\n               fuse this call, hang up. If you use\r\n               three-way calling or call waiting,\r\n               you will be disconnected.  All call\r\n               detail and conversation, excluding\r\n               approved attorney calls,   will  be\r\n               recorded.

Thus, upon dialing \"1\" the party reached at the\r\n\nnumber dialed by the inmate consents to the MITS regime prior to\r\n\nany communication with the inmate.\r\n\n          Although Gilday points out that \r                                                  he has never consented \r                                                                           \r\n\neither explicitly or implicitly \r                                            to the MITS regime, the federal\r\n\nwiretap statute as well as relevant authoritative decisions\r\n\n                               45\r\r\n\nindicate that the requisite consent under the Federal Wiretap Act\r\n\nmay be provided by either party.  See 18 U.S.C. S 2511(2)(c) (no\r\n\nimpermissible \"interception\" where \"one of the parties to the\r\n\ncommunication has given prior consent to such interception\"); see\r\n\nalso \r              United States\r                            v. \r                               McDowell, 918 F.2d 1004, 1006 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n\n(finding no Title III bar to telephone interceptions based on\r\n\nunilateral consent); United States v. Pratt, 913 F.2d 982, 986-87\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (finding unilateral consent adequate to permit\r\n\ninterception under federal law). Thus, MITS call \"detailing\" and\r\n\nrecording does not offend Title III.\r\n\n          Moreover, it is settled law in the First Circuit and\r\n\nelsewhere that \"Title III affords safe harbor not only for persons\r\n\n      Call \"detailing,\" moreover, is not within the ambit of the\r\nFederal Wiretap Act, as it simply captures electronic signals\r\nrelating to the PIN of the caller, the number called, and the date,\r\ntime and length of the call.   See 103 C.M.R. S 482.06(1). The\r\nFederal Wiretap Act defines \"interception\" as an \"aural or other\r\nacquisition of the  contents of any wire, electronic, or oral\r\ncommunication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or\r\nother device.\" 18 U.S.C. S 2510(4) (emphasis added). Subsection\r\n2510(8) in turn defines \"contents\" as \"any information concerning\r\nthe substance, purport, or meaning of [the] . . . communication.\"\r\nId. S 2510(8).\r\n     The United States Supreme Court, in an analogous context, has\r\nheld that \"pen registers\"    devices which can record any number\r\ndialed from a particular telephone    do not violate the Federal\r\nWiretap Act \"because they do not acquire the contents of communica-\r\ntions as that term is defined by 18 U.S.C. S 2510(8).\"     United\r\nStates v. \r                   New York Tel. Co.\r                                    , 434 U.S. 159, 167 (1977). Similarly,\r\nthe SJC has held that pen registers \"are not governed by Title III,\r\nsince there is no 'aural acquisition' of anything.\"      District\r\nAttorney For Norfolk District, 373 N.E.2d at 962. The legislative\r\nhistory of the 1986 Amendments to the Federal Wiretap Act likewise\r\nindicates that Congress intended to exclude call \"detailing\"\r\ndevices.  See S.Rep. No. 99-541, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess., reprinted\r\nin 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555 (stating that devices which record\r\nelectronic data \"capture no part\" of the contents of \"an actual\r\ntelephone conversation\"). \r\n\n                               46\r\r\n\nwho intercept calls with the explicit consent of a conversant but\r\n\nalso for those who do so after receiving implied consent.\" \r                                                                    Griggs-\r\n\nRyan, 904 F.2d at 116;  see also Williams v.

Thus, \"a reviewing\r\n\ncourt must inquire into the  dimensions of  the consent and then\r\n\nascertain whether the interception exceeded those boundaries.\" \r                                                                        Id.\r\n\nat 119 (emphasis added).\r\n\n          The prerecorded MITS message explicitly advises that\r\n\n\"[a]ll call detail and conversation, excluding approved attorney\r\n\ncalls, \r                will \r                     be \r                        recorded,\" \r                                   see \r                                       supra p. 45 (emphasis added), thereby\r\n\ninforming the call recipient that the entire \"contents\" will be\r\n\nintercepted. Consequently, notwithstanding the absence of explicit\r\n\nnotice of the lesser intrusion represented by possible monitoring\r\n\nof call content,  the recipient is fully informed of the greater\r\n\n      The MITS regime permits random monitoring, as well as\r\nparticularized investigative monitoring     the latter based on\r\nsuspected criminal activity.\r\n\n                               47\r\r\n\nintrusion; \r                    viz., that the \r                                   entire \r                                          conversation, as well as all call\r\n\n\"detail,\" will be intercepted  and recorded.   See id.; see  also\r\n\nWilliams, 11 F.3d at 281-82 (discussing elements of implied\r\n\nconsent). Thus, since the MITS records the entire conversation,\r\n\nany concurrent aural monitoring by authorized DOC officials in no\r\n\nsense exceeds the dimensions of the broad implied consent given to\r\n\nrecord all call \"content,\" including call \"detail.\"  See  Griggs-\r\n\nRyan, 904 F.2d at 114, 116-19 (finding implied consent to\r\n\ninterceptions, consisting of concurrent aural monitoring and\r\n\nrecording of telephone conversations, after plaintiff had been\r\n\ninformed of the recording only and no restrictions had been placed\r\n\non the scope of the interceptions); see also Williams, 11 F.3d at\r\n\n282 (stating that implied consent obtains where party to conversa-\r\n\ntion was provided with at least \"minimal knowledge\" of scope of\r\n\ninterception). Therefore, based on the relevant authoritative\r\n\ndecisions, it is at the very  least an open question whether the\r\n\nexpress prior consent provided by MITS-call recipients to the\r\n\nrecordation of all call \"content\" constitutes implied consent to\r\n\nmonitoring.  \r\n\n          Finally, as this is a civil contempt proceeding it was\r\n\nfor Gilday to prove that the DOC defendants \"violated a clear and\r\n\nunambiguous order that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior\r\n\n      Although it has been held    outside the prison context    \r\nthat mere \"knowledge of the capability of monitoring alone cannot\r\nbe considered implied consent,\" \r                                         Watkins, 704 F.2d at 581 (emphasis\r\nin original), under the MITS the recipient of the call is informed\r\nthat the entire call will be recorded. \r\n\n                               48\r\r\n\nwas to be expected\" and that the DOC was \"'able to ascertain from\r\n\nthe four corners of the order precisely what acts . . . [were]\r\n\nforbidden.'\"  Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17 (quoting  Drywall \r                                                               Tapers, 889\r\n\nF.2d at 395). Since the    Gilday injunction bans only unlawful\r\n\npractices by the DOC defendants,      see  supra pp. 20-22 and\r\n\nauthoritative decisions supportably indicate    at the very least\r\n\n   that the challenged MITS practices constitute lawful monitoring,\r\n\nGilday has not demonstrated a \"clear and unambiguous\" violation of\r\n\nTitle III.  Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded\r\n\nthat Gilday failed to establish a violation of the         Gilday\r\n\ninjunction, either by the DOC or by its putative aiders and\r\n\nabettors, NET and AT&amp;T. \r\n\nC.

Gilday argues that the terms of the    Gilday\r\n\ninjunction grant him a \"federal right to be free of any intercep-\r\n\ntion of his wire communications not specifically permitted under\r\n\nthe terms of the Permanent Injunction.\" From this mistaken premise\r\n\nhe maintains that the DOC defendants violated section 1983 by\r\n\nimplementing the MITS under color of Massachusetts law in violation\r\n\nof the Gilday injunction, thereby depriving him of a \"federal\r\n\nright.\" Likewise, he claims that AT&amp;T and NET are state actors,\r\n\nliable for aiding and abetting the alleged violations by the DOC\r\n\ndefendants. As the Gilday injunction was never violated, however,\r\n\nthese civil rights claims collapse as well.\r\n\n                               III\r\n\n                           CONCLUSION\r\n\n          Appellant having failed to show as a matter of law that\r\n\nappellees violated the permanent injunction or caused a deprivation\r\n\nof any federal or constitutional rights, the judgment of the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r\n\n      On appeal, Gilday has abandoned the claim that defendants\r\ndeprived him of \"meaningful access to the courts,\" as well as his\r\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

In 1974, Gilday commenced a civil rights action in federal district court against various FBI and DOC officials, see Gilday v. Webster, No. 74-4169-C, alleging interference with attorney-client communications in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and violations of the federal and state wiretap statutes, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510 et seq., and Mass.  Gen.

All officers, agents, servants, employees and attorneys of the Department of Correction are enjoined permanently, under both 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510 et seq. and M.G.L. c. 272, &#167; 99 et seq., from intercepting, endeavoring to intercept, or procuring any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire communication by or to plaintiff William Gilday without a specific court order or legislative authorization to do so, except as specifically permitted by these statutes, taken together, as they have been amended or may be amended and as they have been construed or may be construed in reported decisions that are binding in this Court or in the state courts of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>2.

This Permanent Injunction, entered pursuant to the settlement stipulation dated September 10, 1984, shall operate prospectively only;  it shall not prejudice the rights of nonsettling defendants or, of its own force, affect the rights of inmates other than William Gilday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next ten years, however, developments in electronic technology, as well as inmate ingenuity, prompted increased prison-telephone abuses,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> such as acquiring merchandise by fraud, promoting drug violations, soliciting murder, harassing crime victims, witnesses, and public officials, facilitating escape plots, violating court restraining orders, and threatening domestic violence.  The DOC responded in 1993 by inviting telephone-system vendors to furnish, install, and maintain an advanced prison telephone system designed to deter inmate abuses by monitoring, recording, and \"detailing\" their calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, NET contracted to produce, install, and maintain an inmate telephone system for all DOC facilities, which became known as the Massachusetts Inmate Telephone System (\"MITS\"), to supply both local and long distance service and remit to the DOC forty percent of the gross revenues from inmate calls.  NET in turn subcontracted with AT &amp; T to furnish long distance MITS service.  A third company, Telematic Corporation, contracted with AT &amp; T and NET to provide the electronic equipment and software needed to provision the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 8, 1994, the DOC promulgated new inmate telephone regulations, see 103 C.M.R. &#167;&#167; 482.00 et seq.  (\"MITS Regulations\"), \"establish[ing] Department procedures regarding access to, use of and the monitoring and/or recording of inmate telephones.\"  Id. &#167; 482.01.  Under the MITS Regulations, a personal identification number (\"PIN\") is randomly assigned to each inmate.  The inmate must dial the assigned PIN immediately before dialing the telephone number, whereupon an automatic operator completes the connection.  No more than fifteen designated parties are accessible with any PIN:  ten friends and family members and five attorneys.  See id. &#167; 482.07(3)(c);  Bender Aff. p 8. The right to call designated attorneys may not be suspended or curtailed except during an institutional emergency, see id. &#167;&#167; 482.08-482.09, whereas the right to call other designated parties is subject to disciplinary restriction, see id. &#167;&#167; 482.07(3)(h), 482.09.  In addition, all inmates are allowed to call three prison legal-service organizations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stickers on all MITS telephones alert inmates to the monitoring/recording regime.  All inmate calls, except preauthorized attorney calls and legal-service organization calls, are automatically recorded.  Certain \"detailing\" information is recorded on all calls either attempted or completed.  Finally, all except attorney and legal-service organization calls may be subjected to concurrent monitoring (i.e., listened in on) by authorized DOC personnel, either at random or for investigative purposes.  See id. &#167; 482.07(3)(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to obtain an individual PIN, the inmate must complete and sign a \"Number Request Form,\" designating the attorney and nonattorney telephone numbers which may be called.  The form advises inmates that their \"acceptance and use of a PIN and use of inmate telephones shall be deemed as consent to the conditions and restrictions placed upon inmate telephone calls, including call monitoring, recording, and call detail.\"   All inmate calls must be placed \"collect.\"  Id. &#167; 482.07(3)(a).  Each call begins with a recorded message--audible by both parties--that the call has been placed \"collect\" by a DOC inmate and is subject to recordation and \"detailing.\"   See id. &#167; 482.07(3)(g);  Kennedy Aff. p 10.  Both parties hear the entire message, but there can be no communication until the collect call has been accepted by the person called.  See 103 C.M.R. &#167; 482.07(3)(f);  Bender Aff. p 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday declined to submit a PIN request form, on the ground that the MITS contravenes the federal and state wiretap statutes and therefore violates the Gilday injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  At about the same time, Gilday mailed AT &amp; T and NET copies of the Gilday injunction entered September 12, 1984, see supra p. 280, advising that their provision of MITS services would violate the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter Gilday petitioned the federal district court for a contempt citation against AT &amp; T, NET, and various DOC officials, claiming that the defendants were \"endeavoring to intercept\" his telephone communications.  Although neither AT &amp; T nor NET was privy to the Gilday injunction, Gilday asserted that both received actual notice by mail, supra pp. 281-82, and therefore knowingly aided and abetted the alleged violations by the DOC defendants.  Finally, Gilday alleged, the defendants were depriving him of his \"federal right to be free of any interception of his wire communications,\" as well as his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and his Fourteenth Amendment right of access to the courts, by restricting consultation with counsel regarding six pending judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered summary judgment for the defendants, on the ground that the Gilday injunction bans neither monitoring nor recording, but only \"interceptions.\"   It noted that no secretive, nonconsensual monitoring or recording--hence no \"interception\"--had occurred under either wiretap statute, since all recording and monitoring is well advertised as required by the MITS Regulations.  See supra p. 281.  The district court reasoned that inmates render the MITS monitoring/recording regime consensual by executing the request form and utilizing the MITS.  And since it found the term \"interception\" ambiguous at best, the district court determined to resolve any interpretive doubts favorably to the defendants.  Finally, it dismissed the Gilday claims relating to call \"detailing,\" on the ground that Langton v. Hogan, 71 F.3d 930 (1st Cir.1995), had already endorsed the MITS practice in this regard.  Accordingly, it concluded that the attendant recording and monitoring did not constitute an \"interception\" under either the federal or state wiretap statute, thus did not contravene the Gilday injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the district court dismissed the section 1983 claims as well, on the ground that Gilday retained all mail privileges, access to a prison law library, the right to meet with counsel and, under the MITS regulations, the right to conduct unmonitored telephone communications with five attorneys and three legal-service organizations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

We address these arguments in turn, mindful that it was for Gilday to establish by \" 'clear and convincing evidence[,]' \" Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 947 F.2d 11, 16 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Langton v. Johnston, 928 F.2d 1206, 1220 (1st Cir.1991)), that the particular defendant violated an unambiguous consent decree \"that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was to be expected,\" id. at 17.   See also Porrata v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 958 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1992) (stating that complainant must clearly establish that \"a lucid and unambiguous consent order has been violated\");  NBA Properties, Inc. v. Gold, 895 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir.1990) (similar).  Moreover, \" 'the party enjoined must be able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.' \"  Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17 (quoting Drywall Tapers &amp; Pointers of Greater N.Y., Local 1974 v. Local 530 of Operative Plasterers &amp; Cement Masons Intern. Ass'n, 889 F.2d 389, 395 (2d Cir.1989) (citation omitted));  see also Reed v. Cleveland Bd. of Educ., 607 F.2d 749, 752 (6th Cir.1979) (stating that judicial order must \"clearly tell a reasonable person what he is required to do or abstain from doing\").  From these requirements flows the important corollary that courts are to construe ambiguities and omissions in consent decrees as \" 'redound[ing] to the benefit of the person charged with contempt.' \"  NBA Properties, 895 F.2d at 32 (quoting Ford v. Kammerer, 450 F.2d 279, 280 (3d Cir.1971) (per curiam));  see also Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Issue Preclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, Gilday insists that the DOC defendants are collaterally estopped from contending that the MITS does not violate the Gilday injunction, because this issue was resolved in Langton v. Hogan, No. 79-2167-Z, 1995 WL 96948 (D.Mass. Feb.21, 1995), which culminated in a permanent injunction (\"the Langton injunction\") almost identical to the Gilday injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, bars relitigation of any issue \"actually decided in previous litigation 'between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.' \"  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Dennis v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust, 744 F.2d 893, 899 (1st Cir.1984) (emphasis in original) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments, &#167; 27 (1982))).  Although \"[a]n issue may be 'actually' decided even if it is not explicitly decided, for it may have constituted, logically or practically, a necessary component of the decision reached in the prior litigation,\" Grella, 42 F.3d at 30-31 (emphasis in original), the narrow, fact-based district court decision in Langton had simply declined to modify the injunction in that case, to permit monitoring and recording, because there was no evidence of inmate-telephone abuse by Langton or his fellow plaintiff.   Thus, as the district court ruling on the petition for modification in Langton neither addressed nor implicated the question whether the MITS violates either the state or federal wiretap statute, see Langton, No. 79-2167-Z, 1995 WL 96948, it neither \"actually\" nor \"necessarily\" determined that the MITS regime violated the Langton injunction, let alone the Gilday injunction.  See Grella, 42 F.3d at 30 (stating that \"the determination of the issue must have been essential to the judgment\");  see also NLRB v. Donna-Lee Sportswear Co., Inc., 836 F.2d 31, 34 (1st Cir.1987) (same).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Claim Preclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday next contends that the 1984 consent decree precludes the DOC defendants from claiming that the MITS does not violate the Gilday injunction, because our decision in Langton v. Hogan, 71 F.3d 930, 933-35 (1st Cir.1995), involving a similar injunction, held that the DOC was precluded from contesting the meaning of the same state and federal wiretap statutes there involved without first obtaining a court order modifying the injunction.  Once again we are unable to agree, as the Langton panel decision is inapposite for several reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, although the parties to a consent decree are bound by traditional preclusion principles and may not litigate claims necessarily resolved by the decree, see id. at 933-34, the Gilday injunction--unlike the Langton injunction--expressly provided that reported decisions authoritatively construing the relevant state and federal wiretap statutes (hereinafter:  \"authoritative decisions\") were to control their future construction for all purposes material to the Gilday injunction.  See supra pp. 280-81 (\"All [DOC agents] are enjoined permanently ... from ... endeavoring to intercept ... any wire communication by or to [Gilday] ... except as specifically permitted by these statutes ... as they have been construed or may be construed in [authoritative decisions].\").  (Emphasis added.)   Thus, the construction suggested by Gilday would ignore language expressly limiting the scope of the Gilday injunction.  See Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1277 (1st Cir.1992) (declining to construe consent decree so as to \"overlook[ ] the language of the decree itself\").  See also United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 236-37, 95 S.Ct. 926, 934-35, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975) (construing consent decrees as contracts);  Systemized of New England, Inc. v. SCM, Inc., 732 F.2d 1030, 1034 (1st Cir.1984) (noting that courts are to adopt constructions that \"give meaning and effect to every part of a contract and reject those which reduce words to mere surplusage\").  Accordingly, the Gilday injunction did not preclude reliance on intervening authoritative decisions construing the state and federal wiretap statutes.  Instead, \"construed as it is written,\" United States v. Armour &amp; Co., 402 U.S. 673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757-58, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971), the Gilday injunction, unlike the Langton injunction, plainly envisioned their consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although the Langton panel majority concluded that the DOC had relinquished any right to litigate the meaning of these wiretap statutes as against the Langton inmates, see Langton, 71 F.3d at 933-34, it did so because it believed those inmates otherwise would have gained nothing--beyond a mere promise by the DOC to obey the law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The usually understood meaning of a Settlement Stipulation is that each party is agreeing to give up something--to yield on one or more reasonably plausible contentions of law, or fact, or mixed-law-fact issues.  \"[T]he agreement reached normally embodies a compromise;  in exchange for the saving of cost and elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation.\"   When making an agreement for a consent decree, the parties to a case are agreeing not to press any of their disputes to decision in court.  The parties forego \"their right to litigate issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense and inevitable risk of litigation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (quoting Armour &amp; Co., 402 U.S. at 681, 91 S.Ct. at 1757) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, in the present case the consent decree secured Gilday a substantial independent benefit unavailable to the Langton plaintiffs.  As the district court recognized, Gilday had alleged in his 1974 action against the DOC that he was the target of two secret federal and state law enforcement efforts, directed by the FBI and code-named \"STOP\" and \"GILROB,\" aimed at gathering information about his as-yet unapprehended accomplices in the Brighton bank robbery.  See supra p. 280.  In securing the 1984 consent decree, therefore, Gilday obtained permanent injunctive relief from any DOC participation in current or future wire-communication interceptions unlawfully directed against him by these state and federal law enforcement agencies--consideration unavailable to the Langton litigants.  Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Gilday consent decree permitted the DOC to litigate future unresolved issues relating to the meaning of the applicable wiretap statutes, Gilday obtained substantial consideration for entering into the settlement with the DOC.  Thus, the Langton panel majority's concerns over a lack of meaningful consideration for the Langton plaintiffs' consent are not implicated to the same degree in the present context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Langton and Gilday cases presented themselves in materially different ways on appeal.  The Langton panel was asked to review, inter alia, a district court ruling denying a DOC petition to modify the Langton injunction.  See id. at 931.   On appeal, the DOC claimed that the district court had broadened the injunction impermissibly in favor of the Langton inmates.  Id. at 933.   The Langton panel majority first decided that the parties had relinquished their respective rights to litigate the meaning of the wiretap statutes underlying the injunction, and then determined that no authoritative decision, existing at the time the Langton injunction issued, specifically supported the challenged MITS monitoring and recording practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Langton majority went on to survey subsequent decisional law, simply noting--without resolving the merits--that \"reasonable [competing] arguments can be advanced\" as to whether the challenged MITS monitoring and recording regime violated the federal wiretap statute.  Id. at 935-37;  see also id. at 940 (\"Nor does the panel majority hold that the present regime is unlawful under the federal and state statutes but only that reasonable arguments can be made on both sides.\")  (Boudin, J., dissenting ) (emphasis in original).  Thus, the Langton majority simply decided that the DOC had failed to carry its burden of demonstrating any change in the law, or the facts, which would warrant modification of the injunction. See id. at 937-38 (sustaining modification ruling as \"appropriately tailored to the only changes in law or in fact disclosed on the record before the district court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, on the other hand, Gilday alleges DOC violations of an injunction which expressly contemplates that authoritative decisions subsequent to the Gilday injunction may determine whether a violation has occurred.  See supra pp. 283-84.   Moreover, since the Langton panel majority never reached the merits regarding the lawfulness of the MITS regime under either wiretap statute, see supra p. 284, we may consider afresh whether the challenged MITS practices violate the Gilday injunction.  Finally, we are required to review the district court's summary judgment ruling against Gilday de novo.  See Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 874-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the DOC is entitled to litigate the meaning of the applicable wiretap statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Gilday Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday argues that the DOC defendants violated the Gilday injunction by endeavoring to monitor and record his wire communications in violation of the state and federal wiretap statutes.  The linchpin in this argument is that no authoritative decision \"specifically\" construes either the federal or state wiretap statute to \"permit\" the inmate-telephone system established under the MITS.  In other words, Gilday argues that the injunction is violated absent an authoritative decision validating either the MITS regime itself or substantially similar practices in a comparable prison context.  At its most particular level, this contention would necessitate an authoritative decision declaring the challenged MITS practices compatible with the applicable wiretap statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We test this contention against the language employed in the Gilday injunction, viewed in its unique litigation context, including the particular circumstances surrounding its formation and the basic purposes it was designed to serve.  See ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 238 (construing ambiguous language in consent decree in light of \"the circumstances surround ing [its] ... formation\");  see also Massachusetts Ass'n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. King, 668 F.2d 602, 607-08 (1st Cir.1981) (construing consent decree in light of its language, the circumstances surrounding its formation, and its basic purposes);  Cornelius v. Hogan, 663 F.2d 330, 333 (1st Cir.1981) (noting that court construing ambiguous consent decree may \"inquire into the parties' intent and the circumstances surrounding the decree in order to select the most reasonable interpretation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a preliminary matter it is necessary to note, however, that no violation of the injunction can be found unless Gilday first established an \"interception,\" as defined under either the federal or Massachusetts wiretap statute, based on \"clear and convincing evidence,\" Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  See infra pp. 288-89, 290.   Therefore, Gilday's insistent contention on appeal--that no MITS practice can ever be allowed under the Gilday injunction unless it has been \"specifically permitted\" beforehand by an authoritative decision--cannot succeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming Gilday were to demonstrate an \"interception,\" the injunction expressly excepts from its reach any practice \"specifically permitted\" under the wiretap statutes as construed in authoritative decisions, see supra pp. 280-81, and the term \"specifically permitted\" is susceptible to various reasonable interpretations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  On the one hand, \"specifically permitted\" may be read to require an authoritative decision that the MITS regime, as applied directly to Gilday, comports with the applicable wiretap statutes.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2187 (1986) (noting that term \"specific\" may connote restriction \"to a particular individual\");  see also Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 590, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1103, 1111, 134 L.Ed.2d 237 (1996) (noting that \" '[s]pecifically' can mean 'explicitly, particularly, [or] definitively' \") (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1398 (6th ed.1990) (emphasis added)).  Under such a reading, an authoritative decision would be unavailing to the DOC defendants unless it explicitly addressed the MITS monitoring and recording of wire communications involving Gilday.  On the other hand, \"specifically permitted\" may contemplate simply an authoritative decision upholding interceptions involving some other DOC inmate or DOC inmates in general.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary at 2187 (noting that \"specific\" may merely restrict to a particular situation).  Under these interpretations, therefore, Gilday would need to demonstrate simply an absence of authoritative decisions specifically permitting the challenged MITS practices as applied directly to him or to similarly situated inmates.  See Langton, 71 F.3d at 935-37 (noting no reported decision \"holding that this type of prison telephone monitoring system\" meets \"consent\" exception to federal wiretap statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, at a more universal level, \"specifically permitted\" may simply contemplate an authoritative decision upholding the general types or kinds of monitoring and recording practices prescribed by the MITS, without regard to whether the practices were employed in a prison context.  See 2 The Oxford English Dictionary 2949 (Compact Ed.1987) (defining \"specifically\" as \"[i]n something of the same kind\");  see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary at 2187 (defining \"specific\" as \"constituting or falling into the category specified\");  Webster's New World Dictionary of American English 1287 (3d ed.1988) (defining \"specific\" as being \"of a special, or particular, sort or kind\");  Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1132 (1989) (defining \"specific\" as \"sharing or being those properties of something that allow it to be referred to a particular category\").  Under the latter interpretation, of course, Gilday would need to demonstrate an absence of authoritative decisions vindicating the kinds of practices utilized under the MITS, without necessary regard to the exact context in which the practices were applied, thereby implicating any relevant authoritative decision addressing the applicable wiretap statutes.  Thus, under the latter interpretation only unlawful MITS practices would be barred by the Gilday injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ambiguities in an injunctive decree are construed in the light most favorable to the alleged contemnor.  See Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16;  NBA Properties, 895 F.2d at 32;  see also United States v. O'Quinn, 913 F.2d 221, 222 (5th Cir.1990);  In re Baldwin-United Corp., 770 F.2d 328, 339 (2d Cir.1985);  New York Tel. Co. v. Communications Workers of America, 445 F.2d 39, 48 (2d Cir.1971);  Ford, 450 F.2d at 280, 11 C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure:  Civil &#167; 2955, at 310 (1995 &amp; Supp.1996) (same).  For present purposes, therefore, the Gilday injunction would be construed as banning only unlawful interceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigation context underlying the Gilday consent decree likewise commends the latter construction.  See ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935 (construing ambiguous consent-decree language in light of \"circumstances surrounding [its] formation ...\");  see also King, 668 F.2d at 607 (similar).  Throughout the district court action terminated by the consent decree, the DOC defendants steadfastly denied \"monitoring,\" \"recording,\" or \"intercepting\" any wire communication involving Gilday.  Thus, implicit in the stance taken by Gilday now is the suggestion that the DOC defendants impliedly conceded prior violations of the relevant wiretap statutes simply by entering into the stipulation of dismissal, whereas the record flatly contradicts any such concession.  Instead, the stipulation of dismissal substantiates the view that the DOC defendants simply agreed to an injunction which required their compliance with the applicable federal and state law governing \"interceptions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, therefore, the Gilday consent decree--entailing no resolution of the central dispute as to whether the DOC defendants ever \"monitored\" or \"recorded,\" let alone \"intercepted,\" any Gilday wire communication--is most harmoniously construed as an agreement that the DOC defendants were to refrain from any \"interception\" violative of either wiretap statute, as determined under either existing or future authoritative decisions.  That is to say, the Gilday consent decree bans only unlawful DOC monitoring and recording practices.  See Settlement Stipulation:  Claims Against Defendants Fair, Vose, Hall and Callahan, Gilday v. Fair, et al., Civ. A. No. 74-4169-C, discussed supra pp. 286-87 &amp; n. 12;  see also supra pp. 280-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggested construction comports with the Langton panel majority opinion as well, which held that the Langton injunction banned any \"interception\" absent \"a specific court order or legislative authorization to do so, except as specifically permitted by these statutes, ... as they have been construed in reported decisions that are binding in this Court or in the state courts of Massachusetts.\"  Langton, 71 F.3d at 931 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Langton panel majority reasoned that the consent decree was to be construed as requiring the DOC defendants to refrain, in perpetuity, from contesting the meaning of the relevant state and federal wiretap statutes \"as construed in reported decisions that [were] binding in [the federal district court] or in the state courts of Massachusetts\" at the time the Langton injunction was entered, see id. at 931, 933-35, as distinguished from merely requiring the DOC defendants to refrain from unlawful interceptions.  As the Langton panel majority viewed the matter, any other approach threatened to render the terms of the Langton injunction \"illusory--stating nothing beyond what was already forbidden by law before the Permanent Injunction was entered.\"  Id. at 933 (emphasis added);  but see id. at 940 (Boudin, J., dissenting );  see also supra p. 284.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel majority relied as well on the final section in the Langton injunction, which stated in terms similar to the Gilday injunction, see supra p. 280, that the injunction \"shall not of its own force affect the rights of inmates of the Department other than William Langton and David LeBlanc.\"   See Langton, 71 F.3d at 933.   It reasoned that had the DOC promised merely to obey the law, no purpose would have been served by the quoted provision.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, however, the two cases presented themselves on appeal in materially different postures.  First, as discussed supra pp. 284-85, the repeated observation by the Langton panel majority, see Langton, 71 F.3d at 933-37--that no then-existing authoritative decision specifically permitted the challenged MITS practices and that the Langton decree would be rendered meaningless were it to be construed as a mere promise to obey the law--is inapposite to the instant context.  That is, central to the present analysis is the explicit language in the Gilday injunction (\"or may be construed in reported decisions\"), see supra p. 280 (emphasis added)--nowhere to be found in the Langton injunction, see 71 F.3d at 931--which in no sense purports to prohibit either (i) these parties from litigating open questions as to the meaning of the applicable wiretap statutes, or (ii) our consideration of later authoritative decisions upholding monitoring and recording practices of the kind prescribed by the MITS, see infra pp. 45-48.   Second, since the settlement stipulation and the consent decree in Gilday were entered into while the parties in Langton were still litigating the initial action which led to the Langton injunction, paragraph 3 in the Gilday injunction (viz., \"[t]his Permanent Injunction ... shall not ... affect the rights of inmates other than William Gilday[,]\") served the discrete purpose of not disturbing the rights of the Langton inmates whose initial action against the DOC was to remain in litigation for two months after the consent decree was entered in Gilday.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, unlike the corresponding provision in the Langton injunction, paragraph 3 in the Gilday injunction is entirely consistent with the view that the Gilday injunction simply contemplates that the DOC not violate the applicable wiretap statutes.  For these reasons we conclude, notwithstanding their similarities, that the Gilday injunction is substantially less restrictive in scope than the Langton injunction, in that it unambiguously enjoins only unlawful recording and monitoring practices by the DOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Massachusetts Wiretap Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must now consider whether Gilday demonstrated by \"clear and convincing evidence,\" Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16, that the challenged MITS practices constitute unlawful interceptions under the applicable wiretap statutes, beginning with the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, bearing in mind that it was for Gilday to show that the DOC defendants \"violated a clear and unambiguous order that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was to be expected\" and that the defendants were \" 'able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.' \"  Id. at 17 (quoting Drywall Tapers, 889 F.2d at 395).   First, we inquire whether the monitoring, recording, and call \"detailing\" practices prescribed by the MITS Regulations are \"interceptions\" under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(4).  Second, should Gilday successfully surmount the first hurdle, we determine whether any such interpretation is nevertheless permitted under any authoritative decision binding on the federal district court.  Finally, we conclude that Gilday failed to prove either that the monitoring and recording practices conducted pursuant to the MITS constitute \"interceptions\" under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, or that the MITS call \"detailing\" practices were clearly prohibited under the Gilday injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Monitoring and Recording</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the Gilday injunction prohibits only \"interceptions\" under the applicable statutes and not call monitoring, recording, or \"detailing\" per se.   The term \"interception,\" as used in the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, \"means to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record, the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any intercepting device....\"  Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts courts have interpreted this \"secrecy\" requirement literally.  See Commonwealth v. Jackson, 370 Mass. 502, 349 N.E.2d 337, 339-40 (1976) (holding that secrecy is essential to establishing a violation of Massachusetts Wiretap Act);  see also District Attorney v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 379 Mass. 586, 399 N.E.2d 866, 869 (1980) (stating that secret recordation of incoming calls violates Massachusetts Wiretap Act).  A secretive interception occurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act unless both parties to a wire \"communication\" had \"actual knowledge\" of the \"interception,\" see, e.g., Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 340, which may be established by evidence that the parties were informed that their conversation was being intercepted, or by \"clear and unequivocal objective manifestations of knowledge ... sufficiently probative of a person's state of mind as to allow an inference of knowledge.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly concluded, the recording and monitoring practices at issue here were in no sense surreptitious.  Inmates are informed in advance, both by the MITS Regulations--a matter of public record--and the individualized PIN Request Form advisory as well, that their MITS calls will be monitored and recorded.  Moreover, inmates are reminded by stickers affixed to each phone that all non-attorney calls are subject to the monitoring and recording practices prescribed by the MITS Regulations.  Finally, a prerecorded message informs both parties--before the parties can communicate--that all call \"contents\" will be recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") has decided that even inmates who \"have not consented to the [MITS] monitoring and recording\"--such as Gilday--nonetheless have been \"made aware of the procedure and its requirements.\"  Cacicio v. Secretary of Public Safety, 422 Mass. 764, 665 N.E.2d 85, 91 (1996) (rejecting constitutional challenge to MITS Regulations).  Therefore, the SJC held, \"[t]he [MITS] monitoring and recording is not surreptitious in any sense.\"  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we now hold that whatever recording and monitoring of oral communications takes place under the MITS regime does not constitute an \"interception\" under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, as it is not secretly conducted.  See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 339 (non-secret recordings not \"interceptions\" under Massachusetts Wiretap Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Call \"Detailing \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Wiretap Act defines the term \"interception\" as a secret acquisition of \"the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any intercepting device ....\"  Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(4) (emphasis added).  Elsewhere the statute explicitly excepts certain telephone equipment from its definition of \"intercepting device\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>The term \"intercepting device\" means any device or apparatus which is capable of ... recording a wire or oral communication ... other than any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment, facility, or a component thereof ... being used by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(3)(b).  Thus, no \"interception\" occurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act if the device used to acquire the contents of a wire communication comes within the ambit of the \"telephone equipment\" exception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MITS employs a sophisticated network of computers and associated telephone equipment, including \"controller boards\"--electronic call processing devices attached to each prison telephone--supplied, installed, and maintained by NET.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  The NET equipment automatically screens approved outside telephone numbers from unapproved numbers, routes inmate calls to approved telephone numbers outside the prison, plays the prerecorded message to both parties, and identifies calls placed to listed attorneys so as to preclude their monitoring and recordation. All call \"detail\" is recorded automatically by the NET telephone equipment in order to generate billing reports and safeguard the NET equipment against fraudulent use by inmates (i.e., inter alia, unapproved long distance and collect calls).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The monthly revenue statements NET provides under its contract with the DOC reflect \"detail\" on all inmate calls placed, including the number dialed, the length of the call, and other billing-related and revenue-related information.  In addition, the NET site administrator at each prison facility regularly generates a so-called \"Fraud Report,\" listing all outside telephone numbers to which the total number of calls placed by inmates within the reporting period exceeded a specified level.  The Fraud Report is forwarded to NET and the DOC for use in investigating fraudulent telephone usage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the above-described evidentiary framework, we now inquire whether the MITS call \"detailing\" conducted by NET is excepted from the Massachusetts Wiretap Act definition of \"intercepting device\" in &#167; 99(B)(3)(b).  See supra pp. 289-90.   First, we note that NET is a \"communication common carrier\" within the contemplation of &#167; 99(B)(3).  See District Attorney for Plymouth Dist. v. Coffey, 386 Mass. 218, 434 N.E.2d 1276, 1280 (1982).  Second, Gilday does not contend that the processor computers and controller boards used by NET for billing-related purposes are not \"equipment ... being used in the ordinary course of [NET's] business.\"   See Reply Brief for the Plaintiff, Appellant at 6 n. 8 (\"Gilday does not argue that NET is precluded from using call detail for billing purposes.\").  Nor does any authoritative decision suggest that a communication common carrier which \"details\" calls in order to generate billing reports or protect its equipment from fraudulent abuse, does not do so in the ordinary course of its business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  Thus, Gilday has not demonstrated by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, see Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16, that any call \"detailing\" conducted by NET for its own billing-related purposes falls outside the &#167; 99(B)(3)(b) exception for equipment used by it \"in the ordinary course of its business.\"   Accordingly, no \"interception\" occurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, at least by reason of the billing-related \"detailing\" conducted by NET.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday nonetheless insists, however, that the injunction precludes the DOC defendants from acquiring access to any call \"detail\" information and that NET therefore may not aid and abet the DOC by affording access.  See Reply Brief for Plaintiff, Appellant at 6 n. 8. Under the Regulations and the MITS \"Procedural Statement\"--a DOC operations guideline which supplements the MITS Regulations--authorized DOC officers may request both \"standard\" and \"custom\" call \"detail\" reports from NET personnel for investigative purposes, or, after receiving training from NET personnel, print out such call \"detail\" reports themselves.  Moreover, these \"standard\" reports may, at the DOC's option, be configured to provide call \"detail\" relating to an individual inmate's PIN, a particular group of inmate PINs, specific prison telephones used to place calls, or particular telephone numbers dialed.  Finally, since the record discloses no limitation on the domain reserved for the so-called \"custom\" reports, we assume, at the summary judgment stage, see Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 874-75, that NET is obligated to provide the DOC with any and all call \"detail\" requested.  Notwithstanding its advantageous summary judgment posture, however, the Gilday call \"detailing\" claim fails in relation to the DOC defendants as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday claims that the DOC violates the injunctive ban against \"intercepting\" or \"endeavoring to intercept\" his wire communications, see supra pp. 280-81, simply by applying the MITS requirements to him;  in particular, by making his consent a prerequisite to utilizing the MITS.  The claim is premised on several rationales:  first, the MITS requirements cannot be applied to him, since the Gilday injunction bans all \"interceptions\" of his calls, absent a relevant court order, legislative authorization, or authoritative decision specifically permitting the challenged MITS practices in their prison context;  second, since he has never consented to the MITS regime, DOC call \"detailing\" cannot meet the \"two party consent exception\" under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(4), even assuming consent by the party called;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  and third, even assuming he were found to have given implicit consent by utilizing the MITS, the injunctive ban on \"interceptions\" is infringed by DOC call \"detailing,\" because it secretly records the outside number dialed by the inmate before the other party can consent;  for example, should the outside phone not be answered.  All these contentions likewise fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with monitoring and recording, see supra pp. 288-89, virtually all call \"detailing\" conducted under the MITS regime is thoroughly advertised.  In addition to the MITS Regulations, the \"Number Request Form\" itself discloses that all inmate calls are subject to call \"detailing.\"   Moreover, the recorded message heard both by the inmate and the call recipient advises that their entire conversation and all \"call detail\" will be recorded.  Thus, whatever \"detailing\" occurs after the call recipient is so advised by the recorded message comports with the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, as both parties have been fully informed in advance that their entire oral communication, as well as all \"call detail,\" will be recorded.  See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 339 (non-secret recordings not \"interceptions\" under Massachusetts Wiretap Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At summary judgment, however, Gilday proffered unrebutted evidence that the outside number dialed by the inmate is recorded before the call is answered;  in other words, before the prerecorded message announcing the MITS monitoring/recording regime has been heard by the party who answers the call.  Thus, the number called by the inmate will have been subjected to call \"detailing,\" whether or not the party called answers the phone or withholds \"consent\" to the MITS recording and call \"detailing\" procedure subsequently announced in the prerecorded message.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Gilday therefore contends that defendants violate the injunction by \"endeavoring\" to record call \"detail\" during the interim between the dialing of the outside number by the inmate and before the call can be answered and accepted--what we shall refer to as \"interim call detailing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday relies heavily on a line of SJC decisions, see, e.g., District Attorney for Plymouth Dist. v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 379 Mass. 586, 399 N.E.2d 866 (1980), treating with \"pen registers\" and \"call traps,\" telephone equipment consisting of electronic devices which surreptitiously record, respectively, the number called or the number from which an incoming call was placed.  These authoritative decisions hold that such electronic devices do record call \"contents,\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, since they acquire \" 'information concerning the identity of the parties to such communication or the existence ... of that communication.' \"  Id., 399 N.E.2d at 869 (quoting Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(5)).  Thus, \"[e]ven if the call is not completed, the caller has initiated a wire communication ... which is intended to cause ... [the call recipient's] telephone to ring and the existence of that communication is recorded by an intercepting device.\"  Id. Be this as it may, however, it gains Gilday nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First of all, it is important to note that the SJC's definition of \"wire communication,\" see id., would not encompass an attempt by an inmate to call a number not on the preapproved MITS list, since the MITS regime automatically prevents such calls from getting past its \"host processors,\" the computers which control the outflow of inmate calls from the prison.  Consequently, inmate attempts to dial numbers not approved under the MITS regime cannot cause an outside telephone to ring, because the call cannot be connected to the point of reception.   Accordingly, there can have been no \"wire communication,\" which is defined as \"any communication ... by the aid of wire, cable or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(1).  (Emphasis added.)   Second, should an inmate initiate a call through the MITS regime, he will already have completed the \"Number Request Form,\" thereby divulging in advance to the DOC--the very entity which previously advertised its intention to monitor and record all outgoing inmate calls to nonattorneys--both the telephone number and the name and relationship of the family member or friend to whom the call is directed.  See supra p. 281.  Third, no reported Massachusetts decision has ever involved sufficiently similar circumstances so as to constitute an authoritative decision that call \"detailing\" in the present context is unlawful.  Cf., e.g., Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 338-40 (discussing residential telephone subscriber's interceptions of incoming calls to ascertain calling number and identity of unknown caller);  District Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 399 N.E.2d at 867, 869-70 (discussing judicial power to compel telephone company, pursuant to warrant, to assist installation of cross-frame-unit trap on particular telephone line in order to record telephone numbers from which incoming calls were made in circumstances where callers' numbers and identities had not already been divulged by callers in advance);  New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. District Attorney For Norfolk Dist., 374 Mass. 569, 373 N.E.2d 960, 962 (1978) (discussing judicial power to order telephone company to assist installation of pen register to determine telephone numbers dialed from particular phone);  District Attorney for Plymouth Dist. v. Coffey, 386 Mass. 218, 434 N.E.2d 1276, 1278 (1982) (discussing warrantless interception by telephone company of calls to residential line to ascertain previously unknown telephone numbers from which incoming, harassing telephone calls were being made).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Gilday has never alleged an intention to call a telephone number or party not listed by him on the required MITS \"Number Request Form,\" see supra p. 281, even assuming he were to elect to utilize the MITS.  Instead, since there can be no secretive acquisition of information already provided to the DOC, see supra pp. 288-89 (noting that \"secretive\" interceptions presume lack of knowledge), Gilday simply assumes, sub silentio, that any putative number(s) and person(s) he might call would not already have been known to the DOC before the call was placed.  Absent evidence on this critical point, however, there can have been no prima facie showing that any surreptitious or secretive \"interception\" would occur, let alone did occur, within the meaning of the Massachusetts Wiretap Act.  See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 340 (holding that a secretive \"interception\" has occurred unless both parties to the call had \"actual knowledge\" of the intrusion).  In all events, as noted above, see supra p. 292, were Gilday to continue to withhold consent but attempt to place a call--or consent, yet attempt to call a number not previously approved by the DOC--the MITS computers would screen out the attempted call.  Thus, under Massachusetts law, no \"wire communication\" could occur.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(1) (defining \"wire communication\" as any \"connection between the point of origin and the point of reception \") (emphasis added);  see also District Attorney for Plymouth Dist. v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 379 Mass. 586, 399 N.E.2d 866, 869 (1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, any attempt to dial a number not previously disclosed by an inmate on the Number Request Form:  (i) results in no \"wire communication\" to the person called, as it cannot proceed beyond the prison, see supra p. 292;  and (ii) voluntarily discloses to the DOC the number called, without any \"wire communication\" having taken place.  Thus, interim call \"detailing\" under the MITS regime is neither \"secretive\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, nor an \"interception\" within the scope of the Gilday injunction.  Accordingly, the district court supportably determined that the challenged MITS practices did not violate the Massachusetts-law component in the Gilday injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no basis for the conclusory contention that the Gilday injunction is violated simply by the MITS regulatory requirement that he, like any other inmate, consent to the MITS regime, including call \"detailing,\" as a prerequisite to utilizing the MITS--hence, that the consent requirement constitutes a coercive endeavor to intercept Gilday's wire communications in violation of the injunction.  See supra pp. 290-91.   First, its unstated premise that Gilday is entitled to utilize prison phones even though he withholds consent is groundless.  As a prison inmate, Gilday can identify no federal or state right--constitutional or otherwise--to utilize a prison phone on his own terms.  See, e.g., Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1100 (6th Cir.1994) (stating that \"a prisoner's right to telephone access is 'subject to rational limitations in the face of legitimate security interests of the penal institution' \") (quoting Strandberg v. City of Helena, 791 F.2d 744, 747 (9th Cir.1986));  see also Feeley v. Sampson, 570 F.2d 364, 374 (1st Cir.1978) (stating that the right of pretrial detainees to make telephone calls, while \"not free from doubt[,]\" is subject to reasonable restrictions);  Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 92 (upholding MITS limitations on inmate telephone access as constitutional, and citing Bellamy v. McMickens, 692 F.Supp. 205, 214 (S.D.N.Y.1988), for the proposition that prisoners have no right to unrestricted telephone use).  Second, the Gilday injunction does not purport to ban call \"detailing\" lawfully conducted under federal and state law.  See supra pp. 280-81, 286-88.   And since MITS call \"detailing\" cannot occur absent inmate consent--a prerequisite to access to the MITS, see supra pp. 281-82--the very least that can be said is that there is no clearly-defined, see Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17, \"interception\" under either federal or state law, see supra pp. 292-93;  infra pp. 296-98.   Third, the verb \"endeavor,\" meaning \"to work with set purpose,\" or \"make an effort\" to accomplish a particular purpose, see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 748 (1986)--here, allegedly, to conduct unlawful interceptions of Gilday's wire communications--cannot bear the weight he places on it.  Given the uncontroverted evidence that extensive inmate fraud and criminal activity necessitated the MITS, see supra p. 280, Gilday cannot demonstrate that the establishment of the MITS--universally available exclusively to inmates who consent to its terms (including Gilday, should he elect to participate)--constituted an \"endeavor\" to \"detail\" Gilday's telephone calls unlawfully, and thus constituted a clear violation of the Gilday injunction, see Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again we emphasize the obvious simply because it is so consistently elided by Gilday, both below and on appeal:  The Gilday injunction grants Gilday no right or privilege to place any telephone call, nor has Gilday cited any authoritative decision indicating that conditioning prison-telephone utilization on informed prisoner consent to reasonable prison-security safeguards violates a federal or state right.  See Langton, 71 F.3d at 936 (stating:  \"at the least, grounds exist for genuine dispute\" about whether DOC \"defendants are authorized by law\" to require prisoner consent to MITS regime) (citing Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that \"implied consent\" is inferred from circumstances indicating that party knowingly agreed to surveillance));  see also Washington, 35 F.3d at 1100 (prison may impose rational limits on inmate telephone access, including subjecting inmates to MITS-type system);  Strandberg, 791 F.2d at 747 (prisoner's right to telephone access subject to reasonable restrictions);  Feeley, 570 F.2d at 374 (right of pretrial detainees to place telephone calls is subject to reasonable restrictions);  Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 90 (upholding MITS as reasonable security measure).  But cf.  United States v. Cheely, 814 F.Supp. 1430, 1443-44 (D.Alaska 1992) (rejecting argument that prison may deem consent implied in situations where inmate must consent to terms in order to place calls, but finding surveillance of prison phones \"a necessary price for prison security\"), aff'd, 36 F.3d 1439 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Gilday injunction does not purport to entitle Gilday to utilize the MITS without acceding to lawful restrictions founded upon reasonable prison-security measures.  Furthermore, inmates who voluntarily withhold their consent retain their constitutional right to communicate with their attorneys (and with family and friends) through prison visitations and the mail.  Thus, it is unfounded supposition to suggest that the DOC has \"endeavored\" to do anything other than afford inmates the opportunity to utilize the MITS, subject to reasonable restrictions designed to preclude fraud, crime, and misuse of the prison telephone system.  Accordingly, the claim that the DOC is \"endeavoring\" to \"detail\" Gilday's telephone calls in violation of the Gilday injunction fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even assuming, arguendo, that Gilday were to overcome all other hurdles, in fine his call \"detailing\" claim engenders substantial justiciability concerns not addressed by the parties.  Article III, section 2, of the United States Constitution confines federal court jurisdiction to actual \"cases\" and \"controversies.\"   U.S. Const. art.  III, &#167; 2.  Article III was designed to ensure that federal courts decide only disputes of \"a Judiciary nature,\" M. Farrand, 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 430 (1911), thereby prohibiting advisory opinions, Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).  In order to satisfy the \"case or controversy\" requirement, the plaintiff must demonstrate \" 'a personal stake in the outcome[,]' \" City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962)), and the complaint must present a controversy neither \"conjectural [n]or hypothetical,\" but both \"real and immediate,\" see id. at 102, 103 S.Ct. at 1665, without regard to the type of relief sought, see Skelly Oil v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S.Ct. 876, 878-79, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the showings required under the \"case or controversy\" requirement is \"ripeness,\" which governs when a proper party may bring a justiciable action consistent with Article III.  See Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric.  Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 580, 105 S.Ct. 3325, 3332, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985) (\" '[R]ipeness is peculiarly a question of timing.' \")  (quoting Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 140, 95 S.Ct. 335, 357, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974)).  The basic rationale underlying the ripeness doctrine is \"to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\"  Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967);  Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Dev.  Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 200, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1720, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983) (same).  The ripeness determination thus turns on \" 'the fitness of the issues for judicial decision' and 'the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.' \"  Id. at 201, 103 S.Ct. at 1720 (quoting Abbott Lab., 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515);  Lincoln House, Inc. v. Dupre, 903 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir.1990) (same).  As we have explained, \"[p]erhaps the most important consideration in determining whether a claim is ripe for adjudication is the extent to which 'the claim involves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.' \"  Id. (quoting 13A Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3532.2, at 141 (1984)).  See also Metzenbaum v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 675 F.2d 1282, 1289-90 (D.C.Cir.1982);  A/S J.

Nor can it simply be presumed that the DOC will \"detail\" unlawfully any call to which Gilday might be a party in the future, nor even that he would dial a number which might prompt a call \"detail\" report.  See Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 461 U.S. at 200, 103 S.Ct. at 1720.   Thus, the call \"detailing\" claim, in fine, \" 'involves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.' \"  Lincoln House, 903 F.2d at 847 (quoting 13A Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3532.2, at 141 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the claims premised on the Massachusetts Wiretap Act are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Thus, \"a reviewing court must inquire into the dimensions of the consent and then ascertain whether the interception exceeded those boundaries.\"  Id. at 119 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prerecorded MITS message explicitly advises that \"[a]ll call detail and conversation, excluding approved attorney calls, will be recorded,\" see supra p. 296 (emphasis added), thereby informing the call recipient that the entire \"contents\" will be intercepted.  Consequently, notwithstanding the absence of explicit notice of the lesser intrusion represented by possible monitoring of call content,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> the recipient is fully informed of the greater intrusion;  viz., that the entire conversation, as well as all call \"detail,\" will be intercepted and recorded.  See id.;   see also Williams, 11 F.3d at 281-82 (discussing elements of implied consent).  Thus, since the MITS records the entire conversation, any concurrent aural monitoring by authorized DOC officials in no sense exceeds the dimensions of the broad implied consent given to record all call \"content,\" including call \"detail.\"   See Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 114, 116-19 (finding implied consent to interceptions, consisting of concurrent aural monitoring and recording of telephone conversations, after plaintiff had been informed of the recording only and no restrictions had been placed on the scope of the interceptions);  see also Williams, 11 F.3d at 282 (stating that implied consent obtains where party to conversation was provided with at least \"minimal knowledge\" of scope of interception).  Therefore, based on the relevant authoritative decisions, it is at the very least an open question whether the express prior consent provided by MITS-call recipients to the recordation of all call \"content\" constitutes implied consent to monitoring.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as this is a civil contempt proceeding it was for Gilday to prove that the DOC defendants \"violated a clear and unambiguous order that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was to be expected\" and that the DOC was \" 'able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts ...

Since the Gilday injunction bans only unlawful practices by the DOC defendants, see supra pp. 286-87 and authoritative decisions supportably indicate--at the very least--that the challenged MITS practices constitute lawful monitoring, Gilday has not demonstrated a \"clear and unambiguous\" violation of Title III.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that Gilday failed to establish a violation of the Gilday injunction, either by the DOC or by its putative aiders and abettors, NET and AT&amp;T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Gilday argues that the terms of the Gilday injunction grant him a \"federal right to be free of any interception of his wire communications not specifically permitted under the terms of the Permanent Injunction.\"   From this mistaken premise he maintains that the DOC defendants violated section 1983 by implementing the MITS under color of Massachusetts law in violation of the Gilday injunction, thereby depriving him of a \"federal right.\"   Likewise, he claims that AT &amp; T and NET are state actors, liable for aiding and abetting the alleged violations by the DOC defendants.

See Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 89 n. 9</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> Although Gilday argues on appeal that interim call \"detailing\" would violate the Massachusetts Wiretap Act because it would record inmate attempts to call telephone numbers not listed on their respective Number Request Forms--i.e., that MITS call \"detailing\" takes place even though the inmate calls a party not on the Number Request Form, hence not already known to the DOC--he has never alleged an intention to make such calls-- i.e., to circumvent the requirements of the MITS--even assuming he were to participate in it.  Thus, the present attempt to hypothesize an abstract interim call \"detailing\" violation raises no justiciable case or controversy, as the injunction simply prohibits the DOC from intercepting or endeavoring to intercept any wire communication by Gilday.  See Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Dev.  Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 203, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1721-22, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983) (declining on Article III ripeness grounds to consider constitutionality of California law allowing State to block construction of nuclear power plants lacking adequate storage capacity for spent nuclear fuel, because the Court \"cannot know\" if State \"will ever find a nuclear plant's storage capacity to be inadequate\");  Lincoln House, Inc. v.

Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(3)(a), excepts from its definition of the term \"intercepting device\" any device or apparatus \"furnished to a subscriber or user by a communications common carrier in the ordinary course of its business under its tariff and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business.\"   The SJC has indicated that institutional efforts to ensure security constitute activities in the \"ordinary course of business\" for &#167; 99(B)(3)(a) purposes.  See Crosland v. Horgan, 401 Mass. 271, 516 N.E.2d 147, 150 (1987) (stating that preservation of security may be viewed as within hospital's \"ordinary course of business\").  Similarly, the SJC has stated that maintenance of security is \"an essential incident to the business of a prison.\"  Id. (dicta) (describing purport of Campiti v. Walonis, 453 F.Supp. 819, 822 (D.Mass.1978), aff'd, 611 F.2d 387 (1st Cir.1979)).  Perhaps most significantly, in response to a constitutional challenge the SJC has held that the MITS serves \"the legitimate purpose of improving the security of the Massachusetts correctional system\" by acting as a \"deterrent against improper use\" of prison telephones.  Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 90</p>\n        <p>Thus, it can be concluded, with considerable confidence in our judgment, that the issue as to whether corrections officials may intercept MITS calls in the \"ordinary course of [prison] business,\" under the protection of &#167; 99(B)(3)(a), is at the very least reasonably debatable, and, therefore, that Gilday's contention comes a cropper.  See Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17 (stating that injunction must leave \"no reasonable doubt\" what conduct is prohibited);  see also Langton, 71 F.3d at 936 (finding \"reasonably debatable\" the issue as to whether MITS monitoring comes within the \"ordinary course of business of a law enforcement officer\" as defined by Federal Wiretap Act).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> Call \"detailing,\" moreover, is not within the ambit of the Federal Wiretap Act, as it simply captures electronic signals relating to the PIN of the caller, the number called, and the date, time and length of the call.  See 103 C.M.R. &#167; 482.06(1).  The Federal Wiretap Act defines \"interception\" as an \"aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(4) (emphasis added).  Subsection 2510(8) in turn defines \"contents\" as \"any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of [the] ... communication.\"  Id. &#167; 2510(8)</p>\n        <p>The United States Supreme Court, in an analogous context, has held that \"pen registers\"--devices which can record any number dialed from a particular telephone--do not violate the Federal Wiretap Act \"because they do not acquire the contents of communications as that term is defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(8).\"  United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 167, 98 S.Ct. 364, 369, 54 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977).  Similarly, the SJC has held that pen registers \"are not governed by Title III, since there is no 'aural acquisition' of anything.\"  District Attorney For Norfolk District, 373 N.E.2d at 962.   The legislative history of the 1986 Amendments to the Federal Wiretap Act likewise indicates that Congress intended to exclude call \"detailing\" devices.  See S.Rep. No. 99-541, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess., reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555 (stating that devices which record electronic data \"capture no part\" of the contents of \"an actual telephone conversation\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> The MITS regime permits random monitoring, as well as particularized investigative monitoring--the latter based on suspected criminal activity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> Although it has been held--outside the prison context--that mere \"knowledge of the capability of monitoring alone cannot be considered implied consent,\" Watkins, 704 F.2d at 581 (emphasis in original), under the MITS the recipient of the call is informed that the entire call will be recorded</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> Various federal decisions have upheld similar prison monitoring and recording practices under the Federal Wiretap Act.

Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has suggested that in circumstances where an employee is believed to be committing a crime or making excessive personal calls, employer monitoring of employee phone calls may not be an unlawful \"interception\" under the \"ordinary use\" exception applicable to extension phones in &#167; 2510(5)(a)(i).

In 1974, Gilday commenced a civil rights action in federal district court against various FBI and DOC officials, see Gilday v. Webster, No. 74-4169-C, alleging interference with attorney-client communications in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and violations of the federal and state wiretap statutes, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510 et seq., and Mass.

The DOC responded in 1993 by inviting telephone-system vendors to furnish, install, and maintain an advanced prison telephone system designed to deter inmate abuses by monitoring, recording, and \"detailing\" their calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, NET contracted to produce, install, and maintain an inmate telephone system for all DOC facilities, which became known as the Massachusetts Inmate Telephone System (\"MITS\"), to supply both local and long distance service and remit to the DOC forty percent of the gross revenues from inmate calls.  NET in turn subcontracted with AT &amp; T to furnish long distance MITS service.  A third company, Telematic Corporation, contracted with AT &amp; T and NET to provide the electronic equipment and software needed to provision the system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 8, 1994, the DOC promulgated new inmate telephone regulations, see 103 C.M.R. &#167;&#167; 482.00 et seq.  (\"MITS Regulations\"), \"establish[ing] Department procedures regarding access to, use of and the monitoring and/or recording of inmate telephones.\"  Id. &#167; 482.01.  Under the MITS Regulations, a personal identification number (\"PIN\") is randomly assigned to each inmate.  The inmate must dial the assigned PIN immediately before dialing the telephone number, whereupon an automatic operator completes the connection.  No more than fifteen designated parties are accessible with any PIN:  ten friends and family members and five attorneys.  See id. &#167; 482.07(3)(c);  Bender Aff. p 8. The right to call designated attorneys may not be suspended or curtailed except during an institutional emergency, see id. &#167;&#167; 482.08-482.09, whereas the right to call other designated parties is subject to disciplinary restriction, see id. &#167;&#167; 482.07(3)(h), 482.09.  In addition, all inmates are allowed to call three prison legal-service organizations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stickers on all MITS telephones alert inmates to the monitoring/recording regime.  All inmate calls, except preauthorized attorney calls and legal-service organization calls, are automatically recorded.  Certain \"detailing\" information is recorded on all calls either attempted or completed.  Finally, all except attorney and legal-service organization calls may be subjected to concurrent monitoring (i.e., listened in on) by authorized DOC personnel, either at random or for investigative purposes.  See id. &#167; 482.07(3)(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to obtain an individual PIN, the inmate must complete and sign a \"Number Request Form,\" designating the attorney and nonattorney telephone numbers which may be called.  The form advises inmates that their \"acceptance and use of a PIN and use of inmate telephones shall be deemed as consent to the conditions and restrictions placed upon inmate telephone calls, including call monitoring, recording, and call detail.\"   All inmate calls must be placed \"collect.\"  Id. &#167; 482.07(3)(a).  Each call begins with a recorded message--audible by both parties--that the call has been placed \"collect\" by a DOC inmate and is subject to recordation and \"detailing.\"   See id. &#167; 482.07(3)(g);  Kennedy Aff. p 10.  Both parties hear the entire message, but there can be no communication until the collect call has been accepted by the person called.  See 103 C.M.R. &#167; 482.07(3)(f);  Bender Aff. p 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday declined to submit a PIN request form, on the ground that the MITS contravenes the federal and state wiretap statutes and therefore violates the Gilday injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  At about the same time, Gilday mailed AT &amp; T and NET copies of the Gilday injunction entered September 12, 1984, see supra p. 280, advising that their provision of MITS services would violate the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter Gilday petitioned the federal district court for a contempt citation against AT &amp; T, NET, and various DOC officials, claiming that the defendants were \"endeavoring to intercept\" his telephone communications.  Although neither AT &amp; T nor NET was privy to the Gilday injunction, Gilday asserted that both received actual notice by mail, supra pp. 281-82, and therefore knowingly aided and abetted the alleged violations by the DOC defendants.  Finally, Gilday alleged, the defendants were depriving him of his \"federal right to be free of any interception of his wire communications,\" as well as his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and his Fourteenth Amendment right of access to the courts, by restricting consultation with counsel regarding six pending judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered summary judgment for the defendants, on the ground that the Gilday injunction bans neither monitoring nor recording, but only \"interceptions.\"   It noted that no secretive, nonconsensual monitoring or recording--hence no \"interception\"--had occurred under either wiretap statute, since all recording and monitoring is well advertised as required by the MITS Regulations.  See supra p. 281.  The district court reasoned that inmates render the MITS monitoring/recording regime consensual by executing the request form and utilizing the MITS.  And since it found the term \"interception\" ambiguous at best, the district court determined to resolve any interpretive doubts favorably to the defendants.  Finally, it dismissed the Gilday claims relating to call \"detailing,\" on the ground that Langton v. Hogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709489\"><a href=\"/opinion/709489/william-langton-and-david-leblanc-v-william-hogan-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), had already endorsed the MITS practice in this regard.  Accordingly, it concluded that the attendant recording and monitoring did not constitute an \"interception\" under either the federal or state wiretap statute, thus did not contravene the Gilday injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the district court dismissed the section 1983 claims as well, on the ground that Gilday retained all mail privileges, access to a prison law library, the right to meet with counsel and, under the MITS regulations, the right to conduct unmonitored telephone communications with five attorneys and three legal-service organizations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A.

Thus, as the district court ruling on the petition for modification in Langton neither addressed nor implicated the question whether the MITS violates either the state or federal wiretap statute, see Langton, No. 79-2167-Z, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">96948</span></span>, it neither \"actually\" nor \"necessarily\" determined that the MITS regime violated the Langton injunction, let alone the Gilday injunction.

See supra pp. 280-81 (\"All [DOC agents] are enjoined permanently ... from ... endeavoring to intercept ... any wire communication by or to [Gilday] ... except as specifically permitted by these statutes ... as they have been construed or may be construed in [authoritative decisions].\").

As the district court recognized, Gilday had alleged in his 1974 action against the DOC that he was the target of two secret federal and state law enforcement efforts, directed by the FBI and code-named \"STOP\" and \"GILROB,\" aimed at gathering information about his as-yet unapprehended accomplices in the Brighton bank robbery.  See supra p. 280.  In securing the 1984 consent decree, therefore, Gilday obtained permanent injunctive relief from any DOC participation in current or future wire-communication interceptions unlawfully directed against him by these state and federal law enforcement agencies--consideration unavailable to the Langton litigants.  Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Gilday consent decree permitted the DOC to litigate future unresolved issues relating to the meaning of the applicable wiretap statutes, Gilday obtained substantial consideration for entering into the settlement with the DOC.  Thus, the Langton panel majority's concerns over a lack of meaningful consideration for the Langton plaintiffs' consent are not implicated to the same degree in the present context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Langton and Gilday cases presented themselves in materially different ways on appeal.  The Langton panel was asked to review, inter alia, a district court ruling denying a DOC petition to modify the Langton injunction.  See id. at 931.   On appeal, the DOC claimed that the district court had broadened the injunction impermissibly in favor of the Langton inmates.  Id. at 933.   The Langton panel majority first decided that the parties had relinquished their respective rights to litigate the meaning of the wiretap statutes underlying the injunction, and then determined that no authoritative decision, existing at the time the Langton injunction issued, specifically supported the challenged MITS monitoring and recording practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Langton majority went on to survey subsequent decisional law, simply noting--without resolving the merits--that \"reasonable [competing] arguments can be advanced\" as to whether the challenged MITS monitoring and recording regime violated the federal wiretap statute.  Id. at 935-37;  see also id. at 940 (\"Nor does the panel majority hold that the present regime is unlawful under the federal and state statutes but only that reasonable arguments can be made on both sides.\")  (Boudin, J., dissenting ) (emphasis in original).  Thus, the Langton majority simply decided that the DOC had failed to carry its burden of demonstrating any change in the law, or the facts, which would warrant modification of the injunction. See id. at 937-38 (sustaining modification ruling as \"appropriately tailored to the only changes in law or in fact disclosed on the record before the district court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, on the other hand, Gilday alleges DOC violations of an injunction which expressly contemplates that authoritative decisions subsequent to the Gilday injunction may determine whether a violation has occurred.  See supra pp. 283-84.   Moreover, since the Langton panel majority never reached the merits regarding the lawfulness of the MITS regime under either wiretap statute, see supra p. 284, we may consider afresh whether the challenged MITS practices violate the Gilday injunction.  Finally, we are required to review the district court's summary judgment ruling against Gilday de novo.  See Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 874-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the DOC is entitled to litigate the meaning of the applicable wiretap statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. The Gilday Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday argues that the DOC defendants violated the Gilday injunction by endeavoring to monitor and record his wire communications in violation of the state and federal wiretap statutes.  The linchpin in this argument is that no authoritative decision \"specifically\" construes either the federal or state wiretap statute to \"permit\" the inmate-telephone system established under the MITS.  In other words, Gilday argues that the injunction is violated absent an authoritative decision validating either the MITS regime itself or substantially similar practices in a comparable prison context.  At its most particular level, this contention would necessitate an authoritative decision declaring the challenged MITS practices compatible with the applicable wiretap statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We test this contention against the language employed in the Gilday injunction, viewed in its unique litigation context, including the particular circumstances surrounding its formation and the basic purposes it was designed to serve.  See ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 238 (construing ambiguous language in consent decree in light of \"the circumstances surround ing [its] ... formation\");  see also Massachusetts Ass'n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v.

See infra pp. 288-89, 290.   Therefore, Gilday's insistent contention on appeal--that no MITS practice can ever be allowed under the Gilday injunction unless it has been \"specifically permitted\" beforehand by an authoritative decision--cannot succeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming Gilday were to demonstrate an \"interception,\" the injunction expressly excepts from its reach any practice \"specifically permitted\" under the wiretap statutes as construed in authoritative decisions, see supra pp. 280-81, and the term \"specifically permitted\" is susceptible to various reasonable interpretations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  On the one hand, \"specifically permitted\" may be read to require an authoritative decision that the MITS regime, as applied directly to Gilday, comports with the applicable wiretap statutes.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2187 (1986) (noting that term \"specific\" may connote restriction \"to a particular individual\");  see also Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118010\"><a href=\"/opinion/118010/barnett-bank-of-marion-cty-na-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span> (1996) (noting that \" '[s]pecifically' can mean 'explicitly, particularly, [or] definitively' \") (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1398 (6th ed.1990) (emphasis added)).  Under such a reading, an authoritative decision would be unavailing to the DOC defendants unless it explicitly addressed the MITS monitoring and recording of wire communications involving Gilday.  On the other hand, \"specifically permitted\" may contemplate simply an authoritative decision upholding interceptions involving some other DOC inmate or DOC inmates in general.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary at 2187 (noting that \"specific\" may merely restrict to a particular situation).  Under these interpretations, therefore, Gilday would need to demonstrate simply an absence of authoritative decisions specifically permitting the challenged MITS practices as applied directly to him or to similarly situated inmates.  See Langton, 71 F.3d at 935-37 (noting no reported decision \"holding that this type of prison telephone monitoring system\" meets \"consent\" exception to federal wiretap statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, at a more universal level, \"specifically permitted\" may simply contemplate an authoritative decision upholding the general types or kinds of monitoring and recording practices prescribed by the MITS, without regard to whether the practices were employed in a prison context.  See 2 The Oxford English Dictionary 2949 (Compact Ed.1987) (defining \"specifically\" as \"[i]n something of the same kind\");  see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary at 2187 (defining \"specific\" as \"constituting or falling into the category specified\");  Webster's New World Dictionary of American English 1287 (3d ed.1988) (defining \"specific\" as being \"of a special, or particular, sort or kind\");  Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1132 (1989) (defining \"specific\" as \"sharing or being those properties of something that allow it to be referred to a particular category\").  Under the latter interpretation, of course, Gilday would need to demonstrate an absence of authoritative decisions vindicating the kinds of practices utilized under the MITS, without necessary regard to the exact context in which the practices were applied, thereby implicating any relevant authoritative decision addressing the applicable wiretap statutes.  Thus, under the latter interpretation only unlawful MITS practices would be barred by the Gilday injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ambiguities in an injunctive decree are construed in the light most favorable to the alleged contemnor.

Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure:  Civil &#167; 2955, at 310 (1995 &amp; Supp.1996) (same).  For present purposes, therefore, the Gilday injunction would be construed as banning only unlawful interceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigation context underlying the Gilday consent decree likewise commends the latter construction.  See ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935 (construing ambiguous consent-decree language in light of \"circumstances surrounding [its] formation ...\");  see also King, 668 F.2d at 607 (similar).  Throughout the district court action terminated by the consent decree, the DOC defendants steadfastly denied \"monitoring,\" \"recording,\" or \"intercepting\" any wire communication involving Gilday.  Thus, implicit in the stance taken by Gilday now is the suggestion that the DOC defendants impliedly conceded prior violations of the relevant wiretap statutes simply by entering into the stipulation of dismissal, whereas the record flatly contradicts any such concession.  Instead, the stipulation of dismissal substantiates the view that the DOC defendants simply agreed to an injunction which required their compliance with the applicable federal and state law governing \"interceptions.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in context, therefore, the Gilday consent decree--entailing no resolution of the central dispute as to whether the DOC defendants ever \"monitored\" or \"recorded,\" let alone \"intercepted,\" any Gilday wire communication--is most harmoniously construed as an agreement that the DOC defendants were to refrain from any \"interception\" violative of either wiretap statute, as determined under either existing or future authoritative decisions.  That is to say, the Gilday consent decree bans only unlawful DOC monitoring and recording practices.  See Settlement Stipulation:  Claims Against Defendants Fair, Vose, Hall and Callahan, Gilday v. Fair, et al., Civ. A. No. 74-4169-C, discussed supra pp. 286-87 &amp; n. 12;  see also supra pp. 280-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggested construction comports with the Langton panel majority opinion as well, which held that the Langton injunction banned any \"interception\" absent \"a specific court order or legislative authorization to do so, except as specifically permitted by these statutes, ... as they have been construed in reported decisions that are binding in this Court or in the state courts of Massachusetts.\"  Langton, 71 F.3d at 931 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Langton panel majority reasoned that the consent decree was to be construed as requiring the DOC defendants to refrain, in perpetuity, from contesting the meaning of the relevant state and federal wiretap statutes \"as construed in reported decisions that [were] binding in [the federal district court] or in the state courts of Massachusetts\" at the time the Langton injunction was entered, see id. at 931, 933-35, as distinguished from merely requiring the DOC defendants to refrain from unlawful interceptions.  As the Langton panel majority viewed the matter, any other approach threatened to render the terms of the Langton injunction \"illusory--stating nothing beyond what was already forbidden by law before the Permanent Injunction was entered.\"  Id. at 933 (emphasis added);  but see id. at 940 (Boudin, J., dissenting );  see also supra p. 284.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The panel majority relied as well on the final section in the Langton injunction, which stated in terms similar to the Gilday injunction, see supra p. 280, that the injunction \"shall not of its own force affect the rights of inmates of the Department other than William Langton and David LeBlanc.\"   See Langton, 71 F.3d at 933.   It reasoned that had the DOC promised merely to obey the law, no purpose would have been served by the quoted provision.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, however, the two cases presented themselves on appeal in materially different postures.  First, as discussed supra pp. 284-85, the repeated observation by the Langton panel majority, see Langton, 71 F.3d at 933-37--that no then-existing authoritative decision specifically permitted the challenged MITS practices and that the Langton decree would be rendered meaningless were it to be construed as a mere promise to obey the law--is inapposite to the instant context.  That is, central to the present analysis is the explicit language in the Gilday injunction (\"or may be construed in reported decisions\"), see supra p. 280 (emphasis added)--nowhere to be found in the Langton injunction, see 71 F.3d at 931--which in no sense purports to prohibit either (i) these parties from litigating open questions as to the meaning of the applicable wiretap statutes, or (ii) our consideration of later authoritative decisions upholding monitoring and recording practices of the kind prescribed by the MITS, see infra pp. 45-48.   Second, since the settlement stipulation and the consent decree in Gilday were entered into while the parties in Langton were still litigating the initial action which led to the Langton injunction, paragraph 3 in the Gilday injunction (viz., \"[t]his Permanent Injunction ... shall not ... affect the rights of inmates other than William Gilday[,]\") served the discrete purpose of not disturbing the rights of the Langton inmates whose initial action against the DOC was to remain in litigation for two months after the consent decree was entered in Gilday.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, unlike the corresponding provision in the Langton injunction, paragraph 3 in the Gilday injunction is entirely consistent with the view that the Gilday injunction simply contemplates that the DOC not violate the applicable wiretap statutes.  For these reasons we conclude, notwithstanding their similarities, that the Gilday injunction is substantially less restrictive in scope than the Langton injunction, in that it unambiguously enjoins only unlawful recording and monitoring practices by the DOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Massachusetts Wiretap Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must now consider whether Gilday demonstrated by \"clear and convincing evidence,\" Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16, that the challenged MITS practices constitute unlawful interceptions under the applicable wiretap statutes, beginning with the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, bearing in mind that it was for Gilday to show that the DOC defendants \"violated a clear and unambiguous order that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was to be expected\" and that the defendants were \" 'able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.' \"  Id. at 17 (quoting Drywall Tapers, 889 F.2d at 395).   First, we inquire whether the monitoring, recording, and call \"detailing\" practices prescribed by the MITS Regulations are \"interceptions\" under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(4).  Second, should Gilday successfully surmount the first hurdle, we determine whether any such interpretation is nevertheless permitted under any authoritative decision binding on the federal district court.  Finally, we conclude that Gilday failed to prove either that the monitoring and recording practices conducted pursuant to the MITS constitute \"interceptions\" under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, or that the MITS call \"detailing\" practices were clearly prohibited under the Gilday injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Monitoring and Recording</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting that the Gilday injunction prohibits only \"interceptions\" under the applicable statutes and not call monitoring, recording, or \"detailing\" per se.   The term \"interception,\" as used in the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, \"means to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record, the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any intercepting device....\"  Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts courts have interpreted this \"secrecy\" requirement literally.

A secretive interception occurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act unless both parties to a wire \"communication\" had \"actual knowledge\" of the \"interception,\" see, e.g., Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 340, which may be established by evidence that the parties were informed that their conversation was being intercepted, or by \"clear and unequivocal objective manifestations of knowledge ... sufficiently probative of a person's state of mind as to allow an inference of knowledge.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly concluded, the recording and monitoring practices at issue here were in no sense surreptitious.  Inmates are informed in advance, both by the MITS Regulations--a matter of public record--and the individualized PIN Request Form advisory as well, that their MITS calls will be monitored and recorded.  Moreover, inmates are reminded by stickers affixed to each phone that all non-attorney calls are subject to the monitoring and recording practices prescribed by the MITS Regulations.  Finally, a prerecorded message informs both parties--before the parties can communicate--that all call \"contents\" will be recorded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") has decided that even inmates who \"have not consented to the [MITS] monitoring and recording\"--such as Gilday--nonetheless have been \"made aware of the procedure and its requirements.\"  Cacicio v.

Thus, no \"interception\" occurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act if the device used to acquire the contents of a wire communication comes within the ambit of the \"telephone equipment\" exception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The MITS employs a sophisticated network of computers and associated telephone equipment, including \"controller boards\"--electronic call processing devices attached to each prison telephone--supplied, installed, and maintained by NET.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  The NET equipment automatically screens approved outside telephone numbers from unapproved numbers, routes inmate calls to approved telephone numbers outside the prison, plays the prerecorded message to both parties, and identifies calls placed to listed attorneys so as to preclude their monitoring and recordation. All call \"detail\" is recorded automatically by the NET telephone equipment in order to generate billing reports and safeguard the NET equipment against fraudulent use by inmates (i.e., inter alia, unapproved long distance and collect calls).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The monthly revenue statements NET provides under its contract with the DOC reflect \"detail\" on all inmate calls placed, including the number dialed, the length of the call, and other billing-related and revenue-related information.  In addition, the NET site administrator at each prison facility regularly generates a so-called \"Fraud Report,\" listing all outside telephone numbers to which the total number of calls placed by inmates within the reporting period exceeded a specified level.  The Fraud Report is forwarded to NET and the DOC for use in investigating fraudulent telephone usage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the above-described evidentiary framework, we now inquire whether the MITS call \"detailing\" conducted by NET is excepted from the Massachusetts Wiretap Act definition of \"intercepting device\" in &#167; 99(B)(3)(b).  See supra pp. 289-90.   First, we note that NET is a \"communication common carrier\" within the contemplation of &#167; 99(B)(3).  See District Attorney for Plymouth Dist. v. Coffey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047358/district-attorney-for-the-plymouth-district-v-coffey/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047358/district-attorney-for-the-plymouth-district-v-coffey/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span>, 1280 (1982).  Second, Gilday does not contend that the processor computers and controller boards used by NET for billing-related purposes are not \"equipment ... being used in the ordinary course of [NET's] business.\"   See Reply Brief for the Plaintiff, Appellant at 6 n. 8 (\"Gilday does not argue that NET is precluded from using call detail for billing purposes.\").  Nor does any authoritative decision suggest that a communication common carrier which \"details\" calls in order to generate billing reports or protect its equipment from fraudulent abuse, does not do so in the ordinary course of its business.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  Thus, Gilday has not demonstrated by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, see Kemp, 947 F.2d at 16, that any call \"detailing\" conducted by NET for its own billing-related purposes falls outside the &#167; 99(B)(3)(b) exception for equipment used by it \"in the ordinary course of its business.\"   Accordingly, no \"interception\" occurs under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, at least by reason of the billing-related \"detailing\" conducted by NET.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday nonetheless insists, however, that the injunction precludes the DOC defendants from acquiring access to any call \"detail\" information and that NET therefore may not aid and abet the DOC by affording access.  See Reply Brief for Plaintiff, Appellant at 6 n. 8. Under the Regulations and the MITS \"Procedural Statement\"--a DOC operations guideline which supplements the MITS Regulations--authorized DOC officers may request both \"standard\" and \"custom\" call \"detail\" reports from NET personnel for investigative purposes, or, after receiving training from NET personnel, print out such call \"detail\" reports themselves.  Moreover, these \"standard\" reports may, at the DOC's option, be configured to provide call \"detail\" relating to an individual inmate's PIN, a particular group of inmate PINs, specific prison telephones used to place calls, or particular telephone numbers dialed.  Finally, since the record discloses no limitation on the domain reserved for the so-called \"custom\" reports, we assume, at the summary judgment stage, see Velez-Gomez, 8 F.3d at 874-75, that NET is obligated to provide the DOC with any and all call \"detail\" requested.  Notwithstanding its advantageous summary judgment posture, however, the Gilday call \"detailing\" claim fails in relation to the DOC defendants as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday claims that the DOC violates the injunctive ban against \"intercepting\" or \"endeavoring to intercept\" his wire communications, see supra pp. 280-81, simply by applying the MITS requirements to him;  in particular, by making his consent a prerequisite to utilizing the MITS.  The claim is premised on several rationales:  first, the MITS requirements cannot be applied to him, since the Gilday injunction bans all \"interceptions\" of his calls, absent a relevant court order, legislative authorization, or authoritative decision specifically permitting the challenged MITS practices in their prison context;  second, since he has never consented to the MITS regime, DOC call \"detailing\" cannot meet the \"two party consent exception\" under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(4), even assuming consent by the party called;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  and third, even assuming he were found to have given implicit consent by utilizing the MITS, the injunctive ban on \"interceptions\" is infringed by DOC call \"detailing,\" because it secretly records the outside number dialed by the inmate before the other party can consent;  for example, should the outside phone not be answered.  All these contentions likewise fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with monitoring and recording, see supra pp. 288-89, virtually all call \"detailing\" conducted under the MITS regime is thoroughly advertised.  In addition to the MITS Regulations, the \"Number Request Form\" itself discloses that all inmate calls are subject to call \"detailing.\"   Moreover, the recorded message heard both by the inmate and the call recipient advises that their entire conversation and all \"call detail\" will be recorded.  Thus, whatever \"detailing\" occurs after the call recipient is so advised by the recorded message comports with the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, as both parties have been fully informed in advance that their entire oral communication, as well as all \"call detail,\" will be recorded.  See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 339 (non-secret recordings not \"interceptions\" under Massachusetts Wiretap Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At summary judgment, however, Gilday proffered unrebutted evidence that the outside number dialed by the inmate is recorded before the call is answered;  in other words, before the prerecorded message announcing the MITS monitoring/recording regime has been heard by the party who answers the call.  Thus, the number called by the inmate will have been subjected to call \"detailing,\" whether or not the party called answers the phone or withholds \"consent\" to the MITS recording and call \"detailing\" procedure subsequently announced in the prerecorded message.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Gilday therefore contends that defendants violate the injunction by \"endeavoring\" to record call \"detail\" during the interim between the dialing of the outside number by the inmate and before the call can be answered and accepted--what we shall refer to as \"interim call detailing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gilday relies heavily on a line of SJC decisions, see, e.g., District Attorney for Plymouth Dist. v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123236\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123236/dist-attorney-for-plymouth-dist-v-new-england-tel/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123236\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123236/dist-attorney-for-plymouth-dist-v-new-england-tel/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span> (1980), treating with \"pen registers\" and \"call traps,\" telephone equipment consisting of electronic devices which surreptitiously record, respectively, the number called or the number from which an incoming call was placed.  These authoritative decisions hold that such electronic devices do record call \"contents,\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, since they acquire \" 'information concerning the identity of the parties to such communication or the existence ... of that communication.' \"  Id., 399 N.E.2d at 869 (quoting Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(5)).  Thus, \"[e]ven if the call is not completed, the caller has initiated a wire communication ... which is intended to cause ... [the call recipient's] telephone to ring and the existence of that communication is recorded by an intercepting device.\"  Id. Be this as it may, however, it gains Gilday nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First of all, it is important to note that the SJC's definition of \"wire communication,\" see id., would not encompass an attempt by an inmate to call a number not on the preapproved MITS list, since the MITS regime automatically prevents such calls from getting past its \"host processors,\" the computers which control the outflow of inmate calls from the prison.  Consequently, inmate attempts to dial numbers not approved under the MITS regime cannot cause an outside telephone to ring, because the call cannot be connected to the point of reception.   Accordingly, there can have been no \"wire communication,\" which is defined as \"any communication ... by the aid of wire, cable or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(1).  (Emphasis added.)   Second, should an inmate initiate a call through the MITS regime, he will already have completed the \"Number Request Form,\" thereby divulging in advance to the DOC--the very entity which previously advertised its intention to monitor and record all outgoing inmate calls to nonattorneys--both the telephone number and the name and relationship of the family member or friend to whom the call is directed.  See supra p. 281.  Third, no reported Massachusetts decision has ever involved sufficiently similar circumstances so as to constitute an authoritative decision that call \"detailing\" in the present context is unlawful.  Cf., e.g., Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 338-40 (discussing residential telephone subscriber's interceptions of incoming calls to ascertain calling number and identity of unknown caller);  District Attorney for Plymouth Dist., 399 N.E.2d at 867, 869-70 (discussing judicial power to compel telephone company, pursuant to warrant, to assist installation of cross-frame-unit trap on particular telephone line in order to record telephone numbers from which incoming calls were made in circumstances where callers' numbers and identities had not already been divulged by callers in advance);  New England Tel. &amp; Tel.

Instead, since there can be no secretive acquisition of information already provided to the DOC, see supra pp. 288-89 (noting that \"secretive\" interceptions presume lack of knowledge), Gilday simply assumes, sub silentio, that any putative number(s) and person(s) he might call would not already have been known to the DOC before the call was placed.  Absent evidence on this critical point, however, there can have been no prima facie showing that any surreptitious or secretive \"interception\" would occur, let alone did occur, within the meaning of the Massachusetts Wiretap Act.  See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 340 (holding that a secretive \"interception\" has occurred unless both parties to the call had \"actual knowledge\" of the intrusion).  In all events, as noted above, see supra p. 292, were Gilday to continue to withhold consent but attempt to place a call--or consent, yet attempt to call a number not previously approved by the DOC--the MITS computers would screen out the attempted call.  Thus, under Massachusetts law, no \"wire communication\" could occur.  See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 272, &#167; 99(B)(1) (defining \"wire communication\" as any \"connection between the point of origin and the point of reception \") (emphasis added);  see also District Attorney for Plymouth Dist. v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123236\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123236/dist-attorney-for-plymouth-dist-v-new-england-tel/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123236\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123236/dist-attorney-for-plymouth-dist-v-new-england-tel/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span>, 869 (1980).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, any attempt to dial a number not previously disclosed by an inmate on the Number Request Form:  (i) results in no \"wire communication\" to the person called, as it cannot proceed beyond the prison, see supra p. 292;  and (ii) voluntarily discloses to the DOC the number called, without any \"wire communication\" having taken place.  Thus, interim call \"detailing\" under the MITS regime is neither \"secretive\" within the meaning of the Massachusetts Wiretap Act, nor an \"interception\" within the scope of the Gilday injunction.  Accordingly, the district court supportably determined that the challenged MITS practices did not violate the Massachusetts-law component in the Gilday injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is no basis for the conclusory contention that the Gilday injunction is violated simply by the MITS regulatory requirement that he, like any other inmate, consent to the MITS regime, including call \"detailing,\" as a prerequisite to utilizing the MITS--hence, that the consent requirement constitutes a coercive endeavor to intercept Gilday's wire communications in violation of the injunction.  See supra pp. 290-91.   First, its unstated premise that Gilday is entitled to utilize prison phones even though he withholds consent is groundless.  As a prison inmate, Gilday can identify no federal or state right--constitutional or otherwise--to utilize a prison phone on his own terms.  See, e.g., Washington v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678535\"><a href=\"/opinion/678535/conchita-washington-sunday-torres-gloria-batton-robinson-antoinette-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span>, 1100 (6th Cir.1994) (stating that \"a prisoner's right to telephone access is 'subject to rational limitations in the face of legitimate security interests of the penal institution' \") (quoting Strandberg v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 214 (S.D.N.Y.1988), for the proposition that prisoners have no right to unrestricted telephone use).  Second, the Gilday injunction does not purport to ban call \"detailing\" lawfully conducted under federal and state law.  See supra pp. 280-81, 286-88.   And since MITS call \"detailing\" cannot occur absent inmate consent--a prerequisite to access to the MITS, see supra pp. 281-82--the very least that can be said is that there is no clearly-defined, see Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17, \"interception\" under either federal or state law, see supra pp. 292-93;  infra pp. 296-98.   Third, the verb \"endeavor,\" meaning \"to work with set purpose,\" or \"make an effort\" to accomplish a particular purpose, see Webster's Third New International Dictionary 748 (1986)--here, allegedly, to conduct unlawful interceptions of Gilday's wire communications--cannot bear the weight he places on it.  Given the uncontroverted evidence that extensive inmate fraud and criminal activity necessitated the MITS, see supra p. 280, Gilday cannot demonstrate that the establishment of the MITS--universally available exclusively to inmates who consent to its terms (including Gilday, should he elect to participate)--constituted an \"endeavor\" to \"detail\" Gilday's telephone calls unlawfully, and thus constituted a clear violation of the Gilday injunction, see Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again we emphasize the obvious simply because it is so consistently elided by Gilday, both below and on appeal:  The Gilday injunction grants Gilday no right or privilege to place any telephone call, nor has Gilday cited any authoritative decision indicating that conditioning prison-telephone utilization on informed prisoner consent to reasonable prison-security safeguards violates a federal or state right.  See Langton, 71 F.3d at 936 (stating:  \"at the least, grounds exist for genuine dispute\" about whether DOC \"defendants are authorized by law\" to require prisoner consent to MITS regime) (citing Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542297\"><a href=\"/opinion/542297/gerald-griggs-ryan-v-beulah-smith-gerald-griggs-ryan-v-richard-connelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990) (holding that \"implied consent\" is inferred from circumstances indicating that party knowingly agreed to surveillance));  see also Washington, 35 F.3d at 1100 (prison may impose rational limits on inmate telephone access, including subjecting inmates to MITS-type system);  Strandberg, 791 F.2d at 747 (prisoner's right to telephone access subject to reasonable restrictions);  Feeley, 570 F.2d at 374 (right of pretrial detainees to place telephone calls is subject to reasonable restrictions);  Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 90 (upholding MITS as reasonable security measure).

Furthermore, inmates who voluntarily withhold their consent retain their constitutional right to communicate with their attorneys (and with family and friends) through prison visitations and the mail.  Thus, it is unfounded supposition to suggest that the DOC has \"endeavored\" to do anything other than afford inmates the opportunity to utilize the MITS, subject to reasonable restrictions designed to preclude fraud, crime, and misuse of the prison telephone system.  Accordingly, the claim that the DOC is \"endeavoring\" to \"detail\" Gilday's telephone calls in violation of the Gilday injunction fails.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even assuming, arguendo, that Gilday were to overcome all other hurdles, in fine his call \"detailing\" claim engenders substantial justiciability concerns not addressed by the parties.  Article III, section 2, of the United States Constitution confines federal court jurisdiction to actual \"cases\" and \"controversies.\"   U.S. Const. art.  III, &#167; 2.

Thus, \"a reviewing court must inquire into the dimensions of the consent and then ascertain whether the interception exceeded those boundaries.\"  Id. at 119 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prerecorded MITS message explicitly advises that \"[a]ll call detail and conversation, excluding approved attorney calls, will be recorded,\" see supra p. 296 (emphasis added), thereby informing the call recipient that the entire \"contents\" will be intercepted.  Consequently, notwithstanding the absence of explicit notice of the lesser intrusion represented by possible monitoring of call content,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> the recipient is fully informed of the greater intrusion;  viz., that the entire conversation, as well as all call \"detail,\" will be intercepted and recorded.  See id.;   see also Williams, 11 F.3d at 281-82 (discussing elements of implied consent).  Thus, since the MITS records the entire conversation, any concurrent aural monitoring by authorized DOC officials in no sense exceeds the dimensions of the broad implied consent given to record all call \"content,\" including call \"detail.\"   See Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 114, 116-19 (finding implied consent to interceptions, consisting of concurrent aural monitoring and recording of telephone conversations, after plaintiff had been informed of the recording only and no restrictions had been placed on the scope of the interceptions);  see also Williams, 11 F.3d at 282 (stating that implied consent obtains where party to conversation was provided with at least \"minimal knowledge\" of scope of interception).  Therefore, based on the relevant authoritative decisions, it is at the very least an open question whether the express prior consent provided by MITS-call recipients to the recordation of all call \"content\" constitutes implied consent to monitoring.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as this is a civil contempt proceeding it was for Gilday to prove that the DOC defendants \"violated a clear and unambiguous order that left no reasonable doubt as to what behavior was to be expected\" and that the DOC was \" 'able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts ... [were] forbidden.' \"  Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17 (quoting Drywall Tapers, 889 F.2d at 395).   Since the Gilday injunction bans only unlawful practices by the DOC defendants, see supra pp. 286-87 and authoritative decisions supportably indicate--at the very least--that the challenged MITS practices constitute lawful monitoring, Gilday has not demonstrated a \"clear and unambiguous\" violation of Title III.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that Gilday failed to establish a violation of the Gilday injunction, either by the DOC or by its putative aiders and abettors, NET and AT&amp;T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

See Crosland v.

Perhaps most significantly, in response to a constitutional challenge the SJC has held that the MITS serves \"the legitimate purpose of improving the security of the Massachusetts correctional system\" by acting as a \"deterrent against improper use\" of prison telephones.  Cacicio, 665 N.E.2d at 90</p>\n        <p>Thus, it can be concluded, with considerable confidence in our judgment, that the issue as to whether corrections officials may intercept MITS calls in the \"ordinary course of [prison] business,\" under the protection of &#167; 99(B)(3)(a), is at the very least reasonably debatable, and, therefore, that Gilday's contention comes a cropper.  See Kemp, 947 F.2d at 17 (stating that injunction must leave \"no reasonable doubt\" what conduct is prohibited);  see also Langton, 71 F.3d at 936 (finding \"reasonably debatable\" the issue as to whether MITS monitoring comes within the \"ordinary course of business of a law enforcement officer\" as defined by Federal Wiretap Act).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn27\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27_ref\">27</a>\n        <p> Call \"detailing,\" moreover, is not within the ambit of the Federal Wiretap Act, as it simply captures electronic signals relating to the PIN of the caller, the number called, and the date, time and length of the call.  See 103 C.M.R. &#167; 482.06(1).  The Federal Wiretap Act defines \"interception\" as an \"aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(4) (emphasis added).  Subsection 2510(8) in turn defines \"contents\" as \"any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of [the] ... communication.\"  Id. &#167; 2510(8)</p>\n        <p>The United States Supreme Court, in an analogous context, has held that \"pen registers\"--devices which can record any number dialed from a particular telephone--do not violate the Federal Wiretap Act \"because they do not acquire the contents of communications as that term is defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(8).\"  United States v.

The legislative history of the 1986 Amendments to the Federal Wiretap Act likewise indicates that Congress intended to exclude call \"detailing\" devices.  See S.Rep.

Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has suggested that in circumstances where an employee is believed to be committing a crime or making excessive personal calls, employer monitoring of employee phone calls may not be an unlawful \"interception\" under the \"ordinary use\" exception applicable to extension phones in &#167; 2510(5)(a)(i).
