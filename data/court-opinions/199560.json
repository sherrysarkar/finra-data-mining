Chapter 7 debtor Robert J.\n\nSpenlinhauer appeals from a district court order which affirmed\n\na bankruptcy court ruling authorizing the chapter 7 trustee to\n\nsell certain property of the chapter 7 estate to the estranged\n\nsiblings of the chapter 7 debtor.      We dismiss the appeal due to\n\nlack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                   I\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n          The chapter 7 debtor and his two brothers established\n\nthe JRS Trust in 1979 for the purpose of leasing certain real\n\nestate situated in Wells, Maine.1 When Robert Spenlinhauer filed\n\na   voluntary   chapter   11   petition     in   1990,   his   one-third\n\nbeneficial interest in the JRS Trust became property of the\n\nchapter 11 estate by operation of law.           The case was converted\n\nto a chapter 7 liquidation proceeding in 1994, whereupon the\n\nappellee became the chapter 7 trustee.           Beginning in 1995, the\n\ntrustees of the JRS Trust — viz., debtor’s brothers, John and\n\nStephen, and the chapter 7 trustee — renegotiated the terms of\n\na sublease which the JRS Trust had entered into with Spencer\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     We recite only the record facts directly pertinent to the\ndeterminative jurisdictional issue.    For greater background\ndetail, see In re Spenlinhauer, 231 B.R. 429 (D. Me. 1999).\n\n                                   3\n\fPress, a company controlled by the Spenlinhauer family.2\n\n            In 1998, the chapter 7 trustee filed a notice of sale\n\nwith the bankruptcy court, see Bankruptcy Code § 363; 11 U.S.C.\n\n§   363,   proposing    to   sell   the      chapter    7    estate’s    one-third\n\nbeneficial    interest       in   the    JRS   Trust    to    John    and    Stephen\n\nSpenlinhauer [hereinafter:              “Purchasers”] for $500,000.              The\n\nnotice of sale did not expressly provide that the chapter 7\n\ntrustee would also release the Purchasers from any potential\n\nliability, either to the chapter 7 estate or to the chapter 7\n\ndebtor, arising from the Purchasers’ pre-sale administration of\n\nthe JRS Trust.\n\n            The chapter 7 debtor then brought suit in federal\n\ndistrict court against Spencer Press and the JRS Trust trustees,\n\nclaiming that their sublease renegotiations were conducted in\n\nviolation of the automatic stay provisions.                  See Bankruptcy Code\n\n§ 362(a)(3); 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(3).                  Simultaneously, in the\n\npending    bankruptcy    court      proceeding,        the    chapter    7   debtor\n\nobjected to the proposed sale, contending that the sublease\n\nrenegotiations     conducted        by       the   Purchasers        violated    the\n\nautomatic stay, breached their fiduciary duties as trustees of\n\nthe JRS Trust, and seriously devalued the chapter 7 debtor’s\n\n\n\n      2\n     By 1988, the chapter 7 debtor, Robert Spenlinhauer, had\nsold all his stock in Spencer Press.\n\n                                         4\n\finterest    in    the   JRS    Trust,       thereby      rendering    the    proposed\n\n$500,000 sale price inadequate.\n\n                On November 3, 1998, the bankruptcy court conducted\n\na telephonic hearing on the chapter 7 trustee’s section 363\n\nnotice of sale, during which the chapter 7 debtor contended that\n\nhis    causes    of   action    against         the    Purchasers    for    allegedly\n\nviolating    the      automatic   stay       and      breaching     their   fiduciary\n\nduties should not be included in the sale proposed by the\n\nchapter 7 trustee, since these assets were distinct from his\n\none-third beneficial interest in the JRS Trust.                       The chapter 7\n\ntrustee     responded      that   these          causes     of    action     were     of\n\nquestionable merit and value, and, in any event, that his sale\n\nof the underlying trust interest to the Purchasers might, by\n\nnecessary implication, release the Purchasers from the claims\n\nasserted by the chapter 7 debtor.                     The Purchasers informed the\n\nbankruptcy court that though they had not requested a release of\n\nclaims from the chapter 7 trustee as part of the proposed sale,\n\nthey   nonetheless       preferred      a       release,    given    the    chapter    7\n\ndebtor’s litigation posture.            After observing that the notice of\n\nthe proposed sale contained no release of claims, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt continued the telephonic hearing for one week in order to\n\npermit the chapter 7 trustee to reevaluate “all the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the sale.”\n\n\n                                            5\n\f          On    November   10,      the       day    the   hearing     resumed,    the\n\nPurchasers submitted the affidavit of Gordon C. Ayer, Esq.\n\n(“Ayer   Affidavit”),         in-house-counsel              to    Spencer     Press,\n\ndescribing in detail the sublease renegotiations conducted in\n\n1995 between Spencer Press and the JRS Trust.                            During the\n\nreconvened hearing, counsel to the chapter 7 debtor informed the\n\nbankruptcy court that he was “at a bit of a disadvantage”\n\nbecause he had not yet received the Ayer Affidavit, thus it was\n\n“very difficult . . . to address it in any fashion or to have\n\nsubmitted countering affidavits.”                   In addition, the Purchasers\n\nstated   that   a   release    of   all       claims       must   be   part   of   the\n\nconsideration for their purchase.\n\n          In light of the chapter 7 debtor’s failure to adduce\n\nevidence that there had been any violation of the automatic stay\n\nor breach of fiduciary duty by the chapter 7 trustee, the\n\nbankruptcy court announced that it would approve the sale of the\n\nchapter 7 estate’s interest in the JRS Trust, as well as the\n\nrelease of any potential causes of action against the Purchasers\n\narising from their pre-sale administration of the JRS Trust.\n\nThus, the court held that the Purchasers had purchased “in good\n\nfaith,” within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code § 363(m), 11\n\nU.S.C. § 363(m).\n\n          Subsection 363(m) provides that “[t]he reversal or\n\n\n                                          6\n\fmodification on appeal of a[] [bankruptcy court’s] authorization\n\n. . . of a sale . . . does not affect the validity of a sale .\n\n. . to an entity that purchased . . . such property in good\n\nfaith . . . unless such authorization and such sale . . . were\n\nstayed pending appeal.”3         Prior to hearing from counsel to the\n\nchapter 7 debtor,         the bankruptcy court announced its intention\n\nto deny any motion for stay.           Whereupon counsel to the chapter\n\n7 debtor interjected:         “[B]y not asking for [a stay], we are not\n\ngiving up our rights to appeal.”\n\n                 In due course, the chapter 7 debtor appealed to the\n\ndistrict court.          The district court upheld the determination\n\nthat       the   Purchasers   were   purchasers   “in   good   faith”   under\n\nsubsection 363(m), but remanded to the bankruptcy court to\n\nreevaluate whether the terms of the sale fairly encompassed a\n\nrelease of the chapter 7 debtor’s putative causes of action\n\nagainst the Purchasers.          In re Spenlinhauer, 231 B.R. 429 (D.\n\nMe. 1999).\n\n                 Following the remand, after yet another hearing, the\n\n\n       3\n      Subsection 363(m) is designed to ensure that a “good faith”\npurchaser, or “one who buys property in good faith and for\nvalue, without knowledge of adverse claims,” In re Mark Bell\nFurniture Warehouse, Inc. (Mark Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc.\nv. D.M. Reid Assocs.), 992 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1993),\njustifiably may rely on the finality of the sale.      See In re\nHealthco Int’l, Inc. (Hicks, Muse & Co. v. Brandt), 136 F.3d 45,\n49 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that § 363(m)’s guarantee of finality\npromotes optimal prices for estate assets).\n\n                                        7\n\fbankruptcy court ruled that it could not undertake further\n\ninquiry into the scope of the sale since the district court had\n\nupheld    the       Purchasers’      “good       faith”     status   on     appeal,    and\n\nconsequently subsection 363(m) precluded any reassessment of the\n\nterms of the sale consummated on November 10, 1998.                         The chapter\n\n7    debtor    once       again   appealed       to   the   district      court,    which\n\nadopted       the    bankruptcy        court’s        rationale      on   remand,     and\n\naffirmed.       In re Spenlinhauer, No. 99-364, 2000 WL 760745 (D.\n\nMe. Feb. 18, 2000).\n\n                                             II\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n              The chapter 7 debtor urges us to reverse the November\n\n10, 1998, order confirming the sale, for the following reasons,\n\namong others:             (1) the chapter 7 trustee concededly failed to\n\nfollow    the       local    bankruptcy      court      rule   which      requires    the\n\nparties to submit their supporting affidavits not later than one\n\nbusiness day prior to a hearing; thus, the bankruptcy court\n\nabused    its       discretion       (i)   by     relying    on   the     pivotal     Ayer\n\nAffidavit as evidence of the Purchasers’ “good faith,” and (ii)\n\nby    denying       the    chapter    7    debtor’s       requests    for    additional\n\ndiscovery or for an evidentiary hearing aimed at countering the\n\ndeleterious evidence presented in the Ayer Affidavit; and (2) on\n\nremand from the district court, the bankruptcy court erroneously\n\n\n                                             8\n\fruled     that   subsection         363(m)   precluded     its    reassessment\n\nregarding whether the November 10, 1998, sale encompassed the\n\nrelease of claims, since the finality provisions in subsection\n\n363(m) pertain strictly to sales of property (e.g., the chapter\n\n7 estate’s one-third interest in the JRS Trust), not to the\n\nchapter 7 estate’s settlement or relinquishment of causes of\n\naction acquired by the chapter 7 estate.\n\n            On appeal from a district court decision reviewing a\n\nbankruptcy court order, we review the bankruptcy court order\n\ndirectly,    disturbing       its    factual    findings   only    if   clearly\n\nerroneous, while according de novo review to its conclusions of\n\nlaw.    In re Stoehr (Stoehr v. Mohamed), 244 F.3d 206, 207-08\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam).                Moreover, we may affirm the\n\nbankruptcy court order on any ground apparent from the record on\n\nappeal.     See In re Rauh (Noonan v. Rauh), 119 F.3d 46, 53-54\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).         Before we address the substantive claims\n\nadvanced on appeal, however, we must determine our appellate\n\njurisdiction.\n\n            Under the Bankruptcy Code, standing to appeal from a\n\nfinal bankruptcy court order is accorded only to a “person\n\naggrieved.”      See In re Thompson (Kowal v. Malkemus), 965 F.2d\n\n1136,   1142     n.9   (1st   Cir.     1992).     The    “person   aggrieved”\n\nparadigm,      which   delimits       appellate   jurisdiction      even   more\n\n\n                                         9\n\fstringently than the doctrine of Article III standing, see,\n\ne.g., In re Alpex Computer Corp. (Nintendo Co. v. Patten), 71\n\nF.3d 353, 357 n.6 (10th Cir. 1995);            In re H.K. Porter Co.\n\n(Travelers Ins. Co. v. H.K. Porter Co.), 45 F.3d 737, 741 (3d\n\nCir. 1995),4 bestows standing only where the challenged order\n\ndirectly     and   adversely   affects    an   appellant’s   pecuniary\n\ninterests.    In re Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1142 n.9.\n\n           The advent of the chapter 7 estate and the appointment\n\nof the chapter 7 trustee divest the chapter 7 debtor of all\n\nright, title and interest in nonexempt property of the estate at\n\nthe commencement of the case.       See Bankruptcy Code §§ 541(a),\n\n704; 11 U.S.C. §§ 541(a), 704.5        Since title to property of the\n\n\n    4The principal policy underlying the heightened “standing”\nrequirement   is   that    bankruptcy   proceedings    —   often\nadministratively and procedurally unwieldy — not be prolonged by\nunnecessary appeals. In re Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1145-46; In re\nColony Hill Assocs. (Kabro Assocs. of W. Islip v. Colony Hill\nAssocs.), 111 F.3d 269, 273 (2d Cir. 1997); In re Andreuccetti,\n975 F.2d 413, 416-17 (7th Cir. 1992).\n    5Neither party disputes that the debtor’s putative causes of\naction against the Purchasers, for violation of the automatic\nstay and breach of fiduciary duty, constitute property of the\nchapter 7 estate, and that a release of those claims was\namenable to disposition by the chapter 7 trustee. See, e.g., In\nre Acton Foodservices Corp., 39 B.R. 70, 72 (Bankr. D. Mass.\n1984) (holding that potential causes of action became property\nof the chapter 7 estate even though they arose postpetition,\nsince any legal or equitable rights of the debtor in the\nunderlying real property from which those causes of action\nderived had become property of the chapter 7 estate before the\ncauses of action accrued) (citing 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(7)); see\nalso In re Doemling, 116 B.R. 48, 50 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1990).\n\n                                  10\n\festate no longer resides in the chapter 7 debtor, the debtor\n\ntypically    lacks       any    pecuniary         interest       in    the     chapter      7\n\ntrustee’s disposition of that property.                        See In re El San Juan\n\nHotel, 809 F.2d 151, 154-55 (1st Cir. 1987); see also In re Cult\n\nAwareness    Network,          Inc.    (Cult      Awareness         Network,       Inc.    v.\n\nMartino), 151 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 1998);                            In re Richman\n\n(Richman v. First Woman’s Bank), 104 F.3d 654, 657 (4th Cir.\n\n1997).   Thus, normally it is the trustee alone, as distinguished\n\nfrom the chapter 7 debtor, who possesses standing to appeal from\n\nbankruptcy       court    orders       which      confirm      or     reject      sales    of\n\nproperty    of    the    estate.         See      In     re    Mark    Bell       Furniture\n\nWarehouse, Inc. (Mark Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc. v. D.M.\n\nReid Assocs.), 992 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1993);                               In re Eisen\n\n(Moneymaker v. CoBen), 31 F.3d 1447, 1451 n.2 (9th Cir. 1994).\n\n            In the normal course, therefore, the bankruptcy or\n\ndistrict    courts       must    make    the      required       “person       aggrieved”\n\ndetermination in the first instance, which entails a factual\n\ninquiry which we review only for clear error.                         See In re El San\n\nJuan Hotel, 809 F.2d at 154 n.3; In re Parker (McClellan Fed.\n\nCredit Union v. Parker), 139 F.3d 668, 670 (9th Cir. 1998).                               But\n\nwhere, as here, the lower court has not undertaken the required\n\n“standing”   inquiry,          we     must   do    so,    ab    initio,      on    our    own\n\ninitiative. See In re Mark Bell Furniture, 992 F.2d at 9; In re\n\n\n                                             11\n\fDein Host, Inc., 835 F.2d 402, 404 (1st Cir. 1987).    Moreover,\n\nprovided the appellate record discloses the requisite facts, we\n\nmay address the matter without remanding.   See In re Parker, 139\n\nF.3d at 670; In re American Ready Mix, Inc. (Lopez v. Behles),\n\n14 F.3d 1497, 1499-1500 (10th Cir. 1994) (noting also that\n\nparties may neither waive nor stipulate to “standing”).    As in\n\nother jurisdictional contexts, of course, the party asserting\n\nappellate jurisdiction — here, the chapter 7 debtor — bears the\n\nburden.   See In re Depoister (Depoister v. Mary M. Holloway\n\nFound.), 36 F.3d 582, 585 (7th Cir. 1994); In re Willemain\n\n(Willemain v. Kivitz), 764 F.2d 1019, 1023 (4th Cir. 1985); In\n\nre Cosmopolitan Aviation Corp. (Cosmopolitan Aviation Corp. v.\n\nNew York State Dep’t of Transp.), 763 F.2d 507, 513 (2d Cir.\n\n1985); In re Alfaro (Alfaro v. Vazquez), 221 B.R. 927, 931-32\n\n(B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1998).6\n\n          Therefore, when the chapter 7 debtor appeals from an\n\norder authorizing a sale of property of the estate, he must\n\nadduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the challenged\n\norder directly and adversely affects the chapter 7 debtor’s\n\npecuniary interests, notwithstanding the fact that he no longer\n\n\n\n    6At the November 10, 1998, hearing, the bankruptcy judge\nmistakenly observed: “I could take an offer of proof from the\ntrustee regarding the standing issue,” but “I’m not going to\naddress that issue today.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n                              12\n\fhas title to the property.     The chapter 7 debtor may establish\n\nstanding by demonstrating, inter alia, that nullification of the\n\nsale is likely to result in an overall surplus in the chapter 7\n\nestate — viz., a total nonexempt-asset valuation exceeding all\n\nallowed claims against the chapter 7 estate — to which the\n\ndebtor,    qua   individual,   would   become   entitled   once   the\n\nbankruptcy case is closed, see, e.g., In re Cundiff (Cundiff v.\n\nCundiff), 227 B.R. 476, 478 (B.A.P. 6th Cir. 1998) (citing 11\n\nU.S.C. § 554(c), noting that all unadministered chapter 7 estate\n\nproperty revests in the individual debtor at close of bankruptcy\n\ncase).    See In re Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1143 n.12; see also In\n\nre McGuirl (McGuirl v. White), 86 F.3d 1232, 1234 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996); In re Willemain, 764 F.2d at 1022.7 The record on appeal\n\ndiscloses no indication that the chapter 7 debtor ever attempted\n\nto sustain his burden on “standing.”\n\n           At the November 3, 1998, hearing, the bankruptcy judge\n\n\n\n    7In addition, a debtor may demonstrate standing by\nestablishing that a proposed sale of property would adversely\naffect the terms and conditions of his chapter 7 discharge. See\nIn re Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1143 n.12.            However, this\nconsideration is not pertinent to the present appeal, which\ninvolves simply a putative debt due the debtor by the\nPurchasers. Further, although the chapter 7 debtor asked the\nchapter 7 trustee to relinquish these causes of action to him\n(viz., abandon them), he did not offer to purchase the releases\nfrom the chapter 7 trustee. Hence, the chapter 7 debtor has no\nconceivable claim to “standing” as an unsuccessful bidder. See\nMark Bell Furniture, 992 F.2d at 10.\n\n                                13\n\fimmediately raised the “standing” issue sua sponte.                      Twice the\n\nchapter 7 trustee was asked:                “[W]hat will the impact of the\n\nsale at this [$500,000] price be in terms of [a] dividend to\n\nnonpriority      unsecured     creditors?”          The    chapter     7    trustee\n\nresponded    that     though    he    had    yet   to     calculate      the    exact\n\nliabilities,     he     “anticipat[ed]       a   fairly    strong     dividend       to\n\nunsecured    creditors.”        The    bankruptcy         judge   then     inquired\n\nwhether a sale at $727,000, the estimated maximum fair market\n\nvalue,   would    “generate      a   surplus       for    distribution         to   the\n\ndebtor?”    The chapter 7 trustee responded that though he had\n\nanticipated      that    the   “standing”        issue    would   arise        at   the\n\nhearing, the burden was upon the chapter 7 debtor, who neither\n\nalleged “standing” nor adduced any evidence that the proposed\n\nsale to the Purchasers would adversely affect his pecuniary\n\ninterests (viz., deny the chapter 7 estate a potential surplus).\n\n            Instead of disputing the procedural deficiency noted\n\nby the chapter 7 trustee, the chapter 7 debtor merely mustered\n\nthe conclusory statement that, but for the $500,000 sale to the\n\nPurchasers, “it is very likely that we would have created value\n\nthat would have devolved to [the chapter 7 debtor].”                            At no\n\npoint did the chapter 7 debtor proffer evidentiary support for\n\nthis supposition, nor tender a counter-appraisal showing that\n\nthe one-third JRS Trust interest (whether or not coupled with a\n\n\n                                       14\n\frelease of claims) currently was worth more than $500,000, let\n\nalone $727,000.       Similarly, the chapter 7 debtor offered no\n\nevidence as to how, or by what amount, the Purchasers’ 1995\n\nsublease renegotiations reduced the value of the JRS Trust\n\n(hence the value of the chapter 7 debtor’s interest in it).\n\n            Furthermore, rather than attempting to approximate the\n\nalleged monetary loss, the chapter 7 debtor conjectured:              “I’ve\n\ngot to believe that the Arthur Anderson appraisal [viz., the\n\nappraisal adduced by appellees], if it had been done on the\n\noriginal [viz., the pre-sublease-renegotiation] picture, would\n\nbe   significantly    higher.”   (Emphasis     added.)         Finally,   the\n\nchapter 7 debtor neither attempted to adduce evidence as to the\n\ntotal     unsecured   liabilities   of   the   chapter    7    estate,    nor\n\nsuggested      that    any   such    calculation         (or     reasonable\n\napproximation) would be infeasible in the circumstances.             Cf. In\n\nre Depoister, 36 F.3d at 585 (appellate court may consider\n\ndebtor’s own calculations regarding assets versus liabilities in\n\narriving at its sua sponte “standing” determination).8\n\n            The bankruptcy judge noted that there “would [be]\n\n\n\n      8\n     At the November 10, 1998 hearing, the bankruptcy judge\nnoted that even assuming the chapter 7 debtor had not had an\nopportunity to review the Ayer Affidavit before the hearing,\n“neither has [the chapter 7 debtor] put forward any sworn or\nattested statement in support of his personal allegations\nagainst . . . his brothers.”\n\n                                    15\n\fstanding concerns” were the case before the district court for\n\ntrial of the chapter 7 debtor’s parallel litigation against the\n\nPurchasers, see supra Section I,9 but ceased further inquiry into\n\nthe “standing” issue as it relates to the chapter 7 debtor’s\n\nchallenge to the sale.     Moreover, at the November 10, 1998,\n\nhearing, the chapter 7 trustee informed the bankruptcy court\n\nthat investigation had disclosed that “there is virtually no\n\nprospect for any surplus to the debtor.”      Still, the chapter 7\n\ndebtor offered no response.   Thus, by November 10, 1998, the day\n\nthe bankruptcy judge concluded the continued telephonic hearing,\n\nthe record contained no competent evidence of “standing” on the\n\npart of the chapter 7 debtor.\n\n          Whatever omission or confusion may have been engendered\n\nby any ruling below, however, it remains incumbent upon us to\n\naddress the “standing” issue sua sponte, based on the existing\n\nappellate record, which plainly demonstrates that the chapter 7\n\ndebtor utterly failed to establish the requisite “standing” to\n\nappeal.   See In re Rauh, 119 F.3d at 53.10\n\n\n     9\n     The bankruptcy judge noted as well that if the chapter 7\ndebtor’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violation of\nthe automatic stay had any substance, “they certainly would or\ncould . . . redound to the benefit of the estate rather than\n[the chapter 7 debtor] personally.”\n     10\n      Nonetheless, appellee is admonished for failing to adhere\nto Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(7) & (b), which\nmandates that appellee briefs include pertinent citations to the\n\n                                16\n\f         Appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\nappellate record, supporting all factual statements.       The\nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure are not optional.\nFortunately for the appellee, our disposition has not depended\nupon his inadequately supported factual recitations.\n\n                              17\n\f",

The case was converted to a chapter 7 liquidation proceeding in 1994, whereupon the appellee became the chapter 7 trustee. Beginning in 1995, the trustees of the JRS Trust -- viz., debtor's brothers, John and Stephen, and the chapter 7 trustee -- renegotiated the terms of a sublease which the JRS Trust had entered into with Spencer Press, a company controlled by the Spenlinhauer family.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the chapter 7 trustee filed a notice of sale with the bankruptcy court, see Bankruptcy Code &#167; 363; 11 U.S.C. &#167; 363, proposing to sell the chapter 7 estate's one-third beneficial interest in the JRS Trust to John and Stephen Spenlinhauer [hereinafter: \"Purchasers\"] for $500,000. The notice of sale did not expressly provide that the chapter 7 trustee would also release the Purchasers from any potential liability, either to the chapter 7 estate or to the chapter 7 debtor, arising from the Purchasers' pre-sale administration of the JRS Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chapter 7 debtor then brought suit in federal district court against Spencer Press and the JRS Trust trustees, claiming that their sublease renegotiations were conducted in violation of the automatic stay provisions. See Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(3); 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(3). Simultaneously, in the pending bankruptcy court proceeding, the chapter 7 debtor objected to the proposed sale, contending that the sublease renegotiations conducted by the Purchasers violated the automatic stay, breached their fiduciary duties as trustees of the JRS Trust, and seriously devalued the chapter 7 debtor's interest in the JRS Trust, thereby rendering the proposed $500,000 sale price inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 3, 1998, the bankruptcy court conducted a telephonic hearing on the chapter 7 trustee's section 363 notice of sale, during which the chapter 7 debtor contended that his causes of action against the Purchasers for allegedly violating the automatic stay and breaching their fiduciary duties should not be included in the sale proposed by the chapter 7 trustee, since these assets were distinct from his one-third beneficial interest in the JRS Trust. The chapter 7 trustee responded that these causes of action were of questionable merit and value, and, in any event, that his sale of the underlying trust interest to the Purchasers might, by necessary implication, release the Purchasers from the claims asserted by the chapter 7 debtor. The Purchasers informed the bankruptcy court that though they had not requested a release of claims from the chapter 7 trustee as part of the proposed sale, they nonetheless preferred a release, given the chapter 7 debtor's litigation posture. After observing that the notice of the proposed sale contained no release of claims, the bankruptcy court continued the telephonic hearing for one week in order to permit the chapter 7 trustee to reevaluate \"all the facts and circumstances of the sale.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, the day the hearing resumed, the Purchasers submitted the affidavit of Gordon C. Ayer, Esq. (\"Ayer Affidavit\"), in-house-counsel to Spencer Press, describing in detail the sublease renegotiations conducted in 1995 between Spencer Press and the JRS Trust. During the reconvened hearing, counsel to the chapter 7 debtor informed the bankruptcy court that he was \"at a bit of a disadvantage\" because he had not yet received the Ayer Affidavit, thus it was \"very difficult . . . to address it in any fashion or to have submitted countering affidavits.\" In addition, the Purchasers stated that a release of all claims must be part of the consideration for their purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the chapter 7 debtor's failure to adduce evidence that there had been any violation of the automatic stay or breach of fiduciary duty by the chapter 7 trustee, the bankruptcy court announced that it would approve the sale of the chapter 7 estate's interest in the JRS Trust, as well as the release of any potential causes of action against the Purchasers arising from their pre-sale administration of the JRS Trust. Thus, the court held that the Purchasers had purchased \"in good faith,\" within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code &#167; 363(m), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 363(m).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection 363(m) provides that \"[t]he reversal or modification on appeal of a[] [bankruptcy court's] authorization . . . of a sale . . . does not affect the validity of a sale . . . to an entity that purchased . . . such property in good faith . . . unless such authorization and such sale . . . were stayed pending appeal.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Prior to hearing from counsel to the chapter 7 debtor, the bankruptcy court announced its intention to deny any motion for stay. Whereupon counsel to the chapter 7 debtor interjected: \"[B]y not asking for [a stay], we are not giving up our rights to appeal.\"  In due course, the chapter 7 debtor appealed to the district court. The district court upheld the determination that the Purchasers were purchasers \"in good faith\" under subsection 363(m), but remanded to the bankruptcy court to reevaluate whether the terms of the sale fairly encompassed a release of the chapter 7 debtor's putative causes of action against the Purchasers. In re Spenlinhauer, 231 B.R. 429 (D. Me. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the remand, after yet another hearing, the bankruptcy court ruled that it could not undertake further inquiry into the scope of the sale since the district court had upheld the Purchasers' \"good faith\" status on appeal, and consequently subsection 363(m) precluded any reassessment of the terms of the sale consummated on November 10, 1998. The chapter 7 debtor once again appealed to the district court, which adopted the bankruptcy court's rationale on remand, and affirmed. In re Spenlinhauer, No. 99-364, 2000 WL 760745 (D. Me. Feb. 18, 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chapter 7 debtor urges us to reverse the November 10, 1998, order confirming the sale, for the following reasons, among others: (1) the chapter 7 trustee concededly failed to follow the local bankruptcy court rule which requires the parties to submit their supporting affidavits not later than one business day prior to a hearing; thus, the bankruptcy court abused its discretion (i) by relying on the pivotal Ayer Affidavit as evidence of the Purchasers' \"good faith,\" and (ii) by denying the chapter 7 debtor's requests for additional discovery or for an evidentiary hearing aimed at countering the deleterious evidence presented in the Ayer Affidavit; and (2) on remand from the district court, the bankruptcy court erroneously ruled that subsection 363(m) precluded its reassessment regarding whether the November 10, 1998, sale encompassed the release of claims, since the finality provisions in subsection 363(m) pertain strictly to sales of property (e.g., the chapter 7 estate's one-third interest in the JRS Trust), not to the chapter 7 estate's settlement or relinquishment of causes of action acquired by the chapter 7 estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal from a district court decision reviewing a bankruptcy court order, we review the bankruptcy court order directly, disturbing its factual findings only if clearly erroneous, while according de novo review to its conclusions of law. In re Stoehr (Stoehr v. Mohamed), 244 F.3d 206, 207-08 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam). Moreover, we may affirm the bankruptcy court order on any ground apparent from the record on appeal. See In re Rauh (Noonan v. Rauh), 119 F.3d 46, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1997). Before we address the substantive claims advanced on appeal, however, we must determine our appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Bankruptcy Code, standing to appeal from a final bankruptcy court order is accorded only to a \"person aggrieved.\" See In re Thompson (Kowal v. Malkemus), 965 F.2d 1136, 1142 n.9 (1st Cir. 1992). The \"person aggrieved\" paradigm, which delimits appellate jurisdiction even more stringently than the doctrine of Article III standing, see, e.g., In re Alpex Computer Corp. (Nintendo Co. v. Patten), 71 F.3d 353, 357 n.6 (10th Cir. 1995); In re H.K. Porter Co. (Travelers Ins. Co. v. H.K. Porter Co.), 45 F.3d 737, 741 (3d Cir. 1995),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> bestows standing only where the challenged order directly and adversely affects an appellant's pecuniary interests. In re Thompson, 965 F.2d at 1142 n.9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advent of the chapter 7 estate and the appointment of the chapter 7 trustee divest the chapter 7 debtor of all right, title and interest in nonexempt property of the estate at the commencement of the case. See Bankruptcy Code &#167;&#167; 541(a), 704; 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 541(a), 704.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Since title to property of the estate no longer resides in the chapter 7 debtor, the debtor typically lacks any pecuniary interest in the chapter 7 trustee's disposition of that property. See In re El San Juan Hotel, 809 F.2d 151, 154-55 (1st Cir. 1987); see also In re Cult Awareness Network, Inc. (Cult Awareness Network, Inc. v. Martino), 151 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 1998); In re Richman (Richman v. First Woman's Bank), 104 F.3d 654, 657 (4th Cir. 1997). Thus, normally it is the trustee alone, as distinguished from the chapter 7 debtor, who possesses standing to appeal from bankruptcy court orders which confirm or reject sales of property of the estate. See In re Mark Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc. (Mark Bell Furniture Warehouse, Inc. v. D.M. Reid Assocs.), 992 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1993); In re Eisen (Moneymaker v. CoBen), 31 F.3d 1447, 1451 n.2 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the normal course, therefore, the bankruptcy or district courts must make the required \"person aggrieved\" determination in the first instance, which entails a factual inquiry which we review only for clear error. See In re El San Juan Hotel, 809 F.2d at 154 n.3; In re Parker (McClellan Fed. Credit Union v. Parker), 139 F.3d 668, 670 (9th Cir. 1998). But where, as here, the lower court has not undertaken the required \"standing\" inquiry, we must do so, ab initio, on our own initiative. See In re Mark Bell Furniture, 992 F.2d at 9; In re Dein Host, Inc., 835 F.2d 402, 404 (1st Cir. 1987). Moreover, provided the appellate record discloses the requisite facts, we may address the matter without remanding. See In re Parker, 139 F.3d at 670; In re American Ready Mix, Inc. (Lopez v. Behles), 14 F.3d 1497, 1499-1500 (10th Cir. 1994) (noting also that parties may neither waive nor stipulate to \"standing\"). As in other jurisdictional contexts, of course, the party asserting appellate jurisdiction -- here, the chapter 7 debtor -- bears the burden. See In re Depoister (Depoister v. Mary M. Holloway Found.), 36 F.3d 582, 585 (7th Cir. 1994); In re Willemain (Willemain v. Kivitz), 764 F.2d 1019, 1023 (4th Cir. 1985); In re Cosmopolitan Aviation Corp. (Cosmopolitan Aviation Corp. v. New York State Dep't of Transp.), 763 F.2d 507, 513 (2d Cir. 1985); In re Alfaro (Alfaro v. VAZQUEZ), 221 B.R. 927, 931-32 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, when the chapter 7 debtor appeals from an order authorizing a sale of property of the estate, he must adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the challenged order directly and adversely affects the chapter 7 debtor's pecuniary interests, notwithstanding the fact that he no longer has title to the property. The chapter 7 debtor may establish standing by demonstrating, inter alia, that nullification of the sale is likely to result in an overall surplus in the chapter 7 estate -- viz., a total nonexempt-asset valuation exceeding all allowed claims against the chapter 7 estate -- to which the debtor, qua individual, would become entitled once the bankruptcy case is closed, see, e.g., In re Cundiff (Cundiff v. Cundiff), 227 B.R. 476, 478 (B.A.P. 6th Cir. 1998) (citing 11 U.S.C. &#167; 554(c), noting that all unadministered chapter 7 estate property revests in the individual debtor at close of bankruptcy case).

Twice the chapter 7 trustee was asked: \"[W]hat will the impact of the sale at this [$500,000] price be in terms of [a] dividend to nonpriority unsecured creditors?\" The chapter 7 trustee responded that though he had yet to calculate the exact liabilities, he \"anticipat[ed] a fairly strong dividend to unsecured creditors.\" The bankruptcy judge then inquired whether a sale at $727,000, the estimated maximum fair market value, would \"generate a surplus for distribution to the debtor?\" The chapter 7 trustee responded that though he had anticipated that the \"standing\" issue would arise at the hearing, the burden was upon the chapter 7 debtor, who neither alleged \"standing\" nor adduced any evidence that the proposed sale to the Purchasers would adversely affect his pecuniary interests (viz., deny the chapter 7 estate a potential surplus).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of disputing the procedural deficiency noted by the chapter 7 trustee, the chapter 7 debtor merely mustered the conclusory statement that, but for the $500,000 sale to the Purchasers, \"it is very likely that we would have created value that would have devolved to [the chapter 7 debtor].\" At no point did the chapter 7 debtor proffer evidentiary support for this supposition, nor tender a counter-appraisal showing that the one-third JRS Trust interest (whether or not coupled with a release of claims) currently was worth more than $500,000, let alone $727,000. Similarly, the chapter 7 debtor offered no evidence as to how, or by what amount, the Purchasers' 1995 sublease renegotiations reduced the value of the JRS Trust (hence the value of the chapter 7 debtor's interest in it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, rather than attempting to approximate the alleged monetary loss, the chapter 7 debtor conjectured: \"I've got to believe that the Arthur Anderson appraisal [viz., the appraisal adduced by appellees], if it had been done on the original [viz., the pre-sublease-renegotiation] picture, would be significantly higher.\" (Emphasis added.) Finally, the chapter 7 debtor neither attempted to adduce evidence as to the total unsecured liabilities of the chapter 7 estate, nor suggested that any such calculation (or reasonable approximation) would be infeasible in the circumstances. Cf. In re Depoister, 36 F.3d at 585 (appellate court may consider debtor's own calculations regarding assets versus liabilities in arriving at its sua sponte \"standing\" determination).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy judge noted that there \"would [be] standing concerns\" were the case before the district court for trial of the chapter 7 debtor's parallel litigation against the Purchasers, see supra Section I,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> but ceased further inquiry into the \"standing\" issue as it relates to the chapter 7 debtor's challenge to the sale. Moreover, at the November 10, 1998, hearing, the chapter 7 trustee informed the bankruptcy court that investigation had disclosed that \"there is virtually no prospect for any surplus to the debtor.\" Still, the chapter 7 debtor offered no response. Thus, by November 10, 1998, the day the bankruptcy judge concluded the continued telephonic hearing, the record contained no competent evidence of \"standing\" on the part of the chapter 7 debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever omission or confusion may have been engendered by any ruling below, however, it remains incumbent upon us to address the \"standing\" issue sua sponte, based on the existing appellate record, which plainly demonstrates that the chapter 7 debtor utterly failed to establish the requisite \"standing\" to appeal.

Further, although the chapter 7 debtor asked the chapter 7 trustee to relinquish these causes of action to him (viz., abandon them), he did not offer to purchase the releases from the chapter 7 trustee. Hence, the chapter 7 debtor has no conceivable claim to \"standing\" as an unsuccessful bidder.

The case was converted to a chapter 7 liquidation proceeding in 1994, whereupon the appellee became the chapter 7 trustee. Beginning in 1995, the trustees of the JRS Trust -- viz., debtor's brothers, John and Stephen, and the chapter 7 trustee -- renegotiated the terms of a sublease which the JRS Trust had entered into with Spencer Press, a company controlled by the Spenlinhauer family.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, the chapter 7 trustee filed a notice of sale with the bankruptcy court, see Bankruptcy Code &#167; 363; 11 U.S.C. &#167; 363, proposing to sell the chapter 7 estate's one-third beneficial interest in the JRS Trust to John and Stephen Spenlinhauer [hereinafter: \"Purchasers\"] for $500,000. The notice of sale did not expressly provide that the chapter 7 trustee would also release the Purchasers from any potential liability, either to the chapter 7 estate or to the chapter 7 debtor, arising from the Purchasers' pre-sale administration of the JRS Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chapter 7 debtor then brought suit in federal district court against Spencer Press and the JRS Trust trustees, claiming that their sublease renegotiations were conducted in violation of the automatic stay provisions. See Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(3); 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(3). Simultaneously, in the pending bankruptcy court proceeding, the chapter 7 debtor objected to the proposed sale, contending that the sublease renegotiations conducted by the Purchasers violated the automatic stay, breached their fiduciary duties as trustees of the JRS Trust, and seriously devalued the chapter 7 debtor's interest in the JRS Trust, thereby rendering the proposed $500,000 sale price inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 3, 1998, the bankruptcy court conducted a telephonic hearing on the chapter 7 trustee's section 363 notice of sale, during which the chapter 7 debtor contended that his causes of action against the Purchasers for allegedly violating the automatic stay and breaching their fiduciary duties should not be included in the sale proposed by the chapter 7 trustee, since these assets were distinct from his one-third beneficial interest in the JRS Trust. The chapter 7 trustee responded that these causes of action were of questionable merit and value, and, in any event, that his sale of the underlying trust interest to the Purchasers might, by necessary implication, release the Purchasers from the claims asserted by the chapter 7 debtor. The Purchasers informed the bankruptcy court that though they had not requested a release of claims from the chapter 7 trustee as part of the proposed sale, they nonetheless preferred a release, given the chapter 7 debtor's litigation posture. After observing that the notice of the proposed sale contained no release of claims, the bankruptcy court continued the telephonic hearing for one week in order to permit the chapter 7 trustee to reevaluate \"all the facts and circumstances of the sale.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 10, the day the hearing resumed, the Purchasers submitted the affidavit of Gordon C. Ayer, Esq. (\"Ayer Affidavit\"), in-house-counsel to Spencer Press, describing in detail the sublease renegotiations conducted in 1995 between Spencer Press and the JRS Trust. During the reconvened hearing, counsel to the chapter 7 debtor informed the bankruptcy court that he was \"at a bit of a disadvantage\" because he had not yet received the Ayer Affidavit, thus it was \"very difficult . . . to address it in any fashion or to have submitted countering affidavits.\" In addition, the Purchasers stated that a release of all claims must be part of the consideration for their purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the chapter 7 debtor's failure to adduce evidence that there had been any violation of the automatic stay or breach of fiduciary duty by the chapter 7 trustee, the bankruptcy court announced that it would approve the sale of the chapter 7 estate's interest in the JRS Trust, as well as the release of any potential causes of action against the Purchasers arising from their pre-sale administration of the JRS Trust. Thus, the court held that the Purchasers had purchased \"in good faith,\" within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code &#167; 363(m), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 363(m).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsection 363(m) provides that \"[t]he reversal or modification on appeal of a[] [bankruptcy court's] authorization . . . of a sale . . . does not affect the validity of a sale . . . to an entity that purchased . . . such property in good faith . . . unless such authorization and such sale . . . were stayed pending appeal.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Prior to hearing from counsel to the chapter 7 debtor, the bankruptcy court announced its intention to deny any motion for stay. Whereupon counsel to the chapter 7 debtor interjected: \"[B]y not asking for [a stay], we are not giving up our rights to appeal.\"  In due course, the chapter 7 debtor appealed to the district court. The district court upheld the determination that the Purchasers were purchasers \"in good faith\" under subsection 363(m), but remanded to the bankruptcy court to reevaluate whether the terms of the sale fairly encompassed a release of the chapter 7 debtor's putative causes of action against the Purchasers.

The chapter 7 debtor may establish standing by demonstrating, inter alia, that nullification of the sale is likely to result in an overall surplus in the chapter 7 estate -- viz., a total nonexempt-asset valuation exceeding all allowed claims against the chapter 7 estate -- to which the debtor, qua individual, would become entitled once the bankruptcy case is closed, see, e.g., In re Cundiff (Cundiff v.

Twice the chapter 7 trustee was asked: \"[W]hat will the impact of the sale at this [$500,000] price be in terms of [a] dividend to nonpriority unsecured creditors?\" The chapter 7 trustee responded that though he had yet to calculate the exact liabilities, he \"anticipat[ed] a fairly strong dividend to unsecured creditors.\" The bankruptcy judge then inquired whether a sale at $727,000, the estimated maximum fair market value, would \"generate a surplus for distribution to the debtor?\" The chapter 7 trustee responded that though he had anticipated that the \"standing\" issue would arise at the hearing, the burden was upon the chapter 7 debtor, who neither alleged \"standing\" nor adduced any evidence that the proposed sale to the Purchasers would adversely affect his pecuniary interests (viz., deny the chapter 7 estate a potential surplus).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead of disputing the procedural deficiency noted by the chapter 7 trustee, the chapter 7 debtor merely mustered the conclusory statement that, but for the $500,000 sale to the Purchasers, \"it is very likely that we would have created value that would have devolved to [the chapter 7 debtor].\" At no point did the chapter 7 debtor proffer evidentiary support for this supposition, nor tender a counter-appraisal showing that the one-third JRS Trust interest (whether or not coupled with a release of claims) currently was worth more than $500,000, let alone $727,000. Similarly, the chapter 7 debtor offered no evidence as to how, or by what amount, the Purchasers' 1995 sublease renegotiations reduced the value of the JRS Trust (hence the value of the chapter 7 debtor's interest in it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, rather than attempting to approximate the alleged monetary loss, the chapter 7 debtor conjectured: \"I've got to believe that the Arthur Anderson appraisal [viz., the appraisal adduced by appellees], if it had been done on the original [viz., the pre-sublease-renegotiation] picture, would be significantly higher.\" (Emphasis added.) Finally, the chapter 7 debtor neither attempted to adduce evidence as to the total unsecured liabilities of the chapter 7 estate, nor suggested that any such calculation (or reasonable approximation) would be infeasible in the circumstances. Cf. In re Depoister, 36 F.3d at 585 (appellate court may consider debtor's own calculations regarding assets versus liabilities in arriving at its sua sponte \"standing\" determination).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy judge noted that there \"would [be] standing concerns\" were the case before the district court for trial of the chapter 7 debtor's parallel litigation against the Purchasers, see supra Section I,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> but ceased further inquiry into the \"standing\" issue as it relates to the chapter 7 debtor's challenge to the sale. Moreover, at the November 10, 1998, hearing, the chapter 7 trustee informed the bankruptcy court that investigation had disclosed that \"there is virtually no prospect for any surplus to the debtor.\" Still, the chapter 7 debtor offered no response. Thus, by November 10, 1998, the day the bankruptcy judge concluded the continued telephonic hearing, the record contained no competent evidence of \"standing\" on the part of the chapter 7 debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever omission or confusion may have been engendered by any ruling below, however, it remains incumbent upon us to address the \"standing\" issue sua sponte, based on the existing appellate record, which plainly demonstrates that the chapter 7 debtor utterly failed to establish the requisite \"standing\" to appeal.

Further, although the chapter 7 debtor asked the chapter 7 trustee to relinquish these causes of action to him (viz., abandon them), he did not offer to purchase the releases from the chapter 7 trustee. Hence, the chapter 7 debtor has no conceivable claim to \"standing\" as an unsuccessful bidder.
