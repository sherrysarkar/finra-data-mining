Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\nAlan D. Rose and Rose &amp; Associates on brief for appellant.\r\nDonald K.  Stern, United States  Attorney, and Kevin  P. McGrath,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n                       April 11, 1997\r\n                                        \r\r\n\n     Per \r                    Curiam. \r                            \r                            Upon \r                                 careful review of the briefs and record,\r\n\nwe perceive no clear error in the district court's sentencing\r\n\ndeterminations.  The  district court properly concluded  that\r\n\nappellant  was  not  entitled  to  a  reduction  as  a  minor\r\n\nparticipant  under  U.S.S.G. S  3B1.2(b),  in  light  of  his\r\n\nresponsibilities  for  storing,  guarding,  and  distributing\r\n\nsubstantial quantities of the drugs.  Further, appellant  was\r\n\nnot entitled  to an extra reduction  for a timely plea  under\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(b)(2), in  light of his belated plea on  the\r\n\nthird day of trial.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\n",
