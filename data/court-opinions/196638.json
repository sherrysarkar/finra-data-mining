Under  that  framework, appellant  American\r\n\nPostal Workers Union, AFL-CIO (the  Union) entered into a  series\r\n\nof collective bargaining agreements with the Service.

The Union  prosecuted grievances  on\r\n\ntheir  behalf.   Following  a five-day  evidentiary hearing,  the\r\n\narbitrator found that the grievants committed the acts with which\r\n\nthey  had been charged, and  that the Service  had just cause for\r\n\nthe disciplinary actions which  it took in first  suspending, and\r\n\nlater ousting, the grievants.\r\n\n          The Union filed an action in the federal district court\r\n\nwith a view toward  vacating the arbitral award.1   Its complaint\r\n\nclaimed  that  the  award \"did  not  draw  its  essence from  the\r\n\ncollective  bargaining agreement\"  because it  was \"not  based on\r\n\nsufficient evidence to  sustain a finding of  just cause.\"  In  a\r\n\nwell-reasoned opinion,  the district court granted  the Service's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1For ease in reference, we  treat the case if the Union  and\r\nthe  Service were the sole protagonists.

These exceptions are narrowly construed\r\n\nand,  unless one of them applies, even \"a court's conviction that\r\n\nthe arbitrator made a serious mistake or committed grievous error\r\n\nwill not furnish a satisfactory basis for undoing  the decision.\"\r\n\nAdvest,  Inc., 914  F.2d at  9; accord  Georgia-Pacific  Corp. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLocal 27, United Paperworkers Int'l Union, 864 F.2d 940, 944 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1988).\r\n\n          As the district court recognized, the instant case does\r\n\nnot  fit  within  the confines  of  any  of  the three  long-odds\r\n\nexceptions.   The linchpin  of the  Union's position,  as counsel\r\n\nmade  clear at  oral  argument, is  that  the arbitral  award  is\r\n\nirrational because  the three grievants  were all audited  on the\r\n\nsame day and only  minor discrepancies were found in  their stamp\r\n\nstock.  Therefore, the Union's thesis runs, it is impossible that\r\n\nany of  the trio  could have stolen  stamp stock  (from which  it\r\n\nfollows that  the arbitrator  based his  decision  on facts  that\r\n\ncould not have been true).\r\n\n          To  be sure,  this  is one  possible interpretation  of\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nselected  items of evidence.  But the arbitrator faced a golconda\r\n\nof conflicting testimony regarding  specific dates, and the Union\r\n\nhas simply  woven together the  timeline most  beneficial to  its\r\n\nview  of  the  universe.    The  arbitrator  apparently  chose  a\r\n\ndifferent  timeline after  hearing  the witnesses  and  carefully\r\n\nconsidering the surrounding circumstances.  The record supports a\r\n\nfinding that Daniels was  audited for the second time  on Monday,\r\n\nApril  16, 1990,  when Davis  was absent  from work,  and not  on\r\n\nTuesday, April 17; that  Davis and Johnson were then  audited the\r\n\nnext day (April 17); and that, although no substantial amounts of\r\n\nstamp stock were found  to be missing, some form of  deception or\r\n\nsleight of hand  was being practiced by the  three clerks to hide\r\n\nthe fact     incontrovertibly proven     that Davis had stolen as\r\n\nmuch as $6,000 by unauthorized withdrawals from his stock.\r\n\n          We add  two further observations.   First, even  if the\r\n\nthree grievants all had been audited on the same day as the Union\r\n\ncontends, the arbitrator's conclusion of just cause for discharge\r\n\nwould remain  soundly based.2   Second,  while the  exceptions we\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  postmaster (Packard)  sealed the  safe containing  the\r\nclerks'  cash drawers  on Saturday  evening, April  14, and  upon\r\nreturning  to work on Monday morning noticed signs of a break-in.\r\nWhen audits  were conducted on  Monday and  Tuesday, Daniels  and\r\nJohnson  showed an  unusual  loss of  large denomination  stamps,\r\nwhile  Davis had an inexplicable surplus of $2 stamps.  Moreover,\r\nJohnson's fingerprints  were found on  seven sheets of  stamps in\r\nDavis'  stock.    In   May,  postal  inspectors  determined  that\r\n$1,153.30 of  Johnson's stamp  stock had originated  from sources\r\nother than  authorized postal  channels.   Given  this and  other\r\nevidence  (including admissions  by  Daniels  and  Johnson),  the\r\narbitrator easily could conclude  that the three clerks purchased\r\nstamps from  outside sources to  replenish Davis' stock  prior to\r\nhis  audit.    On that  hypothesis,  the  three  audits, even  if\r\nconducted  on  the   same  day,  would  likely  reveal  no  major\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nhave described can take hold on a showing that the arbitral award\r\n\nwas \"mistakenly based on a  crucial assumption that is concededly\r\n\na  non-fact,\" Advest,  Inc., 914  F.2d at  8-9, that  doctrine is\r                                     \r\n\nlimited to cases in which no competent evidence of an adjudicated\r                                      \r\n\nfact appears in  the record.  The doctrine has  no bearing where,\r\n\nas here, there is evidence both ways as to the pivotal facts.\r\n\n          We  need go no further.   Refined to  bare essence, the\r\n\nUnion's claim is that the arbitrator found the facts in a clearly\r\n\nerroneous  manner,  largely  because   he  believed  the  \"wrong\"\r\n\nwitnesses and credited the \"wrong\" bits of conflicting testimony.\r\n\nEven if  this claim were well-founded      and there  is not very\r\n\nmuch in the record to suggest  any egregious factual error     we\r\n\ncould not grant the  requested relief.

The linchpin of the Union's position, as counsel made clear at oral argument, is that the arbitral award is irrational because the three grievants were all audited on the same day and only minor discrepancies were found in their stamp stock.   Therefore, the Union's thesis runs, it is impossible that any of the trio could have stolen stamp stock (from which it follows that the arbitrator based his decision on facts that could not have been true).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, this is one possible interpretation of selected items of evidence.   But the arbitrator faced a golconda of conflicting testimony regarding specific dates, and the Union has simply woven together the timeline most beneficial to its view of the universe.   The arbitrator apparently chose a different timeline after hearing the witnesses and carefully considering the surrounding circumstances.   The record supports a finding that Daniels was audited for the second time on Monday, April 16, 1990, when Davis was absent from work, and not on Tuesday, April 17;  that Davis and Johnson were then audited the next day (April 17);  and that, although no substantial amounts of stamp stock were found to be missing, some form of deception or sleight of hand was being practiced by the three clerks to hide the fact incontrovertibly proven that Davis had stolen as much as $6,000 by unauthorized withdrawals from his stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add two further observations.

See 39 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1201-1209 (1994).   Under that framework, appellant American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO (the Union) entered into a series of collective bargaining agreements with the Service.   During the currency of one such agreement, the Service discharged a trio of postal workers (Dennis Daniels, Jonathan Davis, and Karen Johnson) for cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three all of whom worked at the Sudbury, Massachusetts post office were members of a bargaining unit represented by the Union.   The Union prosecuted grievances on their behalf.   Following a five-day evidentiary hearing, the arbitrator found that the grievants committed the acts with which they had been charged, and that the Service had just cause for the disciplinary actions which it took in first suspending, and later ousting, the grievants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Union filed an action in the federal district court with a view toward vacating the arbitral award.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Its complaint claimed that the award \"did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement\" because it was \"not based on sufficient evidence to sustain a finding of just cause.\"   In a well-reasoned opinion, the district court granted the Service's motion for summary judgment.   See American Postal Workers Union v. United States Postal Serv., No. 92-10364-NG, slip op.  (D. Mass.  June 28, 1995).   The Union appeals.   We summarily affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no need to tarry.   Having read the voluminous record, considered the parties' briefs, and entertained oral argument, we find no basis to disturb either the arbitral award or the district court's decision.   To the precise contrary, we regard this as a paradigmatic case in which to put into practice our oft-stated belief that, when lower courts have done first-rate work, an appellate tribunal should not wax longiloquent simply to hear its own words resonate.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602834\"><a href=\"/opinion/602834/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-holders-capital/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.1993).   Consequently, we affirm the judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in the opinion below.   We add only a few brief comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute that confers a right to challenge an arbitral award in a postal employment case, 39 U.S.C. &#167; 1208(b), is an analog to section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185(a), and therefore, the case law under the two statutes is generally interchangeable.
