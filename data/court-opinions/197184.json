These two appeals arise  out\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nof  the armed robbery of  the Dexter Credit  Union in Central\r\n\nFalls,  Rhode  Island  on April  6,  1994.    Jamie Rose  was\r\n\nconvicted  of conspiracy  to rob  a federally  insured credit\r\n\nunion in violation of 18 U.S.C.    371, 2113(a), and of being\r\n\na  felon in  possession  of  a  firearm  in  violation  of   \r\n\n922(g)(1).   Norman  Verrill was  convicted of  the  same two\r\n\noffenses and also of armed robbery and robbery of a federally\r\n\ninsured  credit union.   18 U.S.C.   2113(a),  (d).  Rose was\r\n\nsentenced to 60 months'  imprisonment on the conspiracy count\r\n\nand  to  120  months'  imprisonment  for  being  a  felon  in\r\n\npossession;  the sentences  are  consecutive.    Verrill  was\r\n\nsentenced as  a career offender and an  armed career criminal\r\n\nto a term of 264 months.\r\n\n          On appeal, Rose raises a plethora of issues, two of\r\n\nwhich are weightier than  the rest and require us  to address\r\n\nissues  previously  unresolved  by  this court.    The  first\r\n\nconcerns  the jury charge that may properly be given based on\r\n\nevidence  of a  defendant's  possession  of  recently  stolen\r\n\nproperty.  The second  is whether the trial court  abused its\r\n\ndiscretion by admitting a potentially inflammatory photograph\r\n\ninto evidence,  and if so, whether this  court has discretion\r\n\nto  determine   whether  the  error  was harmless  where  the\r\n\ngovernment has  not so  argued.  Verrill  appeals exclusively\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfrom the determinations made  as to his sentence.   We affirm\r\n\nthe convictions and the sentences.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          During the late morning of April 6, 1994, three men\r\n\nwearing  masks entered  the  Dexter Credit  Union in  Central\r\n\nFalls, Rhode Island.   The  credit union was  insured by  the\r\n\nNational Credit Union Administration.   One robber brandished\r\n\na semi-automatic pistol while the two others  took money from\r\n\nthe teller stations.  A fourth masked man waited outside in a\r\n\nblack  pickup  truck, which  the robbers  used as  a get-away\r\n\nvehicle.  Credit union  employees determined that $10,584 had\r\n\nbeen stolen.1\r\n\n          Police arrived at the scene a few minutes after the\r\n\nrobbers had fled.   They found the  get-away truck abandoned,\r\n\nwith  its engine running, a few blocks from the credit union.\r\n\nThe ignition had  been \"popped,\" and the police later learned\r\n\nthat the truck had been stolen two days before.\r\n\n          The authorities thought they knew where to find the\r\n\nculprits.  Both the FBI and  the Providence Police Department\r\n\nhad  been   investigating  Verrill,  Rose,  David   Vial  and\r\n\nChristopher  Thibodeau in  connection with  a series  of bank\r\n\nrobberies.  A confidential informant had provided information\r\n\nthat the  four men were involved in robbing banks.  A team of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The loss was initially thought to be $10,913.53, but that\r\nfigure was later adjusted downward.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nofficers,  consisting  of FBI  agents  and  Providence police\r\n\nofficers who were part of a bank robbery task force,  went to\r\n\nVial's  home in North Providence  and waited outside.   A few\r\n\nminutes later, a champagne-colored Nissan Pathfinder carrying\r\n\nfour  men pulled into the  building parking lot.   Task force\r\n\nmembers had seen Rose and Thibodeau in the Pathfinder earlier\r\n\nthat  day  and knew  that the  vehicle  had been  stolen some\r\n\nmonths  earlier and that  the license plates  had been stolen\r\n\neleven days before the bank hold-up.\r\n\n          The  task force  members approached  the Pathfinder\r\n\nand  identified themselves.   Rose,  who was  driving, pulled\r\n\naway  at  high speed,  nearly  hitting  two officers  in  the\r\n\nprocess.    The officers  began  shooting.   Vial  managed to\r\n\nescape  temporarily: he  was found  about forty-five  minutes\r\n\nlater hiding in a  bush.  The officers ordered  Rose, Verrill\r\n\nand  Thibodeau out of the  vehicle.  Thibodeau,  who had been\r\n\nwounded, was lying on the front seat; when the police removed\r\n\nhim from  the car,  they found that  he was  holding a  Glock\r\n\nsemi-automatic  pistol in  his left  hand and  had a  Smith &amp;\r\n\nWesson  automatic pistol in the waistband of his pants.  Both\r\n\nwere  loaded with  Winchester  9 millimeter  Black Talon  and\r\n\nFederal  Cartridge  hardball 9  millimeter  round ammunition.\r\n\nThe  officers found two small gym bags,  containing over nine\r\n\nthousand dollars and makeshift masks, in the back seat of the\r\n\nPathfinder.   Some  of the  money was  banded by  paper money\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nstraps  bearing the markings of the Dexter Credit Union.  The\r\n\nfour men were arrested.\r\n\n          Rose  had  suffered  a  scalp  laceration  and  was\r\n\nbrought to Rhode Island  Hospital.  The physician's assistant\r\n\nwho  treated  him  found  a   screwdriver,  a  pager  and  an\r\n\nammunition  clip from  a Glock  semi-automatic pistol  in his\r\n\ntrouser  pockets.   These  items had  not  been found  in  an\r\n\nearlier pat-down of Rose.\r\n\n          Later that  night, an  FBI agent executed  a search\r\n\nwarrant at Rose's home in Providence.  There, the agent found\r\n\na box  of Federal  Cartridge ammunition designed  to hold  50\r\n\nrounds of ammunition  but only containing 39  rounds, as well\r\n\nas a leather pistol case.  The agent also seized a photograph\r\n\nalbum  containing pictures  of Rose  and others.   Among  the\r\n\nphotos were five of Rose holding what appeared to be  a Glock\r\n\nsemi-automatic pistol.  One of the photos showed Rose, finger\r\n\non  the trigger, pointing the  pistol at the  head of another\r\n\nyoung man.\r\n\n          Defendants were  charged with conspiracy to rob the\r\n\nDexter  Credit  Union; armed  robbery  of  the credit  union;\r\n\nrobbery of  the credit  union; using  and carrying  a firearm\r\n\nduring  a crime of violence;  and possession of  a firearm by\r\n\npreviously convicted felons.  Vial  and Thibodeau, two of the\r\n\nmen in the car, pleaded guilty  to some of the counts and the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nrest of the charges against them were dismissed.  Verrill and\r\n\nRose proceeded to trial.\r\n\n          Rose moved to sever his trial from Verrill's and to\r\n\nsever  the felon-in-possession charge from the other charges.\r\n\nThe motions were  denied after a hearing, as was a motion for\r\n\nreconsideration.   The  district  court  ruled that,  because\r\n\nthere was  no evidence  of what  Verrill's defense would  be,\r\n\nthere was no basis  for concluding that Rose and  Verrill had\r\n\nantagonistic defenses. \r\n\n          Vial,  a government  witness,  testified  that  he,\r\n\nVerrill and  Thibodeau entered  the credit union  while Rose,\r\n\nwho had the Glock, remained outside in the truck.   Vial said\r\n\nthat Thibodeau had  waited at  the door of  the credit  union\r\n\nholding  the Smith  &amp; Wesson  while he  and Verrill  took the\r\n\nmoney.  He also testified that all four men fled in the truck\r\n\nbut then switched  to a  second stolen vehicle  which he  and\r\n\nRose had left  near the  credit union earlier  that day,  and\r\n\nthat soon afterwards, they moved to the Pathfinder.\r\n\n          Rose's consecutive  60 and 120 month sentences were\r\n\nbased  on the  guideline for  robbery,  U.S.S.G.    2B3.1, as\r\n\ndictated by the conspiracy guideline,  U.S.S.G.   2X1.1.  The\r\n\nconspiracy guideline requires that the base offense level for\r\n\na conspiracy  conviction be  that of the  substantive offense\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nplus adjustments for any  intended conduct.2  See  U.S.S.G.  \r                                                             \r\n\n2X1.1(a).\r\n\n          Verrill  was  sentenced  both  as  an  armed career\r\n\ncriminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   924(e) and U.S.S.G.   4B1.4,\r\n\nand as a  career offender pursuant to  U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.   As\r\n\neither  an armed  career  criminal or  as a  career offender,\r\n\nVerrill's  offense  level was  34  and  his criminal  history\r\n\ncategory VI, which translates into a guidelines  range of 262\r\n\nto 327 months.  He was  sentenced to 264 months.  This appeal\r\n\nensued.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Rose argues that his  conviction should be reversed\r\n\nfor  several  reasons:  that   the  trial  court  abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion in  denying the motions  to sever  his trial  from\r\n\nVerrill's  and to sever  the felon-in-possession  count; that\r\n\nthe trial  court made erroneous  and prejudicial  evidentiary\r\n\nrulings;  and  that  the charge  to  the  jury  was at  times\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  After determining the  specific offense  characteristics,\r\nthe  court calculated  the offense  level for  the conspiracy\r\ncount as 31 and the offense level for the felon-in-possession\r\ncount as  27.   The  district  court appropriately  used  the\r\nhigher  offense  level  of  31,  see  U.S.S.G.     3D1.3, and\r                                                \r\ndetermined that  Rose had a  criminal history category  of V.\r\nThe guideline range was 168 to  210 months.  With a statutory\r\nmaximum of 5 years for the conspiracy conviction and 10 years\r\nfor  the felon-in-possession  conviction, the  district judge\r\ndetermined the range to be 168 to 180 months.  He effectively\r\nsentenced Rose to the statutory maximum.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nerroneous  and at times incomplete.   We deal  first with his\r\n\nmore serious arguments.\r\n\nJury Instruction on Recently Stolen Property\r                                                        \r\n\n          Rose  questions  several  aspects  of  the  court's\r\n\ncharge to the jury.   The most significant challenge concerns\r\n\nthe instruction  regarding the  inferences that the  jury may\r\n\npermissibly draw from the  defendant's possession of recently\r\n\nstolen items.  In  the context of discussing the  stolen get-\r\n\naway  vehicles,  the  court  instructed  the  jury  that  the\r\n\npossession of recently stolen property, if not satisfactorily\r\n\nexplained,  could  support an  inference  not  only that  the\r\n\nperson in possession  knew that the property  was stolen, but\r\n\nalso that he participated in the theft.3\r\n\n          This raises a question  of first impression in this\r\n\ncircuit.4   The challenged instruction is  reviewed for abuse\r\n\nof discretion  to determine  whether the  charge, taken as  a\r\n\nwhole, \"'fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case\r\n\nto the jury.'\"  United States v. Picciandra, 788 F.2d 39,  46\r                                                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Rose also  argues that the phrase  \"if not satisfactorily\r\nexplained\" impermissibly  penalized him  for failing  to take\r\nthe stand.   This latter  argument has been  rejected by  the\r\nSupreme Court.  Barnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837, 846-47\r                                                   \r\n(1973).\r\n\n4.  It has  long been the law that the jury may infer from an\r\nindividual's possession  of  recently stolen  items that  the\r\nindividual knew the property had been stolen.   See generally\r                                                                         \r\nUnited States  v.

United States  v. Clark, 45  F.3d 1247, 1250\r                                                    \r\n\n(8th Cir. 1995); United States v.

Long, 538  F.2d 580,\r                                                         \r\n\n580-81  (4th  Cir.  1976)  (per  curiam);  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nPlemons, 455 F.2d  243, 246  (10th Cir. 1972).   These  cases\r                   \r\n\nrely  in  large part  on  the  widespread acceptance  of  the\r\n\nprinciple and on the common sense reasoning that supports the\r\n\ninference.  See, e.g., Long, 538 F.2d at 581.\r                                       \r\n\n          We emphasize the limits  on instructions as to this\r\n\ninference.   First, the instruction may not be given in every\r\n\ncase where a defendant was  in possession of recently  stolen\r\n\nproperty.  As the Second Circuit noted, in certain situations\r\n\nthe inference \"would verge on the irrational\" in light of the\r\n\nother evidence in the case.  United States v. Tavoularis, 515\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1070, 1074-75  (2d Cir. 1975); see  also DiGeronimo, 598\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  at  754.   For example,  in  the absence  of additional\r\n\nevidence  tending to  support the  inference, it  may not  be\r\n\nappropriate  to give the instruction.   The court must always\r\n\nact  as  a  check,   ensuring  \"that  the  evidence  warrants\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\npermitting the jury to draw [the] inference.\"  Clark, 45 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 1250.\r\n\n          Second,  the  instruction  involves   a  permissive\r\n\ninference  rather than  a  presumption.   The decision  about\r\n\nwhether  the defendant's  unexplained possession  of recently\r\n\nstolen property  supports the  conclusion that  the defendant\r\n\nparticipated in the theft is made by the jury based on all of\r\n\nthe evidence.  Ferro, 709 F.2d at 297.\r                                \r\n\n          With this in mind, we turn to Rose's claim that the\r\n\nfive month period between the theft of the Pathfinder and his\r\n\narrest  lessens the  applicability  of the  inference.   This\r\n\nclaim  ignores the other evidence  in the case.   The license\r\n\nplates on the  Pathfinder were stolen  within eleven days  of\r\n\nthe  robbery, the black pickup  truck within two  days of the\r\n\nrobbery, and  Vial's testimony linked Rose to the truck.   On\r\n\nthese  facts, the  inference  that Rose  participated in  the\r\n\ntheft  of the  get-away cars  is not  at all  unreasonable or\r\n\nunwarranted.\r\n\nEvidentiary Rulings\r                               \r\n\n          Rose  argues  that  the  district  court  erred  by\r\n\nadmitting into evidence several  items found in his apartment\r\n\nand  that  this error  was  not harmless.    Specifically, he\r\n\nasserts that  the admission of  photos of himself  and others\r\n\nwith what appears to be  a Glock pistol, of a  leather pistol\r\n\ncase  and  a photograph  showing where  it  was found  in his\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\napartment and  of  a  box of  ammunition for  a 9  millimeter\r\n\npistol violated  Fed. R.  Evid. 403, because  the prejudicial\r\n\nimpact of  these items far outweighed  their probative value.\r\n\nReview of the trial court's evidentiary rulings is for  abuse\r\n\nof  discretion.  United States  v. Lombard, 72  F.3d 170, 187\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          This evidence, in general,  met a threshold test of\r\n\nrelevance.  Pistols played an  important role in the  charged\r\n\ncrimes.   One of the  robbers brandished a  pistol inside the\r\n\ncredit  union.   Vial testified  that Rose  was armed  with a\r\n\nsecond pistol.   Two  9 millimeter pistols  were seized  from\r\n\ncodefendant Thibodeau, and  a clip of ammunition  for a semi-\r\n\nautomatic  pistol was found on  Rose at the  hospital.  Items\r\n\nlinking  Rose   to  pistols  tended  to   corroborate  Vial's\r\n\ntestimony  that Rose was a participant  in the conspiracy and\r\n\nthat he had possessed the Glock.\r\n\n          The presence  of  a leather  case for  a pistol  in\r\n\nRose's  home is evidence that  Rose kept such  a weapon there\r\n\nbefore the crime.  That the case was manufactured by Browning\r\n\nrather  than by Smith  &amp; Wesson or  Glock goes  to the weight\r\n\nrather  than to  the relevance  of the  evidence.   The jury,\r\n\nduring  their deliberations,  had  access to  the two  seized\r\n\nweapons  and to  the  pistol case  and  therefore could  have\r\n\ndetermined whether either of the pistols fit the case.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          The  relevance  of  the  ammunition  is  even  more\r\n\nreadily apparent.   The ammunition  was of the  same type  as\r\n\nthat  found in  the two  guns seized  when Rose  and his  co-\r\n\ndefendants were  apprehended.  The box was  marked as holding\r\n\nfifty  rounds, but  contained only  thirty-nine rounds.   The\r\n\njury reasonably could have inferred that at least some of the\r\n\nmissing rounds had been used to load the two pistols.\r\n\n          In general, the photographs showing Rose with a gun\r\n\nare  relevant.   FBI Special  Agent Kevin Eaton  testified at\r\n\ntrial  that the gun in the photographs appeared to be a Glock\r\n\nfirearm; Eaton  stated that Glocks have  \"a very distinctive\"\r\n\nlook.   The photographs thus link  Rose to one of the weapons\r\n\nseized, providing strong corroboration for Vial's inculpatory\r\n\ntestimony.\r\n\n          The  pistol case  and accompanying  photograph, the\r\n\nammunition,  and four  of the  photographs showing  Rose with\r\n\nwhat appeared to be a Glock were not unduly prejudicial.  One\r\n\nof  the photos,  however,  which shows  Rose,  finger on  the\r\n\ntrigger,  with his gun pointed at the head of another person,\r\n\nis  potentially quite inflammatory.  Rose is correct that the\r\n\nphoto  could lead  a jury  to believe  that anyone  who would\r\n\npoint a  possibly loaded pistol  at the  head of a  friend is\r\n\nextremely reckless  and capable of criminal  acts.  Moreover,\r\n\nthis  photograph was  at  best cumulative  of the  four other\r\n\nphotographs linking Rose to  the gun.  The admission  of this\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nphotograph into evidence constituted an  abuse of discretion.\r\n\nThe government all but conceded as much at oral argument.\r\n\n          In the usual case, a non-constitutional evidentiary\r\n\nerror  will be treated as  harmless if it  is highly probable\r\n\nthat the error  did not  contribute to the  verdict.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Rodriguez  Cortes,  949 F.2d  532,  543 (1st  Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1991); United States  v.

In a harmless error inquiry, the government\r\n\nbears the burden of  persuasion with respect to showing  that\r\n\nthe error was  harmless.   United States v.  Olano, 507  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n725,  734-35 (1993).  By contrast, in a plain error argument,\r\n\nthe defendant bears  the burden.   Id.   The government  here\r                                                  \r\n\nfailed  to   argue  that  the    court's   admission  of  the\r\n\nphotograph,  if   error,  would   be  harmless.     Does  the\r\n\ngovernment's  failure  to  raise  this issue  in  its  brief5\r\n\npreclude  further review and  automatically require  that the\r\n\nconviction be reversed  and sent  back for trial?   We  think\r\n\nnot.   Here we review to determine whether the government met\r\n\nits burden  despite its failure explicitly  to argue harmless\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          We join several other  circuit courts of appeals in\r\n\nholding that  appellate courts have the  discretion on direct\r\n\nappeal to overlook the government's failure to argue that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  At  oral  argument, in  response  to  questions from  the\r\ncourt,  the  government  suggested  that any  error  must  be\r\nharmless.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nadmission of the challenged evidence, if error, was harmless,\r\n\nand that appellate courts may therefore consider the issue of\r\n\nharmlessness sua sponte.

In Rodriguez Cortes,  this court noted,  but did not\r                                        \r\n\nresolve, the question, having found the evidence admitted was\r\n\nnot harmless.  949 F.2d at 543.\r\n\n          Here,  we  find  that  the  evidence  admitted  was\r\n\nplainly harmless.  The  photograph was cumulative, the weight\r\n\nof  the   additional  evidence  overwhelming.     Under  such\r\n\ncircumstances, \"it would be a waste of judicial  resources to\r\n\nrequire  a new  trial where  the result  is likely to  be the\r\n\nsame.\"  Id.\r                       \r\n\n          Courts  have variously  grounded  the authority  to\r\n\nengage in sua  sponte harmless error  review on the  arguably\r\n\nmandatory language of Rule 52(a), which states that any error\r\n\nwhich   does  not   affect  substantial   rights  \"shall   be\r                                                                    \r\n\ndisregarded,\" and on other related doctrines.  See Pryce, 938\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 1351 (Randolph, J.,  concurring).  Of obvious concern\r\n\nis   the  cost  to  the  public  of  new  trials  because  of\r\n\ncarelessness  on the part of  the prosecutors on appeal where\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nthe other evidence has  established guilt beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt  and there is little reason to think the error infected\r\n\nthe jury  deliberations.   Also relevant  is the  interest in\r\n\navoiding  incentives to  the government to  fail to  make the\r\n\nproper arguments.\r\n\n          The  Seventh Circuit  decides whether  to undertake\r\n\nthe  harmless error analysis sua sponte based on a three part\r\n\ntest  considering  \"[1]  the  length and  complexity  of  the\r\n\nrecord, [2] whether the  harmlessness of the error or  errors\r\n\nfound is certain  or debatable,  and [3]  whether a  reversal\r\n\nwill  result  in protracted,  costly,  and ultimately  futile\r\n\nproceedings in the district court.\"  Giovannetti, 928 F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n227.   While  we find  helpful the  reasoning of  the Seventh\r\n\nCircuit,  we do  not  restrict ourselves  to the  Giovannetti\r                                                                         \r\n\ntest.  See Pryce, 938 F.2d at 1348 (opinion of  Williams, J.)\r                            \r\n\n(agreeing with  the general  approach of Giovannetti  but not\r                                                                \r\n\nadopting the  specific factors).  The  exercise of discretion\r\n\ninvolves the balancing of many elements.  Among these are the\r\n\nstate  of  the  record and  whether  the  arguments that  the\r\n\ngovernment does make  provide assistance to the court  on the\r\n\nharmlessness issue.6  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Here,  many of the arguments made by the government as to\r\nwhy the photograph was not prejudicial under Rule 403 also go\r\nto the  question of  harmlessness.   Another example  of this\r\nphenomenon is  when the  government marshals the  evidence in\r\nresponse  to an  argument  that the  verdict was  against the\r\nweight  of the  evidence.   That  evidence  too would  be  of\r\nassistance to the court in a harmless error analysis.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n          The government's case is, of course, put at risk by\r\n\nits failure  to  argue that  admission  of the  evidence  was\r\n\nharmless.  Here,  it survives the risk;  in other situations,\r\n\nit  may  not.    Although  the  district  court  abused   its\r\n\ndiscretion by admitting the  photograph of the mock shooting,\r\n\nthat is not a basis for overturning the conviction.\r\n\nSeverance\r                     \r\n\n          Rose  challenges  the  district  court's  denial of\r\n\nmotions  to sever his trial  from Verrill's and  to sever the\r\n\nfelon-in-possession  count.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 14.  Review\r                                            \r\n\nis for abuse  of discretion.  United States  v.

Rose fails to  meet this high\r\n\nstandard.\r\n\n          Rose argues  that being  tried with  Verrill forced\r\n\nhim to abandon his intention of testifying on his own behalf.\r\n\nHe maintains that he  did not participate in the  robbery but\r\n\nmerely picked up Verrill, Vial and Thibodeau when they called\r\n\nto ask him to do so, and  that he only learned of the robbery\r\n\nafter the three men got into  the car.  He argues that if  he\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nhad  testified,  Verrill  would   have  taken  the  stand  to\r\n\nimplicate  him.   Rose  concludes  that  he  and Verrill  had\r\n\nantagonistic defenses which required severance.\r\n\n          The  Supreme  Court   has  held  that   conflicting\r\n\ndefenses  of   codefendants   do  not   necessarily   require\r\n\nseverance,  reasoning that  the risk  of prejudice  will vary\r\n\nwith the facts of  each case.

This court has  further refined  the\r\n\nanalysis,  holding that  antagonistic  defenses only  require\r\n\nseverance if the tensions  between the defenses are  so great\r\n\nthat the finder of  fact would have to believe  one defendant\r\n\nat the expense of the other.  United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1223, 1230 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S.

The  judge  offered to  entertain  the\r\n\nmotion  anew during trial if Verrill did in fact testify, but\r\n\nhe  had no  basis  prior to  trial  for concluding  that  the\r\n\ncodefendants had inconsistent defenses.  Of course, the trial\r\n\njudge  had a \"continuing duty  at all stages  of the trial to\r\n\ngrant a  severance if prejudice [] appear[ed].\"   Schaffer v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  States, 362  U.S. 511,  516 (1960).   Like  the trial\r                          \r\n\njudge in Schaffer, the trial judge here was \"acutely aware of\r                             \r\n\nthe possibility  of prejudice,\"  id., and was  explicit about\r                                                \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nhis  willingness to  sever if  a prejudicial  situation arose\r\n\nduring trial.\r\n\n          That eventuality never occurred.  Neither Rose  nor\r\n\nVerrill  put  on any  evidence  tending  to show  conflicting\r\n\ndefenses.   Rose put on  two witnesses who  testified that he\r\n\nhad  not  been the  driver of  the  black pickup  truck,7 and\r\n\nVerrill  put  on no  witnesses at  all.   This  testimony was\r\n\ninsufficient  to   establish   that  the   codefendants   had\r\n\nantagonistic defenses.8  Nor were the arguments made by their\r\n\ncounsel   necessarily   contradictory.      Rose's   attorney\r\n\nessentially  argued that Rose  had been nothing  more than an\r\n\naccessory after the fact, while Verrill's counsel argued that\r\n\nthe government had failed to meet its burden of proof.  These\r\n\ntheories  are not  irreconcilable.   Even if  they were,  the\r\n\nlevel  of antagonism in defenses is  measured by the evidence\r\n\nactually  introduced at  trial;  argument by  counsel is  not\r\n\nevidence.  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1230.\r                            \r\n\n          Nor  did the  trial court  abuse its  discretion in\r\n\nfailing to sever the  felon-in-possession count.  Rose argues\r\n\nthat if that  count had  been severed, the  jury would  never\r\n\nhave  known of his status  as a convicted  felon.  He asserts\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Rose  also recalled  one  of  the  police officers  as  a\r\ndefense witness.\r\n\n8.  Furthermore,  Rose's  claim  of  prejudice  rests on  the\r\npremise that if Rose had testified, Verrill would  have taken\r\nthe  stand to implicate him.   This seems  improbable, for it\r\nwould have required Verrill to implicate himself as well.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nthat this information tainted him in the eyes of the jury and\r\n\nresulted in his conviction on the conspiracy count.\r\n\n          The felon-in-possession charge  was properly  tried\r\n\nwith  the  other charges  because it  arose  out of  the same\r\n\noccurrence.     Any  prejudice   was  limited  because   Rose\r\n\nstipulated  to  his  status   as  a  prior  convicted  felon.\r\n\nConsequently,  the government  was  not permitted  to put  on\r\n\nevidence  concerning the  number and  nature of  Rose's prior\r\n\nfelony convictions.  Old Chief v. United States, -- S. Ct. --\r                                                           \r\n\n(1997);   United States v.  Tavares, 21 F.3d  1, 4 (1st  Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1994)  (en  banc).    Finally,  it  is  improbable  that  the\r\n\nknowledge of Rose's status as a prior convicted felon led the\r\n\njury to  convict him of the conspiracy charge in light of the\r\n\nacquittal on the two bank robbery charges.\r\n\nOther Jury Instructions\r                                   \r\n\n          Rose also  argues that the district  court erred by\r\n\nrefusing to charge the  jury that mere presence at  the scene\r\n\nof  a  crime  was  not  sufficient  to  convict  him  on  the\r\n\nconspiracy  charge.   The  trial  court's failure  to  give a\r\n\nrequested instruction  on the defendant's theory  of the case\r\n\nis reversible error only if the requested instruction (1) was\r\n\nsubstantively  correct; (2)  was  not  substantially  covered\r\n\nelsewhere in the charge; and (3) concerned an important point\r\n\nin  the  case so  that the  failure  to give  the instruction\r\n\nseriously impaired  the defendant's  ability  to present  his\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ndefense.

Gibson, 726 F.2d 869,  874 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1984).\r\n\n          Jury instructions are viewed  in the context of the\r\n\ncharge as a whole rather than in isolation.  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nNickens, 955 F.2d 112, 119 (1st Cir. 1992).  Furthermore, the\r                   \r\n\ntrial court's charge need not use the exact wording requested\r\n\nby the defendant so long as the  instruction incorporates the\r\n\nsubstance  of  the defendant's  request.    United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCampbell, 874 F.2d 838, 844 (1st Cir. 1989).  Here, the court\r                    \r\n\ninstructed the jury as follows:\r\n\n               Evidence that the  defendant was  in\r\n          the company of, or associated with one or\r\n          more of the persons alleged, or proved to\r\n          have become  a member of  the conspiracy,\r\n          is  not  sufficient  to  prove  that such\r\n          defendant  was  a member  of  the alleged\r\n          conspiracy.  Mere  similarity of  conduct\r\n          among various persons, and the  fact that\r\n          they may have associated with each other,\r\n          may  have  been  together  and  discussed\r\n          common  interests  is  not sufficient  to\r\n          establish membership in a conspiracy.\r\n\nIn  addition,  as  part  of the  instruction  on  aiding  and\r\n\nabetting, the jury was explicitly told that mere  presence at\r\n\nthe scene of the crime, even when coupled with knowledge, was\r\n\ninsufficient  to sustain a  conviction.  On  these facts, the\r\n\njury   charge   substantially    covered   Rose's    proposed\r\n\ninstruction, and  there was no error.\r\n\n          Rose  also  contends  that  the   district  court's\r\n\ninstruction on drawing an inference of guilt from flight from\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nthe  scene of the crime was incomplete.   It is true that the\r\n\ninstruction did  not explicitly  direct the jury  to consider\r\n\nother possible inferences.   However, the charge did indicate\r\n\nthat it  was up to the  jury to determine whether  to draw an\r\n\ninference  of  guilt  from  the flight.    This  conveys  the\r\n\nsubstance of Rose's requested charge.  Williams, 809  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n88.  Furthermore, a  court need only  instruct the jury on  a\r\n\ndefense theory if there is supporting evidence in the record.\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Silvestri,  790 F.2d  186,  192 (1st  Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1986).   Rose's counsel suggested  another possible inference\r\n\nby arguing  in closing that Rose's  flight was understandable\r\n\ngiven  that he  was  surrounded by  men  with drawn  weapons.\r\n\nHowever,  no  evidence  was  adduced  to  this  effect.   The\r\n\nchallenged instruction was a correct statement of the law.\r\n\n          The final claim Rose makes with respect to the jury\r\n\ninstructions is that  the district court erred by refusing to\r\n\ngive a \"missing evidence\" instruction.   We review for  abuse\r\n\nof  discretion.  United States  v. Welch, 15  F.3d 1202, 1214\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  One of the situations that may warrant such\r\n\nan  instruction is when  a party with  exclusive control over\r\n\nrelevant,  noncumulative  evidence   fails  to  produce  that\r\n\nevidence.   Cf. United States v. St.  Michael's Credit Union,\r                                                                        \r\n\n880   F.2d  579,  597   (1st  Cir.   1989)(\"missing  witness\"\r\n\ninstruction).  Rose argues that the FBI's failure  to examine\r\n\nthe  ammunition clip  found  on his  person for  fingerprints\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\njustified the missing  evidence instruction.   However,  this\r\n\nwas not a case where the government failed to provide readily\r\n\navailable  evidence.    The  fingerprint  evidence  was never\r\n\ncollected.  Rose's  counsel was  free to argue  that, in  the\r\n\nabsence of such evidence, the government had not sufficiently\r\n\nlinked Rose to the crime.  See United States v. Martinez, 922\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  914,  925  (1st Cir.  1991).   There  was  no  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\nRose's Sentence\r                           \r\n\n          Rose  charges that  the  district court  should not\r\n\nhave calculated  his base  offense level using  the guideline\r\n\nfor   robbery,  because  he had  been  acquitted of  robbery.\r\n\nReview   of  the   purely  legal   question  of   the  proper\r\n\ninterpretation of a sentencing guideline  is de novo.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Olbres,  99 F.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir.  1996).  There is\r                            \r\n\nno error here.\r\n\n          The   conspiracy   guideline  reflects   \"a  policy\r\n\ndecision that  conspiracies . . . be treated like substantive\r\n\noffenses  for  sentencing  purposes.\"     United  States   v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nChapdelaine,  989 F.2d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 1993).  This question\r                       \r\n\nis  different from  the acquitted  conduct question  faced by\r\n\nthis court in United  States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d  13, 16-17\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st  Cir.   1989),  and   in  Lombard,   72  F.3d   at  174.\r                                                  \r\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court recently held in United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Ct. -- (1997).\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\nVerrill\r                   \r\n\n          Verrill  argues that  the district  court erred  in\r\n\nsentencing  him as a career  offender and as  an armed career\r\n\ncriminal.  Under the  guidelines, an individual is considered\r\n\na career offender if (1) he was at least 18 years old  at the\r\n\ntime  he  committed  the  offense  for   which  he  is  being\r\n\nsentenced; (2) the offense is a  felony and either a crime of\r\n\nviolence or  a substance abuse  crime; and (3)  the defendant\r\n\nhas  at least  two prior convictions  for crimes  of violence\r\n\nand/or substance  abuse crimes.   U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.   Verrill\r\n\nargues,  erroneously,  that  he   does  not  meet  the  third\r\n\nrequirement.\r\n\n          A crime  of violence is defined,  in relevant part,\r\n\nas a state  or federal  offense punishable by  more than  one\r\n\nyear in prison  that \"is  burglary of a  dwelling, arson,  or\r\n\nextortion, involves use of  explosives, or otherwise involves\r\n\nconduct that  presents a  serious potential risk  of physical\r\n\ninjury  to another.\"    U.S.S.G.    4B1.2(1)(ii).   Verrill's\r\n\npresentencing   report  lists   ten  prior   offenses:  three\r\n\ninstances  of  entering  a  dwelling with  intent  to  commit\r\n\nlarceny,  three  instances  of  breaking  and  entering,  one\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\ninstance of breaking and  entering a dwelling with  intent to\r\n\ncommit larceny,  one instance  of breaking and  entering with\r\n\nintent to  commit larceny,  one instance  of possession  of a\r\n\nstolen  vehicle,  and one  instance of  escape.   Six  of the\r\n\noffenses,  at least  four  of which  were  clearly crimes  of\r\n\nviolence, took place during a four month period  when Verrill\r\n\nwas only eighteen years  old.  He therefore argues  that they\r\n\nshould only count as  a single offense.  Verrill  also argues\r\n\nthat  none  of his  later  offenses  (breaking and  entering,\r\n\nbreaking  and   entering  with  intent   to  commit  larceny,\r\n\npossession  of a stolen  vehicle, and escape)  were crimes of\r\n\nviolence or involved a controlled substance.  \r\n\n          Whether  a  particular   offense  qualifies  as   a\r\n\npredicate offense for career offender purposes is reviewed de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo.   United  States v. Winter,  22 F.3d  15, 18  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1994).   This court takes a categorical approach and looks to\r\n\nthe statutory  definitions rather than  the particular facts.\r\n\nId;  see  also Taylor  v. United  States,  495 U.S.  575, 598\r                                                    \r\n\n(1990).   It is therefore  irrelevant that none  of the facts\r\n\nunderlying the prior offenses for which Verrill was convicted\r\n\ninvolved the use of physical  force against another.  Verrill\r\n\nwas  convicted  of breaking  and  entering  and breaking  and\r\n\nentering with intent  to commit larceny in  violation of R.I.\r\n\nGen. Laws    11-8-4.  On  very similar facts,  this court has\r\n\nheld that violation  of that statute  constitutes a crime  of\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nviolence  for career  offender  purposes.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFiore, 983  F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1992).  After all, burglars\r                 \r\n\nmay resort to violence if  someone arrives while the burglary\r\n\nis  in progress.  United  States v. Patterson,  882 F.2d 595,\r                                                         \r\n\n604  (1st Cir. 1989).  Verrill's record shows, apart from his\r\n\nactivities when  he was eighteen,  that he has  the requisite\r\n\ntwo prior convictions to qualify as a career offender.\r\n\n          The  district  court's  calculation  of  an offense\r\n\nlevel of 34 is correct if Verrill is either a career offender\r\n\nor an armed career criminal.   Having determined that Verrill\r\n\nwas correctly  sentenced as  a career offender,  there is  no\r\n\nneed to reach the question of whether he also qualified as an\r\n\narmed  career criminal.  Nor is there  a need to reach any of\r\n\nhis other sentencing claims.9\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  The district  court only addressed these  other issues to\r\nensure  a complete record in  the event that  the decision to\r\nsentence  Verrill  as  a  career offender  and  armed  career\r\ncriminal was reversed on appeal. \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n",

Jamie Rose was convicted of conspiracy to rob a federally insured credit union in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 2113(a), and of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of &#167; 922(g)(1).  Norman Verrill was convicted of the same two offenses and also of armed robbery and robbery of a federally insured credit union.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a), (d).  Rose was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment on the conspiracy count and to 120 months' imprisonment for being a felon in possession;  the sentences are consecutive.  Verrill was sentenced as a career offender and an armed career criminal to a term of 264 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Rose raises a plethora of issues, two of which are weightier than the rest and require us to address issues previously unresolved by this court.  The first concerns the jury charge that may properly be given based on evidence of a defendant's possession of recently stolen property.  The second is whether the trial court abused its discretion by admitting a potentially inflammatory photograph into evidence, and if so, whether this court has discretion to determine whether the error was harmless where the government has not so argued.  Verrill appeals exclusively from the determinations made as to his sentence.  We affirm the convictions and the sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the late morning of April 6, 1994, three men wearing masks entered the Dexter Credit Union in Central Falls, Rhode Island.  The credit union was insured by the National Credit Union Administration.  One robber brandished a semiautomatic pistol while the two others took money from the teller stations.  A fourth masked man waited outside in a black pickup truck, which the robbers used as a get-away vehicle.  Credit union employees determined that $10,584 had been stolen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police arrived at the scene a few minutes after the robbers had fled.  They found the get-away truck abandoned, with its engine running, a few blocks from the credit union.  The ignition had been \"popped,\" and the police later learned that the truck had been stolen two days before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities thought they knew where to find the culprits.  Both the FBI and the Providence Police Department had been investigating Verrill, Rose, David Vial and Christopher Thibodeau in connection with a series of bank robberies.  A confidential informant had provided information that the four men were involved in robbing banks.  A team of officers, consisting of FBI agents and Providence police officers who were part of a bank robbery task force, went to Vial's home in North Providence and waited outside.  A few minutes later, a champagne-colored Nissan Pathfinder carrying four men pulled into the building parking lot.  Task force members had seen Rose and Thibodeau in the Pathfinder earlier that day and knew that the vehicle had been stolen some months earlier and that the license plates had been stolen eleven days before the bank hold-up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The task force members approached the Pathfinder and identified themselves.  Rose, who was driving, pulled away at high speed, nearly hitting two officers in the process.  The officers began shooting.  Vial managed to escape temporarily:  he was found about forty-five minutes later hiding in a bush.  The officers ordered Rose, Verrill and Thibodeau out of the vehicle.  Thibodeau, who had been wounded, was lying on the front seat;  when the police removed him from the car, they found that he was holding a Glock semi-automatic pistol in his left hand and had a Smith &amp; Wesson automatic pistol in the waistband of his pants.  Both were loaded with Winchester 9 millimeter Black Talon and Federal Cartridge hardball 9 millimeter round ammunition.  The officers found two small gym bags, containing over nine thousand dollars and makeshift masks, in the back seat of the Pathfinder.  Some of the money was banded by paper money straps bearing the markings of the Dexter Credit Union.  The four men were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose had suffered a scalp laceration and was brought to Rhode Island Hospital.  The physician's assistant who treated him found a screwdriver, a pager and an ammunition clip from a Glock semi-automatic pistol in his trouser pockets.  These items had not been found in an earlier pat-down of Rose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that night, an FBI agent executed a search warrant at Rose's home in Providence.  There, the agent found a box of Federal Cartridge ammunition designed to hold 50 rounds of ammunition but only containing 39 rounds, as well as a leather pistol case.  The agent also seized a photograph album containing pictures of Rose and others.  Among the photos were five of Rose holding what appeared to be a Glock semiautomatic pistol.  One of the photos showed Rose, finger on the trigger, pointing the pistol at the head of another young man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were charged with conspiracy to rob the Dexter Credit Union;  armed robbery of the credit union;  robbery of the credit union;  using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence;  and possession of a firearm by previously convicted felons.  Vial and Thibodeau, two of the men in the car, pleaded guilty to some of the counts and the rest of the charges against them were dismissed.  Verrill and Rose proceeded to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose moved to sever his trial from Verrill's and to sever the felon-in-possession charge from the other charges.  The motions were denied after a hearing, as was a motion for reconsideration.  The district court ruled that, because there was no evidence of what Verrill's defense would be, there was no basis for concluding that Rose and Verrill had antagonistic defenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vial, a government witness, testified that he, Verrill and Thibodeau entered the credit union while Rose, who had the Glock, remained outside in the truck.  Vial said that Thibodeau had waited at the door of the credit union holding the Smith &amp; Wesson while he and Verrill took the money.  He also testified that all four men fled in the truck but then switched to a second stolen vehicle which he and Rose had left near the credit union earlier that day, and that soon afterwards, they moved to the Pathfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose's consecutive 60 and 120 month sentences were based on the guideline for robbery, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1, as dictated by the conspiracy guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1.  The conspiracy guideline requires that the base offense level for a conspiracy conviction be that of the substantive offense plus adjustments for any intended conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verrill was sentenced both as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4, and as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1.  As either an armed career criminal or as a career offender, Verrill's offense level was 34 and his criminal history category VI, which translates into a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months.  He was sentenced to 264 months.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose argues that his conviction should be reversed for several reasons:  that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motions to sever his trial from Verrill's and to sever the felon-in-possession count;  that the trial court made erroneous and prejudicial evidentiary rulings;  and that the charge to the jury was at times erroneous and at times incomplete.  We deal first with his more serious arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Jury Instruction on Recently Stolen Property</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose questions several aspects of the court's charge to the jury.  The most significant challenge concerns the instruction regarding the inferences that the jury may permissibly draw from the defendant's possession of recently stolen items.  In the context of discussing the stolen get-away vehicles, the court instructed the jury that the possession of recently stolen property, if not satisfactorily explained, could support an inference not only that the person in possession knew that the property was stolen, but also that he participated in the theft.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This raises a question of first impression in this circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The challenged instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion to determine whether the charge, taken as a whole, \" 'fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case to the jury.' \"  United States v. Picciandra, 788 F.2d 39, 46 (1st Cir.1986) (quoting United States v. Fischbach &amp; Moore, Inc., 750 F.2d 1183, 1195 (3d Cir.1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We join the other circuit courts of appeals that have concluded that possession of recently stolen property may support an inference of participation in the theft of that property.  United States v. Clark, 45 F.3d 1247, 1250 (8th Cir.1995);  United States v. Ferro, 709 F.2d 294, 296-97 (5th Cir.1983);  United States v. DiGeronimo, 598 F.2d 746, 754-55 (2d Cir.1979);  United States v. Long, 538 F.2d 580, 580-81 (4th Cir.1976) (per curiam);  United States v. Plemons, 455 F.2d 243, 246 (10th Cir.1972).  These cases rely in large part on the widespread acceptance of the principle and on the common sense reasoning that supports the inference.  See, e.g., Long, 538 F.2d at 581.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize the limits on instructions as to this inference.  First, the instruction may not be given in every case where a defendant was in possession of recently stolen property.  As the Second Circuit noted, in certain situations the inference \"would verge on the irrational\" in light of the other evidence in the case.  United States v. Tavoularis, 515 F.2d 1070, 1074-75 (2d Cir.1975);  see also DiGeronimo, 598 F.2d at 754.   For example, in the absence of additional evidence tending to support the inference, it may not be appropriate to give the instruction.  The court must always act as a check, ensuring \"that the evidence warrants permitting the jury to draw [the] inference.\"  Clark, 45 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the instruction involves a permissive inference rather than a presumption.  The decision about whether the defendant's unexplained possession of recently stolen property supports the conclusion that the defendant participated in the theft is made by the jury based on all of the evidence.  Ferro, 709 F.2d at 297.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this in mind, we turn to Rose's claim that the five month period between the theft of the Pathfinder and his arrest lessens the applicability of the inference.  This claim ignores the other evidence in the case.  The license plates on the Pathfinder were stolen within eleven days of the robbery, the black pickup truck within two days of the robbery, and Vial's testimony linked Rose to the truck.  On these facts, the inference that Rose participated in the theft of the get-away cars is not at all unreasonable or unwarranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose argues that the district court erred by admitting into evidence several items found in his apartment and that this error was not harmless.  Specifically, he asserts that the admission of photos of himself and others with what appears to be a Glock pistol, of a leather pistol case and a photograph showing where it was found in his apartment and of a box of ammunition for a 9 millimeter pistol violated Fed.R.Evid. 403, because the prejudicial impact of these items far outweighed their probative value.  Review of the trial court's evidentiary rulings is for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170, 187 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence, in general, met a threshold test of relevance.  Pistols played an important role in the charged crimes.  One of the robbers brandished a pistol inside the credit union.  Vial testified that Rose was armed with a second pistol.  Two 9 millimeter pistols were seized from codefendant Thibodeau, and a clip of ammunition for a semi-automatic pistol was found on Rose at the hospital.  Items linking Rose to pistols tended to corroborate Vial's testimony that Rose was a participant in the conspiracy and that he had possessed the Glock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presence of a leather case for a pistol in Rose's home is evidence that Rose kept such a weapon there before the crime.  That the case was manufactured by Browning rather than by Smith &amp; Wesson or Glock goes to the weight rather than to the relevance of the evidence.  The jury, during their deliberations, had access to the two seized weapons and to the pistol case and therefore could have determined whether either of the pistols fit the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevance of the ammunition is even more readily apparent.  The ammunition was of the same type as that found in the two guns seized when Rose and his co-defendants were apprehended.  The box was marked as holding fifty rounds, but contained only thirty-nine rounds.  The jury reasonably could have inferred that at least some of the missing rounds had been used to load the two pistols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the photographs showing Rose with a gun are relevant.  FBI Special Agent Kevin Eaton testified at trial that the gun in the photographs appeared to be a Glock firearm;  Eaton stated that Glocks have \"a very distinctive\" look.  The photographs thus link Rose to one of the weapons seized, providing strong corroboration for Vial's inculpatory testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pistol case and accompanying photograph, the ammunition, and four of the photographs showing Rose with what appeared to be a Glock were not unduly prejudicial.  One of the photos, however, which shows Rose, finger on the trigger, with his gun pointed at the head of another person, is potentially quite inflammatory.  Rose is correct that the photo could lead a jury to believe that anyone who would point a possibly loaded pistol at the head of a friend is extremely reckless and capable of criminal acts.  Moreover, this photograph was at best cumulative of the four other photographs linking Rose to the gun.  The admission of this photograph into evidence constituted an abuse of discretion.  The government all but conceded as much at oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the usual case, a non-constitutional evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.   United States v. Rodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d 532, 543 (1st Cir.1991);  United States v. Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d 378, 386 (1st Cir.1990).  In a harmless error inquiry, the government bears the burden of persuasion with respect to showing that the error was harmless.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  By contrast, in a plain error argument, the defendant bears the burden.  Id. The government here failed to argue that the court's admission of the photograph, if error, would be harmless.  Does the government's failure to raise this issue in its brief<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> preclude further review and automatically require that the conviction be reversed and sent back for trial?   We think not.  Here we review to determine whether the government met its burden despite its failure explicitly to argue harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We join several other circuit courts of appeals in holding that appellate courts have the discretion on direct appeal to overlook the government's failure to argue that the admission of the challenged evidence, if error, was harmless, and that appellate courts may therefore consider the issue of harmlessness sua sponte.  Horsley v. Alabama, 45 F.3d 1486, 1492 n. 10 (11th Cir.1995);  United States v. Langston, 970 F.2d 692, 704 n. 9 (10th Cir.1992);  Lufkins v. Leapley, 965 F.2d 1477, 1481 (8th Cir.1992);  United States v. Pryce, 938 F.2d 1343, 1348 (D.C.Cir.1991) (opinion of Williams, J.);  United States v. Giovannetti, 928 F.2d 225, 227 (7th Cir.1991).  In Rodriguez Cortes, this court noted, but did not resolve, the question, having found the evidence admitted was not harmless.  949 F.2d at 543.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we find that the evidence admitted was plainly harmless.  The photograph was cumulative, the weight of the additional evidence overwhelming.  Under such circumstances, \"it would be a waste of judicial resources to require a new trial where the result is likely to be the same.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have variously grounded the authority to engage in sua sponte harmless error review on the arguably mandatory language of Rule 52(a), which states that any error which does not affect substantial rights \"shall be disregarded,\" and on other related doctrines.  See Pryce, 938 F.2d at 1351 (Randolph, J., concurring).  Of obvious concern is the cost to the public of new trials because of carelessness on the part of the prosecutors on appeal where the other evidence has established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and there is little reason to think the error infected the jury deliberations.  Also relevant is the interest in avoiding incentives to the government to fail to make the proper arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit decides whether to undertake the harmless error analysis sua sponte based on a three part test considering \" the length and complexity of the record,  whether the harmlessness of the error or errors found is certain or debatable, and  whether a reversal will result in protracted, costly, and ultimately futile proceedings in the district court.\"  Giovannetti, 928 F.2d at 227.   While we find helpful the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit, we do not restrict ourselves to the Giovannetti test.  See Pryce, 938 F.2d at 1348 (opinion of Williams, J.)  (agreeing with the general approach of Giovannetti but not adopting the specific factors).  The exercise of discretion involves the balancing of many elements.  Among these are the state of the record and whether the arguments that the government does make provide assistance to the court on the harmlessness issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case is, of course, put at risk by its failure to argue that admission of the evidence was harmless.  Here, it survives the risk;  in other situations, it may not.  Although the district court abused its discretion by admitting the photograph of the mock shooting, that is not a basis for overturning the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose challenges the district court's denial of motions to sever his trial from Verrill's and to sever the felon-in-possession count.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 14.  Review is for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67 F.3d 1002, 1007 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1558, 134 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996).  Defendant on appeal must make a strong and specific showing of prejudice.  The prejudice shown must be greater than that inherent in trying multiple counts and multiple defendants together.  United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 896 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Walker, 706 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir.1983).  Rose fails to meet this high standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose argues that being tried with Verrill forced him to abandon his intention of testifying on his own behalf.  He maintains that he did not participate in the robbery but merely picked up Verrill, Vial and Thibodeau when they called to ask him to do so, and that he only learned of the robbery after the three men got into the car.  He argues that if he had testified, Verrill would have taken the stand to implicate him.  Rose concludes that he and Verrill had antagonistic defenses which required severance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that conflicting defenses of codefendants do not necessarily require severance, reasoning that the risk of prejudice will vary with the facts of each case.  Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 538, 113 S.Ct. 933, 937, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993).  This court has further refined the analysis, holding that antagonistic defenses only require severance if the tensions between the defenses are so great that the finder of fact would have to believe one defendant at the expense of the other.  United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1230 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 176, 133 L.Ed.2d 116 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge explained that he was denying the motion because he did not know whether Verrill actually would testify if Rose did, and if so what the substance of that testimony would be.  The judge offered to entertain the motion anew during trial if Verrill did in fact testify, but he had no basis prior to trial for concluding that the codefendants had inconsistent defenses.  Of course, the trial judge had a \"continuing duty at all stages of the trial to grant a severance if prejudice [ ] appear[ed].\"  Schaffer v. United States, 362 U.S. 511, 516, 80 S.Ct. 945, 948, 4 L.Ed.2d 921 (1960).  Like the trial judge in Schaffer, the trial judge here was \"acutely aware of the possibility of prejudice,\" id., and was explicit about his willingness to sever if a prejudicial situation arose during trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That eventuality never occurred.  Neither Rose nor Verrill put on any evidence tending to show conflicting defenses.  Rose put on two witnesses who testified that he had not been the driver of the black pickup truck,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and Verrill put on no witnesses at all.  This testimony was insufficient to establish that the codefendants had antagonistic defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Nor were the arguments made by their counsel necessarily contradictory.  Rose's attorney essentially argued that Rose had been nothing more than an accessory after the fact, while Verrill's counsel argued that the government had failed to meet its burden of proof.  These theories are not irreconcilable.  Even if they were, the level of antagonism in defenses is measured by the evidence actually introduced at trial;  argument by counsel is not evidence.  Smith, 46 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in failing to sever the felon-in-possession count.  Rose argues that if that count had been severed, the jury would never have known of his status as a convicted felon.  He asserts that this information tainted him in the eyes of the jury and resulted in his conviction on the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The felon-in-possession charge was properly tried with the other charges because it arose out of the same occurrence.  Any prejudice was limited because Rose stipulated to his status as a prior convicted felon.  Consequently, the government was not permitted to put on evidence concerning the number and nature of Rose's prior felony convictions.  Old Chief v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997);  United States v. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994) (en banc).  Finally, it is improbable that the knowledge of Rose's status as a prior convicted felon led the jury to convict him of the conspiracy charge in light of the acquittal on the two bank robbery charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Other Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose also argues that the district court erred by refusing to charge the jury that mere presence at the scene of a crime was not sufficient to convict him on the conspiracy charge.  The trial court's failure to give a requested instruction on the defendant's theory of the case is reversible error only if the requested instruction (1) was substantively correct;  (2) was not substantially covered elsewhere in the charge;  and (3) concerned an important point in the case so that the failure to give the instruction seriously impaired the defendant's ability to present his defense.  United States v. Williams, 809 F.2d 75, 86 (1st Cir.1986);  United States v. Gibson, 726 F.2d 869, 874 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury instructions are viewed in the context of the charge as a whole rather than in isolation.  United States v. Nickens, 955 F.2d 112, 119 (1st Cir.1992).  Furthermore, the trial court's charge need not use the exact wording requested by the defendant so long as the instruction incorporates the substance of the defendant's request.   United States v. Campbell, 874 F.2d 838, 844 (1st Cir.1989).  Here, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence that the defendant was in the company of, or associated with one or more of the persons alleged, or proved to have become a member of the conspiracy, is not sufficient to prove that such defendant was a member of the alleged conspiracy.  Mere similarity of conduct among various persons, and the fact that they may have associated with each other, may have been together and discussed common interests is not sufficient to establish membership in a conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, as part of the instruction on aiding and abetting, the jury was explicitly told that mere presence at the scene of the crime, even when coupled with knowledge, was insufficient to sustain a conviction.  On these facts, the jury charge substantially covered Rose's proposed instruction, and there was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose also contends that the district court's instruction on drawing an inference of guilt from flight from the scene of the crime was incomplete.  It is true that the instruction did not explicitly direct the jury to consider other possible inferences.  However, the charge did indicate that it was up to the jury to determine whether to draw an inference of guilt from the flight.  This conveys the substance of Rose's requested charge.  Williams, 809 F.2d at 88.   Furthermore, a court need only instruct the jury on a defense theory if there is supporting evidence in the record.  United States v. Silvestri, 790 F.2d 186, 192 (1st Cir.1986).  Rose's counsel suggested another possible inference by arguing in closing that Rose's flight was understandable given that he was surrounded by men with drawn weapons.  However, no evidence was adduced to this effect.  The challenged instruction was a correct statement of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final claim Rose makes with respect to the jury instructions is that the district court erred by refusing to give a \"missing evidence\" instruction.  We review for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1214 (1st Cir.1993).  One of the situations that may warrant such an instruction is when a party with exclusive control over relevant, noncumulative evidence fails to produce that evidence.  Cf. United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 597 (1st Cir.1989)(\"missing witness\" instruction).  Rose argues that the FBI's failure to examine the ammunition clip found on his person for fingerprints justified the missing evidence instruction.  However, this was not a case where the government failed to provide readily available evidence.  The fingerprint evidence was never collected.  Rose's counsel was free to argue that, in the absence of such evidence, the government had not sufficiently linked Rose to the crime.  See United States v. Martinez, 922 F.2d 914, 925 (1st Cir.1991).  There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Rose's Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose charges that the district court should not have calculated his base offense level using the guideline for robbery, because he had been acquitted of robbery.  Review of the purely legal question of the proper interpretation of a sentencing guideline is de novo.  United States v. Olbres, 99 F.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir.1996).  There is no error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy guideline reflects \"a policy decision that conspiracies ... be treated like substantive offenses for sentencing purposes.\"  United States v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 36 (1st Cir.1993).  This question is different from the acquitted conduct question faced by this court in United States v. Mocciola, 891 F.2d 13, 16-17 (1st Cir.1989), and in Lombard, 72 F.3d at 174.   Furthermore, the Supreme Court recently held in United States v. Watts that a \"jury's verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as the conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Verrill</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verrill argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender and as an armed career criminal.  Under the guidelines, an individual is considered a career offender if (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced;  (2) the offense is a felony and either a crime of violence or a substance abuse crime;  and (3) the defendant has at least two prior convictions for crimes of violence and/or substance abuse crimes.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1.  Verrill argues, erroneously, that he does not meet the third requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A crime of violence is defined, in relevant part, as a state or federal offense punishable by more than one year in prison that \"is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).  Verrill's presentencing report lists ten prior offenses:  three instances of entering a dwelling with intent to commit larceny, three instances of breaking and entering, one instance of breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit larceny, one instance of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, one instance of possession of a stolen vehicle, and one instance of escape.  Six of the offenses, at least four of which were clearly crimes of violence, took place during a four month period when Verrill was only eighteen years old.  He therefore argues that they should only count as a single offense.  Verrill also argues that none of his later offenses (breaking and entering, breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, possession of a stolen vehicle, and escape) were crimes of violence or involved a controlled substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a particular offense qualifies as a predicate offense for career offender purposes is reviewed de novo.  United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1994).  This court takes a categorical approach and looks to the statutory definitions rather than the particular facts.  Id;  see also Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).  It is therefore irrelevant that none of the facts underlying the prior offenses for which Verrill was convicted involved the use of physical force against another.  Verrill was convicted of breaking and entering and breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 11-8-4.  On very similar facts, this court has held that violation of that statute constitutes a crime of violence for career offender purposes.  United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992).  After all, burglars may resort to violence if someone arrives while the burglary is in progress.  United States v. Patterson, 882 F.2d 595, 604 (1st Cir.1989).  Verrill's record shows, apart from his activities when he was eighteen, that he has the requisite two prior convictions to qualify as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's calculation of an offense level of 34 is correct if Verrill is either a career offender or an armed career criminal.  Having determined that Verrill was correctly sentenced as a career offender, there is no need to reach the question of whether he also qualified as an armed career criminal.  Nor is there a need to reach any of his other sentencing claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The loss was initially thought to be $10,913.53, but that figure was later adjusted downward</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> After determining the specific offense characteristics, the court calculated the offense level for the conspiracy count as 31 and the offense level for the felon-in-possession count as 27.  The district court appropriately used the higher offense level of 31, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3, and determined that Rose had a criminal history category of V. The guideline range was 168 to 210 months.  With a statutory maximum of 5 years for the conspiracy conviction and 10 years for the felon-in-possession conviction, the district judge determined the range to be 168 to 180 months.  He effectively sentenced Rose to the statutory maximum</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Rose also argues that the phrase \"if not satisfactorily explained\" impermissibly penalized him for failing to take the stand.  This latter argument has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  Barnes v.

Another example of this phenomenon is when the government marshals the evidence in response to an argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.  That evidence too would be of assistance to the court in a harmless error analysis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Rose also recalled one of the police officers as a defense witness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, Rose's claim of prejudice rests on the premise that if Rose had testified, Verrill would have taken the stand to implicate him.

Jamie Rose was convicted of conspiracy to rob a federally insured credit union in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 2113(a), and of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of &#167; 922(g)(1).  Norman Verrill was convicted of the same two offenses and also of armed robbery and robbery of a federally insured credit union.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a), (d).  Rose was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment on the conspiracy count and to 120 months' imprisonment for being a felon in possession;  the sentences are consecutive.  Verrill was sentenced as a career offender and an armed career criminal to a term of 264 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Rose raises a plethora of issues, two of which are weightier than the rest and require us to address issues previously unresolved by this court.  The first concerns the jury charge that may properly be given based on evidence of a defendant's possession of recently stolen property.  The second is whether the trial court abused its discretion by admitting a potentially inflammatory photograph into evidence, and if so, whether this court has discretion to determine whether the error was harmless where the government has not so argued.  Verrill appeals exclusively from the determinations made as to his sentence.  We affirm the convictions and the sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the late morning of April 6, 1994, three men wearing masks entered the Dexter Credit Union in Central Falls, Rhode Island.  The credit union was insured by the National Credit Union Administration.  One robber brandished a semiautomatic pistol while the two others took money from the teller stations.  A fourth masked man waited outside in a black pickup truck, which the robbers used as a get-away vehicle.  Credit union employees determined that $10,584 had been stolen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police arrived at the scene a few minutes after the robbers had fled.  They found the get-away truck abandoned, with its engine running, a few blocks from the credit union.  The ignition had been \"popped,\" and the police later learned that the truck had been stolen two days before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities thought they knew where to find the culprits.  Both the FBI and the Providence Police Department had been investigating Verrill, Rose, David Vial and Christopher Thibodeau in connection with a series of bank robberies.  A confidential informant had provided information that the four men were involved in robbing banks.  A team of officers, consisting of FBI agents and Providence police officers who were part of a bank robbery task force, went to Vial's home in North Providence and waited outside.  A few minutes later, a champagne-colored Nissan Pathfinder carrying four men pulled into the building parking lot.  Task force members had seen Rose and Thibodeau in the Pathfinder earlier that day and knew that the vehicle had been stolen some months earlier and that the license plates had been stolen eleven days before the bank hold-up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The task force members approached the Pathfinder and identified themselves.  Rose, who was driving, pulled away at high speed, nearly hitting two officers in the process.  The officers began shooting.  Vial managed to escape temporarily:  he was found about forty-five minutes later hiding in a bush.  The officers ordered Rose, Verrill and Thibodeau out of the vehicle.  Thibodeau, who had been wounded, was lying on the front seat;  when the police removed him from the car, they found that he was holding a Glock semi-automatic pistol in his left hand and had a Smith &amp; Wesson automatic pistol in the waistband of his pants.  Both were loaded with Winchester 9 millimeter Black Talon and Federal Cartridge hardball 9 millimeter round ammunition.  The officers found two small gym bags, containing over nine thousand dollars and makeshift masks, in the back seat of the Pathfinder.  Some of the money was banded by paper money straps bearing the markings of the Dexter Credit Union.  The four men were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose had suffered a scalp laceration and was brought to Rhode Island Hospital.  The physician's assistant who treated him found a screwdriver, a pager and an ammunition clip from a Glock semi-automatic pistol in his trouser pockets.  These items had not been found in an earlier pat-down of Rose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that night, an FBI agent executed a search warrant at Rose's home in Providence.  There, the agent found a box of Federal Cartridge ammunition designed to hold 50 rounds of ammunition but only containing 39 rounds, as well as a leather pistol case.  The agent also seized a photograph album containing pictures of Rose and others.  Among the photos were five of Rose holding what appeared to be a Glock semiautomatic pistol.  One of the photos showed Rose, finger on the trigger, pointing the pistol at the head of another young man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were charged with conspiracy to rob the Dexter Credit Union;  armed robbery of the credit union;  robbery of the credit union;  using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence;  and possession of a firearm by previously convicted felons.  Vial and Thibodeau, two of the men in the car, pleaded guilty to some of the counts and the rest of the charges against them were dismissed.  Verrill and Rose proceeded to trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose moved to sever his trial from Verrill's and to sever the felon-in-possession charge from the other charges.  The motions were denied after a hearing, as was a motion for reconsideration.  The district court ruled that, because there was no evidence of what Verrill's defense would be, there was no basis for concluding that Rose and Verrill had antagonistic defenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vial, a government witness, testified that he, Verrill and Thibodeau entered the credit union while Rose, who had the Glock, remained outside in the truck.  Vial said that Thibodeau had waited at the door of the credit union holding the Smith &amp; Wesson while he and Verrill took the money.  He also testified that all four men fled in the truck but then switched to a second stolen vehicle which he and Rose had left near the credit union earlier that day, and that soon afterwards, they moved to the Pathfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose's consecutive 60 and 120 month sentences were based on the guideline for robbery, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1, as dictated by the conspiracy guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1.  The conspiracy guideline requires that the base offense level for a conspiracy conviction be that of the substantive offense plus adjustments for any intended conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2X1.1(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verrill was sentenced both as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4, and as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1.  As either an armed career criminal or as a career offender, Verrill's offense level was 34 and his criminal history category VI, which translates into a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months.  He was sentenced to 264 months.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose argues that his conviction should be reversed for several reasons:  that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motions to sever his trial from Verrill's and to sever the felon-in-possession count;  that the trial court made erroneous and prejudicial evidentiary rulings;  and that the charge to the jury was at times erroneous and at times incomplete.  We deal first with his more serious arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Jury Instruction on Recently Stolen Property</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose questions several aspects of the court's charge to the jury.  The most significant challenge concerns the instruction regarding the inferences that the jury may permissibly draw from the defendant's possession of recently stolen items.  In the context of discussing the stolen get-away vehicles, the court instructed the jury that the possession of recently stolen property, if not satisfactorily explained, could support an inference not only that the person in possession knew that the property was stolen, but also that he participated in the theft.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This raises a question of first impression in this circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The challenged instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion to determine whether the charge, taken as a whole, \" 'fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case to the jury.' \"  United States v.

These cases rely in large part on the widespread acceptance of the principle and on the common sense reasoning that supports the inference.  See, e.g., Long, 538 F.2d at 581.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize the limits on instructions as to this inference.  First, the instruction may not be given in every case where a defendant was in possession of recently stolen property.  As the Second Circuit noted, in certain situations the inference \"would verge on the irrational\" in light of the other evidence in the case.  United States v. Tavoularis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"327527\"><a href=\"/opinion/327527/united-states-v-anthony-tavoularis/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span>, 1074-75 (2d Cir.1975);  see also DiGeronimo, 598 F.2d at 754.   For example, in the absence of additional evidence tending to support the inference, it may not be appropriate to give the instruction.  The court must always act as a check, ensuring \"that the evidence warrants permitting the jury to draw [the] inference.\"  Clark, 45 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the instruction involves a permissive inference rather than a presumption.  The decision about whether the defendant's unexplained possession of recently stolen property supports the conclusion that the defendant participated in the theft is made by the jury based on all of the evidence.

This claim ignores the other evidence in the case.  The license plates on the Pathfinder were stolen within eleven days of the robbery, the black pickup truck within two days of the robbery, and Vial's testimony linked Rose to the truck.  On these facts, the inference that Rose participated in the theft of the get-away cars is not at all unreasonable or unwarranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Evidentiary Rulings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose argues that the district court erred by admitting into evidence several items found in his apartment and that this error was not harmless.  Specifically, he asserts that the admission of photos of himself and others with what appears to be a Glock pistol, of a leather pistol case and a photograph showing where it was found in his apartment and of a box of ammunition for a 9 millimeter pistol violated Fed.R.Evid. 403, because the prejudicial impact of these items far outweighed their probative value.  Review of the trial court's evidentiary rulings is for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Lombard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196476\"><a href=\"/opinion/196476/united-states-v-lombard/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span>, 187 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence, in general, met a threshold test of relevance.  Pistols played an important role in the charged crimes.  One of the robbers brandished a pistol inside the credit union.  Vial testified that Rose was armed with a second pistol.  Two 9 millimeter pistols were seized from codefendant Thibodeau, and a clip of ammunition for a semi-automatic pistol was found on Rose at the hospital.  Items linking Rose to pistols tended to corroborate Vial's testimony that Rose was a participant in the conspiracy and that he had possessed the Glock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presence of a leather case for a pistol in Rose's home is evidence that Rose kept such a weapon there before the crime.  That the case was manufactured by Browning rather than by Smith &amp; Wesson or Glock goes to the weight rather than to the relevance of the evidence.  The jury, during their deliberations, had access to the two seized weapons and to the pistol case and therefore could have determined whether either of the pistols fit the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevance of the ammunition is even more readily apparent.  The ammunition was of the same type as that found in the two guns seized when Rose and his co-defendants were apprehended.  The box was marked as holding fifty rounds, but contained only thirty-nine rounds.  The jury reasonably could have inferred that at least some of the missing rounds had been used to load the two pistols.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, the photographs showing Rose with a gun are relevant.  FBI Special Agent Kevin Eaton testified at trial that the gun in the photographs appeared to be a Glock firearm;  Eaton stated that Glocks have \"a very distinctive\" look.  The photographs thus link Rose to one of the weapons seized, providing strong corroboration for Vial's inculpatory testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pistol case and accompanying photograph, the ammunition, and four of the photographs showing Rose with what appeared to be a Glock were not unduly prejudicial.  One of the photos, however, which shows Rose, finger on the trigger, with his gun pointed at the head of another person, is potentially quite inflammatory.  Rose is correct that the photo could lead a jury to believe that anyone who would point a possibly loaded pistol at the head of a friend is extremely reckless and capable of criminal acts.  Moreover, this photograph was at best cumulative of the four other photographs linking Rose to the gun.  The admission of this photograph into evidence constituted an abuse of discretion.  The government all but conceded as much at oral argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the usual case, a non-constitutional evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.

See Pryce, 938 F.2d at 1351 (Randolph, J., concurring).  Of obvious concern is the cost to the public of new trials because of carelessness on the part of the prosecutors on appeal where the other evidence has established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and there is little reason to think the error infected the jury deliberations.

The judge offered to entertain the motion anew during trial if Verrill did in fact testify, but he had no basis prior to trial for concluding that the codefendants had inconsistent defenses.  Of course, the trial judge had a \"continuing duty at all stages of the trial to grant a severance if prejudice [ ] appear[ed].\"  Schaffer v.

Neither Rose nor Verrill put on any evidence tending to show conflicting defenses.  Rose put on two witnesses who testified that he had not been the driver of the black pickup truck,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and Verrill put on no witnesses at all.  This testimony was insufficient to establish that the codefendants had antagonistic defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Nor were the arguments made by their counsel necessarily contradictory.  Rose's attorney essentially argued that Rose had been nothing more than an accessory after the fact, while Verrill's counsel argued that the government had failed to meet its burden of proof.  These theories are not irreconcilable.  Even if they were, the level of antagonism in defenses is measured by the evidence actually introduced at trial;  argument by counsel is not evidence.

The trial court's failure to give a requested instruction on the defendant's theory of the case is reversible error only if the requested instruction (1) was substantively correct;  (2) was not substantially covered elsewhere in the charge;  and (3) concerned an important point in the case so that the failure to give the instruction seriously impaired the defendant's ability to present his defense.

Furthermore, the trial court's charge need not use the exact wording requested by the defendant so long as the instruction incorporates the substance of the defendant's request.   United States v.

Here, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence that the defendant was in the company of, or associated with one or more of the persons alleged, or proved to have become a member of the conspiracy, is not sufficient to prove that such defendant was a member of the alleged conspiracy.  Mere similarity of conduct among various persons, and the fact that they may have associated with each other, may have been together and discussed common interests is not sufficient to establish membership in a conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, as part of the instruction on aiding and abetting, the jury was explicitly told that mere presence at the scene of the crime, even when coupled with knowledge, was insufficient to sustain a conviction.  On these facts, the jury charge substantially covered Rose's proposed instruction, and there was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rose also contends that the district court's instruction on drawing an inference of guilt from flight from the scene of the crime was incomplete.  It is true that the instruction did not explicitly direct the jury to consider other possible inferences.  However, the charge did indicate that it was up to the jury to determine whether to draw an inference of guilt from the flight.  This conveys the substance of Rose's requested charge.  Williams, 809 F.2d at 88.   Furthermore, a court need only instruct the jury on a defense theory if there is supporting evidence in the record.  United States v.

Rose's counsel suggested another possible inference by arguing in closing that Rose's flight was understandable given that he was surrounded by men with drawn weapons.  However, no evidence was adduced to this effect.  The challenged instruction was a correct statement of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final claim Rose makes with respect to the jury instructions is that the district court erred by refusing to give a \"missing evidence\" instruction.

One of the situations that may warrant such an instruction is when a party with exclusive control over relevant, noncumulative evidence fails to produce that evidence.  Cf. United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526736\"><a href=\"/opinion/526736/united-states-v-st-michaels-credit-union-and-janice-sacharczyk/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 597 (1st Cir.1989)(\"missing witness\" instruction).  Rose argues that the FBI's failure to examine the ammunition clip found on his person for fingerprints justified the missing evidence instruction.  However, this was not a case where the government failed to provide readily available evidence.  The fingerprint evidence was never collected.  Rose's counsel was free to argue that, in the absence of such evidence, the government had not sufficiently linked Rose to the crime.  See United States v. Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553838\"><a href=\"/opinion/553838/united-states-v-victor-martinez-united-states-of-america-v-hector-vidal/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 925 (1st Cir.1991).

Review of the purely legal question of the proper interpretation of a sentencing guideline is de novo.  United States v. Olbres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197051\"><a href=\"/opinion/197051/united-states-v-olbres/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.1996).  There is no error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy guideline reflects \"a policy decision that conspiracies ... be treated like substantive offenses for sentencing purposes.\"  United States v.

This question is different from the acquitted conduct question faced by this court in United States v.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court recently held in United States v. Watts that a \"jury's verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as the conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span> (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Verrill</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Verrill argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender and as an armed career criminal.  Under the guidelines, an individual is considered a career offender if (1) he was at least 18 years old at the time he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced;  (2) the offense is a felony and either a crime of violence or a substance abuse crime;  and (3) the defendant has at least two prior convictions for crimes of violence and/or substance abuse crimes.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1.  Verrill argues, erroneously, that he does not meet the third requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A crime of violence is defined, in relevant part, as a state or federal offense punishable by more than one year in prison that \"is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).  Verrill's presentencing report lists ten prior offenses:  three instances of entering a dwelling with intent to commit larceny, three instances of breaking and entering, one instance of breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit larceny, one instance of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, one instance of possession of a stolen vehicle, and one instance of escape.  Six of the offenses, at least four of which were clearly crimes of violence, took place during a four month period when Verrill was only eighteen years old.  He therefore argues that they should only count as a single offense.  Verrill also argues that none of his later offenses (breaking and entering, breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, possession of a stolen vehicle, and escape) were crimes of violence or involved a controlled substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a particular offense qualifies as a predicate offense for career offender purposes is reviewed de novo.  United States v. Winter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195327\"><a href=\"/opinion/195327/united-states-v-winter/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1994).  This court takes a categorical approach and looks to the statutory definitions rather than the particular facts.  Id;  see also Taylor v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 598, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2143</span></a></span>, 2158, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990).  It is therefore irrelevant that none of the facts underlying the prior offenses for which Verrill was convicted involved the use of physical force against another.  Verrill was convicted of breaking and entering and breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 11-8-4.  On very similar facts, this court has held that violation of that statute constitutes a crime of violence for career offender purposes.  United States v. Fiore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597517\"><a href=\"/opinion/597517/united-states-v-anthony-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992).  After all, burglars may resort to violence if someone arrives while the burglary is in progress.  United States v. Patterson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527784\"><a href=\"/opinion/527784/united-states-v-john-w-patterson-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span>, 604 (1st Cir.1989).  Verrill's record shows, apart from his activities when he was eighteen, that he has the requisite two prior convictions to qualify as a career offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's calculation of an offense level of 34 is correct if Verrill is either a career offender or an armed career criminal.  Having determined that Verrill was correctly sentenced as a career offender, there is no need to reach the question of whether he also qualified as an armed career criminal.  Nor is there a need to reach any of his other sentencing claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The loss was initially thought to be $10,913.53, but that figure was later adjusted downward</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> After determining the specific offense characteristics, the court calculated the offense level for the conspiracy count as 31 and the offense level for the felon-in-possession count as 27.  The district court appropriately used the higher offense level of 31, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3, and determined that Rose had a criminal history category of V. The guideline range was 168 to 210 months.  With a statutory maximum of 5 years for the conspiracy conviction and 10 years for the felon-in-possession conviction, the district judge determined the range to be 168 to 180 months.  He effectively sentenced Rose to the statutory maximum</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Rose also argues that the phrase \"if not satisfactorily explained\" impermissibly penalized him for failing to take the stand.  This latter argument has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  Barnes v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108830\"><a href=\"/opinion/108830/barnes-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 846-47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108830\"><a href=\"/opinion/108830/barnes-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2357</span></a></span>, 2363, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108830\"><a href=\"/opinion/108830/barnes-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span> (1973)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It has long been the law that the jury may infer from an individual's possession of recently stolen items that the individual knew the property had been stolen.  See generally United States v. Farnkoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335420\"><a href=\"/opinion/335420/united-states-v-george-h-farnkoff-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 666-67 (1st Cir.1976)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> At oral argument, in response to questions from the court, the government suggested that any error must be harmless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Here, many of the arguments made by the government as to why the photograph was not prejudicial under Rule 403 also go to the question of harmlessness.  Another example of this phenomenon is when the government marshals the evidence in response to an argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.  That evidence too would be of assistance to the court in a harmless error analysis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Rose also recalled one of the police officers as a defense witness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, Rose's claim of prejudice rests on the premise that if Rose had testified, Verrill would have taken the stand to implicate him.  This seems improbable, for it would have required Verrill to implicate himself as well</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The district court only addressed these other issues to ensure a complete record in the event that the decision to sentence Verrill as a career offender and armed career criminal was reversed on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
