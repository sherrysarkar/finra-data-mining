Plaintiffs-appellants challenge\r\nthe district court's dismissal of their equitable claim on the\r\ngrounds of mootness.  We affirm on a different ground.\r\n     Because this case turns principally on its procedural\r\nposture, we do no more than skim the facts.  See CCM Cable Rep.,\r\nInc. v. Ocean Cost Properties, Inc., 48 F.3d 618, 619 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).\r\n     Plaintiffs are the owners in fee simple of a parcel of\r\nland in the Mediana Baja Ward of the Municipality of Loza in the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.  One of the plaintiffs-appellants,\r\nSurima Surez-Cestero, has a contract for the extraction of sand\r\nfrom the property and a Department of Natural Resources and the\r\nEnvironment (\"DNRE\") permit for its extraction.  She alleges that\r\nthe extraction of sand is the first phase of the development of a\r\nresidential project.\r\n     Surez allegedly sought and received approval for the\r\nproject from the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewers Authority, the\r\nPuerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Department of\r\nTransportation and Public Works, the Institute of Puerto Rican\r\nCulture, the Puerto Rico Telephone Company, the Puerto Rico\r\nEnvironmental Quality Board, as well as from the Municipality of\r\nLoza and the DNRE.  Plaintiffs-appellants allege that although\r\nthe sand extraction was incidental to the project, as approved by\r\nthe above agencies, the DNRE additionally required that Surez\r\nobtain an extraction permit.  Surez complied with all of the\r\napplication requirements and, after public notice and without\r\nopposition, the permit was issued in December 1996.  Plaintiffs-\r\nappellants claim that they relied on the permit and commenced sand\r\nextraction in January 1997.\r\nOn April 29, 1997, the Municipality filed a civil action\r\nin the Carolina Superior Court requesting a temporary restraining \r\norder and temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent the\r\nextraction of sand from the property.  It averred that the\r\nconstruction permits requested for the development project were a\r\nsubterfuge for obtaining a commercial sand extraction permit which\r\nwould create an artificial lake without properly evaluating the\r\nindividual and cumulative environmental impact on the surrounding\r\narea.  The Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order.\r\nNeedless to say, civil and administrative proceedings\r\nresulted.  As part of the administrative proceedings, on June 6,\r\n1997, the Secretary of the DNRE issued a Cease and Desist and Show\r\nCause Order against Surez enjoining her from further extraction\r\nactivities and ordering her to show cause why the permits should\r\nnot be modified and/or revoked.  On June 24, Surez filed an answer\r\nand requested an administrative hearing.  After the Carolina\r\nSuperior Court refused to issue the permanent injunction (and\r\ndissolved the earlier restraining order), Surez notified the DNRE\r\nthat its Cease and Desist Order was no longer valid because the\r\nMunicipality's action had been dismissed, and that she was going to\r\nresume extraction activities.  On August 8, Pagn-Rosa, Secretary\r\nof the DNRE, notified Surez that the administrative proceedings\r\nagainst her were to continue and that any request or petition\r\nshould be presented by motion in the administrative case.  Surez\r\nthen requested that the administrative case be dismissed.  When it\r\nwas not, believing that the Cease and Desist Order constituted a\r\ncontinuing violation of their due process rights, plaintiffs-\r\nappellants filed a verified complaint and request for a temporary\r\nrestraining order in federal district court on August 19, 1997.\r\nThe hearing on the requested injunctive relief was set\r\nfor September 24.  On September 23, 1997, the Governor of Puerto\r\nRico signed into law Joint Resolution of the Senate No. 398.  The\r\nstatute declared a year-long moratorium on the issuance of sand\r\nextraction permits by the DNRE in Loza, and stayed the\r\neffectiveness of all existing permits, pending an environmental\r\nstudy of the impact of sand extraction in the area.\r\nIn its Opinion and Order, the district court dismissed\r\nplaintiffs-appellants' claim for equitable relief on the ground of\r\nmootness because \"an injunction enjoining defendants from\r\ninterfering with plaintiff's sand extraction activities would be,\r\nin fact, of no benefit to plaintiffs, since they are equally\r\nimpeded by [Senate Joint resolution No. 398].\"  Opinion and Orderat 9.\r\n\"[C]ourts of appeal will reverse a district court's\r\ndenial of a preliminary injunction only if the district court\r\nabused its discretion.\"  American Bd. of Psychology and Neurology,\r\nInc. v. Johnson-Powell, 129 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nWe conclude that the district court acted within its\r\ndiscretion in refusing to entertain the claim for preliminary\r\ninjunctive relief at the start of the moratorium period, albeit for\r\na different ground than that cited by the district court.  In order\r\nto gain a preliminary injunction in the First Circuit, a plaintiff\r\nmust satisfy four criteria.  The court must find:\r\n(1) that plaintiff will suffer irreparable\r\ninjury if the injunction is not granted; (2)\r\nthat such injury outweighs any harm which\r\ngranting injunctive relief would inflict on\r\nthe defendant; (3) that plaintiff has\r\nexhibited a likelihood of success on the\r\nmerits; and (4) that the public interest will\r\nnot be adversely affected by the granting of\r\nthe injunction.\r\n\nPlanned Parenthood League of Massachusetts v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d\r\n1006, 1008-09 (1st Cir. 1981).\r\nIrreparable harm is a necessary precondition to a\r\npreliminary injunction and, given the moratorium on sand extraction\r\nin place, none existed here.  By definition, the court's refusal to\r\ngrant a preliminary injunction caused plaintiffs no harm since they\r\nwere equally impeded by the moratorium.  As a result, plaintiffs-\r\nappellants were not entitled to a preliminary injunction.\r\nIn theory, the district court should have dismissed only\r\nthe request for a preliminary injunction, not the request for a\r\npermanent injunction -- which the district court did by denying all\r\nequitable relief.  Nevertheless, to the degree that the moratorium\r\nis no longer in existence, the plaintiffs can renew their request\r\nfor temporary equitable relief; and the time to consider permanent\r\ninjunctive relief will come at the close of the case, and will not\r\nbe foreclosed either by the lower court's ruling or by this court's\r\nopinion.

The court must find:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>(1) that plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted;  (2) that such injury outweighs any harm which granting injunctive relief would inflict on the defendant;  (3) that plaintiff has exhibited a likelihood of success on the merits;  and (4) that the public interest will not be adversely affected by the granting of the injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts v. Bellotti, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387368\"><a href=\"/opinion/387368/planned-parenthood-league-of-massachusetts-v-francis-x-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1008-09 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Irreparable harm is a necessary precondition to a preliminary injunction and, given the moratorium on sand extraction in place, none existed here.  By definition, the court's refusal to grant a preliminary injunction caused plaintiffs no harm since they were equally impeded by the moratorium.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As a result, plaintiffs-appellants were not entitled to a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In theory, the district court should have dismissed only the request for a preliminary injunction, not the request for a permanent injunction--which the district court did by denying all equitable relief.  Nevertheless, to the degree that the moratorium is no longer in existence, the plaintiffs can renew their request for temporary equitable relief;  and the time to consider permanent injunctive relief will come at the close of the case, and will not be foreclosed either by the lower court's ruling or by this court's opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Daniel Pagan-Rosa is one of the defendants-appellees in his personal and official capacities as Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment.
