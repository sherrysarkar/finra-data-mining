FLORENCE,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJ. Martin Richey, Federal Defender Office, for appellant.\r\nBen T. Clements, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\n                     May 4, 1998\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant James P.\r\nFlorence strives to convince us that the district court erred when\r\nit ordered a federal sentence to be served consecutively to the\r\nundischarged portion of certain state sentences.  We are not\r\npersuaded.\r\n                           I.\r\n                       Background\r\nIn October 1993, the appellant asked a cousin who lived\r\nin Kentucky to buy guns for him.  The cousin complied.  Florence\r\nthen brought the firearms into Massachusetts.  At the time the\r\nappellant purchased, possessed, and transported the weapons, he was\r\na convicted felon (manslaughter and unlawful possession of a\r\nfirearm).\r\nOn February 15, 1994, masked men used one of the\r\ntransported firearms, a Norinco semi-automatic pistol, to rob a\r\npizza parlor in Rosindale, Massachusetts.  A brigand armed with\r\nthat pistol shot a bystander, leaving him paralyzed.  Some weeks\r\nlater, a state trooper attempted to stop the appellant for a motor\r\nvehicle infraction.  During an ensuing chase, Florence threw the\r\nsame Norinco pistol onto the median strip where the authorities\r\nsubsequently recovered it.\r\nLike the mills of the Gods, see  George Herbert, Jacula\r\nPrudentum (1651), the wheels of justice sometimes grind slow. \r\nNearly three years elapsed before a federal grand jury charged the\r\nappellant with transporting a firearm across state lines and being\r\na felon in possession of a firearm.  See 18 U.S.C.  922(a)(3) and\r\n(g)(1) (1994).  Both counts of the indictment referred to the\r\nNorinco semi-automatic pistol.  The appellant eventually pled\r\nguilty to these charges.  The district court imposed a 60-month\r\nincarcerative term for the transportation offense and a 96-month\r\nterm for the felon-in-possession offense.  The court stipulated\r\nthat these sentences were to be served concurrently with each\r\nother, but consecutively to all undischarged state sentences.\r\nAt the time of the federal disposition (July 18, 1997),\r\nthe appellant was serving a two-year state sentence for possession\r\nof heroin with intent to distribute (State Sentence No. 1), which\r\nhe had begun on April 17, 1996.  Between April and August 1996, he\r\nreceived (and elected not to contest) five separate citations for\r\nprobation violations in connection with (1) a charge of heroin\r\npossession, (2) a charge of marijuana possession, and (3) three\r\nseparate motor vehicle offenses.  In the same time frame, he also\r\npleaded guilty to several outstanding state charges, including two\r\nseparate charges related to possession of cocaine; a charge of\r\npossession of heroin with intent to distribute; and a charge of\r\npossession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  The state\r\ncourts revoked the appellant's probation, imposed concurrent\r\nsentences for the probation violations and the new offenses, and\r\nspecified that the new sentences (none of which exceeded one year,\r\nand all of which expired on or before May 21, 1997) would run\r\nconcurrently with State Sentence No. 1.  During the same period,\r\nthe state courts likewise revoked a one-year term of probation\r\nstemming from an underlying narcotics offense and imposed a one-\r\nyear sentence (State Sentence No. 2) to be served \"from and after\"\r\nthe expiration of State Sentence No. 1.\r\nWhen Judge Harrington convened the federal disposition\r\nhearing, the appellant had served approximately 15 months of the\r\ntotal of three years' immurement levied against him for the\r\ncompendium of state offenses.  The remaining time (roughly 21\r\nmonths) constituted the undischarged portion of his state sentences\r\n(Nos. 1 and 2).\r\n                          II.\r\n                  The Legal Landscape\r\nAppellate review of a district court's application of the\r\nsentencing guidelines demands a bifurcated inquiry.  The court of\r\nappeals affords plenary review to the sentencing judge's assessment\r\nof a guideline's legal meaning and scope, but reviews the judge's\r\nfactfinding only for clear error.  See United States v. Brewster,\r\n1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d\r\n698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nOrdinarily, federal sentencing proceeds according to the\r\nversion of the guidelines in effect at the time that sentence is\r\npronounced.  See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-\r\n42 (1st Cir. 1990).  An exception exists, however, if changes in\r\nthe guidelines between the date of the offense and the date of\r\ndisposition threaten the defendant with harsher treatment.  In\r\ndeference to ex post facto concerns, the sentencing court then\r\ncustomarily applies the version of the guidelines that obtained\r\nwhen the defendant committed the crime.  See id.\r\nUSSG 5G1.3 covers the sentencing of defendants who are\r\nsubject to undischarged terms of imprisonment (federal or state). \r\nIn the instant case, the government and the appellant agree that\r\nthe 1993 version of section 5G1.3, in effect on the date  Florence\r\ncommitted the federal offenses, should control.  We therefore\r\nabjure independent consideration of the point and proceed to\r\nanalyze the appellant's claim under the November 1993 edition of\r\nthe sentencing guidelines.\r\nWe reproduce in the margin the text of this guideline as\r\nit read in 1993.  In general, this guideline contemplates three\r\nsomewhat different types of situations:  subsection (a) deals with\r\nfederal offenses committed during the pendency or service of a\r\nstate sentence; subsection (b) deals with state sentences arising\r\nout of conduct related to the offense of conviction (i.e., conduct\r\nwhich must be taken into account when calculating the federal\r\nsentence); and subsection (c) applies to all other federal\r\nsentences imposed while the defendant is serving an undischarged\r\nterm of imprisonment.  At the time of the federal disposition in\r\nthis matter, the appellant was serving a state term of imprisonment\r\nfor conduct wholly unrelated to his federal firearms offenses\r\n(State Sentence No. 1), he had pending another undischarged state\r\nterm of imprisonment for unrelated conduct (State Sentence No. 2),\r\nand he had perpetrated the federal offenses prior to the commission\r\nof the state offenses that underlay those sentences.  Consequently,\r\nsection 5G1.3(c) applies here.\r\nIn its 1993 iteration, section 5G1.3(c) provides that, in\r\ncases not covered elsewhere in section 5G1.3, \"the sentence for the\r\ninstant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to\r\nachieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant\r\noffense.\"  Former Application Note 3 placed a gloss on this\r\nlanguage, admonishing that \"[t]o the extent practicable, the court\r\nshould consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence\r\nfor the instant offense that results in the combined sentence of\r\nimprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have\r\nbeen imposed under section 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of\r\nConviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which\r\nsentences were being imposed at the same time.\"  In turn, section\r\n5G1.2 directed that, in regard to multiple counts of conviction,\r\nthe sentence on each count should run consecutively to the extent\r\nnecessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total\r\npunishment when all offenses are considered together.  See USSG\r\n5G1.2(b)-(d).\r\nAs if this litany of rules did not, in itself, create a\r\nsufficient maze, we note that in 1993, as now, the procedure for\r\ndetermining the offense level on multiple counts of conviction\r\nrequired the sentencing court to \"group\" the counts to the extent\r\npracticable.  See USSG 3D1.2.  Under the applicable grouping\r\nrules, counts that \"involve substantially the same harm\" form a\r\nsingle group.  USSG 3D1.2.  The court then calculates the offense\r\nlevel for each count within each group, attributes to each group\r\nthe highest offense level of any count within it, compares the\r\ngroups to ascertain which has the highest offense level, considers\r\ncertain further adjustments (not relevant to our inquiry here), and\r\nsentences the defendant based on that triage.  See United States v.\r\nHernandez-Coplin, 24 F.3d 312, 319-20 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nInterleaving  this procedure with the analytic approach\r\nenvisioned by former Application Note 3 results in the following\r\nparadigm for purposes of USSG 5G1.3(c).  The district court must\r\nfirst group the state convictions that undergird the undischarged\r\nstate sentences as if they were federal offenses and ascertain what\r\nterm of imprisonment those offenses would yield had they been\r\ndirectly subject to the federal sentencing guidelines.  The court\r\nthen must calculate the total sentence that the defendant would\r\nhave received had all the offenses been prosecuted federally (in a\r\nsingle proceeding).  If the projected sentence exceeds the sentence\r\nthat the defendant ordinarily would serve on the federal\r\nconvictions alone, the district court should compensate for this\r\ndisparity by running all (or some part) of the defendant's federal\r\nsentence consecutively to the undischarged portion of his state\r\nsentence.  If, however, the projected sentence does not exceed the\r\ntime that the defendant ordinarily would serve on the federal\r\nsentence alone, the district court should run the federal sentence\r\nconcurrently with the undischarged state sentence.\r\nThis somewhat awkward model is not obligatory in every\r\ncase to which section 5G1.3(c) pertains.  By its terms, former\r\nApplication Note 3 applies only \"to the extent practicable,\" and,\r\nthus, the paradigm that we have outlined should not be employed\r\nblindly or when doing so \"unduly complicates or prolongs the\r\nsentencing process.\"  USSG 5G1.3, comment. (n.3).  Not\r\nsurprisingly, then, experience has shown that the paradigm applies\r\nto \"a good many of the cases likely to arise under subsection (c),\"\r\nUnited States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995), but not to\r\nall such cases.\r\n                          III\r\n                       Discussion\r\nIn this case, the district court sentenced the appellant\r\nto a 96-month term of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to\r\nthe undischarged portion of his state imprisonment. On appeal,\r\nFlorence avers that the court failed to follow the method\r\nprescribed by former Application Note 3 in determining whether his\r\nfederal sentence should run consecutive to, or concurrent with, his\r\nstate sentences.  He further contends that, had the court employed\r\nthis methodology, it would have concluded that the federal sentence\r\nshould run concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state\r\nimmurement.\r\nTo reach this result, the appellant purports slavishly to\r\nfollow the paradigm outlined above.  He aspires to assemble all his\r\nstate offenses in one group and the two federal offenses of\r\nconviction in another.  But his efforts are somewhat less than\r\ncomprehensive:  when constructing his state grouping, the appellant\r\nonly considers the narcotics convictions and ignores all the other\r\nconvictions, some because (in his view) they are subsumed under the\r\numbrella of the narcotics convictions and the rest   particularly,\r\nthe vehicular offenses and the probation revocations   because they\r\nhave no federal analogues and, in any event, are irrelevant.  On\r\nthis basis, the highest offense level within the state drug-crime\r\ngroup is 12 (for possession with intent to distribute cocaine).  In\r\ncontrast, the federal offenses carry an offense level of 21.  From\r\nthis premise, the appellant concludes that, by operation of former\r\nApplication Note 3, his total sentence should not exceed 96 months\r\n(the apex of the guideline sentencing range prescribed for a\r\ndefendant who has an offense level of 21 and who, like Florence, is\r\nin criminal history category VI).  See USSG Ch.5, Pt. A (Sentencing\r\nTable).  A fortiori, the district court should have run his federal\r\nsentence concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state\r\nsentences.\r\nThe appellant's approach is flawed in several respects. \r\nIn United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522 (1st Cir. 1996), we noted\r\nthat when section 5G1.3(c) arguably applies, \"a sentencing court\r\nshould initially look to [former Application] Note 3 for guidance\r\nin calculating an appropriate incremental punishment, [but] it\r\nnonetheless has discretion to follow a different course in a small\r\nnumber of cases where adherence to Note 3 would be impracticable\r\nand result in an inappropriate incremental punishment.\"  Id. at\r\n538.  As the district court recognized, this is such a case. \r\nFormer Application Note 3 does not tell a federal court how to\r\nimplement a grouping analysis where, as here, the state charges  \r\nsuch as probation violations   have no specific analogues in the\r\nsentencing guidelines.\r\nThis lack of a ready comparison not only renders\r\nimpracticable resort to the paradigm spawned by former Application\r\nNote 3, but also ineluctably leads a rudderless sentencing court to\r\nChapter 7 of the Guidelines Manual.  That chapter instructs that\r\n\"any sentence of imprisonment for a criminal offense that is\r\nimposed after revocation of probation or supervised release\r\n[should] be run consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed\r\nupon revocation.\"  USSG 7B1.3, comment. (n.5).  We already have\r\nhad occasion to construe the meaning of this commentary in a\r\ncontext in which the defendant was serving an undischarged state\r\nterm of imprisonment for, inter alia, parole revocation.  SeeMcCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538 (stating that this commentary suggests\r\nthat \"imposing a wholly consecutive sentence was correct\"); seealso United States v. Torrez, 40 F.3d 84, 87-88 (5th Cir. 1994)\r\n(holding that USSG 7B1.3 favors the imposition of a consecutive\r\nsentence when the existing sentence results from parole\r\nrevocation).\r\nBecause we see no relevant distinction between parole\r\nrevocation and probation revocation, we hold that this aspect of\r\nthe McCarthy court's analysis controls here.  At the time of the\r\nfederal disposition hearing, the appellant was serving a two-year\r\nterm of incarceration (State Sentence No. 1) that overlapped with\r\nfive concurrent sentences stemming from probation violations. \r\nMoreover, upon completion of this sentence, Florence forlornly\r\nfaced a further one-year term (State Sentence No. 2) based entirely\r\non a probation revocation.  Hence, even had the district court\r\napplied former Application Note 3, it could have run Florence's\r\nsentence consecutively  under USSG 7B1.3.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d\r\nat 538.\r\nThe appellant has a fallback position.  He contends that,\r\nsave for the two-year sentence for distribution of heroin (State\r\nSentence No. 1) and the consecutive one-year sentence for a single\r\nprobation violation (State Sentence No. 2), all his other state\r\nsentences had expired by the time Judge Harrington imposed the\r\nfederal sentence, and thus are irrelevant for federal sentencing\r\npurposes.  He argues, in effect, that the federal sentence should\r\nat the very least run concurrently with the balance of State\r\nSentence No. 1 (roughly nine months), as the heroin offense,\r\nsimpliciter, has a ready federal analogue, and the overlapping\r\nterms imposed in consequence of the five probation violations all\r\nhad lapsed.  In his view, this left a \"gap\" into which the paradigm\r\ncontemplated by former Application Note 3 should have been\r\ninserted.\r\nThe appellant's prior state sentences are discussed in\r\nPart I, supra.  To assist the reader, we have prepared and\r\nreproduce in the Appendix a chronological chart reflecting those\r\nsentences.  After studying this chart, we conclude that the\r\nappellant's reasoning does not hold water.\r\nBy its own language, former Application Note 3 creates a\r\nparadigm that operates only \"[t]o the extent practicable.\"  We do\r\nnot think it is \"practicable\" to compute the appellant's federal\r\nsentence in the manner that he suggests.  After all, the one-year\r\nfrom-and-after sentence imposed in response to the appellant's\r\nlatest probation violation (State Sentence No. 2) has no federal\r\nanalogue and, based upon the authorities previously cited, that\r\nsentence ought not to be served concurrently with a subsequent\r\nfederal sentence.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538-39; Torrez, 40 F.3d\r\nat 87-88; see also USSG 7B1.3, comment. (n.5).  Thus, were the\r\ndistrict court bound to adhere to the appellant's construct, it\r\nwould be forced to run the federal sentence concurrent with the\r\n\"gap\"   the nine-month undischarged portion of the state sentence\r\nthat the appellant was serving on the date of the federal\r\ndisposition   and then run the federal sentence consecutive to\r\nState Sentence No. 2 from and after the expiration of State\r\nSentence No. 1.  See Appendix.  Because this odd juxtaposition\r\nwould \"unduly complicate[] . . . the sentencing process,\" USSG\r\n5G1.3(c), comment. (n.3), use of the paradigm is not obligatory\r\nhere.  Former Application Note 3 does not demand that a federal\r\nsentencing court engage in elaborate mental gymnastics that far\r\nexceed what is customary even within the convoluted federal\r\nsentencing scheme.\r\nThe appellant's riposte is that, even if the letter of\r\nformer Application Note 3 does not compel a concurrent or partially\r\nconcurrent sentence, the district court should have honored the\r\nNote's spirit by running nine months of the federal sentence\r\nconcurrent with the undischarged portion of the appellant's state\r\nincarceration.  We agree that this would have been within the\r\ndistrict court's discretion   but it is quite another thing to say\r\nthat the court was obliged to shape the federal sentence in that\r\nway.  The predominant objective of USSG 5G1.3(c) is \"to achieve a\r\nreasonable incremental punishment for the [offense of conviction].\" \r\nUnder the appellant's approach, the district court would be forced\r\nto ignore a wide array of state offenses for which the appellant\r\nreceived little reproof and, in the bargain, to extend leniency\r\nbased on a state sentence that already had absorbed the sting of\r\nnumerous other state sentences.  On these facts, we cannot second-\r\nguess the district court's seemingly wise determination that a\r\npartially concurrent federal sentence would not achieve a\r\nreasonable incremental punishment for the offense of conviction.\r\nUnited States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296 (1st Cir. 1994),\r\nmuch relied on by the appellant, does not compel a different\r\nresult.  In Whiting, we ruled that the district court erred in\r\nimposing a wholly consecutive federal sentence on a defendant,\r\nBartlett, without attempting to compute the punishment called for\r\nby former Application Note 3.  See id. at 1310-11.  There are four\r\nsignificant distinctions between Whiting and the case at bar. \r\nFirst, the offenses on which Bartlett's state sentence was based\r\nhad federal analogues, thus permitting simulation of federal\r\ngrouping practices.  See id. at 1310-11.  Second, Whiting did not\r\ninvolve either prior state sentences imposed for probation\r\nviolations or an amalgam of overlapping state sentences.  See id. \r\nThird, the appeal in Whiting arose in response to the district\r\ncourt's mistaken belief that section 5G1.3 required either wholly\r\nconcurrent or consecutive sentencing, rather than permitting\r\npartially concurrent or consecutive sentences where appropriate. \r\nSee id.  Finally, Whiting dealt with the 1991 version of USSG\r\n5G1.3, and that version was amended in 1992 in a way that weakens\r\nthe appellant's reliance on it.  See United States v. Redman, 35\r\nF.3d 437, 439-42 (9th Cir. 1994) (discussing this revision).\r\nWe need go no further.  Refined to bare essence, the\r\nguidelines call for the district court, when USSG 5G1.3 applies,\r\nto impose a sentence that will result in a \"reasonable incremental\r\npunishment.\"  Viewed in a practical, commonsense light, pairing the\r\nappellant's federal sentence with the undischarged portion of his\r\nstate sentences would not accomplish this result.  Because so many\r\nof Florence's multiple state sentences ran concurrently, sentencing\r\nhim on the federal firearms charges to yet another concurrent term\r\neffectively would have obliterated any penalty for those offenses. \r\nBy contrast, stringing the federal sentence consecutively to the\r\nundischarged portion of the state sentences effected what is\r\nplainly, in these circumstances, a reasonable incremental\r\npunishment.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 539.\r\n\nAffirmed.

During an ensuing chase, Florence threw the same Norinco pistol onto the median strip where the authorities subsequently recovered it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the mills of the Gods, see George Herbert, Jacula Prudentum (1651), the wheels of justice sometimes grind slow.  Nearly three years elapsed before a federal grand jury charged the appellant with transporting a firearm across state lines and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(a)(3) and (g)(1) (1994).  Both counts of the indictment referred to the Norinco semi-automatic pistol.  The appellant eventually pled guilty to these charges.  The district court imposed a 60-month incarcerative term for the transportation offense and a 96-month term for the felon-in-possession offense.  The court stipulated that these sentences were to be served concurrently with each other, but consecutively to all undischarged state sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the federal disposition (July 18, 1997), the appellant was serving a two-year state sentence for possession of heroin with intent to distribute (State Sentence No. 1), which he had begun on April 17, 1996.  Between April and August 1996, he received (and elected not to contest) five separate citations for probation violations in connection with (1) a charge of heroin possession, (2) a charge of marijuana possession, and (3) three separate motor vehicle offenses.  In the same time frame, he also pleaded guilty to several outstanding state charges, including two separate charges related to possession of cocaine;  a charge of possession of heroin with intent to distribute;  and a charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  The state courts revoked the appellant's probation, imposed concurrent sentences for the probation violations and the new offenses, and specified that the new sentences (none of which exceeded one year, and all of which expired on or before May 21, 1997) would run concurrently with State Sentence No. 1. During the same period, the state courts likewise revoked a one-year term of probation stemming from an underlying narcotics offense and imposed a one-year sentence (State Sentence No. 2) to be served \"from and after\" the expiration of State Sentence No. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Judge Harrington convened the federal disposition hearing, the appellant had served approximately 15 months of the total of three years' immurement levied against him for the compendium of state offenses.  The remaining time (roughly 21 months) constituted the undischarged portion of his state sentences (Nos. 1 and 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Legal Landscape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of a district court's application of the sentencing guidelines demands a bifurcated inquiry.  The court of appeals affords plenary review to the sentencing judge's assessment of a guideline's legal meaning and scope, but reviews the judge's factfinding only for clear error.  See United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, federal sentencing proceeds according to the version of the guidelines in effect at the time that sentence is pronounced.  See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990).  An exception exists, however, if changes in the guidelines between the date of the offense and the date of disposition threaten the defendant with harsher treatment.  In deference to ex post facto concerns, the sentencing court then customarily applies the version of the guidelines that obtained when the defendant committed the crime.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 5G1.3 covers the sentencing of defendants who are subject to undischarged terms of imprisonment (federal or state).  In the instant case, the government and the appellant agree that the 1993 version of section 5G1.3, in effect on the date Florence committed the federal offenses, should control.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We therefore abjure independent consideration of the point and proceed to analyze the appellant's claim under the November 1993 edition of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reproduce in the margin the text of this guideline as it read in 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In general, this guideline contemplates three somewhat different types of situations:  subsection (a) deals with federal offenses committed during the pendency or service of a state sentence;  subsection (b) deals with state sentences arising out of conduct related to the offense of conviction (i.e., conduct which must be taken into account when calculating the federal sentence);  and subsection (c) applies to all other federal sentences imposed while the defendant is serving an undischarged term of imprisonment.  At the time of the federal disposition in this matter, the appellant was serving a state term of imprisonment for conduct wholly unrelated to his federal firearms offenses (State Sentence No. 1), he had pending another undischarged state term of imprisonment for unrelated conduct (State Sentence No. 2), and he had perpetrated the federal offenses prior to the commission of the state offenses that underlay those sentences.  Consequently, section 5G1.3(c) applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its 1993 iteration, section 5G1.3(c) provides that, in cases not covered elsewhere in section 5G1.3, \"the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense.\"   Former Application Note 3 placed a gloss on this language, admonishing that \"[t]o the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in the combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under section 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time.\"   In turn, section 5G1.2 directed that, in regard to multiple counts of conviction, the sentence on each count should run consecutively to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment when all offenses are considered together.  See USSG &#167; 5G1.2(b)-(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As if this litany of rules did not, in itself, create a sufficient maze, we note that in 1993, as now, the procedure for determining the offense level on multiple counts of conviction required the sentencing court to \"group\" the counts to the extent practicable.  See USSG &#167; 3D1.2.  Under the applicable grouping rules, counts that \"involve substantially the same harm\" form a single group.  USSG &#167; 3D1.2.  The court then calculates the offense level for each count within each group, attributes to each group the highest offense level of any count within it, compares the groups to ascertain which has the highest offense level, considers certain further adjustments (not relevant to our inquiry here), and sentences the defendant based on that triage.  See United States v. Hernandez Coplin, 24 F.3d 312, 319-20 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interleaving this procedure with the analytic approach envisioned by former Application Note 3 results in the following paradigm for purposes of USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c).  The district court must first group the state convictions that undergird the undischarged state sentences as if they were federal offenses and ascertain what term of imprisonment those offenses would yield had they been directly subject to the federal sentencing guidelines.  The court then must calculate the total sentence that the defendant would have received had all the offenses been prosecuted federally (in a single proceeding).  If the projected sentence exceeds the sentence that the defendant ordinarily would serve on the federal convictions alone, the district court should compensate for this disparity by running all (or some part) of the defendant's federal sentence consecutively to the undischarged portion of his state sentence.  If, however, the projected sentence does not exceed the time that the defendant ordinarily would serve on the federal sentence alone, the district court should run the federal sentence concurrently with the undischarged state sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This somewhat awkward model is not obligatory in every case to which section 5G1.3(c) pertains.  By its terms, former Application Note 3 applies only \"to the extent practicable,\" and, thus, the paradigm that we have outlined should not be employed blindly or when doing so \"unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process.\"  USSG &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n.3).  Not surprisingly, then, experience has shown that the paradigm applies to \"a good many of the cases likely to arise under subsection (c),\" United States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995), but not to all such cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court sentenced the appellant to a 96-month term of imprisonment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to be served consecutively to the undischarged portion of his state imprisonment.  On appeal, Florence avers that the court failed to follow the method prescribed by former Application Note 3 in determining whether his federal sentence should run consecutive to, or concurrent with, his state sentences.  He further contends that, had the court employed this methodology, it would have concluded that the federal sentence should run concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state immurement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reach this result, the appellant purports slavishly to follow the paradigm outlined above.  He aspires to assemble all his state offenses in one group and the two federal offenses of conviction in another.  But his efforts are somewhat less than comprehensive:  when constructing his state grouping, the appellant only considers the narcotics convictions and ignores all the other convictions, some because (in his view) they are subsumed under the umbrella of the narcotics convictions and the rest--particularly, the vehicular offenses and the probation revocations--because they have no federal analogues and, in any event, are irrelevant.  On this basis, the highest offense level within the state drug-crime group is 12 (for possession with intent to distribute cocaine).  In contrast, the federal offenses carry an offense level of 21.  From this premise, the appellant concludes that, by operation of former Application Note 3, his total sentence should not exceed 96 months (the apex of the guideline sentencing range prescribed for a defendant who has an offense level of 21 and who, like Florence, is in criminal history category VI).  See USSG Ch.5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table).  A fortiori, the district court should have run his federal sentence concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's approach is flawed in several respects.  In United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522 (1st Cir.1996), we noted that when section 5G1.3(c) arguably applies, \"a sentencing court should initially look to [former Application] Note 3 for guidance in calculating an appropriate incremental punishment, [but] it nonetheless has discretion to follow a different course in a small number of cases where adherence to Note 3 would be impracticable and result in an inappropriate incremental punishment.\"  Id. at 538.   As the district court recognized, this is such a case.  Former Application Note 3 does not tell a federal court how to implement a grouping analysis where, as here, the state charges--such as probation violations--have no specific analogues in the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lack of a ready comparison not only renders impracticable resort to the paradigm spawned by former Application Note 3, but also ineluctably leads a rudderless sentencing court to Chapter 7 of the Guidelines Manual.  That chapter instructs that \"any sentence of imprisonment for a criminal offense that is imposed after revocation of probation or supervised release [should] be run consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.\"  USSG &#167; 7B1.3, comment.  (n.5).  We already have had occasion to construe the meaning of this commentary in a context in which the defendant was serving an undischarged state term of imprisonment for, inter alia, parole revocation.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538 (stating that this commentary suggests that \"imposing a wholly consecutive sentence was correct\");  see also United States v. Torrez, 40 F.3d 84, 87-88 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that USSG &#167; 7B1.3 favors the imposition of a consecutive sentence when the existing sentence results from parole revocation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we see no relevant distinction between parole revocation and probation revocation, we hold that this aspect of the McCarthy court's analysis controls here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  At the time of the federal disposition hearing, the appellant was serving a two-year term of incarceration (State Sentence No. 1) that overlapped with five concurrent sentences stemming from probation violations.  Moreover, upon completion of this sentence, Florence forlornly faced a further one-year term (State Sentence No. 2) based entirely on a probation revocation.  Hence, even had the district court applied former Application Note 3, it could have run Florence's sentence consecutively under USSG &#167; 7B1.3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has a fallback position.  He contends that, save for the two-year sentence for distribution of heroin (State Sentence No. 1) and the consecutive one-year sentence for a single probation violation (State Sentence No. 2), all his other state sentences had expired by the time Judge Harrington imposed the federal sentence, and thus are irrelevant for federal sentencing purposes.  He argues, in effect, that the federal sentence should at the very least run concurrently with the balance of State Sentence No. 1 (roughly nine months), as the heroin offense, simpliciter, has a ready federal analogue, and the overlapping terms imposed in consequence of the five probation violations all had lapsed.  In his view, this left a \"gap\" into which the paradigm contemplated by former Application Note 3 should have been inserted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's prior state sentences are discussed in Part I, supra.   To assist the reader, we have prepared and reproduce in the Appendix a chronological chart reflecting those sentences.  After studying this chart, we conclude that the appellant's reasoning does not hold water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own language, former Application Note 3 creates a paradigm that operates only \"[t]o the extent practicable.\"   We do not think it is \"practicable\" to compute the appellant's federal sentence in the manner that he suggests.  After all, the one-year from-and-after sentence imposed in response to the appellant's latest probation violation (State Sentence No. 2) has no federal analogue and, based upon the authorities previously cited, that sentence ought not to be served concurrently with a subsequent federal sentence.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538-39;  Torrez, 40 F.3d at 87-88;  see also USSG &#167; 7B1.3, comment.  (n.5).  Thus, were the district court bound to adhere to the appellant's construct, it would be forced to run the federal sentence concurrent with the \"gap\"--the nine-month undischarged portion of the state sentence that the appellant was serving on the date of the federal disposition--and then run the federal sentence consecutive to State Sentence No. 2 from and after the expiration of State Sentence No. 1. See Appendix.  Because this odd juxtaposition would \"unduly complicate[ ] ... the sentencing process,\" USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c), comment.  (n.3), use of the paradigm is not obligatory here.  Former Application Note 3 does not demand that a federal sentencing court engage in elaborate mental gymnastics that far exceed what is customary even within the convoluted federal sentencing scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's riposte is that, even if the letter of former Application Note 3 does not compel a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence, the district court should have honored the Note's spirit by running nine months of the federal sentence concurrent with the undischarged portion of the appellant's state incarceration.  We agree that this would have been within the district court's discretion--but it is quite another thing to say that the court was obliged to shape the federal sentence in that way.  The predominant objective of USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c) is \"to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the [offense of conviction].\"  Under the appellant's approach, the district court would be forced to ignore a wide array of state offenses for which the appellant received little reproof and, in the bargain, to extend leniency based on a state sentence that already had absorbed the sting of numerous other state sentences.  On these facts, we cannot second-guess the district court's seemingly wise determination that a partially concurrent federal sentence would not achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296 (1st Cir.1994), much relied on by the appellant, does not compel a different result.  In Whiting, we ruled that the district court erred in imposing a wholly consecutive federal sentence on a defendant, Bartlett, without attempting to compute the punishment called for by former Application Note 3. See id. at 1310-11.   There are four significant distinctions between Whiting and the case at bar.  First, the offenses on which Bartlett's state sentence was based had federal analogues, thus permitting simulation of federal grouping practices.  See id. at 1310-11.   Second, Whiting did not involve either prior state sentences imposed for probation violations or an amalgam of overlapping state sentences.  See id.   Third, the appeal in Whiting arose in response to the district court's mistaken belief that section 5G1.3 required either wholly concurrent or consecutive sentencing, rather than permitting partially concurrent or consecutive sentences where appropriate.  See id.   Finally, Whiting dealt with the 1991 version of USSG &#167; 5G1.3, and that version was amended in 1992 in a way that weakens the appellant's reliance on it.  See United States v. Redman, 35 F.3d 437, 439-42 (9th Cir.1994) (discussing this revision).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Refined to bare essence, the guidelines call for the district court, when USSG &#167; 5G1.3 applies, to impose a sentence that will result in a \"reasonable incremental punishment.\"   Viewed in a practical, commonsense light, pairing the appellant's federal sentence with the undischarged portion of his state sentences would not accomplish this result.  Because so many of Florence's multiple state sentences ran concurrently, sentencing him on the federal firearms charges to yet another concurrent term effectively would have obliterated any penalty for those offenses.  By contrast, stringing the federal sentence consecutively to the undischarged portion of the state sentences effected what is plainly, in these circumstances, a reasonable incremental punishment.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 539.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <pre>APPENDIX\nCHARGE          DATE OF      COURT      SENTENCE      APPROXIMATE\n                DISPOSITION                           EXPIRATION\n                                                      OF SENTENCE*\npossession of   April 17,    Roxbury    2 years       April 17,\nheroin with     1996         Dist.

Florence strives to convince us that the district court erred when it ordered a federal sentence to be served consecutively to the undischarged portion of certain state sentences.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, the appellant asked a cousin who lived in Kentucky to buy guns for him.  The cousin complied.  Florence then brought the firearms into Massachusetts.  At the time the appellant purchased, possessed, and transported the weapons, he was a convicted felon (manslaughter and unlawful possession of a firearm).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 1994, masked men used one of the transported firearms, a Norinco semi-automatic pistol, to rob a pizza parlor in Rosindale, Massachusetts.  A brigand armed with that pistol shot a bystander, leaving him paralyzed.  Some weeks later, a state trooper attempted to stop the appellant for a motor vehicle infraction.  During an ensuing chase, Florence threw the same Norinco pistol onto the median strip where the authorities subsequently recovered it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the mills of the Gods, see George Herbert, Jacula Prudentum (1651), the wheels of justice sometimes grind slow.  Nearly three years elapsed before a federal grand jury charged the appellant with transporting a firearm across state lines and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(a)(3) and (g)(1) (1994).  Both counts of the indictment referred to the Norinco semi-automatic pistol.  The appellant eventually pled guilty to these charges.  The district court imposed a 60-month incarcerative term for the transportation offense and a 96-month term for the felon-in-possession offense.  The court stipulated that these sentences were to be served concurrently with each other, but consecutively to all undischarged state sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the federal disposition (July 18, 1997), the appellant was serving a two-year state sentence for possession of heroin with intent to distribute (State Sentence No. 1), which he had begun on April 17, 1996.  Between April and August 1996, he received (and elected not to contest) five separate citations for probation violations in connection with (1) a charge of heroin possession, (2) a charge of marijuana possession, and (3) three separate motor vehicle offenses.  In the same time frame, he also pleaded guilty to several outstanding state charges, including two separate charges related to possession of cocaine;  a charge of possession of heroin with intent to distribute;  and a charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  The state courts revoked the appellant's probation, imposed concurrent sentences for the probation violations and the new offenses, and specified that the new sentences (none of which exceeded one year, and all of which expired on or before May 21, 1997) would run concurrently with State Sentence No. 1. During the same period, the state courts likewise revoked a one-year term of probation stemming from an underlying narcotics offense and imposed a one-year sentence (State Sentence No. 2) to be served \"from and after\" the expiration of State Sentence No. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Judge Harrington convened the federal disposition hearing, the appellant had served approximately 15 months of the total of three years' immurement levied against him for the compendium of state offenses.  The remaining time (roughly 21 months) constituted the undischarged portion of his state sentences (Nos. 1 and 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Legal Landscape</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of a district court's application of the sentencing guidelines demands a bifurcated inquiry.  The court of appeals affords plenary review to the sentencing judge's assessment of a guideline's legal meaning and scope, but reviews the judge's factfinding only for clear error.  See United States v. Brewster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194846\"><a href=\"/opinion/194846/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, federal sentencing proceeds according to the version of the guidelines in effect at the time that sentence is pronounced.  See United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990).  An exception exists, however, if changes in the guidelines between the date of the offense and the date of disposition threaten the defendant with harsher treatment.  In deference to ex post facto concerns, the sentencing court then customarily applies the version of the guidelines that obtained when the defendant committed the crime.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 5G1.3 covers the sentencing of defendants who are subject to undischarged terms of imprisonment (federal or state).  In the instant case, the government and the appellant agree that the 1993 version of section 5G1.3, in effect on the date Florence committed the federal offenses, should control.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We therefore abjure independent consideration of the point and proceed to analyze the appellant's claim under the November 1993 edition of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reproduce in the margin the text of this guideline as it read in 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In general, this guideline contemplates three somewhat different types of situations:  subsection (a) deals with federal offenses committed during the pendency or service of a state sentence;  subsection (b) deals with state sentences arising out of conduct related to the offense of conviction (i.e., conduct which must be taken into account when calculating the federal sentence);  and subsection (c) applies to all other federal sentences imposed while the defendant is serving an undischarged term of imprisonment.  At the time of the federal disposition in this matter, the appellant was serving a state term of imprisonment for conduct wholly unrelated to his federal firearms offenses (State Sentence No. 1), he had pending another undischarged state term of imprisonment for unrelated conduct (State Sentence No. 2), and he had perpetrated the federal offenses prior to the commission of the state offenses that underlay those sentences.  Consequently, section 5G1.3(c) applies here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its 1993 iteration, section 5G1.3(c) provides that, in cases not covered elsewhere in section 5G1.3, \"the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense.\"   Former Application Note 3 placed a gloss on this language, admonishing that \"[t]o the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in the combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under section 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time.\"   In turn, section 5G1.2 directed that, in regard to multiple counts of conviction, the sentence on each count should run consecutively to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment when all offenses are considered together.  See USSG &#167; 5G1.2(b)-(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As if this litany of rules did not, in itself, create a sufficient maze, we note that in 1993, as now, the procedure for determining the offense level on multiple counts of conviction required the sentencing court to \"group\" the counts to the extent practicable.  See USSG &#167; 3D1.2.  Under the applicable grouping rules, counts that \"involve substantially the same harm\" form a single group.  USSG &#167; 3D1.2.  The court then calculates the offense level for each count within each group, attributes to each group the highest offense level of any count within it, compares the groups to ascertain which has the highest offense level, considers certain further adjustments (not relevant to our inquiry here), and sentences the defendant based on that triage.  See United States v. Hernandez Coplin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670483\"><a href=\"/opinion/670483/united-states-v-ramon-hernandez-coplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 319-20 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interleaving this procedure with the analytic approach envisioned by former Application Note 3 results in the following paradigm for purposes of USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c).  The district court must first group the state convictions that undergird the undischarged state sentences as if they were federal offenses and ascertain what term of imprisonment those offenses would yield had they been directly subject to the federal sentencing guidelines.  The court then must calculate the total sentence that the defendant would have received had all the offenses been prosecuted federally (in a single proceeding).  If the projected sentence exceeds the sentence that the defendant ordinarily would serve on the federal convictions alone, the district court should compensate for this disparity by running all (or some part) of the defendant's federal sentence consecutively to the undischarged portion of his state sentence.  If, however, the projected sentence does not exceed the time that the defendant ordinarily would serve on the federal sentence alone, the district court should run the federal sentence concurrently with the undischarged state sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This somewhat awkward model is not obligatory in every case to which section 5G1.3(c) pertains.  By its terms, former Application Note 3 applies only \"to the extent practicable,\" and, thus, the paradigm that we have outlined should not be employed blindly or when doing so \"unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process.\"  USSG &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n.3).  Not surprisingly, then, experience has shown that the paradigm applies to \"a good many of the cases likely to arise under subsection (c),\" United States v. Gondek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196276\"><a href=\"/opinion/196276/united-states-v-gondek/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1995), but not to all such cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court sentenced the appellant to a 96-month term of imprisonment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to be served consecutively to the undischarged portion of his state imprisonment.  On appeal, Florence avers that the court failed to follow the method prescribed by former Application Note 3 in determining whether his federal sentence should run consecutive to, or concurrent with, his state sentences.  He further contends that, had the court employed this methodology, it would have concluded that the federal sentence should run concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state immurement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To reach this result, the appellant purports slavishly to follow the paradigm outlined above.  He aspires to assemble all his state offenses in one group and the two federal offenses of conviction in another.  But his efforts are somewhat less than comprehensive:  when constructing his state grouping, the appellant only considers the narcotics convictions and ignores all the other convictions, some because (in his view) they are subsumed under the umbrella of the narcotics convictions and the rest--particularly, the vehicular offenses and the probation revocations--because they have no federal analogues and, in any event, are irrelevant.  On this basis, the highest offense level within the state drug-crime group is 12 (for possession with intent to distribute cocaine).  In contrast, the federal offenses carry an offense level of 21.  From this premise, the appellant concludes that, by operation of former Application Note 3, his total sentence should not exceed 96 months (the apex of the guideline sentencing range prescribed for a defendant who has an offense level of 21 and who, like Florence, is in criminal history category VI).  See USSG Ch.5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table).  A fortiori, the district court should have run his federal sentence concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's approach is flawed in several respects.  In United States v. McCarthy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196595\"><a href=\"/opinion/196595/united-states-v-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996), we noted that when section 5G1.3(c) arguably applies, \"a sentencing court should initially look to [former Application] Note 3 for guidance in calculating an appropriate incremental punishment, [but] it nonetheless has discretion to follow a different course in a small number of cases where adherence to Note 3 would be impracticable and result in an inappropriate incremental punishment.\"  Id. at 538.   As the district court recognized, this is such a case.  Former Application Note 3 does not tell a federal court how to implement a grouping analysis where, as here, the state charges--such as probation violations--have no specific analogues in the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lack of a ready comparison not only renders impracticable resort to the paradigm spawned by former Application Note 3, but also ineluctably leads a rudderless sentencing court to Chapter 7 of the Guidelines Manual.  That chapter instructs that \"any sentence of imprisonment for a criminal offense that is imposed after revocation of probation or supervised release [should] be run consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.\"  USSG &#167; 7B1.3, comment.  (n.5).  We already have had occasion to construe the meaning of this commentary in a context in which the defendant was serving an undischarged state term of imprisonment for, inter alia, parole revocation.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538 (stating that this commentary suggests that \"imposing a wholly consecutive sentence was correct\");  see also United States v. Torrez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6812\"><a href=\"/opinion/6812/united-states-v-torrez/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 87-88 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that USSG &#167; 7B1.3 favors the imposition of a consecutive sentence when the existing sentence results from parole revocation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we see no relevant distinction between parole revocation and probation revocation, we hold that this aspect of the McCarthy court's analysis controls here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  At the time of the federal disposition hearing, the appellant was serving a two-year term of incarceration (State Sentence No. 1) that overlapped with five concurrent sentences stemming from probation violations.  Moreover, upon completion of this sentence, Florence forlornly faced a further one-year term (State Sentence No. 2) based entirely on a probation revocation.  Hence, even had the district court applied former Application Note 3, it could have run Florence's sentence consecutively under USSG &#167; 7B1.3.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has a fallback position.  He contends that, save for the two-year sentence for distribution of heroin (State Sentence No. 1) and the consecutive one-year sentence for a single probation violation (State Sentence No. 2), all his other state sentences had expired by the time Judge Harrington imposed the federal sentence, and thus are irrelevant for federal sentencing purposes.  He argues, in effect, that the federal sentence should at the very least run concurrently with the balance of State Sentence No. 1 (roughly nine months), as the heroin offense, simpliciter, has a ready federal analogue, and the overlapping terms imposed in consequence of the five probation violations all had lapsed.  In his view, this left a \"gap\" into which the paradigm contemplated by former Application Note 3 should have been inserted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's prior state sentences are discussed in Part I, supra.   To assist the reader, we have prepared and reproduce in the Appendix a chronological chart reflecting those sentences.  After studying this chart, we conclude that the appellant's reasoning does not hold water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its own language, former Application Note 3 creates a paradigm that operates only \"[t]o the extent practicable.\"   We do not think it is \"practicable\" to compute the appellant's federal sentence in the manner that he suggests.  After all, the one-year from-and-after sentence imposed in response to the appellant's latest probation violation (State Sentence No. 2) has no federal analogue and, based upon the authorities previously cited, that sentence ought not to be served concurrently with a subsequent federal sentence.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538-39;  Torrez, 40 F.3d at 87-88;  see also USSG &#167; 7B1.3, comment.  (n.5).  Thus, were the district court bound to adhere to the appellant's construct, it would be forced to run the federal sentence concurrent with the \"gap\"--the nine-month undischarged portion of the state sentence that the appellant was serving on the date of the federal disposition--and then run the federal sentence consecutive to State Sentence No. 2 from and after the expiration of State Sentence No. 1. See Appendix.  Because this odd juxtaposition would \"unduly complicate[ ] ... the sentencing process,\" USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c), comment.  (n.3), use of the paradigm is not obligatory here.  Former Application Note 3 does not demand that a federal sentencing court engage in elaborate mental gymnastics that far exceed what is customary even within the convoluted federal sentencing scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's riposte is that, even if the letter of former Application Note 3 does not compel a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence, the district court should have honored the Note's spirit by running nine months of the federal sentence concurrent with the undischarged portion of the appellant's state incarceration.  We agree that this would have been within the district court's discretion--but it is quite another thing to say that the court was obliged to shape the federal sentence in that way.  The predominant objective of USSG &#167; 5G1.3(c) is \"to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the [offense of conviction].\"  Under the appellant's approach, the district court would be forced to ignore a wide array of state offenses for which the appellant received little reproof and, in the bargain, to extend leniency based on a state sentence that already had absorbed the sting of numerous other state sentences.  On these facts, we cannot second-guess the district court's seemingly wise determination that a partially concurrent federal sentence would not achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Whiting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673817\"><a href=\"/opinion/673817/united-states-v-darryl-whiting-aka-g-god-rah-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), much relied on by the appellant, does not compel a different result.  In Whiting, we ruled that the district court erred in imposing a wholly consecutive federal sentence on a defendant, Bartlett, without attempting to compute the punishment called for by former Application Note 3. See id. at 1310-11.   There are four significant distinctions between Whiting and the case at bar.  First, the offenses on which Bartlett's state sentence was based had federal analogues, thus permitting simulation of federal grouping practices.  See id. at 1310-11.   Second, Whiting did not involve either prior state sentences imposed for probation violations or an amalgam of overlapping state sentences.  See id.   Third, the appeal in Whiting arose in response to the district court's mistaken belief that section 5G1.3 required either wholly concurrent or consecutive sentencing, rather than permitting partially concurrent or consecutive sentences where appropriate.  See id.   Finally, Whiting dealt with the 1991 version of USSG &#167; 5G1.3, and that version was amended in 1992 in a way that weakens the appellant's reliance on it.  See United States v. Redman, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></span>, 439-42 (9th Cir.1994) (discussing this revision).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  Refined to bare essence, the guidelines call for the district court, when USSG &#167; 5G1.3 applies, to impose a sentence that will result in a \"reasonable incremental punishment.\"   Viewed in a practical, commonsense light, pairing the appellant's federal sentence with the undischarged portion of his state sentences would not accomplish this result.  Because so many of Florence's multiple state sentences ran concurrently, sentencing him on the federal firearms charges to yet another concurrent term effectively would have obliterated any penalty for those offenses.  By contrast, stringing the federal sentence consecutively to the undischarged portion of the state sentences effected what is plainly, in these circumstances, a reasonable incremental punishment.

(n.3) (hereinafter \"former Application Note 3\") in writing the November 1995 edition of the guidelines.  The appellant contends, and the government accepts, that deleting former Application Note 3 arguably made it more difficult to secure a concurrent sentence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The guideline provides:</p>\n        <p>&#167; 5G1.3 Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment</p>\n        <p>(a) If the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status) or after sentencing for, but before commencing service of, such term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>\n        <p>(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>\n        <p>(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense.</p>\n        <p>USSG &#167; 5G1.3 (Nov.1993).  All citations to the guidelines are to that edition, unless otherwise expressly indicated.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For this purpose, we ignore the concurrent 60-month federal sentence, as its existence does not affect our analysis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To be sure, McCarthy has another, more problematic aspect.  The opinion indicates that when the conduct giving rise to the state sentences is unrelated to the conduct giving rise to the federal sentence, \"the rationale of the guidelines' grouping rules does not apply\" and the argument for strict adherence to the sentence-calculation method prescribed by former Application Note 3 is at its nadir.  McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 538.   We are skeptical about this conclusion, but we need not probe the point too deeply.  McCarthy 's alternative rationale, combined with other circumstances that render it infeasible here to follow the paradigm contemplated by former Application Note 3, fully disposes of the case at hand</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We find further footing for this result in USSG &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n.4), which approves consecutive sentencing for the commission of a federal offense while on state or federal probation, parole, or supervised release, \"in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation.\"  USSG &#167; 5G1.3 comment.  (n.4);  see Gondek, 65 F.3d at 2-3.   Although this application note does not literally apply to Florence's situation, it illustrates the Commission's overall view that defendants normally should not enjoy the luxury of concurrent sentences when they have violated the terms of parole or probation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
