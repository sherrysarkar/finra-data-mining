The court also determined that Vargas failed to state\r\n\na  proper  claim  of excessive  force.    Vargas  appeals on  the\r\n\nunlawful arrest claim,  arguing that there was  no probable cause\r\n\nto support his warrantless arrest.2  We affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In the summary judgment context, we review all material\r\n\nfacts in genuine dispute  in the light most favorable to the non-\r\n\nmovant, here Vargas.   Serrano-Cruz v. DFI Puerto Rico,  109 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n23, 24 (1st Cir. 1997).  Vargas was one of three men who  were in\r\n\na  Puerto Rico  Aqueducts  and Sewers  Administration truck  that\r\n\ncollided   with   a  car   driven  by   Minerva  Delgado-Gonz lez\r\n\n(\"Delgado\").  After the collision, which took place at night on a\r\n\nhilly road, Vargas, Delgado, and Vargas' two colleagues agreed to\r\n\nmeet at a nearby police station to report the accident.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Vargas initially named as defendants an unnamed supervisor and\r\nIsmael Betancourt,  the superintendent of the  Puerto Rico Police\r\nDepartment.  The actions against these two other defendants  were\r\ndismissed through partial judgments, at which point the remaining\r\ndefendant officers filed their summary judgment motion.\r\n\n2   On  appeal, Vargas  does not  challenge the  district court's\r\ndetermination  regarding  his  failure  to  state  a   cognizable\r\nexcessive force claim. \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          At the  police station, the defendant  police officers,\r\n\nAndr s  D az-Torres and  Andr s Maldonado-Castro,  questioned the\r\n\nfour  persons.   Delgado told  the officers  that Vargas  was the\r\n\ndriver of  the truck -- a  fact that Vargas disputes  -- and that\r\n\nshe thought  that he and the  other men smelled of  alcohol.  She\r\n\nalso stated that the men had shiny eyes and staggered a bit.\r\n\n          When  the   officers  sought  out  Vargas  for  further\r\n\nquestioning,  he   was  outside  the  police   station,  drinking\r\n\nsomething from a plastic cup.  After the officers asked  to speak\r\n\nwith him, he threw down his  cup, entered the station, and  began\r\n\nsmoking a cigarette.   When the officers  ordered him to put  out\r\n\nthe cigarette, Vargas  stubbed it out with his  shoe on the floor\r\n\nof the police station.   Officer D az then told Vargas to dispose\r\n\nof  the cigarette in  a trash can.   Vargas denies  being rude or\r\n\naggressive toward  the officers, although he does not deny having\r\n\ntaken these particular actions.  \r\n\n          Immediately  thereafter,  the  police  officers  placed\r\n\nVargas under arrest  for driving under the  influence of alcohol,\r\n\nunder Section 5-801 of  the Puerto Rico Vehicle and  Traffic Law.\r\n\nP.R.  Laws  Ann. tit.  9,    1041 et  seq.   They  handcuffed and\r                                                    \r\n\nsearched him before transporting him to a police station that had\r\n\na working breathalyzer.   After the breathalyzer test indicated a\r\n\nblood alcohol level of zero percent, Vargas was released.  Vargas\r\n\nwas  subsequently charged on a count of reckless driving based on\r\n\nthe  same incident   -- a criminal charge  which was dropped once\r\n\nVargas' insureragreed to payfor the damagescaused by theaccident.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          The  district court  granted  summary  judgment on  the\r\n\nbasis  of qualified  immunity.    In  so  holding,  it  made  two\r\n\nfindings:   that  the defendants  were presented  with sufficient\r\n\nevidence to establish probable cause for Vargas' arrest, and that\r\n\nalthough the particular warrantless arrest violated a Puerto Rico\r\n\nstatute, it did not violate any clearly established federal law.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          We   review  the  district   court's  summary  judgment\r\n\ndetermination de  novo.

The Qualified Immunity Standard \r                    A.  The Qualified Immunity Standard\r\n\n          The  doctrine  of   qualified  immunity  provides  that\r\n\n\"government  officials performing  discretionary functions .  . .\r\n\nare  shielded from liability  for civil damages  insofar as their\r\n\nconduct  does  not  violate   clearly  established  statutory  or\r\n\nconstitutional  rights of  which a  reasonable person  would have\r\n\nknown.\"    Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800,  818  (1982).\r                                           \r\n\nDefendant police officers are shielded if either of the following\r                                                          \r\n\nholds: if  the federal  law  allegedly violated  was not  clearly\r\n\nestablished  at  the time  of the  alleged  violation, or  if, at\r\n\nsummary judgment,  there is no  genuine dispute of  material fact\r\n\nthat  would prevent a finding  that the defendants' actions, with\r\n\nregard  to applying  or following  such clearly  established law,\r\n\nwere objectively reasonable.   See Stella v. Kelley, 63  F.3d 71,\r                                                             \r\n\n73  (1st Cir. 1995).  In effect, qualified immunity protects \"all\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nbut the plainly  incompetent or those  who knowingly violate  the\r\n\nlaw.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).\r                                 \r\n\n          This appeal presents two distinct legal issues.  First,\r\n\nwe  must determine whether the  warrantless arrest of a suspected\r\n\nmisdemeanant,  where  the  misdemeanor   did  not  occur  in  the\r\n\nofficers'  presence,  would  have  violated  clearly  established\r\n\nfederal  law  as of  December 1990.    Second, we  must determine\r\n\nwhether the officers acted in conformity with clearly established\r\n\nlaw under an objective reasonableness standard.\r\n\n          B.  The Clearly Established Law\r                    B.  The Clearly Established Law\r\n\n          It  is not disputed that at the time of Vargas' arrest,\r\n\nclearly  established  Fourth  Amendment  law  required  that  the\r\n\ndefendants have  probable cause  to  support Vargas'  warrantless\r\n\narrest.  See Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964).  Whether there\r                                   \r\n\nwere adequate  grounds for making a  probable cause determination\r\n\nis addressed in the  next section.  However, Vargas  also appears\r\n\nto  contend  that  the   officers  violated  a  rule  prohibiting\r\n\nwarrantless arrests  for misdemeanors  that do  not occur  in the\r\n\npresence  of  the arresting  officers.   We  must  thus determine\r\n\nwhether such a rule was a clearly established part of federal law\r\n\nin December 1990, when Vargas' arrest occurred.\r\n\n          Vargas correctly points out that in Puerto Rico, such a\r\n\nrule exists.    Rule 11  of  the Puerto  Rico  Rules of  Criminal\r\n\nProcedure provides  that a  warrantless arrest for  a misdemeanor\r\n\noffense is only permitted where the arresting officer has grounds\r\n\nto  believe that the  misdemeanor was committed  in his presence,\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nwhereas  no such  presence  requirement  governs the  warrantless\r\n\narrest of felons.   See P.R.  Laws Ann. tit.  34, App. II,  R. 11\r                                 \r\n\n(1991).   Driving under the influence of alcohol is a misdemeanor\r\n\nin Puerto  Rico.   See  P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  9,    1042  (1976).\r                                \r\n\nRegardless of  whether the  arresting officers violated  Rule 11,\r\n\nVargas  can  offer no  support for  the  proposition that,  as of\r\n\nDecember  1990,  this  provision had  a  clear  basis in  federal\r                                                                           \r\n\nconstitutional or statutory  law.  \"Mere violations of  state law\r\n\ndo not, of course, create constitutional claims.\"  Roy v. City of\r                                                                           \r\n\nAugusta, 712 F.2d 1517, 1522 (1st Cir. 1983).  \r                 \r\n\n          To  date, neither  the Supreme  Court nor  this circuit\r\n\never  has held  that the  Fourth Amendment  prohibits warrantless\r\n\narrests  for  misdemeanors  not  committed  in  the  presence  of\r\n\narresting  officers.     Into   this  silent  past,   a  \"clearly\r\n\nestablished right\"  cannot be retrojected.   Moreover, cases from\r\n\nsister circuits addressing  this very issue  have arrived at  the\r\n\nopposite conclusion.  See,  e.g., Pyles v. Raisor, 60  F.3d 1211,\r                                                           \r\n\n1215 (6th Cir. 1995) (arrestee  cannot recover under section 1983\r\n\non  ground  that  officers  violated  state  law  prohibition  of\r\n\nwarrantless arrests for  misdemeanors not committed  in officers'\r\n\npresence);  Barry  v. Fowler, 902 F.2d  770, 772 (9th  Cir. 1990)\r                                      \r\n\n(same);  Street v. Surdyka, 492 F.2d  368, 371-72 (4th Cir. 1974)\r                                    \r\n\n(same);   see  also  Vargas-Badillo v.  D az-Torres, Opinion  and\r                                                             \r\n\nOrder  of  May 24,  1996, at  12-17  (D.P.R. 1996)  (providing an\r\n\nilluminating discussion of the questionable constitutional status\r\n\nof  this longstanding  rule).   Thus, we  conclude that  the only\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nclearly   established   federal  right   implicated   in  Vargas'\r\n\nwarrantless  arrest in  December  1990 was  his Fourth  Amendment\r\n\nright not to be arrested without probable cause.\r\n\n          C.  Objective Reasonableness and Probable Cause\r                    C.  Objective Reasonableness and Probable Cause\r\n\n          We next assess whether the second part of the qualified\r\n\nimmunity  standard,  requiring  that  the officers  acted  in  an\r\n\nobjectively reasonable  fashion in  light of clearly  established\r\n\nlaw,  was  met.   Here, that  assessment  turns on  the officers'\r\n\ndetermination of probable cause.\r\n\n            In   cases   applying   this   [qualified\r\n            immunity] standard to  police arrests  in\r\n            this  circuit,  an  arrest challenged  as\r\n            unsupported by probable  cause is  deemed\r\n            \"'objectively reasonable'\"  unless \"there\r\n            clearly was no probable cause at the time\r\n            the arrest was made.\"\r\n\nTopp v. Wolkowski, 994 F.2d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Floyd\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1985)).  In the instant case,\r                    \r\n\nthe  evidence  giving rise  to probable  cause to  believe Vargas\r\n\ndrove  under the influence of alcohol was far from substantial --\r\n\nand yet  we cannot say that  there clearly was  no probable cause\r\n\nfrom  the point of view  of reasonable persons  standing in these\r\n\npolice officers'  shoes.  See Farrell, 765  F.2d at 5 (\"Despite a\r                                               \r\n\nfinding of no probable cause at a later hearing, a police officer\r\n\nshould not be found liable under    1983 for a warrantless arrest\r\n\nbecause the presence of probable cause was merely questionable at\r\n\nthe  time of arrest.\"); Briggs v. Malley,  748 F.2d 715, 719 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1984).\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          The Fourth  Amendment requirement of probable  cause to\r\n\nperform a warrantless arrest turns on \"whether at that moment the\r\n\nfacts and  circumstances within [the officers']  knowledge and of\r\n\nwhich they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient\r\n\nto warrant a  prudent man  in believing that  the petitioner  had\r\n\ncommitted  or was committing an offense.\"   Beck, 379 U.S. at 91;\r                                                          \r\n\nsee also United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1987)  (quoting  Beck).   Here,  the  following undisputed  facts\r                               \r\n\ncould,  at the very least, have led reasonable police officers to\r\n\nbelieve that they were obeying the probable cause requirement  in\r\n\nproceeding to  arrest Vargas for  driving under the  influence of\r\n\nalcohol.    The  officers   were  informed  by  Delgado,  whether\r\n\ncorrectly  or  incorrectly, that  Vargas  was the  driver  of the\r\n\ntruck.   Delgado also informed the defendants that Vargas and the\r\n\nother men smelled  of alcohol  and had glassy  eyes.   Reasonable\r\n\npolice  officers  could  further  believe  that  Vargas'  actions\r\n\nsuggested insolence,  and  were thus  the  kind of  actions  that\r\n\ncorrelate with drunkenness.    \r\n\n          It is worth emphasizing  that in the qualified immunity\r\n\ncontext, we  need not  adjudge whether  these facts  were legally\r\n\nsufficient  grounds  for  this  warrantless  arrest.3    We  only\r\n\nconclude that  the  undisputed  facts in  this  case  preclude  a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3    The evidence  suggesting that  an  arrest was  necessary was\r\nfrankly not  very strong  in this  case.   We are concerned,  for\r\nexample, that in light of Vargas' cooperation with the police and\r\nvoluntary decision to report to the police station, the police so\r\nquickly  chose the option of arrest  and handcuffing, rather than\r\nsome  less severe means to  the end of  giving him a breathalyzer\r\ntest.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nfinding that there  was clearly  no probable cause,  or that  \"no\r\n\nreasonably competent  officer would  have found  probable cause.\"\r\n\nProkey v.

The\r                            \r\n\nreports and observations suggesting  that Vargas had been driving\r\n\nwhile  intoxicated were sufficient  to satisfy  the rule  in this\r\n\ncircuit  that questionable  calls on  matters of  probable cause,\r\n\nsuch as  the one in this case, are protected through the doctrine\r\n\nof qualified immunity.

Serrano-Cruz v. DFI Puerto Rico, 109 F.3d 23, 24 (1st Cir.1997).  Vargas was one of three men who were in a Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Administration truck that collided with a car driven by Minerva Delgado-Gonzalez (\"Delgado\").  After the collision, which took place at night on a hilly road, Vargas, Delgado, and Vargas' two colleagues agreed to meet at a nearby police station to report the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the police station, the defendant police officers, Andres Daz-Torres and Andres Maldonado-Castro, questioned the four persons.  Delgado told the officers that Vargas was the driver of the truck--a fact that Vargas disputes--and that she thought that he and the other men smelled of alcohol.  She also stated that the men had shiny eyes and staggered a bit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the officers sought out Vargas for further questioning, he was outside the police station, drinking something from a plastic cup.  After the officers asked to speak with him, he threw down his cup, entered the station, and began smoking a cigarette.  When the officers ordered him to put out the cigarette, Vargas stubbed it out with his shoe on the floor of the police station.  Officer Daz then told Vargas to dispose of the cigarette in a trash can.  Vargas denies being rude or aggressive toward the officers, although he does not deny having taken these particular actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately thereafter, the police officers placed Vargas under arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol, under Section 5-801 of the Puerto Rico Vehicle and Traffic Law.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 9, &#167; 1041 et seq.   They handcuffed and searched him before transporting him to a police station that had a working breathalyzer.  After the breathalyzer test indicated a blood alcohol level of zero percent, Vargas was released.  Vargas was subsequently charged on a count of reckless driving based on the same incident--a criminal charge which was dropped once Vargas' insurer agreed to pay for the damages caused by the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.  In so holding, it made two findings:  that the defendants were presented with sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for Vargas' arrest, and that although the particular warrantless arrest violated a Puerto Rico statute, it did not violate any clearly established federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's summary judgment determination de novo.  Ionics, Inc. v. Elmwood Sensors, Inc., 110 F.3d 184, 185 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Qualified Immunity Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of qualified immunity provides that \"government officials performing discretionary functions ... are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  Defendant police officers are shielded if either of the following holds:  if the federal law allegedly violated was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violation, or if, at summary judgment, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that would prevent a finding that the defendants' actions, with regard to applying or following such clearly established law, were objectively reasonable.  See Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 73 (1st Cir.1995).  In effect, qualified immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1093, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal presents two distinct legal issues.  First, we must determine whether the warrantless arrest of a suspected misdemeanant, where the misdemeanor did not occur in the officers' presence, would have violated clearly established federal law as of December 1990.  Second, we must determine whether the officers acted in conformity with clearly established law under an objective reasonableness standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Clearly Established Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not disputed that at the time of Vargas' arrest, clearly established Fourth Amendment law required that the defendants have probable cause to support Vargas' warrantless arrest.  See Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).  Whether there were adequate grounds for making a probable cause determination is addressed in the next section.  However, Vargas also appears to contend that the officers violated a rule prohibiting warrantless arrests for misdemeanors that do not occur in the presence of the arresting officers.  We must thus determine whether such a rule was a clearly established part of federal law in December 1990, when Vargas' arrest occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vargas correctly points out that in Puerto Rico, such a rule exists.  Rule 11 of the Puerto Rico Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor offense is only permitted where the arresting officer has grounds to believe that the misdemeanor was committed in his presence, whereas no such presence requirement governs the warrantless arrest of felons.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, App.  II, R. 11 (1991).  Driving under the influence of alcohol is a misdemeanor in Puerto Rico.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 9, &#167; 1042 (1976).  Regardless of whether the arresting officers violated Rule 11, Vargas can offer no support for the proposition that, as of December 1990, this provision had a clear basis in federal constitutional or statutory law.  \"Mere violations of state law do not, of course, create constitutional claims.\"  Roy v. City of Augusta, 712 F.2d 1517, 1522 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To date, neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit ever has held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not committed in the presence of arresting officers.  Into this silent past, a \"clearly established right\" cannot be retrojected.  Moreover, cases from sister circuits addressing this very issue have arrived at the opposite conclusion.  See, e.g., Pyles v. Raisor, 60 F.3d 1211, 1215 (6th Cir.1995) (arrestee cannot recover under section 1983 on ground that officers violated state law prohibition of warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not committed in officers' presence);  Barry v. Fowler, 902 F.2d 770, 772 (9th Cir.1990) (same);  Street v. Surdyka, 492 F.2d 368, 371-72 (4th Cir.1974) (same);  see also Vargas-Badillo v. Daz-Torres, Opinion and Order of May 24, 1996, at 12-17 (D.P.R.1996) (providing an illuminating discussion of the questionable constitutional status of this longstanding rule).  Thus, we conclude that the only clearly established federal right implicated in Vargas' warrantless arrest in December 1990 was his Fourth Amendment right not to be arrested without probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Objective Reasonableness and Probable Cause</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next assess whether the second part of the qualified immunity standard, requiring that the officers acted in an objectively reasonable fashion in light of clearly established law, was met.  Here, that assessment turns on the officers' determination of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>In cases applying this [qualified immunity] standard to police arrests in this circuit, an arrest challenged as unsupported by probable cause is deemed \" 'objectively reasonable' \" unless \"there clearly was no probable cause at the time the arrest was made.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Topp v. Wolkowski, 994 F.2d 45, 48 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Floyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1985)).  In the instant case, the evidence giving rise to probable cause to believe Vargas drove under the influence of alcohol was far from substantial--and yet we cannot say that there clearly was no probable cause from the point of view of reasonable persons standing in these police officers' shoes.  See Farrell, 765 F.2d at 5 (\"Despite a finding of no probable cause at a later hearing, a police officer should not be found liable under &#167; 1983 for a warrantless arrest because the presence of probable cause was merely questionable at the time of arrest.\");  Briggs v. Malley, 748 F.2d 715, 719 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause to perform a warrantless arrest turns on \"whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.\"  Beck, 379 U.S. at 91, 85 S.Ct. at 225;  see also United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting Beck ).   Here, the following undisputed facts could, at the very least, have led reasonable police officers to believe that they were obeying the probable cause requirement in proceeding to arrest Vargas for driving under the influence of alcohol.  The officers were informed by Delgado, whether correctly or incorrectly, that Vargas was the driver of the truck.  Delgado also informed the defendants that Vargas and the other men smelled of alcohol and had glassy eyes.  Reasonable police officers could further believe that Vargas' actions suggested insolence, and were thus the kind of actions that correlate with drunkenness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is worth emphasizing that in the qualified immunity context, we need not adjudge whether these facts were legally sufficient grounds for this warrantless arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We only conclude that the undisputed facts in this case preclude a finding that there was clearly no probable cause, or that \"no reasonably competent officer would have found probable cause.\"  Prokey v. Watkins, 942 F.2d 67, 72 n. 4 (1st Cir.1991).  The reports and observations suggesting that Vargas had been driving while intoxicated were sufficient to satisfy the rule in this circuit that questionable calls on matters of probable cause, such as the one in this case, are protected through the doctrine of qualified immunity.  Cf. Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 263-64 (1st Cir.1992) (denying qualified immunity where arresting officer provided \"no facts to support his legal conclusion that he had probable cause\").  This kind of discretionary judgment call, made routinely by peace officers, must be protected from the chilling effect of personal liability.  Our binding precedents addressing qualified immunity strike the difficult balance between chilling effective law enforcement and protecting individual liberties by reviewing allegedly unlawful warrantless arrests to determine whether there was clearly no probable cause, and we follow these precedents today.  See, e.g., Topp, 994 F.2d at 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Vargas initially named as defendants an unnamed supervisor and Ismael Betancourt, the superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department.

First, we must determine whether the warrantless arrest of a suspected misdemeanant, where the misdemeanor did not occur in the officers' presence, would have violated clearly established federal law as of December 1990.  Second, we must determine whether the officers acted in conformity with clearly established law under an objective reasonableness standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Clearly Established Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not disputed that at the time of Vargas' arrest, clearly established Fourth Amendment law required that the defendants have probable cause to support Vargas' warrantless arrest.  See Beck v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 225, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span> (1964).  Whether there were adequate grounds for making a probable cause determination is addressed in the next section.  However, Vargas also appears to contend that the officers violated a rule prohibiting warrantless arrests for misdemeanors that do not occur in the presence of the arresting officers.  We must thus determine whether such a rule was a clearly established part of federal law in December 1990, when Vargas' arrest occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vargas correctly points out that in Puerto Rico, such a rule exists.  Rule 11 of the Puerto Rico Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor offense is only permitted where the arresting officer has grounds to believe that the misdemeanor was committed in his presence, whereas no such presence requirement governs the warrantless arrest of felons.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 34, App.  II, R. 11 (1991).  Driving under the influence of alcohol is a misdemeanor in Puerto Rico.  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 9, &#167; 1042 (1976).  Regardless of whether the arresting officers violated Rule 11, Vargas can offer no support for the proposition that, as of December 1990, this provision had a clear basis in federal constitutional or statutory law.  \"Mere violations of state law do not, of course, create constitutional claims.\"  Roy v. City of Augusta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422030\"><a href=\"/opinion/422030/donald-roy-of-waterville-kennebec-county-state-of-maine-v-the-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1517</span></a></span>, 1522 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To date, neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit ever has held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not committed in the presence of arresting officers.  Into this silent past, a \"clearly established right\" cannot be retrojected.  Moreover, cases from sister circuits addressing this very issue have arrived at the opposite conclusion.  See, e.g., Pyles v. Raisor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700474\"><a href=\"/opinion/700474/teresa-a-pyles-v-robert-s-raisor-ray-l-sabbatine/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span>, 1215 (6th Cir.1995) (arrestee cannot recover under section 1983 on ground that officers violated state law prohibition of warrantless arrests for misdemeanors not committed in officers' presence);  Barry v. Fowler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540901\"><a href=\"/opinion/540901/patricia-j-barry-charlene-karr-v-gary-fowler/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 772 (9th Cir.1990) (same);  Street v. Surdyka, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"317151\"><a href=\"/opinion/317151/george-b-street-v-officer-leo-surdyka-baltimore-city-police-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, 371-72 (4th Cir.1974) (same);  see also Vargas-Badillo v. Daz-Torres, Opinion and Order of May 24, 1996, at 12-17 (D.P.R.1996) (providing an illuminating discussion of the questionable constitutional status of this longstanding rule).  Thus, we conclude that the only clearly established federal right implicated in Vargas' warrantless arrest in December 1990 was his Fourth Amendment right not to be arrested without probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

In the instant case, the evidence giving rise to probable cause to believe Vargas drove under the influence of alcohol was far from substantial--and yet we cannot say that there clearly was no probable cause from the point of view of reasonable persons standing in these police officers' shoes.  See Farrell, 765 F.2d at 5 (\"Despite a finding of no probable cause at a later hearing, a police officer should not be found liable under &#167; 1983 for a warrantless arrest because the presence of probable cause was merely questionable at the time of arrest.\");  Briggs v.

Figueroa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488520\"><a href=\"/opinion/488520/united-states-v-raul-casiano-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1023 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting Beck ).   Here, the following undisputed facts could, at the very least, have led reasonable police officers to believe that they were obeying the probable cause requirement in proceeding to arrest Vargas for driving under the influence of alcohol.  The officers were informed by Delgado, whether correctly or incorrectly, that Vargas was the driver of the truck.  Delgado also informed the defendants that Vargas and the other men smelled of alcohol and had glassy eyes.  Reasonable police officers could further believe that Vargas' actions suggested insolence, and were thus the kind of actions that correlate with drunkenness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is worth emphasizing that in the qualified immunity context, we need not adjudge whether these facts were legally sufficient grounds for this warrantless arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We only conclude that the undisputed facts in this case preclude a finding that there was clearly no probable cause, or that \"no reasonably competent officer would have found probable cause.\"  Prokey v. Watkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566801\"><a href=\"/opinion/566801/gloria-prokey-v-george-watkins-scott-cataldi-roderick-beaulieu-gloria/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 72 n. 4 (1st Cir.1991).  The reports and observations suggesting that Vargas had been driving while intoxicated were sufficient to satisfy the rule in this circuit that questionable calls on matters of probable cause, such as the one in this case, are protected through the doctrine of qualified immunity.  Cf. Rivera v. Murphy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594699\"><a href=\"/opinion/594699/emma-rivera-v-paul-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 263-64 (1st Cir.1992) (denying qualified immunity where arresting officer provided \"no facts to support his legal conclusion that he had probable cause\").  This kind of discretionary judgment call, made routinely by peace officers, must be protected from the chilling effect of personal liability.  Our binding precedents addressing qualified immunity strike the difficult balance between chilling effective law enforcement and protecting individual liberties by reviewing allegedly unlawful warrantless arrests to determine whether there was clearly no probable cause, and we follow these precedents today.  See, e.g., Topp, 994 F.2d at 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Vargas initially named as defendants an unnamed supervisor and Ismael Betancourt, the superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department.  The actions against these two other defendants were dismissed through partial judgments, at which point the remaining defendant officers filed their summary judgment motion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> On appeal, Vargas does not challenge the district court's determination regarding his failure to state a cognizable excessive force claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The evidence suggesting that an arrest was necessary was frankly not very strong in this case.  We are concerned, for example, that in light of Vargas' cooperation with the police and voluntary decision to report to the police station, the police so quickly chose the option of arrest and handcuffing, rather than some less severe means to the end of giving him a breathalyzer test</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
