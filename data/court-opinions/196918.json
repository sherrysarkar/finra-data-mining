Valentin Severino Nunez pled guilty to\r                                \r\n\naiding  and  abetting  others in  possessing  with  intent to\r\n\ndistribute approximately  540  kilograms of  cocaine and  was\r\n\nsentenced to  a 90-month  prison term.  He appealed  from his\r\n\nsentence.   Appellate  counsel  has now  filed a  brief under\r\n\nAnders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), asserting the lack\r                                \r\n\nof  any  meritorious  ground  for  appeal,  and a  motion  to\r\n\nwithdraw which he has  served on Severino.  Although  counsel\r\n\nnotified Severino of his right to  file a supplemental brief,\r\n\nSeverino has not filed any brief and the deadline has passed.\r\n\nBecause we  agree that  this appeal has  no merit,  we affirm\r\n\nSeverino's  conviction and sentence  and grant the  motion to\r\n\nwithdraw.  \r\n\n          The plea  hearing transcript  shows that  the court\r\n\nconducted a colloquy which substantially conformed to Fed. R.\r\n\nCrim.  P. 11  requirements  and  that  Severino  pled  guilty\r\n\nvoluntarily and knowingly.  Hence, his guilty plea was valid.\r\n\nCf. United  States v. Cotal-Crespo,  47 F.3d 1, 4  (1st Cir.)\r                                              \r\n\n(guilty  pleas which violate  the \"core concerns\"  of Rule 11\r\n\nmust be set  aside), cert. denied, 116 S.

The applicable sentencing guideline range was 87\r\n\nto  108  months.    In the  plea  agreement,  the  government\r\n\npromised to  recommend a sentence  at the \"lower\" end  of the\r\n\nrange,  which it did.  At sentencing, the court imposed a 90-\r\n\nmonth sentence, which was unquestionably within the lower end\r\n\nof  the  guidelines.    Even  if,  despite  the  government's\r\n\nrecommendation,  the court had chosen an even higher sentence\r\n\nwithin the  guideline range, Severino would have no basis for\r\n\ncomplaint.  In his  plea agreement, he acknowledged  that the\r\n\ncourt  was   not   bound  by   the  government's   sentencing\r\n\nrecommendations.  \r\n\n          Moreover,  Severino  cannot  avail  himself of  the\r\n\nadditional two-level reduction in base offense level accorded\r\n\nsome defendants by Amendment 515 of the Sentencing Guidelines\r\n\nsince he was sentenced before the Amendment became effective.\r\n\nIn  United States  v.
