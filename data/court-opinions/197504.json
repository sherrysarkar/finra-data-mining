We\r\n\naffirm.  \r\n\n                              FACTS\r                                             \r\n\n     We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the party\r\n\nopposing summary judgment.   See Fennell v.  First Steps Designs,\r                                                                           \r\n\nLtd., 83 F.3d 526, 534 (1st Cir. 1996).  The incidents underlying\r              \r\n\nthis case began in approximately 1989, when Galvao was working in\r\n\nthe Boston Research  and Development Division (BRAD)  of Gillette\r\n\nas a Grade 7 technician.  He sought a promotion or upgrade of his\r\n\njob  classification,   which  was  denied.2    Instead,  Gillette\r\n\nsupervisors  presented  Galvao  with a  Career  Development  plan\r\n\ndesigned to qualify  him for promotion to a Grade 8 position.  On\r\n\nGalvao's protest, an  audit of his position was  performed by the\r\n\nGillette Human Resources Compensation Department, which concluded\r\n\nthat  his  position  was  properly  graded.    Galvao sought  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    Galvao specifically claims that it was Gillette as a\r\ncorporate entity, and not any specific individuals there, who\r\ndiscriminated against him.\r\n\n     2    There seems to be some confusion as to whether the\r\nchange sought was a promotion or a regrading of Galvao's existing\r\njob.  Indeed, Galvao himself testified in his deposition that he\r\nwas unclear as to the distinction between the two.  The issue is\r\nirrelevant to our analysis, however, since Galvao is unable to\r\nshow that there were others similarly situated for either\r\ncircumstance.  \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nreceived a  review of  the audit by  Gillette's Open  Door Review\r\n\nPanel, which also upheld the denial of the upgrade.3  \r\n\n    In July 1992, Galvao filed a complaint with the Massachusetts\r\n\nCommission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"), alleging  that he had\r\n\nbeen   denied  a  promotion  and  given  a  negative  performance\r\n\nevaluation  due to  his  race,  color and  national  origin.   He\r\n\nmaintains  that  after  his  filing,  his  supervisors  distanced\r\n\nthemselves from him,  and subjected him to  greater criticism and\r\n\ndemands.   He  was assigned  to a new  supervisor, Dr.  Hoang Mai\r\n\nTrankiem,  in February  1993.4    Although  Trankiem  and  Galvao\r\n\ninitially had a positive relationship  as a result of an in-house\r\n\nproject they had previously worked on together, relations between\r\n\nthem rapidly deteriorated.  Trankiem instituted a system of daily\r\n\nworksheets  and productivity reports on Galvao, and, according to\r\n\nhim, exerted tremendous pressure on  him, with the result that he\r\n\nfelt  increasingly stressed.  Despite repeated requests by Galvao\r\n\nto  both  Trankiem and  her  supervisor,  Dr. Stan  Wreford,  for\r\n\nintervention  vis  a   vis  his   working  responsibilities   and\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3     The Panel was composed of Doris Ferrer Roach, an\r\nattorney in Gillette's General Counsel's Office and a Hispanic\r\nfemale; Timothy W. Horan, Director of Human Resources-\r\nManufacturing, a white male; and Robert A. Williams, III, Vice\r\nPresident, Corporate Director, Urban Affairs, a black male.  \r\n\n     4    Dr. Trankiem is a Vietnamese female.  Trankiem\r\ntestified in her deposition that she requested she supervise\r\nGalvao in an effort to improve his productivity, which had become\r\na source of concern under a previous supervisor.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nTrankiem's supervision of him, no help was forthcoming.5  Rather,\r\n\nGalvao was eventually provided with a Final Written Warning,6 and\r\n\nthen terminated on November 8, 1993.  He subsequently filed suit,\r\n\nbringing both federal  and state  discrimination and  retaliation\r\n\nclaims.     The  district  court  granted  summary  judgment  for\r\n\nGillette, and this appeal followed.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n     We review the district court's  grant of summary judgment de\r                                                                           \r\n\nnovo.   See Mesnick v.  General Electric Co.,  950 F.2d 816,  822\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1992).  In so  doing, we have thoroughly  reviewed the\r\n\nrecord  and the  briefs, and  find ourselves  in accord  with the\r\n\ndistrict  court's conclusions.   Mindful  that  where a  district\r\n\ncourt  has produced  a  comprehensive, well-reasoned  opinion, we\r\n\nshould  not needlessly  expound  at length,  we  discuss each  of\r\n\nGalvao's claims  briefly.  See  Lawton v. State Mut.  Life Assur.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo. of America, 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r                        \r\n\n1.Title VII Discrimination.\r                                     \r\n\nUnder the well-established McDonnell Douglas  framework for Title\r                                                      \r\n\nVII cases,  see McDonnell  Douglas Corp. v.  Green, 411  U.S. 792\r                                                            \r\n\n(1973); see also  Smith v. F.W. Morse  &amp; Co., Inc., 76  F.3d 413,\r                                                            \r\n\n420 (1st Cir.  1996), a plaintiff seeking to prove discrimination\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5    In one memo to Dr. Wreford, Galvao described Dr.\r\nTrankiem's management style as \"Vietnamese\" and said he was being\r\nsubjected to psychological torture and treated like a prisoner or\r\na slave.  \r\n\n     6    As part of his Final Written Warning, Galvao was\r\nupgraded to Grade 8 by Dr. Trankiem in an effort to remove a\r\nperceived barrier to his productivity.  \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nwithout  direct evidence  of bias  must first  establish a  prima\r\n\nfacie  case of discrimination.  See  Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n99 F.3d 456  (1st Cir. 1996).7   This is accomplished  by showing\r\n\nthat the  employee is  a member  of a  protected  class and  that\r\n\nsimilarly situated  employees who were  not members of  the class\r\n\nwere treated more favorably.  See id.  If such a showing is made,\r                                              \r\n\nthe burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate\r\n\nnon-discriminatory reason for its actions.  See id.  Once this is\r                                                            \r\n\naccomplished,  the employee  may then attempt  to prove  that the\r\n\nproffered reason is a pretext.  See id.8  \r                                                \r\n\n     The district court found that Galvao had failed to show that\r\n\nthere were  similarly situated employees  who could be used  as a\r\n\nbasis of  comparison.   We see  no flaw  in its  reasoning.   The\r\n\nemployees identified by Galvao either  were not in the same grade\r\n\nas him, or they worked in different areas.  \r\n\n     We recently  cautioned that courts must  exercise particular\r\n\ncare when evaluating a plaintiff's claim that an employer applied\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7    Cases decided under the ADEA (Age Discrimination in\r\nEmployment Act, 29 U.S.C.    621-634) are applicable in the Title\r\nVII context, see Fennell, 83 F.3d at 535 n. 9, and we therefore\r                                  \r\ncite to cases of both types for purposes of the McDonnell-Douglas\r                                                                           \r\nanalysis.  \r\n\n     8      The district court concluded this was a \"non-\r\ncompetitive promotion\" case (rather than what it termed a \"garden\r\nvariety\" failure to promote case), and therefore adopted a\r\nmodification promulgated in a district court case in Tennessee,\r\nYoung v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 868 F.Supp. 937, 944-45\r                                                 \r\n(W.D. Tenn. 1994).  As both the \"garden variety\" and \"non-\r\ncompetitive promotion\" analyses require a plaintiff to address\r\nthe key issue here -- i.e. whether the plaintiff is treated\r\ndifferently from others similarly situated -- we do not for the\r\npresent distinguish between non-competitive promotion and other\r\nfailure to promote cases.  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nits  standards differentially  (i.e.,  distinguished between  the\r                                              \r\n\nplaintiff and those similarly situated).  See E.E.O.C.  v. Amego,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 110 F.3d 135, 145  (1st Cir. 1997)(citing Banerjee v. Board\r                                                                           \r\n\nof Trustees, 648 F.2d 61,  63 (1st Cir. 1981))(in academic tenure\r                     \r\n\ncontext, plaintiffs who were  denied tenure must show that  their\r\n\nqualifications  are  at least  comparable to  those of  \"a middle\r\n\ngroup of  tenure candidates as  to whom both a  decision granting\r\n\ntenure  and a  decision denying  tenure could  be justified  as a\r\n\nreasonable exercise  of discretion by the  tenure-decision making\r\n\nbody\").  A  plaintiff must be able, at a  minimum, to demonstrate\r\n\nthat  there are  at least  some  basically comparable  employees.\r\n\nGalvao was unable to do this.\r\n\n     Although the district court's finding that Galvao had failed\r\n\nto make out  a prima facie  case made it unnecessary  to continue\r\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas  analysis, the  district court  went on  to\r                               \r\n\nfind that Gillette's proffered reason for not upgrading Galvao --\r\n\nthat he lacked  the credentials and characteristics of  a Grade 8\r\n\ntechnician -- was  not a pretext.  The  district court thoroughly\r\n\naddressed the evidence on this issue, and we  need not repeat it.\r\n\nWe agree  that, on this  record, a jury  could not conclude  that\r\n\nGillette's  reasons  were  pretextual,  and  Galvao s  Title  VII\r\n\ndiscrimination claim therefore fails.  \r\n\n2.   Title VII Retaliation.\r                                     \r\n\n     Galvao  also contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\ndismissing his separate  claim that  Gillette retaliated  against\r\n\nhim  for  filing  the  MCAD  complaint.    He  asserts  that  his\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nsupervisor subjected him to undue supervision and assessment, and\r\n\nultimately  terminated  him  in response  to  his  administrative\r\n\nclaim. \r\n\n     The  McDonnell Douglas burden shifting analysis is also used\r                                     \r\n\nin  retaliation claims  where there  is no  direct evidence  of a\r\n\ndefendant's retaliatory animus.  See Fennell, 83 F.3d at 535.   A\r                                                      \r\n\nplaintiff seeking to show a prima facie case of retaliation under\r\n\nTitle  VII must show  1) he or  she engaged  in protected conduct\r\n\nunder  Title VII and that the alleged retaliator was aware of it,\r\n\n2)  an adverse  employment  action, and  3)  a causal  connection\r\n\nbetween the first two elements.  See id.; see also Petitti v. New\r                                                                           \r\n\nEngland Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 909 F.2d  28, 33 (1st Cir. 1990).   Once\r                                 \r\n\nthis showing has been made, the burden shifts to the defendant to\r\n\narticulate  a   legitimate  non-discriminatory  reason   for  its\r\n\nemployment decision.  See Fennell, 853 F.3d at 535.\r                                           \r\n\n     Even given  a generous  reading, Galvao's  retaliation claim\r\n\nfalters.   While he  can establish that  he engaged  in protected\r\n\nconduct -- the filing  of the MCAD complaint -- he  has failed to\r\n\nshow that Gillette personnel knew  about this at the time of  the\r\n\nallegedly adverse employment actions, or that there was  a causal\r\n\nrelationship  between his  filing  his  MCAD  complaint  and  the\r\n\nchallenged conduct.  As the district court  explained, the record\r\n\nshows that  the adverse employment actions of which he complains,\r\n\nincluding  his  termination,  were the  result  of  his own  poor\r\n\nperformance and insubordination.  \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n3.   Motion of Counsel to Withdraw.\r                                             \r\n\n     Galvao  also contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\ndenying his  previous counsel's  motion to  withdraw.  He  argues\r\n\nthat the court's ruling compelled him to continue with counsel in\r\n\nwhom  he  had lost  faith, and  whose commitment  to his  case he\r\n\ndoubted, and that  his case was thereby prejudiced.   Under Local\r\n\nRule 83.5.2(c), because  successor counsel had not  been obtained\r\n\nby Galvao, it was within  the court's discretion whether to grant\r\n\nhis counsel's  motion to  withdraw.9   In  the circumstances,  we\r\n\ncannot say  that the  court's refusal to  do so  was an  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.   See Andrews v.  Bechtel Power Corp., 780  F.2d 124,\r                                                           \r\n\n135 (1st Cir. 1985).   Title VII litigation is complex  and a pro\r\n\nse   litigant  embarks  on   this  path  with   some  significant\r\n\ndisadvantage.   The court's conclusion that Galvao was better off\r\n\nwith counsel, even  if they were not  exactly seeing eye  to eye,\r\n\nwas not an unreasonable one.

The incidents underlying\r              \r\n\nthis case began in approximately 1989, when Galvao was working in\r\n\nthe Boston Research  and Development Division (BRAD)  of Gillette\r\n\nas a Grade 7 technician.  He sought a promotion or upgrade of his\r\n\njob  classification,   which  was  denied.2    Instead,  Gillette\r\n\nsupervisors  presented  Galvao  with a  Career  Development  plan\r\n\ndesigned to qualify  him for promotion to a Grade 8 position.  On\r\n\nGalvao's protest, an  audit of his position was  performed by the\r\n\nGillette Human Resources Compensation Department, which concluded\r\n\nthat  his  position  was  properly  graded.    Galvao sought  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    Galvao specifically claims that it was Gillette as a\r\ncorporate entity, and not any specific individuals there, who\r\ndiscriminated against him.\r\n\n     2    There seems to be some confusion as to whether the\r\nchange sought was a promotion or a regrading of Galvao's existing\r\njob.  Indeed, Galvao himself testified in his deposition that he\r\nwas unclear as to the distinction between the two.  The issue is\r\nirrelevant to our analysis, however, since Galvao is unable to\r\nshow that there were others similarly situated for either\r\ncircumstance.  \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nreceived a  review of  the audit by  Gillette's Open  Door Review\r\n\nPanel, which also upheld the denial of the upgrade.3  \r\n\n    In July 1992, Galvao filed a complaint with the Massachusetts\r\n\nCommission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"), alleging  that he had\r\n\nbeen   denied  a  promotion  and  given  a  negative  performance\r\n\nevaluation  due to  his  race,  color and  national  origin.   He\r\n\nmaintains  that  after  his  filing,  his  supervisors  distanced\r\n\nthemselves from him,  and subjected him to  greater criticism and\r\n\ndemands.   He  was assigned  to a new  supervisor, Dr.  Hoang Mai\r\n\nTrankiem,  in February  1993.4    Although  Trankiem  and  Galvao\r\n\ninitially had a positive relationship  as a result of an in-house\r\n\nproject they had previously worked on together, relations between\r\n\nthem rapidly deteriorated.  Trankiem instituted a system of daily\r\n\nworksheets  and productivity reports on Galvao, and, according to\r\n\nhim, exerted tremendous pressure on  him, with the result that he\r\n\nfelt  increasingly stressed.  Despite repeated requests by Galvao\r\n\nto  both  Trankiem and  her  supervisor,  Dr. Stan  Wreford,  for\r\n\nintervention  vis  a   vis  his   working  responsibilities   and\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3     The Panel was composed of Doris Ferrer Roach, an\r\nattorney in Gillette's General Counsel's Office and a Hispanic\r\nfemale; Timothy W. Horan, Director of Human Resources-\r\nManufacturing, a white male; and Robert A. Williams, III, Vice\r\nPresident, Corporate Director, Urban Affairs, a black male.  \r\n\n     4    Dr. Trankiem is a Vietnamese female.  Trankiem\r\ntestified in her deposition that she requested she supervise\r\nGalvao in an effort to improve his productivity, which had become\r\na source of concern under a previous supervisor.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nTrankiem's supervision of him, no help was forthcoming.5  Rather,\r\n\nGalvao was eventually provided with a Final Written Warning,6 and\r\n\nthen terminated on November 8, 1993.  He subsequently filed suit,\r\n\nbringing both federal  and state  discrimination and  retaliation\r\n\nclaims.     The  district  court  granted  summary  judgment  for\r\n\nGillette, and this appeal followed.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n     We review the district court's  grant of summary judgment de\r                                                                           \r\n\nnovo.

We see  no flaw  in its  reasoning.

A  plaintiff must be able, at a  minimum, to demonstrate\r\n\nthat  there are  at least  some  basically comparable  employees.\r\n\nGalvao was unable to do this.\r\n\n     Although the district court's finding that Galvao had failed\r\n\nto make out  a prima facie  case made it unnecessary  to continue\r\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas  analysis, the  district court  went on  to\r                               \r\n\nfind that Gillette's proffered reason for not upgrading Galvao --\r\n\nthat he lacked  the credentials and characteristics of  a Grade 8\r\n\ntechnician -- was  not a pretext.  The  district court thoroughly\r\n\naddressed the evidence on this issue, and we  need not repeat it.\r\n\nWe agree  that, on this  record, a jury  could not conclude  that\r\n\nGillette's  reasons  were  pretextual,  and  Galvao s  Title  VII\r\n\ndiscrimination claim therefore fails.  \r\n\n2.   Title VII Retaliation.\r                                     \r\n\n     Galvao  also contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\ndismissing his separate  claim that  Gillette retaliated  against\r\n\nhim  for  filing  the  MCAD  complaint.    He  asserts  that  his\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nsupervisor subjected him to undue supervision and assessment, and\r\n\nultimately  terminated  him  in response  to  his  administrative\r\n\nclaim. \r\n\n     The  McDonnell Douglas burden shifting analysis is also used\r                                     \r\n\nin  retaliation claims  where there  is no  direct evidence  of a\r\n\ndefendant's retaliatory animus.

Once\r                                 \r\n\nthis showing has been made, the burden shifts to the defendant to\r\n\narticulate  a   legitimate  non-discriminatory  reason   for  its\r\n\nemployment decision.  See Fennell, 853 F.3d at 535.\r                                           \r\n\n     Even given  a generous  reading, Galvao's  retaliation claim\r\n\nfalters.   While he  can establish that  he engaged  in protected\r\n\nconduct -- the filing  of the MCAD complaint -- he  has failed to\r\n\nshow that Gillette personnel knew  about this at the time of  the\r\n\nallegedly adverse employment actions, or that there was  a causal\r\n\nrelationship  between his  filing  his  MCAD  complaint  and  the\r\n\nchallenged conduct.  As the district court  explained, the record\r\n\nshows that  the adverse employment actions of which he complains,\r\n\nincluding  his  termination,  were the  result  of  his own  poor\r\n\nperformance and insubordination.  \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n3.

He  argues\r\n\nthat the court's ruling compelled him to continue with counsel in\r\n\nwhom  he  had lost  faith, and  whose commitment  to his  case he\r\n\ndoubted, and that  his case was thereby prejudiced.   Under Local\r\n\nRule 83.5.2(c), because  successor counsel had not  been obtained\r\n\nby Galvao, it was within  the court's discretion whether to grant\r\n\nhis counsel's  motion to  withdraw.9   In  the circumstances,  we\r\n\ncannot say  that the  court's refusal to  do so  was an  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.

Title VII litigation is complex  and a pro\r\n\nse   litigant  embarks  on   this  path  with   some  significant\r\n\ndisadvantage.   The court's conclusion that Galvao was better off\r\n\nwith counsel, even  if they were not  exactly seeing eye  to eye,\r\n\nwas not an unreasonable one.   Moreover, the court indicated that\r\n\nit would be willing to  reconsider the issue later.  Furthermore,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9    Rule 83.5.2(c) states:\r\n\n    An attorney may withdraw from a case by\r\n    serving notice of his withdrawal on his\r\n    client and all other parties and filing the\r\n    notice, provided that (1) such notice is\r\n    preceded or accompanied by notice of the\r\n    appearance of other counsel; (2) there are no\r\n    motions pending before the court; (3) no\r\n    trial date has been set; and (4) no hearings\r\n    or conferences are scheduled, and no reports,\r\n    oral or written, are due.  Unless these\r\n    conditions are met, an attorney (including\r\n    one whose services have been terminated by\r\n    his client) may withdraw from a case only by\r\n    leave of court.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nalthough we  realize that  a serious  difference existed  between\r\n\nGalvao  and his  counsel, it  appears  from the  record that  the\r\n\ndistrict court made every effort  to permit Galvao to present his\r\n\ncase as he wished.10 \r\n\n     Additionally,  Galvao's  counsel  was  bound  by an  ethical\r\n\nobligation  to  prosecute his  case fully  and effectively.
