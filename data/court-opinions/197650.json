Bogaert and Morrison, Mahoney &amp; Miller\r\non  Memorandum of  Law  in Support  of  Motion of  Defendant-Appellee,\r\nKimberly Cheney, for Summary Affirmance.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n                      November 14, 1997\r\n                                        \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.   Pro se plaintiff Dennis Solomon appeals  a\r\n\ndistrict  court judgment  that  dismissed  his  complaint  as\r\n\nfrivolous \r                     under 28 U.S.C. S 1915(e)(2)(B).  Plaintiff is not a\r\n\nprisoner.  He did not seek to proceed in forma pauperis,  but\r\n\nrather \r                  paid \r                       the \r                          full \r                               fee \r                                   for filing his complaint.  Thus, it is\r\n\nnot \r               entirely \r                        clear that the foregoing statute, which generally\r\n\napplies to  prisoners seeking to  proceed in forma  pauperis,\r\n\napplies \r                   to \r                      this \r                          case. \r                                 \r                                 Nevertheless, having thoroughly reviewed\r\n\nthe \r               record \r                      and \r                         the \r                             parties' briefs on appeal, this court agrees\r\n\nthat the instant  action is frivolous and that plaintiff  can\r\n\nprove \r                 no \r                    set \r                       of \r                          facts \r                                that would entitle him to relief.  Nor do\r\n\nwe see any merit to the plaintiff's unsupported claim of bias\r\n\non the part of the district court.  Accordingly, the judgment\r\n\nof the district court is summarily affirmed.  See Local  Rule\r\n\n27.1.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\n",
