Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Giuseppe Pellerito on brief pro se.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Miguel A. Fernandez,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Rebecca Vargas-Vera,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 12, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we find no basis for this appeal from the district\r\ncourt's order dated August 3, 1998.  That order essentially\r\ngranted the relief sought by petitioner in his pro se  2255\r\nmotion, and it adopted the parties' agreed payment plan, which\r\nplan petitioner personally ratified by his affidavits.  This\r\ncourt is not the proper forum in the first instance for a claim\r\nof present inability to comply with the August 3 order. \r\nPetitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is\r\nwholly frivolous. \r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
