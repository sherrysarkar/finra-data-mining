Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n   James T. McCormick on brief for appellant.\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Richard W.\nRose, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\nJanuary 4, 1999\n\nPer Curiam. Upon careful review of the briefs and record,\nwe conclude that this appeal presents no substantial question for\nour review.\nOn the record here, the government's refusal to recommend\na departure under U.S.S.G.  5K1.1 cannot be said to be\nunconstitutional or, even assuming a bad faith standard, in bad\nfaith.  See Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185-87 (1992);\nUnited States v. Catalucci, 36 F.3d 151, 153 (1st Cir. 1994).  Even\nif that refusal was finally precipitated by defendant's denial of\nculpability for an airline ticket scam, still the refusal was not\nirrational.  Assuming arguendo that the district court had some\nresidual authority of its own (without a government motion) to\ndepart based on defendant's assistance, in extraordinary\ncircumstances, see United States v. Romolo, 937 F.2d 20, 25 (1st\nCir. 1991) (reserving the question), no such circumstances are\npresent here.\nFinally, defendant asserts that the district court might\nhave misunderstood its authority to depart under  4A1.3 on the\nground that defendant's criminal history category may have over-\nrepresented his true criminality.  To the contrary, as we read the\nrecord, the district court assumed that it might have discretion\nfor such a departure in an appropriate case, but concluded as a\nmatter of discretion that no departure would be warranted in\ndefendant's case.  See United States v. Perez,     F.3d    , 1998\nWL 798723 (1st Cir. November 23, 1998).\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
