More to\r\n\nthe point, the self-settled JRS Realty Trust, of which the debtor\r\n\nis  both  a settlor  and  a beneficiary,  contains  a spendthrift\r\n\nclause which is vulnerable under  Maine law and which, therefore,\r\n\ncannot  support  the  claim  for  exclusion.    Accordingly,  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court did not  err in denying the debtor's  request to\r\n\nwithhold his interest in the trust from the bankruptcy estate.\r\n\n          We have repeatedly stated    and today reaffirm    that\r\n\nwe will  not write at length  to explicate points that  have been\r\n\nmade  perfectly clear by lower courts.
