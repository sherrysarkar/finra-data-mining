George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Thomas J. Lynch with whom Lynch Associates, LLC was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Joseph   D.  Halpern,   Blue  Cross   and  Blue  Shield of\nMassachusetts, Inc., Law Department, with whom Sara A. Walker was\non brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         June 11, 2002\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge.        In March 2001, Marjorie Hotz\n\nbrought suit in state court against her health insurer, Blue Cross\n\nand Blue Shield of Massachusetts (\"Blue Cross\"). Hotz claimed that\nBlue Cross violated a state law prohibiting unfair claim settlement\n\npractices by insurance companies, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, §\n\n3(9) (2000), when it waited nearly three months before approving\npayment for a course of follow-up therapy recommended by her\n\nphysician after the removal of her cancerous tonsil.   Hotz alleged\n\nthat Blue Cross's delay caused her condition to worsen and sued\n\nunder Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9(1) (2000), which was amended in\n\n1979 to extend its private remedies provisions to violations of\n\nchapter 176D, § 3(9) (2000).1\n\n          Hotz's insurance coverage with Blue Cross was part of an\nemployee benefit plan offered and paid for by the law firm where\n\nshe worked; the plan is governed by the Employee Retirement Income\n\nSecurity Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. (2000).      Blue\nCross removed the case to federal district court, claiming federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction based on ERISA; it then moved to dismiss on\nthe ground that Hotz's chapter 93A claim fell within ERISA's clause\n\npreempting all state laws that \"relate to\" employee benefit plans,\n\nid. § 1144(a).\n\n     1\n      See Hopkins v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 750 N.E.2d 943, 949-50\n(Mass. 2001); Van Dyke v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 448\nN.E.2d 357, 360 (Mass. 1983). Chapter 93A is a well-known\nMassachusetts statute that permits private actions for multiple\ndamages and attorney's fees for a broad class of \"unfair methods of\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\nconduct of any trade or commerce.\"     Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, §\n2(a).   Blue Cross asserts that it is not engaged in trade or\ncommerce but we do not reach that issue.\n\n                                -2-\n\f           The district court denied Hotz's motion to remand and\n\ngranted Blue Cross's motion to dismiss, and Hotz now appeals.                    As\n\nrequired, we assume for this purpose the truth of her factual\nallegations.      Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1,\n\n5-6 (1st Cir. 2002). This is so even though Blue Cross asserts\n\nthat, if the case were tried, it would show that no undue delay\noccurred because it approved the treatment requested within 48\n\nhours after it received the relevant request. Our review, which is\n\naddressed to questions of law, is de novo.                Id.\n\n             Hotz   presses    two   points      on    appeal.     First,   at   the\n\nthreshold, she argues that the district court lacked removal\n\njurisdiction over her state law claim. Second, she argues that her\n\nclaim is not preempted because it falls under the so-called \"saving\nclause\" exempting from ERISA's preemption provision any state law\n\nthat \"regulates insurance.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A). We address\n\nthese issues in the same order and conclude that they are largely\ngoverned by existing case law.\n\n             Normally, federal defenses including preemption do not by\n\nthemselves      confer     federal   jurisdiction         over   a    well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint alleging only violations of state law. Franchise Tax Bd.\n\nof Cal. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Cal., 463 U.S. 1,\n\n9-10,   25-27     (1983).      But   under       the    doctrine     of   \"complete\n\npreemption,\" ERISA's civil enforcement provisions, 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(a),   have     been    interpreted     to    establish      federal    removal\n\njurisdiction over any state law claims that in substance seek\n\nrelief that is otherwise within the scope of those ERISA remedy\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fprovisions.   See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63-67\n\n(1987).     Pertinently,   ERISA   permits   a   federal   action   by   a\n\nbeneficiary \"to recover benefits due . . . under the terms of [the]\nplan, to enforce . . . rights under the terms of the plan, or to\n\nclarify . . . rights to future benefits under the terms of the\n\nplan.\"    29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).\n            Hotz denies that her claim involves a \"benefit\" as the\n\nterm is used in ERISA; she says that \"benefit\" means only the\n\nbenefit offered directly by the employer to its employees (i.e.,\n\ncoverage under the employer's group insurance policy) and not the\n\nbenefit provided by the insurance company to the employee (i.e.,\n\npayment for medical services) pursuant to the employer's policy.\n\nAlthough the distinction is linguistically possible, it would mean\nthat numerous past ERISA suits brought to secure payment for\n\nmedical services from third-party providers under ERISA plans\n\nlacked a legal basis.2\n            In any event, Hotz's argument is foreclosed by this\n\ncourt's previous opinion in Danca v. Private Health Care Systems,\n\nInc., 185 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1999).            There, we found removal\n\njurisdiction over plaintiff's state tort claim alleging that the\n\ndefendant insurer was negligent when it approved treatment at a\n\nmental hospital different from the hospital recommended by the\n\nreferring physician.       Relying on Pilot Life Insurance Co. v.\n\n\n     2\n      E.g., I.V. Servs. of Am., Inc. v. Inn Dev. & Mgmt., Inc., 182\nF.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 1999); Bernstein v. Capitalcare, Inc., 70\nF.3d 783, 784 (4th Cir. 1995); Farley v. Benefit Trust Life Ins.\nCo., 979 F.2d 653, 658 (8th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fDedeaux, 481 U.S. 41 (1987), we said the claim fell within the\n\nambit of 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) because it challenged \"the\n\nprocess used to assess a participant's claim for a benefit payment\nunder the plan.\"   185 F.3d at 6.      This ruling governs Hotz's claim\n\nagainst   the   insurer   alleging    undue    delay   in   processing    her\n\nphysician's referral.      See also Pryzbowski v. U.S. Healthcare,\n\nInc., 245 F.3d 266, 273-74 (3d Cir. 2001).\n\n           We turn, then, to the question of preemption.                 Hotz\n\nconcedes that if what Blue Cross promises to provide is deemed a\n\nplan benefit, then her state law claim falls at least initially\n\nwithin 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).          That section broadly preempts any\n\nstate law claim that \"relate[s] to\" an employee benefit plan, and\n\nit has been applied widely to bar state claims seeking damages for\nalleged breach of obligations pertaining to an ERISA plan.           E.g.,\n\nPilot Life, 481 U.S. at 47-48.             Hotz's answer is that section\n\n1144(b)'s saving clause preserves her claim as one brought under a\nstate law that \"regulates insurance.\"          29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A).\n\n           The Supreme Court has used several formulas to delineate\nthe scope of the saving clause.            In a trilogy of cases, it has\n\nasked whether the state law regulates insurance under a \"common-\n\nsense view\" of the term and, separately, whether the practice falls\n\nwithin the phrase \"business of insurance\" for purposes of the\n\nMcCarran-Ferguson Act based on three more technical factors.3\nFinally, in one of the cases, it has separately asked whether\n\n     3\n      UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am. v. Ward, 526 U.S. 358, 367-68\n(1999) (citing Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 48-49, and Metro. Life Ins.\nCo. v. Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 724, 740, 743 (1985)).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fallowing the state-created rule to govern would interfere with the\n\nuniform remedial scheme established by ERISA itself for securing\n\nplan benefits.     Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 51-57.\n          Much of the emphasis in the trilogy is on whether the\n\nclaim or rule invoked by the plaintiff is exclusive to insurance\n\nregulation;   in   UNUM   Life,   the   Court's   decision   not   to   find\npreemption turned principally on the fact that the state rule\n\n(involving failure to give notice) was unique to insurance cases.\n\n526 U.S. at 370-71; see also Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 50-51; Metro.\n\nLife, 471 U.S. at 742-43.    The underlying notion is that a claim or\n\nrule directed only to insurance is one that \"regulates insurance\"\n\nwhile one that regulates insurance along with everything else is\n\nnot within the quoted phrase.\n          Exclusivity is an ambiguous label in this case.                The\n\nsubstantive prohibition on delay in claim processing in chapter\n\n176D is directed solely at the insurance industry, but the private\naction for multiple damages and attorney's fees claim brought by\n\nHotz is created by chapter 93A, § 9, which applies to unfair\n\ncommercial practices in any industry.       Yet looking through form to\n\nsubstance, chapter 176D, § 3, invoked by Hotz, is (by its own\n\nterms) merely a specification of particular \"unfair methods of\n\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices\"--which are\n\nbanned in more general terms, and for all industries, in chapter\n\n93A (see note 1, above).\n\n          On balance, our case seems closer to Pilot Life, where\n\nthe Court held to be preempted a punitive damages tort claim for\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fegregious nonpayment of benefits under an insurance policy.           Under\n\nstate law, such punitive damages were also available for egregious\n\nviolations of contracts unrelated to insurance, just as chapter 93A\nis   available   for   non-insurance    unfair   trade   practices.      In\n\naddition, the Court in Pilot Life--quite apart from the \"common-\n\nsense view\" and McCarran-Ferguson tests--emphasized that to allow\npunitive damages for failure to pay benefits was at odds with\n\nCongress's refusal to allow punitive damages for benefit claims\n\nunder ERISA.     481 U.S. at 53-54.\n\n           On this last rationale, other circuits have in a number\n\nof cases held claims under various state statutes similar to\n\nMassachusetts' to be preempted by ERISA despite the saving clause.4\n\nPossibly UNUM Life betokens a shift of emphasis by the Supreme\n\nCourt; plainly the law as to the scope of the saving clause is\n\nstill evolving. But under current Supreme Court precedent, we feel\n\nbound by the similarity of Pilot Life to our own case and by the\n\nclose fit of its final rationale to Hotz's chapter 93A claim.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      Ramirez v.

Hotz claimed that Blue Cross violated a state law prohibiting unfair claim settlement practices by insurance companies, <i>see</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D, &#167; 3(9) (2000), when it waited nearly three months before approving payment for a course of follow-up therapy recommended by her physician after the removal of her cancerous tonsil. Hotz alleged that Blue Cross's delay caused her condition to worsen and sued under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9(1) (2000), which was amended in 1979 to extend its private remedies provisions to violations of chapter 176D, &#167; 3(9) (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hotz's insurance coverage with Blue Cross was part of an employee benefit plan offered and paid for by the law firm where she worked; the plan is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 <i>et seq.</i> (2000). Blue Cross removed the case to federal district court, claiming federal question jurisdiction based on ERISA; it then moved to dismiss on the ground that Hotz's chapter 93A claim fell within ERISA's clause preempting all state laws that \"relate to\" employee benefit plans, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1144(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Hotz's motion to remand and granted Blue Cross's motion to dismiss, and Hotz now appeals. As required, we assume for this purpose the truth of her factual allegations. <i>Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199871\"><a href=\"/opinion/199871/martin-v-applied-cellular-tec/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.2002). This is so even though Blue Cross asserts that, if the case were tried, it would show that no undue delay occurred because it approved the treatment requested within 48 hours after it received the relevant request. Our review, which is addressed to questions of law, is <i>de novo. Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hotz presses two points on appeal. First, at the threshold, she argues that the district court lacked removal jurisdiction over her state law claim. Second, she argues that her claim is not preempted because it falls under the so-called \"saving clause\" exempting from ERISA's preemption provision any state law that \"regulates insurance.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(b)(2)(A). We address these issues in the same order and conclude that they are largely governed by existing case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, federal <i>defenses</i> including preemption do not by themselves confer federal jurisdiction over a well-pleaded complaint alleging only violations of state law. <i>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v.

But under the doctrine of \"complete preemption,\" ERISA's civil enforcement provisions, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a), have been interpreted to establish federal removal jurisdiction over any state law claims that in substance seek relief that is otherwise within the scope of those ERISA remedy provisions. <i>See Metro.

Pertinently, ERISA permits a federal action by a beneficiary \"to recover benefits due ... under the terms of [the] plan, to enforce ... rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify ... rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hotz denies that her claim involves a \"benefit\" as the term is used in ERISA; she says that \"benefit\" means only the benefit offered directly by the employer to its employees (<i>i.e.,</i> coverage under the employer's group insurance policy) and not the benefit provided by the insurance company to the employee (<i>i.e.,</i> payment for medical services) pursuant to the employer's policy. Although the distinction is linguistically possible, it would mean that numerous past ERISA suits brought to secure payment for medical services from third-party providers under ERISA plans lacked a legal basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Hotz's argument is foreclosed by this court's previous opinion in <i>Danca v. Private Health Care Systems, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198586\"><a href=\"/opinion/198586/danca-v-emerson-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999). There, we found removal jurisdiction over plaintiff's state tort claim alleging that the defendant insurer was negligent when it approved treatment at a mental hospital different from the hospital recommended by the referring physician.

This ruling governs Hotz's claim against the insurer alleging undue delay in processing her physician's referral. <i>See also Pryzbowski v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772685\"><a href=\"/opinion/772685/linda-pryzbowksi-v-us-healthcare-inc-medemerge-pa-john-pilla-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 273-74 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to the question of preemption. Hotz concedes that if what Blue Cross promises to provide is deemed a plan benefit, then her state law claim falls at least initially within 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a). That section broadly preempts any state law claim that \"relate[s] to\" an employee benefit plan, and it has been applied widely to bar state claims seeking damages for alleged breach of obligations pertaining to an ERISA plan. <i>E.g., Pilot Life,</i> 481 U.S. at 47-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111858\"><a href=\"/opinion/111858/pilot-life-ins-co-v-dedeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1549</span></a></span>. Hotz's answer is that section 1144(b)'s saving clause preserves her claim as one brought under a state law that \"regulates insurance.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(b)(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has used several formulas to delineate the scope of the saving clause. In a trilogy of cases, it has asked whether the state law regulates insurance under a \"common-sense view\" of the term and, separately, whether the practice falls within the phrase \"business of insurance\" for purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson Act based on three more technical factors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Finally, in one of the cases, it has separately asked whether allowing the state-created rule to govern would interfere with the uniform remedial scheme established by ERISA itself for securing plan benefits. <i>Pilot Life,</i> 481 U.S. at 51-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111858\"><a href=\"/opinion/111858/pilot-life-ins-co-v-dedeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
