The     government       has    asked for summary\n\ndisposition of this appeal pursuant to Local Rule 27(c).                  The\n\ngovernment has shown that Antonio Cortes’s claim of sentencing\n\nfactor manipulation, the only issue he raises on appeal, is\n\nwithout merit.        “[Se]ntencing factor manipulation is a claim\n\nonly for the extreme and unusual case.”                  United States v.\n\nMontoya, 62 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995).            A defendant cannot make\n\nout a case of undue provocation simply by showing that the idea\n\noriginated     with    the    government    or   that    the   conduct    was\n\nencouraged by it, or that the crime was prolonged beyond the\n\nfirst criminal act, or exceeded in degree or kind what the\n\ndefendant had done before.            Id. at 3-4. “What the defendant\n\nneeds in order to require a reduction are elements like these\n\ncarried to such a degree that the government's conduct must be\n\nviewed as `extraordinary misconduct.’”            Id. at 4.        Cortes fails\n\nto meet the heavy burden necessary to prevail on an assertion of\n\nsentencing factor manipulation.            The scope of the transaction,\n\n150 kilograms of cocaine, never changed during the course of\n\nnegotiations    between       the   coconspirators     and   the   undercover\n\nagents.   Nor did the price of $16,000 per kilogram, $3,000 per\n\nkilogram payable on delivery, deviate at any time during the\n\nnegotiations.     The only element that changed was the method of\n\fthe down payment upon delivery, from cash to the promissory note\n\non a store Cortes purported to own.    Because Cortes fails to\n\nmake a showing of a “extraordinary misconduct,” his sentencing\n\nfactor manipulation claim fails.\n\n    The government’s motion for summary disposition is therefore\n\nGRANTED, and the district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              3\n\f",
