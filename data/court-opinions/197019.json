Papps, First\r                                                                       \r\nAssistant  U.S.  Attorney,  on  Motion  for  Summary  Disposition  for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   After  careful review  of the  record and\r                            \r\n\nbriefs,  we  conclude  that  this case  clearly  presents  no\r\n\nsubstantial issue for review.  \r\n\n     We  find  no  error  or  abuse  of  discretion  in   the\r\n\nrevocation of defendant's supervised release.  The government\r\n\npresented adequate evidence of defendant's state convictions,\r\n\nand  defendant did not make  any response suggesting that the\r\n\nconvictions were insufficient  evidence of  his violation  of\r\n\nsupervised release.    In those  circumstances, the  district\r\n\ncourt  cannot  be faulted  for basing  the revocation  on the\r\n\nconvictions.  See generally United States v. Czajak, 909 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n20, 22 (1st Cir. 1990) (record need only demonstrate that the\r\n\ndistrict  court did  not abuse  its discretion  in concluding\r\n\nthat  the   evidence  \"reasonably  satisfied\"  it   that  the\r\n\ndefendant had in fact violated the law).\r\n\n     The  district court  also properly  rejected defendant's\r\n\nsubsequent motion for arrest of judgment, as defendant failed\r\n\nto show  that the district court \"was without jurisdiction of\r\n\nthe offense charged.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 34.\r\n\n     We  are  not  persuaded  by any  of  defendant's  myriad\r\n\narguments about the arrest  warrant and supporting affidavit;\r\n\ndetainers;  timely  hearing; timely  appointment  of counsel;\r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel;  effect of state  bail on\r\n\nhis  state   and  federal  sentencing;   advisement  for  his\r\n\nunderlying sentence; and credit for pre-sentence time served.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nThe district court correctly  disposed of those arguments, to\r\n\nthe extent  that they were raised below.  And they present no\r\n\ngrounds for  overturning the revocation or  sentence, even on\r\n\nplain error review.  See United States v. Chaklader, 987 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n75,  76 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (absent plain  error, an  issue not\r\n\npresented  to the  district  court cannot  be raised  for the\r\n\nfirst time on appeal). \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
