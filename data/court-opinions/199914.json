The State of Rhode Island\n\nbrought suit in the district court seeking to enjoin certain\n\nfederal    administrative       proceedings      on    the    ground   that    the\n\nproceedings infringed upon the state's constitutionally protected\n\nsovereign interests. Finding the state's arguments convincing, the\n\ndistrict court enjoined the United States Department of Labor and\n\nthree employees of a Rhode Island state agency from proceeding in\n\nan administrative adjudication of the employees' claims that the\n\nstate had retaliated against them in violation of federal law. The\n\nUnited    States    and   individual    employees      now    appeal   the    order\nentering the injunction.\n\n            After fully considering the parties' contentions, which\nwere ably briefed and very well argued, we affirm the judgment of\nthe district court, with only slight modification to its order.\n\n                                       I.\n\nA.   Statutory Background\n\n            The Solid Waste Disposal Act (\"SWDA\" or \"Act\"), 23 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 6901-6992k, is a comprehensive environmental enactment designed\n\nto promote the reduction of hazardous waste and the treatment,\n\nstorage, or disposal of such waste so as to minimize threats to\n\nhuman health and the environment.            Id. § 6902(b).\n\n            The Act contains a whistleblower provision that prohibits\nan employer from firing or otherwise discriminating against an\n\nemployee   who     initiates    or   testifies    in    a    proceeding   brought\npursuant to the Act.           Id. § 6971(a).          The Act establishes an\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fadministrative scheme by which an employee who believes that he was\n\nthe victim of a retaliatory adverse employment action may seek\n\nreview of the employer's decision by the Secretary of Labor.1                    See\n\n29 C.F.R. pt. 24.\n\n               1.    Initial investigation\n\n               Under this administrative scheme, an employee may, within\n\nthirty days of the alleged retaliation, apply to the Secretary of\n\nLabor for a review of the firing or alleged discrimination.                      42\n\nU.S.C.    §    6971(b).         The   Act   directs    the   Secretary    of   Labor\n\n(\"Secretary\"), upon receiving such an application, to cause an\ninvestigation to be made as the Secretary deems appropriate.                     Id.\n\nBy regulation, an initial investigation is conducted by the Office\nof the Assistant Secretary of the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (\"OSHA\").              29 C.F.R. § 24.4(b).       The regulations\n\nauthorize OSHA, in the course of this investigation, to enter and\ninspect       places      and   records,    question   persons   who     are   being\nproceeded against and other employees of the charged employer, and\n\nrequire the production of any documentary or other evidence deemed\nnecessary to determine whether a violation of the law has been\ncommitted.          Id.   Within thirty days of receipt of the employee's\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The same administrative enforcement mechanism applies to the\nwhistleblower provisions in several other environmental statutes.\nSee 29 C.F.R. § 24.1; see also 15 U.S.C. § 2622 (Toxic Substances\nControl Act); 33 U.S.C. § 1367 (Water Pollution Control Act); 42\nU.S.C. § 300j-9 (Safe Drinking Water Act); 42 U.S.C. § 5851 (Energy\nReorganization Act); 42 U.S.C. § 7622 (Clean Air Act); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9610 (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and\nLiability Act).\n\n                                            -3-\n\fapplication, OSHA must complete the investigation and determine\n\nwhether a violation has occurred.                Id. § 24.4(d)(1).\n\n               2.    Opportunity for an administrative hearing\n\n               The statute requires the Secretary to provide, on request\n\nof either party, an opportunity for a hearing to enable the parties\n\nto present information relating to the alleged violation.                        42\n\nU.S.C.     §    6971(b).        Upon     such     a   request,      OSHA's   initial\n\ndetermination becomes inoperative, 29 C.F.R. § 24.4(d)(2), and the\n\nmatter is assigned to an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") within\n\nthe Department of Labor, id. § 24.6(a).                A hearing before the ALJ\nis conducted in accordance with the formal hearing provisions of\n\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), set forth at 5 U.S.C.\n§ 554.         42 U.S.C. § 6971(b).             The employer and employee are\nentitled to be represented by counsel at the hearing, present\n\nevidence on their behalf, and, upon request, present oral argument\nand file a prehearing brief or other written statement of fact or\nlaw.     29 C.F.R. §§ 24.6(d), (e)(1)-(3).              At her discretion, the\n\nSecretary may intervene in the matter as a party or amicus curiae\nat any time during the proceedings.                Id. § 24.6(f)(1).\n\n               At the end of the hearing, the ALJ issues a recommended\n\ndecision.           Id. § 24.7(a).       If the ALJ finds in favor of the\ncomplainant, a recommended order that includes a recommendation as\nto appropriate relief is issued.                Id. § 24.7(c)(1).\n\n               The ALJ's recommended decision becomes final unless a\npetition for review is filed with the Administrative Review Board\n\n(\"ARB\"),       id.    §   24.7(d),   a   body    to   which   the    Secretary   has\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdelegated the authority to issue final decisions, id. § 24.8(a).\n\nThe ARB is composed of three members, each of whom is appointed by\n\nthe Secretary for a term not to exceed two years.               See Authority\nand Responsibilities of the Administrative Review Board, 61 Fed.\n\nReg. 19,978, 19,789 (May 3, 1996).\n\n           The ARB reviews the decision of the ALJ to determine\nwhether a violation of the law occurred.            29 C.F.R. § 24.8(d)(1).\n\nIf the ARB determines that a violation did occur, it shall order\n\nthe party charged to take \"appropriate affirmative action to abate\n\nthe   violation,\"         including   reinstating    the    complainant     and\n\ncompensating the complainant for back pay and other compensatory\n\ndamages.     Id.    The ARB, at the request of the complainant, shall\n\nalso award attorney fees and costs.           Id. § 24.8(d)(2); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 6971(c).      If the ARB concludes that no violation occurred, it\n\nmust issue an order denying the complaint.            29 C.F.R. § 24.8(e).\n\n           3.      Enforcement of the Secretary's orders\n\n           Unlike a court, the Secretary does not have inherent\n\nauthority to issue enforceable orders, and the SWDA does not give\nthe Secretary the power of contempt, mandamus, or the like.               Thus,\nany enforcement of the Secretary's orders must occur in court.\n\nSpecifically,       the    Act   directs    that    the    Secretary's    final\ndeterminations under the whistleblower provisions are subject to\nreview in the court of appeals in accordance with judicial review\n\nprovisions of the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.                 See 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n6971(b), 6976(b); see also Varnadore v. Sec'y of Labor, 141 F.3d\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f625, 630 (6th Cir. 1999); Simon v. Simmons Foods, Inc., 49 F.3d\n\n386, 389 n.2 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\nB.   Factual Background and Proceedings Below\n\n           1.   Administrative proceedings\n\n           The State of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Department\n\nof Environmental Management (\"DEM\") brought this action to enjoin\n\nfour separate administrative proceedings brought pursuant to the\nwhistleblower provision of the SWDA.2     The complainants in these\n\nproceedings were DEM employees Beverly Migliore, Barbara Raddatz,\n\nand Joan Taylor (the \"individual appellants\").     They each allege\nthat the state agency retaliated against them for reporting what\nthe employees believed to be an improper implementation of the\nSWDA.   See Rhode Island v. United States, 115 F. Supp. 2d 269, 270-\n\n71 (D.R.I. 2000).   Migliore also filed a second charge based on her\nallegation that DEM had retaliated against her for initiating the\nfirst proceeding.    Id. at 271.    The relief that each complainant\n\nsought included monetary and injunctive relief.     Id.\n\n           The four proceedings were at different stages when the\ndistrict court enjoined further action.         In Migliore's first\nproceeding, an ALJ had issued a recommended decision awarding her\n\n$843,000 in monetary relief, and the DEM filed a petition with the\n\nARB for review of the ALJ's decision.     Id. at 272.   In the second\n\n\n2\n    The state asserted in the administrative proceedings that\nsovereign immunity barred the individuals' claims, but its\nentreaties were rejected by the ALJ. The regulations governing the\nproceedings provide no formal mechanism for interlocutory review of\nimmunity determinations.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fproceeding initiated by Migliore, OSHA had issued an order awarding\n\nMigliore $10,000 in monetary relief, and the DEM requested a\n\nhearing before an ALJ.        Id. In the proceeding initiated by Barbara\n\nRaddatz, OSHA found no violation, and Raddatz requested a hearing\n\nbefore an ALJ.       Id.   Joan Taylor's allegations were still under\n\ninvestigation when the district court's injunction issued.3                 Id.\n\n          2.    Proceedings in the district court\n\n          In ruling on Rhode Island's motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction,    the   district     court       held   that   the   administrative\n\nproceedings were barred by sovereign immunity principles.                       The\ncourt observed that in Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), the\n\nSupreme Court had contrasted a suit brought by the United States\nwith a suit brought by a private party and explained that \"'[s]uits\nbrought by     the   United    States    itself      require   the   exercise    of\n\npolitical responsibility for each suit prosecuted against a State,\na control which is absent from a broad delegation to private\npersons to sue nonconsenting States.'\"               Rhode Island, 115 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 273 (quoting Alden, 527 U.S. at 756).                 The district court\nconcluded that the same reasoning applied to federal administrative\nproceedings.    In the court's view, the Secretary could investigate\n\nalleged violations of federal law and determine appropriate relief,\nbut the Secretary could not rely on privately prosecuted adversary\nproceedings in making that determination.                Id. at 274.\n\n\n\n3\n  OSHA subsequently found that Taylor's allegations had merit, and\nthe DEM requested a hearing which, due to the injunction, has not\ntaken place.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f            The court entered a preliminary injunction barring any\n\nfurther   prosecution       before    the    Department    of   Labor    of    the\n\nemployees' claims against the state agency.           Id. at 279.       Although\nthe court did not enjoin OSHA from investigating the alleged\n\nviolations on which those claims were based or from otherwise\n\nseeking to ensure the state's compliance with federal law,                    id.,\n\nits ruling does not seem to allow the administrative proceedings to\n\ncontinue if the Secretary decides to intervene to prosecute the\n\ncomplaints on the individuals' behalf.\n\n            Because the district court had effectively decided the\n\ncase on the merits, the parties filed a stipulation to convert the\n\npreliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and enter final\n\njudgment.      The court entered final judgment pursuant to that\nstipulation.\n\n            The    United    States    and    individual    appellants        filed\n\nseparate notices of appeal.           However, the individual appellants\nfiled their notices of appeal in response to the district court's\n\ngranting of the preliminary injunction.            The individuals' notices\n\nwere then rendered moot by the entry of judgment and a permanent\n\ninjunction.       See Chaparro-Febus v. Int'l Longshoremen Ass'n, 983\n\nF.2d 325, 331 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993) (finding plaintiffs' complaints\n\non appeal concerning denial of preliminary injunction to be moot\n\ngiven final judgment dismissing case).             Accordingly, this Court\n\ndismissed the individuals' appeals.             The individual appellants'\n\nthen moved for rehearing and for consolidation with the United\n\nStates's appeal. We concluded that the consolidation motion served\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fas the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal, was timely\n\nfiled, and thus conferred jurisdiction.       We therefore reinstated\n\nthe individuals' appeal.\n\n                                  II.\n\nA.   Threshold Issues\n\n           Writing as amicus curiae, the American Civil Liberties\n\nUnion of   Rhode   Island   (\"ACLU-RI\")   raises   a   challenge   to   the\njurisdiction of the district court -- and, by extension, this Court\n\n-- over the state's claim of sovereign immunity.           As a general\n\nmatter, we do not consider arguments advanced only by an amicus,\nUnited States v. Sturm, Ruger & Co., 84 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996),\n\nnor do we ordinarily entertain challenges raised for the first time\non appeal, Campos-Orrego v. Rivera, 175 F.3d 89, 95 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   Given the purportedly jurisdictional dimensions of ACLU-\nRI's arguments, however, we shall address them fully.          See In re\n\nHealthco Int'l, Inc., 136 F.3d 45, 50 n.4 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"As in\n\nany other case, we must consider, sua sponte if need be, whether we\npossess subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal.\").\n           ACLU-RI argues that Rhode Island has impermissibly sought\nreview of agency action that is not \"final\" within the meaning of\n\n§ 704 of the APA.       See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (providing for judicial\n\nreview of \"final agency action\").       The APA's finality requirement\n\nallows the agency an opportunity to apply its expertise and correct\n\nits mistakes, it avoids disrupting the agency's processes, and it\n\nrelieves the courts from having to engage in \"piecemeal review\n\nwhich at the least is inefficient and upon completion of the agency\n\n                                  -9-\n\fprocess might prove to have been unnecessary.\" FTC v. Standard Oil\n\nCo., 449 U.S. 232, 242 (1980).\n\n            Courts sometimes have viewed the finality requirement of\nthe APA as being jurisdictional in nature.   See, e.g., DRG Funding\n\nCorp. v. Sec'y of Hous. & Urban Dev., 76 F.3d 1212, 1214 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996). In our view, however, the issue of whether the APA provides\nfor judicial review of the nonfinal ruling is not one that,\n\nprecisely speaking, implicates the subject-matter jurisdiction of\n\nthe court. See Air Courier Conference v. Am. Postal Workers Union,\n\n498 U.S. 517, 523 n.3 (1991) (\"The judicial review provisions of\n\nthe APA are not jurisdictional . . . .\").     Instead, the question\n\nis one of \"[w]hether a cause of action exists\" that permits review\n\nof an agency's interim denial of a state's claim of sovereign\nimmunity.   Id.; cf. Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946) (noting\n\nthat \"it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause\n\nof action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a\ndismissal for want of jurisdiction\").\n\n            Even though the asserted lack of finality does not\ndirectly challenge the subject-matter jurisdiction of the district\n\ncourt, the question of whether the state otherwise has a valid\n\ncause of action is an important one that we address as a threshold\n\nissue.   Rhode Island does not dispute that the administrative\n\nproceedings were not yet final when it brought its claim for\n\ninjunctive relief in the court below.     Instead, the state argues\n\nthat its constitutional claim of immunity finds footing, not in the\n\nAPA, but in the federal court's equitable powers and in the more\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fgeneral grant of federal-question jurisdiction provided by 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1331.\n\n            We agree with the amicus that the ALJ's adverse immunity\ndetermination is not \"final agency action\" within the meaning of\n\nAPA § 704. As the statute states, \"[a] preliminary, procedural, or\n\nintermediate agency action or ruling not directly reviewable is\nsubject to review on the review of the final agency action.\"                    5\n\nU.S.C. § 704.     Thus, we have generally held that a final decision\n\nthat may be reviewed or enforced in federal court is one that\n\nresolves not only the underlying claim, but also the relief to be\n\nafforded if liability is found.           Rivera-Rosario v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nAgric., 151 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 1998).               The state's claim of\n\nimmunity is clearly not accompanied by a final determination on the\nunderlying whistleblower claim.              As such, the claim does not\n\nqualify as \"final\" under the APA.\n\n            That said, we are not convinced that the absence of\n\"final   agency   action\"   renders       the   state's    claim   of   immunity\n\nunreviewable    until   such   time    as    the   Secretary   makes    a   final\n\nliability   determination      on   the     individuals'    claims.      Such   a\n\nconclusion would essentially deprive the state of the very immunity\n\nto which it claims entitlement -- at least insofar as the state\n\nseeks to \"prevent the indignity of [being] subject[ed] . . . to the\n\ncoercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private\n\nparties.\"    In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 505 (1887) (noting that the\n\nright to be free from such proceedings is the \"very object and\n\npurpose\" of sovereign immunity).                And given that the state's\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fasserted immunity is constitutional in scope, see P.R. Aqueduct &\n\nSewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 145 (1993)\n\n(stating that sovereign immunity involves \"a claim to a fundamental\nconstitutional protection\"), we are bound by a strong presumption\n\nin favor of providing the state some vehicle for vindicating its\n\nrights.    See Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 242 (1979) (\"[T]he\n\nclass of those litigants who allege that their own constitutional\n\nrights have been violated, and who at the same time have no\n\neffective means other than the judiciary to enforce these rights,\n\nmust be able to invoke the existing jurisdiction of the courts for\n\nthe protection of their justiciable constitutional rights.\").\n\n            As a general matter, there is no statute expressly\n\ncreating    a   cause     of   action   against    federal      officers      for\nconstitutional or federal statutory violations.          But cf. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 (providing a statutory cause of action for deprivations of\n\nfederal rights against officials acting under color of state law).\nNevertheless, our courts have long recognized that federal officers\n\nmay be sued in their official capacity for prospective injunctive\nrelief to prevent ongoing or future infringements of federal\n\nrights.     See Schneider v. Smith, 390 U.S. 17 (1968); Larson v.\n\nDomestic    &   Foreign    Commerce     Corp.,    337   U.S.        682   (1949);\n\nPhiladelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.S. 605 (1912); see generally\n\nErwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 9.2.2 (3d ed. 1999).\n\nSuch actions are based on the grant of general federal-question\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the inherent equity powers\n\nof   the   federal   courts.     Though    the   existence     of    this   long-\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\frecognized equitable remedy provides a useful backdrop for our\n\nanalysis, it does not entirely dispose of the immediate question\n\nbefore us.    We must determine whether a cause of action exists that\nallows the state to vindicate its claim of sovereign immunity with\n\nrespect to an administrative proceeding where there is no final\n\nreviewable order from the agency.\n             Our examination begins with \"the strong presumption that\n\nCongress intends judicial review of administrative action.\"    Bowen\n\nv. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986).   The\n\npresumption of judicial review \"may be overcome 'only upon a\n\nshowing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative\n\nintent.'\"     Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 542 (1988) (quoting\n\nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967)).       Thus, even\nwhere a litigant is unable to ground his action on either a\n\nspecific or general statutory review provision, judicial relief is\n\nnot necessarily foreclosed.      See id. at 545; Bowen, 476 U.S. at\n\n672. Given the right circumstances, review of agency action may be\n\navailable in federal district court utilizing the procedures of so-\ncalled \"nonstatutory review.\"4     Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74\n\nF.3d 1322, 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see generally Richard H. Fallon\n\net al., Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and The Federal\n\nSystem 995-99 (4th ed. 1996) (discussing the pedigree and evolution\n\nof nonstatutory review).\n\n4\n   The term \"nonstatutory review\" is something of a misnomer, since\nall actions in federal court are based on a statute. See Clark\nByse & Joseph V. Fiocca, Section 1361 of the Mandamus and Venue Act\nof   1962   and   \"Nonstatutory\"   Judicial   Review   of   Federal\nAdministrative Action, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 308, 321 n.51 (1967).\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            The basic premise behind nonstatutory review is that,\n\neven after the passage of the APA, some residuum of power remains\n\nwith the district court to review agency action that is ultra\n\nvires.     See Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217, 224 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1988).     Such claims usually take the form of a suit seeking an\n\ninjunction, often accompanied by a request for relief under the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201.               See Clark Byse &\n\nJoseph V. Fiocca, Section 1361 of the Mandamus and Venue Act of\n\n1962 and \"Nonstatutory\" Judicial Review of Federal Administrative\n\nAction, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 308, 322 (1967).        The nonstatutory review\n\naction finds its jurisdictional toehold in the general grant of\n\nfederal-question jurisdiction of 28 U.S.C. § 1331.            Maxon Marine,\n\nInc. v. Dir. of Office of Workers' Comp. Programs, 39 F.3d 144, 146\n(7th Cir. 1994).\n\n            The   most   notable    example     of   a     court   deploying\n\nnonstatutory review after the passage of the APA can be found in\nLeedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184 (1958).          In Kyne, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that a federal district court had jurisdiction to review a\n\ncertification decision by the National Labor Relations Board that\n\ndirectly    conflicted   with   a   provision   of   the    National   Labor\n\nRelations Act, despite the absence of express authorization of\n\njudicial review of such determinations.         See id. at 188-89.      The\n\nCourt stated that it \"cannot lightly infer that Congress does not\n\nintend judicial protection of rights it confers against agency\n\naction taken in excess of delegated powers.\"             Id. at 190.   Thus,\n\nafter finding that the agency was violating a \"clear\" statutory\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fright, the Kyne Court held that an injunctive remedy to enforce\n\nthat right was available in federal district court under the\n\n\"statutory provisions governing general jurisdiction.\"                            Id.\n\n              Subsequent decisions have noted that Kyne describes a\n\nnarrow exception to the general rule of exhaustion for review of\n\nadministrative action.            See, e.g., Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376\nU.S. 473, 481 (1964).              In particular, the Supreme Court has\n\nemphasized that certain critical factors must be present to invoke\n\nnonstatutory review. One such factor is that the agency's nonfinal\n\naction must        \"wholly   deprive      the    [party]       of    a    meaningful      and\n\nadequate means of vindicating its . . . rights.\"                         Bd. of Governors\n\nof Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin. Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43 (1991).\n\nThe other critical factor is that Congress must not have clearly\nintended      to    preclude       review       of    the      agency's       particular\n\ndetermination.        Id. at 44.        However, the evidence of Congress's\n\nintent to preclude review must be clear and convincing; it is not\nenough for the agency to merely contend \"that a statutory provision\n\nthat provide[s] for judicial review implie[s], by its silence, a\npreclusion of review of the contested determination.\"                         Id.       Where\n\neither   of    these    factors      is     absent,        nonstatutory       review      is\n\nunavailable.       See id.\n\n              Notwithstanding the limited circumstances under which\n\nnonstatutory       review    is    available,         we    find     that    it    was    an\n\nappropriate vehicle for the state's claim of immunity in this case.\n\nRhode Island's claim satisfies the specific limitations placed on\n\nnonstatutory       review    in   the   wake     of    Kyne;    it       satisfies      other\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fconsiderations of equity generally implicated by such claims; and\n\nit involves a constitutional right that is amenable to resolution\n\nby a federal district court.\n             First, it seems beyond cavil that, absent immediate\n\njudicial review, an agency's adverse immunity determination will\n\n\"wholly deprive the [state] of a meaningful and adequate means of\nvindicating its . . . rights.\"                 MCorp, 502 U.S. at 43.              Since the\n\nstate's sovereign rights encompass more than a mere defense from\n\nliability -- they include an immunity from being haled before a\n\ntribunal by private parties -- those rights would be lost without\n\nan early and authoritative ruling.                        See P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer\n\nAuth., 506 U.S. at 145.\n\n            Furthermore,          we   find         no    indication        that       Congress\nspecifically intended to preclude review of the agency's immunity\n\ndeterminations.          The SWDA provides a mechanism for facilitating\n\njudicial review of final determinations of whether an employer has\nunlawfully    retaliated          against      an    employee,        see    42    U.S.C.    §§\n\n6971(b),     6976(b),       and    such     review         procedures        are       normally\n\nconsidered exclusive.             See Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510\n\nU.S. 200, 215 (1994); Whitney Nat'l Bank v. Bank of New Orleans &\n\nTrust Co., 379 U.S. 411, 420 (1965).                      However, an agency's ruling\n\non   the   state's       entitlement      to    sovereign       immunity          is   \"wholly\n\ncollateral    to     a    statute's    review            provisions    and    outside       the\n\nagency's expertise.\" Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 212. We therefore\n\nfind no intention to preclude review.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f               The general equitable considerations that favor relief\n\nbased on a nonstatutory review action are also aligned in Rhode\n\nIsland's favor.        The state's right to relief is premised on a claim\nthat    federal       officials    are   violating           a    clear    right    that   is\n\nconstitutional in nature.              See Hunt v. Commodity Futures Trading\n\nComm'n, 591 F.2d 1234, 1236 (7th Cir. 1979) (\"[I]f an agency would\nviolate a clear right of a petitioner by disregarding a specific\n\nand unambiguous statutory, regulatory, or constitutional directive,\n\na     court    will    not     require    the        petitioners          to   exhaust     his\n\nadministrative remedies and will intervene immediately.\").                                  In\n\naddition, we have already noted that the SWDA's review provisions\n\ndo not allow for immediate review of immunity rulings, and that the\n\nstate's immunity would be effectively lost absent judicial review.\nSee Morales v. Trans World Airlines, 504 U.S. 374, 381 (1992) (\"It\n\nis a basic doctrine of equity jurisprudence that courts of equity\n\nshould not act . . . when the moving party has an adequate remedy\nat law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable\n\nrelief.\") (citations and quotation marks omitted).                             Yet another\nfactor supporting recognition of the state's claim is that its suit\n\nfor    injunctive       relief    involves       a    question         that    is   strictly\n\nconstitutional in scope, and does not require the application of\n\nagency expertise.            Compare Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 109\n\n(1977)    (\"Constitutional         questions          obviously        are     unsuited    to\n\nresolution in administrative hearing procedures and, therefore,\n\naccess    to    the    courts     is   essential        to       the   decision     of    such\n\nquestions.\"), with Weinberger v. Bentex Pharm. Inc., 412 U.S. 645,\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f653 (1973) (declining relief where the issue was \"peculiarly suited\n\nto initial determination\" by the agency).          The state's immunity is\n\na question best addressed by a federal court.\n            Finally,     although   sovereign      immunity     is   generally\n\nasserted in a defensive posture, we believe that the peculiarities\n\nof raising the claim in an administrative proceeding make it\nappropriate to use immunity as a sword (rather than a shield) in an\n\naction for nonstatutory review. There is precedent in this circuit\n\nfor such a proposition.      In United States v. Puerto Rico, 287 F.3d\n\n212 (1st Cir. 2002), we addressed a suit for injunctive and\n\ndeclaratory relief brought by the federal government to protect its\n\nsovereign     interest    against      being   forced   to     appear   in    an\n\nadministrative proceeding of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nThere, we held that the United States had not waived its immunity\n\nin proceedings before the administrative agency and that the\n\nfederal government was entitled to injunctive and declaratory\nrelief consistent with that conclusion.           Id. at 221.    Although the\n\ninstant case involves the sovereign interests of a state entity\n\n(rather than a federal one), we so no reason to foreclose relief on\n\nthat basis.\n\n            We therefore hold that procedures of nonstatutory review\n\npermitted the district court to address the state's immunity claim.\n\nSeveral   district     courts   have    already   enjoined     administrative\n\nwhistleblower    proceedings     under    29   C.F.R.   part    24   that    were\n\ninitiated against a non-consenting state by a private party.                  See\n\nConn. Dep't of Envtl. Prot. v. OSHA, 138 F. Supp. 2d 285 (D. Conn.\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f2001); Florida v. United States, 133 F. Supp. 2d 1280 (N.D. Fla.\n\n2001); Ohio Envtl. Prot. Agency v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 121 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1155 (S.D. Ohio 2000).        Although neither the decision of\nthe court below nor the decisions from other districts expressly\n\nrely on the principles of nonstatutory review, we think that their\n\napproach and reasoning fit squarely within that doctrine.\n               We note, however, that an action before the district\n\ncourt may not be the only equitable means of seeking review of an\n\nagency's ruling with respect to an assertion of sovereign immunity\n\nby a state.        As one prominent authority has stated, \"initial\n\ndistrict court action, followed by appeal to the court of appeals,\n\nseems almost self-defeating; in the rare case that may justify\n\njudicial intervention, it would be better to devise a direct remedy\nin the court of appeals . . . .\"       16 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller & Edward H. Cooper       Federal Practice and Procedure § 3943,\n\nat 815 (3d ed. 1996).\n               Arguably, direct review in the court of appeals would\n\nconform more closely to the judicial review provisions that govern\nliability determinations under the SWDA.          In order to obtain such\n\nreview,    a    petitioner   could   seek   interlocutory   review   of   the\n\nagency's immunity ruling based on an analogy to the collateral\n\norder doctrine.       See Meredith v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health Rev.\n\nComm'n, 177 F.3d 1042, 1046-52 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (employing the\n\ncollateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,\n\n337 U.S. 541 (1949), to review an agency's qualified-immunity\n\nruling).       In clear cases, the petitioning party could also seek a\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fwrit of prohibition as necessary or appropriate in aid of the\n\nappeals court's jurisdiction.       See 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) (the All\n\nWrits Act); see also In re Perry, 859 F.2d 1043, 1046-50 (1st Cir.\n1988) (considering a petition for writ of prohibition against an\n\nadministrative agency).       But in situations such as this, where\n\n\"even good lawyers and good judges may be confused about where\nreview of a particular action should be sought,\" Note, Jurisdiction\n\nto Review Federal Administrative Actions: District Court or Court\n\nof Appeals, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 980, 997-98 (1975) (quotation marks\n\nand footnotes omitted), we take a flexible approach that ensures\n\nthat     litigants   retain   a   practical   opportunity   to   subject\n\nadministrative action to judicial control.\n\n            We conclude that this action was properly before the\ndistrict court and that the action has, in turn, properly arrived\n\nbefore    this panel.5    We therefore turn our attention to the\n\nquestions of whether the district court erred in holding that the\nstate was entitled to sovereign immunity in the administrative\n\nproceedings and whether injunctive relief was an appropriate means\n\nof protecting the state's interests.\n\n\n5\n     The state raises its own threshold challenge to our\njurisdiction, which we address only briefly. Rhode Island contends\nthat this appeal was mooted by our dismissal of the individual\nappellants' earlier appeal from the order granting the preliminary\ninjunction.    However, following our dismissal, the individual\nappellants moved for rehearing and for consolidation with the\nUnited States's appeal.      We treated this as the functional\nequivalent of a notice of appeal and reinstated the individuals'\nappeal.   Although Rhode Island now objects strenuously to our\ndecision, it offers no developed argument challenging our authority\nto reinstate the appeal. The reinstatement of the individuals'\nappeal therefore stands.\n\n                                   -20-\n\fB.   Preliminary injunction\n\n           Under this circuit's formulation, trial courts follow a\n\nfour-part framework in determining whether preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief is appropriate.     The district court considers: first, the\n\nlikelihood that the party requesting the injunction will succeed on\n\nthe merits; second, the potential for irreparable harm if the\n\ninjunction is denied; third, the balance of hardships to the\n\nparties if injunctive relief is either granted or denied; and\n\nfourth, the effect of the court's ruling on the public interest.\n\nRoss-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15\n(1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           We generally review the district court's grant or denial\nof a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.    Id.   This\ndeferential standard, however, applies only to \"issues of judgment\n\nand balancing of conflicting factors,\" and we still review rulings\non abstract legal issues de novo and findings of fact for clear\nerror. Cablevision of Boston, Inc. v. Pub. Improvement Comm'n, 184\n\nF.3d 88, 96 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.\n\nv. Pepsico, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 61 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n           1.   Success on the merits\n\n           Appellants argue that the state has no claim to sovereign\n\nimmunity in the privately prosecuted administrative proceedings at\n\nissue here.     Recently, however, the Supreme Court handed down its\n\ndecision in Federal Maritime Commission v. South Carolina State\n\nPorts Authority, 122 S. Ct. 1864 (2002) (\"SCSPA\").    We think this\n\ndecision fairly disposes of any argument by the appellants that, as\n\n                                 -21-\n\fa general proposition, a state's traditional immunity from suit\n\ndoes    not   extend     to   administrative        proceedings    initiated   and\n\nprosecuted by private citizens.\n              In SCSPA, the Court faced the question of whether state\n\nsovereign immunity precludes the Federal Maritime Commission, an\n\nexecutive-branch administrative agency, from adjudicating a private\nparty's complaint that a state-run port has violated the Shipping\n\nAct of 1984, 46 U. S. C. App. § 1701 et seq.                 After determining\n\nthat the proceedings before the agency very much resembled a civil\n\nlawsuit, the Court held that \"state sovereign immunity bars the\n\n[agency] from adjudicating complaints filed by a private party\n\nagainst a nonconsenting state.\"           SCSPA, 122 S. Ct. at 1874.           The\n\nCourt reasoned:\n              if the Framers thought it an impermissible\n              affront to a State's dignity to be required to\n              answer the complaints of private parties in\n              federal courts, we cannot imagine that they\n              would have found it acceptable to compel a\n              State to do exactly the same thing before the\n              administrative tribunal of an agency . . . .\n\nId.\n\n              Although    SCSPA    involved     a    different     administrative\n\nagency, a different federal statute, and a different scheme of\n\nadministrative adjudication, we see no basis for distinguishing\n\nSCSPA's central holding.          The proceedings under 29 C.F.R. part 24\n\nshare    with    proceedings      under   the   Shipping     Act    the   salient\n\ncharacteristics that led the Supreme Court to determine that such\n\nadjudications were the \"type of proceedings from which the Framers\n\nwould have thought the States possessed immunity when they agreed\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fto enter the Union.\" Id. at 1872.           That is, both proceedings are\n\nadjudicated before an ALJ, whose role is similar to that of a trial\n\njudge, id.; both proceedings are conducted in a manner that roughly\nconforms to the rules of procedure that govern the course of a\n\ntraditional civil lawsuit, id. at 1873-74; and, finally, both\n\nproceedings culminate in a final decision that includes the types\nof relief typically available in civil litigation, see id. at 1874.\n\nWe therefore conclude that a state is generally capable of invoking\n\nsovereign immunity in proceedings initiated by a private party\n\nunder 29 C.F.R. part 24.\n\n              Our inquiry, however, is not entirely at an end.              The\n\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity is subject to numerous exceptions,\n\nsee Alden, 527 U.S. at 755-57 (summarizing the limitations and\nexceptions to the states' sovereign immunity), and both the United\n\nStates and individual appellants contend that one or more of these\n\nexceptions deprive Rhode Island of its immunity in the case at\nhand.   We address these claims in turn.\n\n                    a.    Waiver of immunity\n\n              It has long been recognized that a state's sovereign\nimmunity is \"a personal privilege which [the state] may waive at\n\npleasure.\"       Clark v. Barnard, 108 U.S. 436, 447 (1883); see\n\ngenerally Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 270 F.3d\n17, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing waiver principles), petition\n\nfor   cert.    filed,    70   U.S.L.W.   3669   (U.S.   Apr   15,   2002)   (No.\n01-1545).     However, we do not make a finding of waiver lightly, so\n\nthe \"test for determining whether a State has waived its immunity\n\n                                     -23-\n\ffrom federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one.\"            Atascadero\n\nState Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241 (1985).           We address two\n\npossible bases for finding waiver -- the first argued by the\nindividual appellants, and the second raised by us sua sponte in\n\nlight of another recent decision of the Supreme Court.\n\n            First, in a curious variation on waiver doctrine, the\nindividual appellants make the novel contention that Rhode Island\n\nis a \"partial sovereign,\" unable to invoke the full extent of\n\nsovereign immunity available to other states.              The appellants'\n\nargument begins with the premise that, at the time the United\n\nStates   Constitution   was   ratified,    Rhode   Island    maintained    a\n\nprovision in its colonial charter allowing it to sue or be sued in\n\nthe courts.    Appellants then read the existence of this provision,\nalong with Rhode Island's failure to explicitly reserve the right\n\nto claim sovereign status in subsequent manifestations of its state\n\nconstitution,    as   conclusive   proof   that    Rhode   Island    has   no\nauthority to now claim any degree of sovereign immunity.\n\n            A similar line of reasoning has already been considered\n\nand rejected by the Supreme Court.         In the dissenting opinion in\n\nAlden, Justice Souter seized upon the historical experience of\n\nRhode Island as proof that the concept of sovereign immunity\n\nremained unsettled at the time of the Constitution's ratification.\n\nSee Alden, 527 U.S. at 769-70 (Souter, J., dissenting).             However,\n\nAlden's majority opinion drew a wholly different conclusion from\n\nthe existence of sue-or-be-sued provisions in the charters of some\n\ncolonies.     As the Court stated,\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f           The   handful    of   state    statutory   and\n           constitutional provisions authorizing suits or\n           petitions of right against States only\n           confirms the prevalence of the traditional\n           understanding that a State could not be sued\n           in the absence of an express waiver, for if\n           the   understanding   were    otherwise,   the\n           provisions would have been unnecessary.\nId. at 724.    The majority opinion also noted that any argument that\n\nRhode Island did not recognize its own sovereign status is further\n\nbelied   by    Rhode   Island's   proclamation   in   its     ratification\n\nconvention that \"'[i]t is declared by the Convention, that the\n\njudicial power of the United States, in cases in which a state may\n\nbe a party, does not extend to criminal prosecutions, or to\n\nauthorize any suit by any person against a state.'\"            Alden, 527\nU.S. at 718 (quoting 1 Jonathan Elliot, Debates on the Federal\n\nConstitution 336 (2d ed. 1854)).\n\n           If the analysis of the Alden majority were not potent\nenough, two additional factors counsel in favor of rejecting this\n\nnovel waiver argument. First, the argument depends almost entirely\n\non the existence of a provision merely allowing Rhode Island to sue\n\nor be sued in its own courts.       The Supreme Court has repeatedly\nheld that such provisions are insufficient to waive the state's\n\nimmunity from suit in a federal forum.        See, e.g., College Sav.\n\nBank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666,\n\n676 (1999); Atascadero State Hosp., 473 U.S. at 241; Fla. Dep't of\n\nHealth & Rehab. Servs. v. Fla. Nursing Home Ass'n, 450 U.S. 147,\n\n150   (1981)   (per    curiam).    Second,   although   the    individual\n\nappellants contend that, under the state's organic law, Rhode\n\nIsland has never been entitled to sovereign immunity, the highest\n\n                                  -25-\n\fcourt of the state has long recognized that, absent statutory\n\nabrogation, Rhode Island adheres strictly to the doctrine of\n\nsovereign immunity. See Laird v. Chrysler Corp., 460 A.2d 425, 428\n(R.I. 1983); see also Becker v. Beaudoin, 261 A.2d 896, 901-02\n\n(R.I. 1970) (abolishing the doctrine of municipal immunity but\n\nemphasizing that \"it is to be understood that this decision does\nnot in any manner abolish or limit the sovereign immunity that\n\ninheres in the state itself\").    For these reasons, we decline to\n\nadopt the individual appellants' proposal that we recognize a\n\n\"Rhode Island exception\" to the general principles of sovereign\n\nimmunity embedded in the structure of the Constitution.6\n\n6\n   We have previously held that Rhode Island General Laws § 9-31-1\neffects a broad waiver of Rhode Island's sovereign immunity for\ncertain claims in federal court. Della Grotta v. Rhode Island, 781\nF.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir. 1986); see also Laird, 460 A.2d at 429-30\n(holding that § 9-31-1 waives the state's Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity with regard to \"actions in tort\").         The individual\nappellants argued before the district court that § 9-31-1 also\nwaived any immunity the state might have in the administrative\nproceedings.   The district court rejected this statutory waiver\nargument, reasoning that the whistleblower proceedings before the\nALJ did not qualify as an \"action[] in tort\" within the meaning of\nthe waiver statute.    Rhode Island, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 276-78.\nAlthough this statutory waiver argument strikes us as at least more\npromising than the other waiver arguments presented on appeal, the\nindividual appellants' only attempt to preserve the issue consists\nof a single footnote in their appellate brief purporting to\n\"incorporate their statutory waiver argument by reference\" to a\nbrief filed before the court below. We deem the argument to have\nbeen forfeited. Gilday v. Callahan, 59 F.3d 257, 273 n.23 (1st\nCir. 1995).    Filing a brief that merely adopts by reference a\nmemorandum previously filed in the district court does not comply\nwith the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. See Fed. R. App. P.\n28(a)(6) (providing that argument must contain appellant's\ncontentions and reasons therefor, with citations to authorities).\nMoreover, it is a practice \"that has been consistently and roundly\ncondemned by the Courts of Appeals,\" Cray Communications, Inc. v.\nNovatel Computer Sys., Inc., 33 F.3d 390, 396 n.6 (4th Cir. 1994),\nand litigants in this circuit would be well advised to avoid it in\nthe future.\n\n                                 -26-\n\f           In order to assess a second possible ground for waiver,\n\nwe asked the parties the question of whether, in light of the\n\nSupreme Court's recent decision in Lapides v. Board of Regents of\n\nthe University System of Georgia, 122 S. Ct. 1640 (2002), the state\n\nwaived its immunity by filing an action in federal district court.\n\nRhode Island and the United States both agree that the Lapides\n\ndecision is inapplicable.        However, the individual appellants\n\ndisagree and contend that the state's litigation conduct did indeed\n\nstrip it of its immunity from suit.\n\n           In Lapides, the plaintiff brought suit in state court\n\nagainst an arm of the state of Georgia, alleging violations of\n\nstate and federal law.       The state entity removed the case to\n\nfederal court, and then moved to dismiss, asserting that it was\nimmune from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted that by removing the case the state entity\n\n\"voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court,\" id. at\n\n1645 (emphasis in original).       Accordingly, the Court held that\n\n\"removal is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court's\njurisdiction   sufficient   to   waive   the   State's   otherwise   valid\n\nobjection to litigation of a matter . . . in a federal forum.\"         Id.\n\nat 1646.\n\n           The individual appellants read Lapides broadly to mean\n\nthat a state waives its immunity by voluntarily participating in\n\nany facet of a federal adjudicative proceeding.          In the words of\n\nthe individual appellants:\n\n           Rhode Island has engaged in a form of \"Russian\n           roulette\" . . . .         It acceded to the\n\n                                  -27-\n\f            Administrative forum when it thought it could\n            dispose of the case, and then reverted to a\n            sovereign immunity defense after completing\n            discovery, including depositions, issuance of\n            subpoena, nineteen days of hearing before an\n            [ALJ], and then was hit with an adverse\n            decision. Adopting sovereign immunity at such\n            a late point in the litigation is to wrongly\n            seek \"an unfair tactical advantage.\"\n\nIndividual Appellants' Supp. Br. at 6 (quoting Lapides, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 1644).    According to the individual appellants, the state could\n\nhave preserved its immunity only by failing to appear before the\n\nALJ and refusing to participate in the administrative proceedings\n\nentirely.    See id. at 16.\n\n            This approach to waiver is startling in its breadth and,\n\nmore   importantly,    appears   to   conflict    directly   with   well\n\nestablished principles of law.    It has repeatedly been held that a\nstate may raise its immunity from suit at any time during the\n\nproceedings, including on appeal.       See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S.\n\n651, 677-78 (1974); Larson v. United States, 274 F.3d 643, 648 (1st\nCir. 2001) (per curiam); Paul N. Howard Co. v. P.R. Aqueduct &\n\nSewer Auth., 744 F.2d 880, 886 (1st Cir. 1984).         This venerable\n\nline of cases cannot be reconciled with the individual appellants'\n\nreasoning, under which a state would waive its immunity by doing\n\nnothing more than filing an answer to a complaint and conducting\n\ndiscovery.    The Supreme Court gave no indication that its decision\n\nin Lapides would upset such established precedent.            And as a\n\npractical matter, the individual appellants' approach to waiver is\n\nsimply untenable, as it encourages states to assert their immunity\n\nby means of extra-judicial \"self help,\" rather than through the\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fjudicial channels that have been established by years of settled\n\ncaselaw.    We therefore decline to adopt the individual appellants'\n\nreasoning.\n            There is, however, another reading of Lapides -- one that\n\nis not so expansive as the individual appellants' approach, but\n\nexpansive nonetheless -- that might also be implicated here.            One\ncould argue that the state, by invoking the federal jurisdiction of\n\nthe district court in a nonstatutory review action, thereby waived\n\nits claimed immunity in the administrative proceedings.                 See\n\nLapides, 122 S. Ct. at 1644 (\"[T]he Court has made clear in general\n\nthat 'where a State voluntarily becomes a party to a cause and\n\nsubmits its rights for judicial determination, it will be bound\n\nthereby and cannot escape the result of its own voluntary act by\ninvoking the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment.'\") (quoting\n\nGunter v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 200 U.S. 273, 284 (1906)).\n\n            Although it is something of a close question, we do not\nread Lapides to effect a waiver of Rhode Island's immunity in this\n\ncase.      We   discern   several   critical   distinctions   between   the\n\nsituation presented here and the one presented to the Supreme Court\n\nin Lapides.       To begin with, the state entity in Lapides had\n\n\"explicitly waived immunity from state-court proceedings\" on the\n\nsame claims in respect to which it then sought immunity protection\n\nin federal court.     122 S. Ct. at 1643.      It is reasonably apparent\n\nthat the Supreme Court should be troubled by such an attempt to\n\nregain, by a change in forum, litigation advantage that the state\n\nhas already renounced by a general statute.        See Lapides v. Bd. of\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fRegents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 251 F.3d 1372, 1375 n.2 (11th Cir.\n\n2001) (noting Georgia's statutory waiver with respect to the state\n\ntort claims in state court), rev'd, 122 S. Ct. 1640 (2002).               Rhode\nIsland, by contrast, was undoubtably entitled to immunity when the\n\nproceedings were first brought before the ALJ.             See SCSPA, 122 S.\n\nCt. at 1879.       And, because we reject the individual appellants'\nargument that Rhode Island had waived immunity by its conduct in\n\nthe administrative proceeding, we consequently discern no attempt\n\nby the state to reverse its waiver by a change in forum.                Rather,\n\nRhode Island has consistently asserted its sovereign immunity, both\n\nhere and in the administrative proceeding.\n\n            Second, Rhode Island invoked the aid of the federal\n\ncourts in an entirely new and different proceeding than the one in\nwhich it sought immunity. The removal of the state-court action in\n\nLapides was merely a continuation of the same proceeding in a\n\ndifferent forum.\n            Third,        Rhode Island brought its claim in federal court\n\nfor the     sole    and    exclusive   purpose   of   obtaining   an   immunity\ndetermination for the underlying whistleblower claims that remained\n\npending before the administrative agency. In Lapides, however, the\n\nstate entity moved the parties' entire dispute to federal court for\n\na determination on all of the claims at issue.\n\n            We     find    these   distinguishing     characteristics,    taken\n\ntogether, to place this case outside the reach of Lapides. Finding\n\nwaiver here would not advance the policies that ordinarily motivate\n\nthe rule.    \"In large part the rule governing voluntary invocations\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fof   federal    jurisdiction       has    rested      upon     the    problems    of\n\ninconsistency and unfairness that a contrary rule of law would\n\ncreate.\"     Lapides, 122 S. Ct. at 1645.             In this case, the state\ninvoked the     district    court's      aid,   not   to     obtain    an   unseemly\n\nlitigation advantage, but to clarify its entitlement to sovereign\n\nimmunity where the agency's rules provided no means for doing so.\nThus,   if    consistency   and    fairness     are     our    guideposts,       such\n\nconsiderations point away from finding waiver.\n\n             It would be a great irony for us to hold that a state\n\nwaives its sovereign immunity solely by seeking judicial review of\n\nan   agency's    adverse    (and    incorrect)        immunity       determination,\n\nespecially since there is \"a strong presumption that Congress\n\nintends judicial review of administrative action.\" Bowen, 476 U.S.\n\nat 670.      So extending Lapides would have the perverse effect of\n\ncompletely depriving the state of a primary benefit of sovereign\n\nimmunity no matter what course it chooses.                   If the state cannot\nseek an interim judicial determination of immunity without waiving\n\nthat very immunity, the state is constrained to participate in the\nproceedings all the way to their termination.                    While the state\n\nmight be able to assert its immunity upon judicial review of the\n\nagency's final order, by that time the protections of sovereign\n\nimmunity will have been reduced to a mere defense from liability.\n\nSee P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth., 506 U.S. at 145 (\"[T]he value to\n\nthe States of their [sovereign] immunity . . . is for the most part\n\nlost as litigation proceeds past motion practice.\"); accord SCSPA,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 1877.     To be sure, we have observed that litigation\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fmay sometimes present the state with a difficult choice as to\n\nwhether immunity should be waived.           See WJM, Inc. v. Mass. Dep't of\n\nPub.   Welfare,   840   F.2d   996,    1004-05    (1st     Cir.   1988)   (\"[A]n\neffective waiver [of sovereign immunity] . . . may occur even when\n\nthe waiving party is between a rock and a hard place.\") (citations\n\nomitted).    But the waiver doctrine still requires the state to be\nable to make some choice, and using Lapides to deprive the state of\n\nits immunity in this case would allow the state no choice at all.\n\n            Finally, waiver occasioned by the state's litigation\n\nconduct -- a principle that was well established in this circuit\n\nprior to the Supreme Court's decision in Lapides7 -- was not raised\n\nby any of the appellants before the district court or before this\n\nCourt.     Claims of waiver of immunity are like any other legal\nargument    and   may   themselves     be    waived   or   forfeited      if   not\n\nseasonably asserted.     See In re Gosselin, 276 F.3d 70, 72 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (holding that litigant's argument that a state waived its\nEleventh Amendment immunity was not timely raised); see also\n\nMartinez v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice, No. 00-51135, 2002 WL\n\n1721803, at *6 (5th Cir. July 25, 2002) (holding that litigant\n\nforfeited any claim to Lapides-type waiver by failing to raise the\n\nissue below). We therefore find no waiver of the state's immunity.\n\n\n7\n   See Newfield House, Inc. v. Mass. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 651\nF.2d 32, 36 n.3 (1st Cir. 1981) (holding that a state entity waived\nits Eleventh Amendment immunity by having the case removed to\nfederal court); see also Arecibo Cmty. Health Care, 270 F.3d at 27\n(holding that Puerto Rico waived its sovereign immunity by filing\na claim with the bankruptcy court); Paul N. Howard, 744 F.2d at 886\n(holding that agency of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico waived its\nimmunity by filing a counterclaim and a third-party complaint).\n\n                                      -32-\n\f                   b.     Congressional abrogation\n\n          A     state's    sovereign   immunity     may   be    abrogated    by\n\ncongressional enactment, Alden, 527 U.S. at 756,                provided that\n\nCongress expresses its unequivocal intention to do so and acts\n\npursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority. Laro v. New\n\nHampshire, 259 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Bd. of Trs. of\n\nthe Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363 (2001).                   While\n\nCongress may not base its abrogation of immunity upon the powers\n\nenumerated in Article I, it may subject non-consenting states to\n\nsuit when legislating pursuant to a valid exercise of power under\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.8       Laro, 259 F.3d at 5; see\n\nalso Garrett, 531 U.S. at 363-64.\n          The    individual    appellants   argue    that      Rhode   Island's\nimmunity from suit has been abrogated because the whistleblower\n\nprovisions of the SWDA were enacted pursuant to Section 5.              Such an\nabrogation analysis is incomplete.          Certainly, the individual\nappellants have a colorable argument that the SWDA's whistleblower\n\nprovisions were enacted to safeguard First Amendment rights that\n\n\n\n8\n   Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress the power\nto enforce the substantive guarantees contained in § 1 of the\nFourteenth Amendment by enacting \"appropriate legislation.\"\nSection 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part:\n\n     No state shall make or enforce any law which shall\n     abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\n     United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of\n     life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;\n     nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\n     protection of the laws.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\n\n                                   -33-\n\fhave long been made applicable to states through the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.     See Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 574-75\n\n(1968) (holding that the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect\nthe right of public employees to speak on matters of public\n\nconcern).     But in order to determine whether a federal statute\n\nproperly exposes states to suits by individuals, we must also apply\na \"simple but stringent test: Congress may abrogate the States'\n\nconstitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only\n\nby making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the\n\nstatute.\"     Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 73 (2000)\n\n(citations and quotation marks omitted).          On this account, we find\n\nthe individual appellants' argument wanting.\n\n             The individual appellants point to nothing in the Act\nindicating that Congress clearly expressed an intention to abrogate\n\nthe states' immunity.       Nor, in reviewing the language of the SWDA\n\nourselves, do we find any provision of the Act that remotely\npurports to abrogate the states' immunity.           The only provision of\n\nthe Act addressing the question of sovereign immunity mandates that\n\ncitizen civil suits under 42 U.S.C. § 6972 may enforce the Act's\n\nsubstantive    provisions    only   \"to    the   extent   permitted   by   the\n\neleventh amendment to the Constitution.\"          Id. § 6972(a)(1)(A).      If\n\nanything, this section indicates that Congress had no intention to\n\ndisturb the states' traditional immunity from suit.            We therefore\n\nfind no abrogation.9\n\n9\n   Because we conclude that Congress did not unequivocally express\nan intention to subject the states to suits by private individuals,\nwe need not address a remaining inquiry under Section 5 of the\n\n                                    -34-\n\f                    d.     Ex parte Young exception\n\n          Lastly, the appellants argue that, in accordance with the\n\ndoctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), there is no\n\nimpediment   to    the   administrative    adjudication    insofar    as   the\n\ncomplainants are seeking prospective equitable relief, such as\n\nreinstatement.     Under our precedent, \"[i]t is quite true that Ex\n\nparte   Young     avoids    the   [sovereign   immunity]    defense    where\n\nprospective injunctive relief, not involving damages or property\n\ntransfer, is sought against named state officials for a violation\n\nof federal law.\"      Neo Gen Screening, Inc. v. New England Newborn\nScreening Program, 187 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing Idaho v.\n\nCoeur d'Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. 261, 276-77 (1997)).\n          In this case, the individual appellants contend that they\nhave satisfied the Ex parte Young predicates: they named their\n\nmanagers at DEM in their administrative complaints; and they sought\nprospective equitable relief.       If these conditions have truly been\nmet, the complaint might not be barred by sovereign immunity.10 Cf.\n\nFlorida, 133 F. Supp. 2d at 1291-92 (allowing administrative\n\n\n\nFourteenth Amendment, namely, whether the SWDA's whistleblower\nprovision creates the necessary \"congruence and proportionality\nbetween the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end.\" City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520\n(1997).\n10\n   We express no view as to whether an employee filing a complaint\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 6971 may also seek monetary relief against a\nstate official named in his individual capacity.     Cf. Hafer v.\nMelo, 502 U.S. 21, 30-31 (1991) (holding that a state officer sued\nin his individual capacity may be held personally liable for\ndamages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based upon actions taken in his\nofficial capacity).\n\n                                    -35-\n\fwhistleblower claims for injunctive relief to proceed against\n\nindividuals named in their official capacity).                 But we cannot\n\nproperly     assess    the    argument   here    because      the   individual\nappellants' brief contains no sustained argument in support of\n\ntheir claim and the record provides nothing conclusive.11 See Mass.\n\nSch. of Law v. Am. Bar. Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).            We\ntherefore find that Ex parte Young does not, in this instance,\n\ncircumvent the state's immunity.\n\n                      e.   Role of the federal government\n\n            \"In ratifying the Constitution, the States consented to\nsuits brought by . . . the Federal Government.\"            Alden, 527 U.S. at\n\n755 (citing Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313,\n328-29 (1934)).       Thus, sovereign immunity is no barrier to a suit\ninitiated by the United States, even where the relief sought is\n\nmonetary in nature.        Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S.\n\n44, 71 n.14 (1996); see also United States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621,\n\n644-45 (1892) (finding the power of the federal government to bring\n\nsuit against states necessary to \"the permanence of the Union\").\n            The individual appellants argue first that the ARB, the\nbody that directly reviews the decision of the ALJ, exercises\n\nsufficient    political      responsibility     to   negate   Rhode   Island's\nimmunity.    In support of this contention, they point to the fact\n\n\n11\n   We note, however, that Rhode Island asserts that the complaints\ndid not name any individuals in their official capacity -- an\nassertion that is not challenged by the United States. Moreover,\nthere is no dispute that the individual appellants sought monetary\nrelief in addition to their prayers for reinstatement. See Rhode\nIsland, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 271.\n\n                                    -36-\n\fthat the ARB's constituent members are each appointed by the\n\nSecretary of Labor, an executive branch official.\n\n           We find the mere nature of the ARB members' appointment\ninsufficient   to   defeat    sovereign   immunity.   The    governing\n\nregulations clearly establish that the ARB reviews the decision of\n\nthe ALJ only for the limited purpose of determining whether a\nviolation of the law occurred.     29 C.F.R. § 24.8(d)(1).    Once the\n\nARB makes this determination, its course of action is limited: if\n\nthe violation occurred, the ARB must order appropriate relief, id.\n\n§ 24.8(d)(1) & (2); if no violation occurred, it must issue an\n\norder denying the complaint, id. § 24.8(e).       There is nothing in\n\nthe role defined for the ARB to suggest that its members may weigh\n\nthe greater policy implications of affirming the ALJ's decision or\ndenying the complaint.       Thus, the presence of the ARB does not\n\naffect the sovereign immunity calculus.\n\n           Individual appellants next claim that the Secretary,\nrather than the individual complainant, is the \"true\" plaintiff in\n\nany administrative proceeding under 29 C.F.R. part 24.       Thus, they\n\ncontend that Rhode Island's sovereign immunity is inapplicable\n\nbecause the whistleblower claim proceedings are subject to the\n\n\"exercise of political responsibility [by the federal government]\n\nfor each suit prosecuted against a State, a control which is absent\n\nfrom a broad delegation to private persons to sue nonconsenting\n\nStates.\"   Alden, 527 U.S. at 756.\n\n           It is obvious from the regulatory scheme and governing\n\nAPA provisions that the administrative adjudication is not directed\n\n\n                                  -37-\n\for   prosecuted   by   the   Secretary.    Instead,   the   individual\n\ncomplainant tries a case against the employer, and the Secretary\n\n(through the ALJ) acts as the neutral arbiter of law and fact.    See\n\nButz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 513 (1978) (\"[T]he [ALJ] exercises\n\nhis independent judgment on the evidence before him, free from\n\npressures by . . . other officials within the agency.\").      There is\nsimply    no   basis   for    construing   the   privately-prosecuted\n\nwhistleblower claims at issue here as implicating the exercise of\n\npolitical responsibility by the federal government.12\n           We pause, however, to make one important observation.\n\nThe governing regulations provide that the Secretary may, at any\n\ntime, intervene in the proceedings before the ALJ as a party or\n\namicus. 29 C.F.R. § 24.6(f)(1). Generally speaking, if the United\nStates joins a suit after it has been initiated by otherwise-barred\n\nprivate parties and seeks the same relief as the private parties,\n\nthis generally cures any Eleventh Amendment or sovereign immunity\ndefect, and the private parties may continue to participate in the\n\nsuit.    See Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota, 124\n\nF.3d 904, 913 (8th Cir. 1997), aff'd, 526 U.S. 172 (1999); Seneca\n\nNation of Indians v. New York, 178 F.3d 95, 97 (2d Cir. 1999) (per\n\n12\n   The United States originally argued that the federal exercise\nof political responsibility necessary to avoid sovereign immunity\ncould be found in the Secretary's ultimate decision whether to seek\nenforcement of her order in court. In the wake of SCSPA, it is\nclear that such an argument is a non-starter. As the SCSPA Court\nstated, \"The Attorney General's decision to bring an enforcement\naction against a State after the conclusion of the [agency's]\nproceedings . . . does not retroactively convert an [agency]\nadjudication initiated and pursued by a private party into one\ninitiated and pursued by the Federal Government.\" 122 S. Ct. at\n1876.\n\n                                  -38-\n\fcuriam).   Thus, our holding does not preclude the Secretary from\n\nintervening in the enjoined proceedings and removing the sovereign\n\nimmunity bar.      See Ohio Envtl. Prot. Agency, 121 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n1167.   To the extent the district court's injunction does not\n\npermit the Secretary to take such action, we modify the injunction\n\naccordingly.13\n           Notwithstanding this single caveat, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict   court    was   correct   to     hold   that   Rhode   Island   has\n\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.              The states'\n\nimmunity from suit embedded in the structure of the Constitution\n\nextends to adversary administrative proceedings that are prosecuted\n\nagainst an unconsenting state by a private party.            See SCSPA, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 1879.     And in this case, the appellants have advanced no\narguments that persuade us that a recognized exception to the\n\nimmunity doctrine is applicable.\n\n           2.    Other preliminary injunction factors\n\n           The individual appellants challenge the district court's\n\nrulings on each of the remaining preliminary injunction factors.\nBecause we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in evaluating any of the factors, we address these\n\narguments only briefly.\n           The appellants first argue that the state failed to\ndemonstrate that it would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of\n\n\n13\n   We also note, in agreement with the district court, that OSHA\nis not enjoined from receiving complaints, conducting its own\ninvestigations on such complaints, and making determinations as to\nliability under 29 C.F.R. § 24.4(d)(1).\n\n                                    -39-\n\fan injunction.       Such an argument downplays a fundamental aspect of\n\nthe state's sovereign immunity.               As we have already observed, the\n\nstate's immunity is not merely a defense from liability; it is a\nsafeguard against being subjected to \"the coercive process of\n\njudicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.\"                          In re\n\nAyers, 123 U.S. at 505.            If a state cannot assert its immunity in\nthe earliest stages of the adjudication, much of the benefit\n\nconferred by that immunity is irretrievably lost.                  P.R. Aqueduct &\n\nSewer Auth., 506 U.S. at 145.\n\n             As     for    the     balance    of   hardships,     the    individual\n\nappellants contend that their interests in gaining relief on their\n\nwhistleblower claims outweigh the state's sovereign interests.\n\nAlthough we sympathize greatly with the appellants' stymied efforts\nto vindicate their rights, the Supreme Court has demonstrated on\n\nseveral occasions that employees' federal statutory rights may, in\n\nsome circumstances, be subordinated to the sovereign interests of\nthe states.       See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 360 (holding that sovereign\n\nimmunity     bars    state       employees'    claims   under    Title     I    of   the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117); Kimel,\n\n528   U.S.   at     67    (same    with   regard   to   claims     under       the   Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634); Alden, 527\n\nU.S. at 712 (same with regard to claims under the Fair Labor\n\nStandards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219).\n\n             Lastly, the individual appellants argue that the issuance\n\nof an injunction runs counter to the public interest in protecting\n\nwhistleblowers and promoting clean government.                  The district court\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\ftook these important interests into account, balanced them against\n\nthe competing interests of federalism, and concluded that the\n\nissuance of the injunction did not offend the overall public\ninterest.     We discern no abuse of discretion in the court's\n\nconclusion.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            The   order   of    the     district     court   enjoining       the\n\nadministrative    proceedings    before      the   Department   of   Labor    is\n\nmodified to allow the Secretary of Labor, if she so chooses, to\n\nintervene in the proceedings before the ALJ, thereby curing any\nsovereign immunity bar.         In all other respects, the district\n\ncourt's order is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\f",

The State of Rhode Island\n\nbrought suit in the district court seeking to enjoin certain\n\nfederal    administrative       proceedings      on    the    ground   that    the\n\nproceedings infringed upon the state's constitutionally protected\n\nsovereign interests.

The\n\nUnited    States    and   individual    employees      now    appeal   the    order\nentering the injunction.\n\n            After fully considering the parties' contentions, which\nwere ably briefed and very well argued, we affirm the judgment of\nthe district court, with only slight modification to its order.\n\n                                       I.\n\nA.   Statutory Background\n\n            The Solid Waste Disposal Act (\"SWDA\" or \"Act\"), 23 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 6901-6992k, is a comprehensive environmental enactment designed\n\nto promote the reduction of hazardous waste and the treatment,\n\nstorage, or disposal of such waste so as to minimize threats to\n\nhuman health and the environment.            Id. § 6902(b).\n\n            The Act contains a whistleblower provision that prohibits\nan employer from firing or otherwise discriminating against an\n\nemployee   who     initiates    or   testifies    in    a    proceeding   brought\npursuant to the Act.           Id. § 6971(a).          The Act establishes an\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fadministrative scheme by which an employee who believes that he was\n\nthe victim of a retaliatory adverse employment action may seek\n\nreview of the employer's decision by the Secretary of Labor.1                    See\n\n29 C.F.R. pt. 24.\n\n               1.    Initial investigation\n\n               Under this administrative scheme, an employee may, within\n\nthirty days of the alleged retaliation, apply to the Secretary of\n\nLabor for a review of the firing or alleged discrimination.                      42\n\nU.S.C.    §    6971(b).         The   Act   directs    the   Secretary    of   Labor\n\n(\"Secretary\"), upon receiving such an application, to cause an\ninvestigation to be made as the Secretary deems appropriate.                     Id.\n\nBy regulation, an initial investigation is conducted by the Office\nof the Assistant Secretary of the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (\"OSHA\").              29 C.F.R. § 24.4(b).       The regulations\n\nauthorize OSHA, in the course of this investigation, to enter and\ninspect       places      and   records,    question   persons   who     are   being\nproceeded against and other employees of the charged employer, and\n\nrequire the production of any documentary or other evidence deemed\nnecessary to determine whether a violation of the law has been\ncommitted.          Id.   Within thirty days of receipt of the employee's\n\n\n\n\n1\n   The same administrative enforcement mechanism applies to the\nwhistleblower provisions in several other environmental statutes.\nSee 29 C.F.R. § 24.1; see also 15 U.S.C. § 2622 (Toxic Substances\nControl Act); 33 U.S.C. § 1367 (Water Pollution Control Act); 42\nU.S.C. § 300j-9 (Safe Drinking Water Act); 42 U.S.C. § 5851 (Energy\nReorganization Act); 42 U.S.C. § 7622 (Clean Air Act); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9610 (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and\nLiability Act).\n\n                                            -3-\n\fapplication, OSHA must complete the investigation and determine\n\nwhether a violation has occurred.                Id. § 24.4(d)(1).\n\n               2.    Opportunity for an administrative hearing\n\n               The statute requires the Secretary to provide, on request\n\nof either party, an opportunity for a hearing to enable the parties\n\nto present information relating to the alleged violation.                        42\n\nU.S.C.     §    6971(b).        Upon     such     a   request,      OSHA's   initial\n\ndetermination becomes inoperative, 29 C.F.R. § 24.4(d)(2), and the\n\nmatter is assigned to an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") within\n\nthe Department of Labor, id. § 24.6(a).                A hearing before the ALJ\nis conducted in accordance with the formal hearing provisions of\n\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), set forth at 5 U.S.C.\n§ 554.         42 U.S.C. § 6971(b).             The employer and employee are\nentitled to be represented by counsel at the hearing, present\n\nevidence on their behalf, and, upon request, present oral argument\nand file a prehearing brief or other written statement of fact or\nlaw.     29 C.F.R. §§ 24.6(d), (e)(1)-(3).              At her discretion, the\n\nSecretary may intervene in the matter as a party or amicus curiae\nat any time during the proceedings.                Id. § 24.6(f)(1).\n\n               At the end of the hearing, the ALJ issues a recommended\n\ndecision.           Id. § 24.7(a).       If the ALJ finds in favor of the\ncomplainant, a recommended order that includes a recommendation as\nto appropriate relief is issued.                Id. § 24.7(c)(1).\n\n               The ALJ's recommended decision becomes final unless a\npetition for review is filed with the Administrative Review Board\n\n(\"ARB\"),       id.    §   24.7(d),   a   body    to   which   the    Secretary   has\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdelegated the authority to issue final decisions, id. § 24.8(a).\n\nThe ARB is composed of three members, each of whom is appointed by\n\nthe Secretary for a term not to exceed two years.               See Authority\nand Responsibilities of the Administrative Review Board, 61 Fed.\n\nReg. 19,978, 19,789 (May 3, 1996).\n\n           The ARB reviews the decision of the ALJ to determine\nwhether a violation of the law occurred.            29 C.F.R. § 24.8(d)(1).\n\nIf the ARB determines that a violation did occur, it shall order\n\nthe party charged to take \"appropriate affirmative action to abate\n\nthe   violation,\"         including   reinstating    the    complainant     and\n\ncompensating the complainant for back pay and other compensatory\n\ndamages.     Id.    The ARB, at the request of the complainant, shall\n\nalso award attorney fees and costs.           Id. § 24.8(d)(2); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 6971(c).      If the ARB concludes that no violation occurred, it\n\nmust issue an order denying the complaint.            29 C.F.R. § 24.8(e).\n\n           3.      Enforcement of the Secretary's orders\n\n           Unlike a court, the Secretary does not have inherent\n\nauthority to issue enforceable orders, and the SWDA does not give\nthe Secretary the power of contempt, mandamus, or the like.               Thus,\nany enforcement of the Secretary's orders must occur in court.\n\nSpecifically,       the    Act   directs    that    the    Secretary's    final\ndeterminations under the whistleblower provisions are subject to\nreview in the court of appeals in accordance with judicial review\n\nprovisions of the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.

Administrative proceedings\n\n           The State of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Department\n\nof Environmental Management (\"DEM\") brought this action to enjoin\n\nfour separate administrative proceedings brought pursuant to the\nwhistleblower provision of the SWDA.2     The complainants in these\n\nproceedings were DEM employees Beverly Migliore, Barbara Raddatz,\n\nand Joan Taylor (the \"individual appellants\").     They each allege\nthat the state agency retaliated against them for reporting what\nthe employees believed to be an improper implementation of the\nSWDA.   See Rhode Island v.

Migliore also filed a second charge based on her\nallegation that DEM had retaliated against her for initiating the\nfirst proceeding.    Id. at 271.    The relief that each complainant\n\nsought included monetary and injunctive relief.     Id.\n\n           The four proceedings were at different stages when the\ndistrict court enjoined further action.         In Migliore's first\nproceeding, an ALJ had issued a recommended decision awarding her\n\n$843,000 in monetary relief, and the DEM filed a petition with the\n\nARB for review of the ALJ's decision.     Id. at 272.   In the second\n\n\n2\n    The state asserted in the administrative proceedings that\nsovereign immunity barred the individuals' claims, but its\nentreaties were rejected by the ALJ. The regulations governing the\nproceedings provide no formal mechanism for interlocutory review of\nimmunity determinations.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fproceeding initiated by Migliore, OSHA had issued an order awarding\n\nMigliore $10,000 in monetary relief, and the DEM requested a\n\nhearing before an ALJ.        Id. In the proceeding initiated by Barbara\n\nRaddatz, OSHA found no violation, and Raddatz requested a hearing\n\nbefore an ALJ.       Id.   Joan Taylor's allegations were still under\n\ninvestigation when the district court's injunction issued.3                 Id.\n\n          2.    Proceedings in the district court\n\n          In ruling on Rhode Island's motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction,    the   district     court       held   that   the   administrative\n\nproceedings were barred by sovereign immunity principles.                       The\ncourt observed that in Alden v.

The district court\nconcluded that the same reasoning applied to federal administrative\nproceedings.    In the court's view, the Secretary could investigate\n\nalleged violations of federal law and determine appropriate relief,\nbut the Secretary could not rely on privately prosecuted adversary\nproceedings in making that determination.                Id. at 274.\n\n\n\n3\n  OSHA subsequently found that Taylor's allegations had merit, and\nthe DEM requested a hearing which, due to the injunction, has not\ntaken place.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f            The court entered a preliminary injunction barring any\n\nfurther   prosecution       before    the    Department    of   Labor    of    the\n\nemployees' claims against the state agency.           Id. at 279.       Although\nthe court did not enjoin OSHA from investigating the alleged\n\nviolations on which those claims were based or from otherwise\n\nseeking to ensure the state's compliance with federal law,                    id.,\n\nits ruling does not seem to allow the administrative proceedings to\n\ncontinue if the Secretary decides to intervene to prosecute the\n\ncomplaints on the individuals' behalf.\n\n            Because the district court had effectively decided the\n\ncase on the merits, the parties filed a stipulation to convert the\n\npreliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and enter final\n\njudgment.      The court entered final judgment pursuant to that\nstipulation.\n\n            The    United    States    and    individual    appellants        filed\n\nseparate notices of appeal.           However, the individual appellants\nfiled their notices of appeal in response to the district court's\n\ngranting of the preliminary injunction.            The individuals' notices\n\nwere then rendered moot by the entry of judgment and a permanent\n\ninjunction.       See Chaparro-Febus v.

See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (providing for judicial\n\nreview of \"final agency action\").       The APA's finality requirement\n\nallows the agency an opportunity to apply its expertise and correct\n\nits mistakes, it avoids disrupting the agency's processes, and it\n\nrelieves the courts from having to engage in \"piecemeal review\n\nwhich at the least is inefficient and upon completion of the agency\n\n                                  -9-\n\fprocess might prove to have been unnecessary.\" FTC v.

See, e.g., DRG Funding\n\nCorp. v. Sec'y of Hous. & Urban Dev., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713000\"><a href=\"/opinion/713000/drg-funding-corporation-v-secretary-of-housing-and-urban-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1214 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1996). In our view, however, the issue of whether the APA provides\nfor judicial review of the nonfinal ruling is not one that,\n\nprecisely speaking, implicates the subject-matter jurisdiction of\n\nthe court. See Air Courier Conference v. Am. Postal Workers Union,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112538\"><a href=\"/opinion/112538/air-courier-conference-of-america-v-american-postal-workers-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 n.3 (1991) (\"The judicial review provisions of\n\nthe APA are not jurisdictional . . . .\").     Instead, the question\n\nis one of \"[w]hether a cause of action exists\" that permits review\n\nof an agency's interim denial of a state's claim of sovereign\nimmunity.   Id.; cf. Bell v. Hood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104272\"><a href=\"/opinion/104272/bell-v-hood/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 682 (1946) (noting\n\nthat \"it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause\n\nof action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a\ndismissal for want of jurisdiction\").\n\n            Even though the asserted lack of finality does not\ndirectly challenge the subject-matter jurisdiction of the district\n\ncourt, the question of whether the state otherwise has a valid\n\ncause of action is an important one that we address as a threshold\n\nissue.   Rhode Island does not dispute that the administrative\n\nproceedings were not yet final when it brought its claim for\n\ninjunctive relief in the court below.     Instead, the state argues\n\nthat its constitutional claim of immunity finds footing, not in the\n\nAPA, but in the federal court's equitable powers and in the more\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fgeneral grant of federal-question jurisdiction provided by 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1331.\n\n            We agree with the amicus that the ALJ's adverse immunity\ndetermination is not \"final agency action\" within the meaning of\n\nAPA § 704. As the statute states, \"[a] preliminary, procedural, or\n\nintermediate agency action or ruling not directly reviewable is\nsubject to review on the review of the final agency action.\"                    5\n\nU.S.C. § 704.     Thus, we have generally held that a final decision\n\nthat may be reviewed or enforced in federal court is one that\n\nresolves not only the underlying claim, but also the relief to be\n\nafforded if liability is found.           Rivera-Rosario v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nAgric., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756656\"><a href=\"/opinion/756656/delcio-rivera-rosario-v-us-department-of-agriculture-and-mike-espy/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37 (1st Cir. 1998).               The state's claim of\n\nimmunity is clearly not accompanied by a final determination on the\nunderlying whistleblower claim.              As such, the claim does not\n\nqualify as \"final\" under the APA.\n\n            That said, we are not convinced that the absence of\n\"final   agency   action\"   renders       the   state's    claim   of   immunity\n\nunreviewable    until   such   time    as    the   Secretary   makes    a   final\n\nliability   determination      on   the     individuals'    claims.      Such   a\n\nconclusion would essentially deprive the state of the very immunity\n\nto which it claims entitlement -- at least insofar as the state\n\nseeks to \"prevent the indignity of [being] subject[ed] . . . to the\n\ncoercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private\n\nparties.\"    In re Ayers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92059\"><a href=\"/opinion/92059/in-re-ayers/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (1887) (noting that the\n\nright to be free from such proceedings is the \"very object and\n\npurpose\" of sovereign immunity).

However, the evidence of Congress's\n\nintent to preclude review must be clear and convincing; it is not\nenough for the agency to merely contend \"that a statutory provision\n\nthat provide[s] for judicial review implie[s], by its silence, a\npreclusion of review of the contested determination.\"                         Id.

Since the\n\nstate's sovereign rights encompass more than a mere defense from\n\nliability -- they include an immunity from being haled before a\n\ntribunal by private parties -- those rights would be lost without\n\nan early and authoritative ruling.

Although the\n\ninstant case involves the sovereign interests of a state entity\n\n(rather than a federal one), we so no reason to foreclose relief on\n\nthat basis.\n\n            We therefore hold that procedures of nonstatutory review\n\npermitted the district court to address the state's immunity claim.\n\nSeveral   district     courts   have    already   enjoined     administrative\n\nwhistleblower    proceedings     under    29   C.F.R.   part    24   that    were\n\ninitiated against a non-consenting state by a private party.

Although neither the decision of\nthe court below nor the decisions from other districts expressly\n\nrely on the principles of nonstatutory review, we think that their\n\napproach and reasoning fit squarely within that doctrine.\n               We note, however, that an action before the district\n\ncourt may not be the only equitable means of seeking review of an\n\nagency's ruling with respect to an assertion of sovereign immunity\n\nby a state.        As one prominent authority has stated, \"initial\n\ndistrict court action, followed by appeal to the court of appeals,\n\nseems almost self-defeating; in the rare case that may justify\n\njudicial intervention, it would be better to devise a direct remedy\nin the court of appeals . . . .\"       16 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.\n\nMiller & Edward H.

App. § 1701 et seq.                 After determining\n\nthat the proceedings before the agency very much resembled a civil\n\nlawsuit, the Court held that \"state sovereign immunity bars the\n\n[agency] from adjudicating complaints filed by a private party\n\nagainst a nonconsenting state.\"           SCSPA, 122 S.

The\n\nCourt reasoned:\n              if the Framers thought it an impermissible\n              affront to a State's dignity to be required to\n              answer the complaints of private parties in\n              federal courts, we cannot imagine that they\n              would have found it acceptable to compel a\n              State to do exactly the same thing before the\n              administrative tribunal of an agency . . . .\n\nId.\n\n              Although    SCSPA    involved     a    different     administrative\n\nagency, a different federal statute, and a different scheme of\n\nadministrative adjudication, we see no basis for distinguishing\n\nSCSPA's central holding.          The proceedings under 29 C.F.R. part 24\n\nshare    with    proceedings      under   the   Shipping     Act    the   salient\n\ncharacteristics that led the Supreme Court to determine that such\n\nadjudications were the \"type of proceedings from which the Framers\n\nwould have thought the States possessed immunity when they agreed\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fto enter the Union.\" Id. at 1872.           That is, both proceedings are\n\nadjudicated before an ALJ, whose role is similar to that of a trial\n\njudge, id.; both proceedings are conducted in a manner that roughly\nconforms to the rules of procedure that govern the course of a\n\ntraditional civil lawsuit, id. at 1873-74; and, finally, both\n\nproceedings culminate in a final decision that includes the types\nof relief typically available in civil litigation, see id. at 1874.\n\nWe therefore conclude that a state is generally capable of invoking\n\nsovereign immunity in proceedings initiated by a private party\n\nunder 29 C.F.R. part 24.\n\n              Our inquiry, however, is not entirely at an end.              The\n\ndoctrine of sovereign immunity is subject to numerous exceptions,\n\nsee Alden, 527 U.S. at 755-57 (summarizing the limitations and\nexceptions to the states' sovereign immunity), and both the United\n\nStates and individual appellants contend that one or more of these\n\nexceptions deprive Rhode Island of its immunity in the case at\nhand.

We address two\n\npossible bases for finding waiver -- the first argued by the\nindividual appellants, and the second raised by us sua sponte in\n\nlight of another recent decision of the Supreme Court.\n\n            First, in a curious variation on waiver doctrine, the\nindividual appellants make the novel contention that Rhode Island\n\nis a \"partial sovereign,\" unable to invoke the full extent of\n\nsovereign immunity available to other states.              The appellants'\n\nargument begins with the premise that, at the time the United\n\nStates   Constitution   was   ratified,    Rhode   Island    maintained    a\n\nprovision in its colonial charter allowing it to sue or be sued in\n\nthe courts.    Appellants then read the existence of this provision,\nalong with Rhode Island's failure to explicitly reserve the right\n\nto claim sovereign status in subsequent manifestations of its state\n\nconstitution,    as   conclusive   proof   that    Rhode   Island    has   no\nauthority to now claim any degree of sovereign immunity.\n\n            A similar line of reasoning has already been considered\n\nand rejected by the Supreme Court.         In the dissenting opinion in\n\nAlden, Justice Souter seized upon the historical experience of\n\nRhode Island as proof that the concept of sovereign immunity\n\nremained unsettled at the time of the Constitution's ratification.\n\nSee Alden, 527 U.S. at 769-70 (Souter, J., dissenting).             However,\n\nAlden's majority opinion drew a wholly different conclusion from\n\nthe existence of sue-or-be-sued provisions in the charters of some\n\ncolonies.     As the Court stated,\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f           The   handful    of   state    statutory   and\n           constitutional provisions authorizing suits or\n           petitions of right against States only\n           confirms the prevalence of the traditional\n           understanding that a State could not be sued\n           in the absence of an express waiver, for if\n           the   understanding   were    otherwise,   the\n           provisions would have been unnecessary.\nId. at 724.    The majority opinion also noted that any argument that\n\nRhode Island did not recognize its own sovereign status is further\n\nbelied   by    Rhode   Island's   proclamation   in   its     ratification\n\nconvention that \"'[i]t is declared by the Convention, that the\n\njudicial power of the United States, in cases in which a state may\n\nbe a party, does not extend to criminal prosecutions, or to\n\nauthorize any suit by any person against a state.'\"            Alden, 527\nU.S. at 718 (quoting 1 Jonathan Elliot, Debates on the Federal\n\nConstitution 336 (2d ed. 1854)).\n\n           If the analysis of the Alden majority were not potent\nenough, two additional factors counsel in favor of rejecting this\n\nnovel waiver argument. First, the argument depends almost entirely\n\non the existence of a provision merely allowing Rhode Island to sue\n\nor be sued in its own courts.       The Supreme Court has repeatedly\nheld that such provisions are insufficient to waive the state's\n\nimmunity from suit in a federal forum.        See, e.g., College Sav.\n\nBank v. Fla.

Board of Regents of\n\nthe University System of Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), the state\n\nwaived its immunity by filing an action in federal district court.\n\nRhode Island and the United States both agree that the Lapides\n\ndecision is inapplicable.        However, the individual appellants\n\ndisagree and contend that the state's litigation conduct did indeed\n\nstrip it of its immunity from suit.\n\n           In Lapides, the plaintiff brought suit in state court\n\nagainst an arm of the state of Georgia, alleging violations of\n\nstate and federal law.       The state entity removed the case to\n\nfederal court, and then moved to dismiss, asserting that it was\nimmune from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted that by removing the case the state entity\n\n\"voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal court,\" id. at\n\n1645 (emphasis in original).       Accordingly, the Court held that\n\n\"removal is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court's\njurisdiction   sufficient   to   waive   the   State's   otherwise   valid\n\nobjection to litigation of a matter . . . in a federal forum.\"         Id.\n\nat 1646.\n\n           The individual appellants read Lapides broadly to mean\n\nthat a state waives its immunity by voluntarily participating in\n\nany facet of a federal adjudicative proceeding.          In the words of\n\nthe individual appellants:\n\n           Rhode Island has engaged in a form of \"Russian\n           roulette\" . . . .         It acceded to the\n\n                                  -27-\n\f            Administrative forum when it thought it could\n            dispose of the case, and then reverted to a\n            sovereign immunity defense after completing\n            discovery, including depositions, issuance of\n            subpoena, nineteen days of hearing before an\n            [ALJ], and then was hit with an adverse\n            decision. Adopting sovereign immunity at such\n            a late point in the litigation is to wrongly\n            seek \"an unfair tactical advantage.\"\n\nIndividual Appellants' Supp. Br. at 6 (quoting Lapides, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 1644).    According to the individual appellants, the state could\n\nhave preserved its immunity only by failing to appear before the\n\nALJ and refusing to participate in the administrative proceedings\n\nentirely.    See id. at 16.\n\n            This approach to waiver is startling in its breadth and,\n\nmore   importantly,    appears   to   conflict    directly   with   well\n\nestablished principles of law.    It has repeatedly been held that a\nstate may raise its immunity from suit at any time during the\n\nproceedings, including on appeal.       See Edelman v. Jordan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 677-78 (1974); Larson v.

This venerable\n\nline of cases cannot be reconciled with the individual appellants'\n\nreasoning, under which a state would waive its immunity by doing\n\nnothing more than filing an answer to a complaint and conducting\n\ndiscovery.    The Supreme Court gave no indication that its decision\n\nin Lapides would upset such established precedent.            And as a\n\npractical matter, the individual appellants' approach to waiver is\n\nsimply untenable, as it encourages states to assert their immunity\n\nby means of extra-judicial \"self help,\" rather than through the\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fjudicial channels that have been established by years of settled\n\ncaselaw.    We therefore decline to adopt the individual appellants'\n\nreasoning.\n            There is, however, another reading of Lapides -- one that\n\nis not so expansive as the individual appellants' approach, but\n\nexpansive nonetheless -- that might also be implicated here.            One\ncould argue that the state, by invoking the federal jurisdiction of\n\nthe district court in a nonstatutory review action, thereby waived\n\nits claimed immunity in the administrative proceedings.                 See\n\nLapides, 122 S. Ct. at 1644 (\"[T]he Court has made clear in general\n\nthat 'where a State voluntarily becomes a party to a cause and\n\nsubmits its rights for judicial determination, it will be bound\n\nthereby and cannot escape the result of its own voluntary act by\ninvoking the prohibitions of the Eleventh Amendment.'\") (quoting\n\nGunter v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96399\"><a href=\"/opinion/96399/gunter-v-atlantic-coast-line-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 284 (1906)).\n\n            Although it is something of a close question, we do not\nread Lapides to effect a waiver of Rhode Island's immunity in this\n\ncase.      We   discern   several   critical   distinctions   between   the\n\nsituation presented here and the one presented to the Supreme Court\n\nin Lapides.       To begin with, the state entity in Lapides had\n\n\"explicitly waived immunity from state-court proceedings\" on the\n\nsame claims in respect to which it then sought immunity protection\n\nin federal court.     122 S. Ct. at 1643.      It is reasonably apparent\n\nthat the Supreme Court should be troubled by such an attempt to\n\nregain, by a change in forum, litigation advantage that the state\n\nhas already renounced by a general statute.        See Lapides v. Bd. of\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fRegents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75316\"><a href=\"/opinion/75316/paul-d-lapides-v-board-of-regents/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1372</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1375 n.2 (11th Cir.\n\n2001) (noting Georgia's statutory waiver with respect to the state\n\ntort claims in state court), rev'd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118504\"><a href=\"/opinion/118504/lapides-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-system-of-ga/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002).               Rhode\nIsland, by contrast, was undoubtably entitled to immunity when the\n\nproceedings were first brought before the ALJ.             See SCSPA, 122 S.\n\nCt. at 1879.       And, because we reject the individual appellants'\nargument that Rhode Island had waived immunity by its conduct in\n\nthe administrative proceeding, we consequently discern no attempt\n\nby the state to reverse its waiver by a change in forum.                Rather,\n\nRhode Island has consistently asserted its sovereign immunity, both\n\nhere and in the administrative proceeding.\n\n            Second, Rhode Island invoked the aid of the federal\n\ncourts in an entirely new and different proceeding than the one in\nwhich it sought immunity. The removal of the state-court action in\n\nLapides was merely a continuation of the same proceeding in a\n\ndifferent forum.\n            Third,        Rhode Island brought its claim in federal court\n\nfor the     sole    and    exclusive   purpose   of   obtaining   an   immunity\ndetermination for the underlying whistleblower claims that remained\n\npending before the administrative agency. In Lapides, however, the\n\nstate entity moved the parties' entire dispute to federal court for\n\na determination on all of the claims at issue.\n\n            We     find    these   distinguishing     characteristics,    taken\n\ntogether, to place this case outside the reach of Lapides. Finding\n\nwaiver here would not advance the policies that ordinarily motivate\n\nthe rule.    \"In large part the rule governing voluntary invocations\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fof   federal    jurisdiction       has    rested      upon     the    problems    of\n\ninconsistency and unfairness that a contrary rule of law would\n\ncreate.\"     Lapides, 122 S. Ct. at 1645.             In this case, the state\ninvoked the     district    court's      aid,   not   to     obtain    an   unseemly\n\nlitigation advantage, but to clarify its entitlement to sovereign\n\nimmunity where the agency's rules provided no means for doing so.\nThus,   if    consistency   and    fairness     are     our    guideposts,       such\n\nconsiderations point away from finding waiver.\n\n             It would be a great irony for us to hold that a state\n\nwaives its sovereign immunity solely by seeking judicial review of\n\nan   agency's    adverse    (and    incorrect)        immunity       determination,\n\nespecially since there is \"a strong presumption that Congress\n\nintends judicial review of administrative action.\" Bowen, 476 U.S.\n\nat 670.      So extending Lapides would have the perverse effect of\n\ncompletely depriving the state of a primary benefit of sovereign\n\nimmunity no matter what course it chooses.                   If the state cannot\nseek an interim judicial determination of immunity without waiving\n\nthat very immunity, the state is constrained to participate in the\nproceedings all the way to their termination.                    While the state\n\nmight be able to assert its immunity upon judicial review of the\n\nagency's final order, by that time the protections of sovereign\n\nimmunity will have been reduced to a mere defense from liability.\n\nSee P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth., 506 U.S. at 145 (\"[T]he value to\n\nthe States of their [sovereign] immunity . . . is for the most part\n\nlost as litigation proceeds past motion practice.\"); accord SCSPA,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 1877.     To be sure, we have observed that litigation\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fmay sometimes present the state with a difficult choice as to\n\nwhether immunity should be waived.

Nor, in reviewing the language of the SWDA\n\nourselves, do we find any provision of the Act that remotely\npurports to abrogate the states' immunity.           The only provision of\n\nthe Act addressing the question of sovereign immunity mandates that\n\ncitizen civil suits under 42 U.S.C. § 6972 may enforce the Act's\n\nsubstantive    provisions    only   \"to    the   extent   permitted   by   the\n\neleventh amendment to the Constitution.\"          Id. § 6972(a)(1)(A).

The    governing\n\nregulations clearly establish that the ARB reviews the decision of\n\nthe ALJ only for the limited purpose of determining whether a\nviolation of the law occurred.     29 C.F.R. § 24.8(d)(1).    Once the\n\nARB makes this determination, its course of action is limited: if\n\nthe violation occurred, the ARB must order appropriate relief, id.\n\n§ 24.8(d)(1) & (2); if no violation occurred, it must issue an\n\norder denying the complaint, id. § 24.8(e).       There is nothing in\n\nthe role defined for the ARB to suggest that its members may weigh\n\nthe greater policy implications of affirming the ALJ's decision or\ndenying the complaint.       Thus, the presence of the ARB does not\n\naffect the sovereign immunity calculus.\n\n           Individual appellants next claim that the Secretary,\nrather than the individual complainant, is the \"true\" plaintiff in\n\nany administrative proceeding under 29 C.F.R. part 24.       Thus, they\n\ncontend that Rhode Island's sovereign immunity is inapplicable\n\nbecause the whistleblower claim proceedings are subject to the\n\n\"exercise of political responsibility [by the federal government]\n\nfor each suit prosecuted against a State, a control which is absent\n\nfrom a broad delegation to private persons to sue nonconsenting\n\nStates.\"   Alden, 527 U.S. at 756.\n\n           It is obvious from the regulatory scheme and governing\n\nAPA provisions that the administrative adjudication is not directed\n\n\n                                  -37-\n\for   prosecuted   by   the   Secretary.

In the wake of SCSPA, it is\nclear that such an argument is a non-starter. As the SCSPA Court\nstated, \"The Attorney General's decision to bring an enforcement\naction against a State after the conclusion of the [agency's]\nproceedings . . . does not retroactively convert an [agency]\nadjudication initiated and pursued by a private party into one\ninitiated and pursued by the Federal Government.\" 122 S.

Thus, our holding does not preclude the Secretary from\n\nintervening in the enjoined proceedings and removing the sovereign\n\nimmunity bar.      See Ohio Envtl. Prot. Agency, 121 F.

To the extent the district court's injunction does not\n\npermit the Secretary to take such action, we modify the injunction\n\naccordingly.13\n           Notwithstanding this single caveat, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict   court    was   correct   to     hold   that   Rhode   Island   has\n\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.              The states'\n\nimmunity from suit embedded in the structure of the Constitution\n\nextends to adversary administrative proceedings that are prosecuted\n\nagainst an unconsenting state by a private party.            See SCSPA, 122\n\nS. Ct. at 1879.     And in this case, the appellants have advanced no\narguments that persuade us that a recognized exception to the\n\nimmunity doctrine is applicable.\n\n           2.

Such an argument downplays a fundamental aspect of\n\nthe state's sovereign immunity.               As we have already observed, the\n\nstate's immunity is not merely a defense from liability; it is a\nsafeguard against being subjected to \"the coercive process of\n\njudicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.\"                          In re\n\nAyers, 123 U.S. at 505.            If a state cannot assert its immunity in\nthe earliest stages of the adjudication, much of the benefit\n\nconferred by that immunity is irretrievably lost.                  P.R.

See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 360 (holding that sovereign\n\nimmunity     bars    state       employees'    claims   under    Title     I    of   the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117); Kimel,\n\n528   U.S.   at     67    (same    with   regard   to   claims     under       the   Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634); Alden, 527\n\nU.S. at 712 (same with regard to claims under the Fair Labor\n\nStandards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219).\n\n             Lastly, the individual appellants argue that the issuance\n\nof an injunction runs counter to the public interest in protecting\n\nwhistleblowers and promoting clean government.                  The district court\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\ftook these important interests into account, balanced them against\n\nthe competing interests of federalism, and concluded that the\n\nissuance of the injunction did not offend the overall public\ninterest.
