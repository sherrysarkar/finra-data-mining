P. 12(b)(6).  For  the following reasons,  we affirm in\r\n\npart, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.1\r                                                                     1\r\n\n     On March 28, 1994, Hightower  filed a complaint under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    1983 against various Rhode  Island prison officials\r\n\nbased on events which  allegedly occurred while Hightower was\r\n\na  pretrial  detainee.    Stripped  to  its  essentials,  the\r\n\ncomplaint  alleges  that  correctional officers  Gilbert  and\r\n\nBerry conspired to falsely charge Hightower with swearing and\r\n\nthreatening; Officer Gilbert later admitted at a disciplinary\r\n\nhearing that  Hightower did  not swear  and that  the alleged\r\n\nthreat  was a statement by Hightower that he intended to file\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Although appellees  have not raised the  issue of waiver,\r               1\r\nwe  note that the instant  case was originally  referred to a\r\nmagistrate judge for a recommended disposition pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.   636(b)(1)(B).   The magistrate's report  recommended\r\ndismissal, Hightower filed no  objection to the  magistrate's\r\nreport,  and  the  district  judge  adopted  the  recommended\r\ndecision  on the ground  that \"no  objection has  been timely\r\nfiled and the time for objecting  has expired.\"  As a general\r\nrule,  a  litigant  in  this  circuit  waives  the  right  to\r\nappellate  review  of  a  district  court  order  adopting  a\r\nmagistrate's recommendation if  the litigant fails to  object\r\nto the  proposed decision before  the district  court.   See,\r                                                                        \r\ne.g., Henley Drilling  Co. v.  McGee, 36 F.3d  143, 150-51  &amp;\r                                                \r\nn.19 (1st Cir.  1994); Park  Motor Mart, Inc.  v.

However, we decline\r               \r\nto apply the waiver  rule to a  pro se litigant's failure  to\r                                                  \r\nobject where,  as here, appellees have not  argued waiver and\r\nthe  magistrate's report  does  not warn  the litigant  \"that\r\nfailure to file within  the time allowed waives the  right to\r\nappeal  the  district  court's  order.\"    United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\nValencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam)\r                           \r\n(mandating  such notice  in a  magistrate's report  where the\r\nlitigant is pro se).  \r                              \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\na  grievance; the  disciplinary board  found Hightower  to be\r\n\nguilty  of threatening and imposed a term of segregation; and\r\n\nthe  guilty finding  was  affirmed on  administrative appeal.\r\n\nThe \"false\" charges were made and the discipline was imposed,\r\n\nthe complaint  alleges, in retaliation for Hightower's filing\r\n\na grievance against Gilbert.  The complaint also alleges that\r\n\nthe disciplinary board excluded evidence regarding the nature\r\n\nof  the \"threat\" in its written report, and that the evidence\r\n\nin the disciplinary record does not support a guilty finding.\r\n\nFinally,   the  complaint  alleges  that  Hightower  suffered\r\n\nvarious indignities during segregation--including  the denial\r\n\nof a  shower for eight  days and having  unknown correctional\r\n\nofficers soil  his court clothing--and that  prison officials\r\n\ndid not immediately  return him to the  general population at\r\n\nthe completion of his disciplinary term.  \r\n\n     Based on  these facts,  Hightower alleged the  denial of\r\n\nhis  right   under  the  First  Amendment   to  petition  the\r\n\ngovernment  for the redress of grievances.  He also alleged a\r\n\ndenial  of  both  substantive  and  procedural  due  process.\r\n\nFinally,  Hightower invoked the  supplemental jurisdiction of\r\n\nthe district  court and  alleged various violations  of state\r\n\nlaw.\r\n\n     To  the  extent that  Hightower  complains  that he  was\r\n\npunished for expressing an intent to file a  grievance--or in\r\n\nthe alternative, that he was subjected to \"false charges\" and\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ndiscipline  in retaliation  for doing  so--he states  a claim\r\n\nunder the First  Amendment.2  See, e.g., Sprouse  v. Babcock,\r                                       2                                \r\n\n870 F.2d 450, 452 (8th Cir. 1989) (recognizing that the First\r\n\nAmendment  right to  petition the  government for  redress of\r\n\ngrievances   includes   redress   under  established   prison\r\n\ngrievance procedures); Franco v.  Kelly, 854 F.2d 584, 589-90\r                                                   \r\n\n(2d Cir. 1988) (observing  that \"intentional obstruction of a\r\n\nprisoner's right to seek  redress of grievances\" is precisely\r\n\nthe sort of oppression that   1983 is intended to remedy).  \r\n\n     Hightower's  claims  that the  disciplinary  hearing was\r\n\nconstitutionally deficient and that he was denied substantive\r\n\ndue process  are closely intertwined  with his claim  that he\r\n\nwas  punished for  constitutionally protected  activity.   We\r\n\nneed not definitively resolve  at this juncture the viability\r\n\nof these claims.3  Since Hightower may be able to show injury\r                            3\r\n\nunder the First  Amendment, it may be unnecessary to consider\r\n\nclaims arising  out of other constitutional  provisions.  Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2Contrary to appellees' suggestion, claims  asserted under\r               2\r\nthe First Amendment survive Sandin v.

If Hightower fails to  prove a\r\n\nFirst  Amendment violation,  he  may nonetheless  succeed  in\r\n\nshowing  a violation of due process if he can demonstrate, as\r\n\nhe  alleges, that  there  is no  evidence  in the  record  to\r\n\nsupport a constitutionally valid  charge of threatening.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nSuperintendent,  Mass. Correctional  Inst., Walpole  v.

See Bell  v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\r                                                          \r\n\n539 n.21 (1979).   The  delay in returning  Hightower to  the\r\n\ngeneral population was brief.   Hightower makes no allegation\r\n\nthat  he was repeatedly denied  showers, or that  he was ever\r\n\ndenied access to hygiene items, water, and towels.  We do not\r\n\nthink  a single instance of  being denied a  shower for eight\r\n\ndays,  without more,  states a  due  process violation.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nDavenport  v.

Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 455-56 (1985) (holding that due process requires that a finding of guilt be supported by \"some evidence\" in the record).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hightower's remaining &#167; 1983 claims were properly dismissed because, on the facts of this case, they amount to de minimis impositions and thus do not implicate constitutional concerns.   See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 539 n. 21 (1979).  The delay in returning Hightower to the general population was brief.  Hightower makes no allegation that he was repeatedly denied showers, or that he was ever denied access to hygiene items, water, and towels.  We do not think a single instance of being denied a shower for eight days, without more, states a due process violation.   Cf. Davenport v. DeRobertis, 844 F.2d 1310, 1316 (7th Cir.)

For the following reasons, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 28, 1994, Hightower filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against various Rhode Island prison officials based on events which allegedly occurred while Hightower was a pretrial detainee.  Stripped to its essentials, the complaint alleges that correctional officers Gilbert and Berry conspired to falsely charge Hightower with swearing and threatening;  Officer Gilbert later admitted at a disciplinary hearing that Hightower did not swear and that the alleged threat was a statement by Hightower that he intended to file a grievance;  the disciplinary board found Hightower to be guilty of threatening and imposed a term of segregation;  and the guilty finding was affirmed on administrative appeal.  The \"false\" charges were made and the discipline was imposed, the complaint alleges, in retaliation for Hightower's filing a grievance against Gilbert.  The complaint also alleges that the disciplinary board excluded evidence regarding the nature of the \"threat\" in its written report, and that the evidence in the disciplinary record does not support a guilty finding.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Hightower suffered various indignities during segregation--including the denial of a shower for eight days and having unknown correctional officers soil his court clothing--and that prison officials did not immediately return him to the general population at the completion of his disciplinary term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these facts, Hightower alleged the denial of his right under the First Amendment to petition the government for the redress of grievances.  He also alleged a denial of both substantive and procedural due process.  Finally, Hightower invoked the supplemental jurisdiction of the district court and alleged various violations of state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that Hightower complains that he was punished for expressing an intent to file a grievance--or in the alternative, that he was subjected to \"false charges\" and discipline in retaliation for doing so--he states a claim under the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   See, e.g., Sprouse v. Babcock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520030\"><a href=\"/opinion/520030/robert-d-sprouse-v-david-babcock-charles-harper-and-ronald-g-welder/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 452 (8th Cir.1989) (recognizing that the First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances includes redress under established prison grievance procedures);   Franco v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510218\"><a href=\"/opinion/510218/francisco-franco-v-walter-kelly-lt-moscicki-and-officer-higley/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span>, 589-90 (2d Cir.1988) (observing that \"intentional obstruction of a prisoner's right to seek redress of grievances\" is precisely the sort of oppression that &#167; 1983 is intended to remedy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hightower's claims that the disciplinary hearing was constitutionally deficient and that he was denied substantive due process are closely intertwined with his claim that he was punished for constitutionally protected activity.  We need not definitively resolve at this juncture the viability of these claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Since Hightower may be able to show injury under the First Amendment, it may be unnecessary to consider claims arising out of other constitutional provisions.   Cf. Franco, 854 F.2d at 590 n. 3;   Burton v. Livingston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470122\"><a href=\"/opinion/470122/willie-burton-jr-v-a-livingston/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 101 n. 2 (8th Cir.1986).  If Hightower fails to prove a First Amendment violation, he may nonetheless succeed in showing a violation of due process if he can demonstrate, as he alleges, that there is no evidence in the record to support a constitutionally valid charge of threatening.
