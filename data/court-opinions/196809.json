Discerning  no\r\n\nhint of error, we summarily affirm.\r\n\n          1.   The  appellant's  first complaint  relates to  the\r                    1.\r\n\ndistrict  court's  drug  quantity   determination.    The   court\r\n\ndetermined   that  the   appellant  personally   participated  in\r\n\ntransactions  involving   between  two  and  one-half   and  four\r\n\nkilograms  of cocaine;  that the  conspiracy of  which she  was a\r\n\nmember,  during   the   period  of   her   membership,   launched\r\n\ntransactions  involving another  five to  fifteen kilograms  at a\r\n\nminimum; that many (if not all) of these transactions occurred in\r\n\nthe course  of jointly undertaken criminal  activity (the charged\r\n\nconspiracy) and were foreseeable to her; and that, therefore, she\r\n\nwas  responsible (in  the  relevant conduct  sense, see  U.S.S.G.\r                                                                 \r\n\n 1B1.3) for over five  kilograms of cocaine in toto,  bringing to\r                                                             \r\n\nbear  a mandatory  minimum ten-year  sentence.   See 21  U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (providing for mandatory minimum sentence of ten\r\n\nyears in cases involving five kilograms or more of cocaine).\r\n\n          We review  the district court's findings  of fact anent\r\n\ndrug quantity only for clear error, and we will set such findings\r\n\naside only if we are persuaded that the sentencing court has made\r\n\na  \"serious mistake.\"  United States v.  Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 870\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  We are not so persuaded here;  to the contrary,\r\n\nwe  believe  that  the   sentencing  court's  findings  are  both\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nsufficiently explicit and sufficiently record-rooted.\r\n\n          Drug   quantities  need   not   be   determined  in   a\r\n\nmathematically   precise   fashion.     Within  the   margins  of\r\n\nreliability,  sentencing  courts  have  the  authority   to  make\r\n\nreasonable estimates based on  available information.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited States v. Sepulveda,  15 F.3d 1161, 1199 (1st  Cir. 1993),\r                                    \r\n\ncert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 2714 (1994); United States v. Sklar, 920\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 107,  113 (1st Cir.  1990).   It is, moreover,  settled that\r\n\nmembers of a drug-trafficking  conspiracy may be held accountable\r\n\nat  sentencing for  different  drug quantities  depending on  the\r\n\ncircumstances of their involvement.   See United States v. Munoz,\r                                                                          \r\n\n36 F.3d  1229, 1237 (1st  Cir. 1994 ),  cert. denied, 115  S. Ct.\r                                                              \r\n\n1164  (1995); United States v. Garcia, 954  F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1992).   In  respect to  a  defendant's accountability  for  drug\r\n\ntransactions  in  which  she   did  not  personally  participate,\r\n\nforeseeability is the key.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 16.   \"In the\r                                                \r\n\nusual  case,  what is  foreseeable depends  on  the scope  of the\r\n\ndefendant's agreement with the other participants in the criminal\r\n\nenterprise.\"  Munoz, 36 F.3d at 1237.\r                             \r\n\n          Here, the record reveals  that the district court fully\r\n\nunderstood these  principles, applied the correct legal standard,\r\n\nand made a fact-sensitive  determination of what trafficked drugs\r\n\nwere, in  the court's words, \"reasonably  foreseeable or actually\r\n\nknown to [Lynch]  . .  . during the  time she  was a knowing  and\r\n\nwilling participant in th[e]  conspiracy.\"  These findings cannot\r\n\nbe  set aside under the jurisprudence of clear error.  After all,\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthe district court heard  over ten weeks of trial  testimony, and\r\n\nalso had  the benefit of a  compendious presentence investigation\r\n\nreport  (PSI  Report)    a report  that  was not  contradicted by\r\n\ncountervailing  evidence  in  any  relevant  particulars.     The\r\n\ntestimony and the specifics in  the PSI Report, viewed  favorably\r\n\nto the government, fully  substantiate the findings.  No  more is\r\n\nexigible.  See, e.g., United States  v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n19, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (discussing utility at sentencing of facts\r\n\ncontained  in PSI Report); United  States v. Ruiz,  905 F.2d 499,\r                                                           \r\n\n508 (1st Cir. 1990) (discussing utility of trial testimony in the\r\n\nsentencing phase);  see also United States  v.

The appellant's second issue involves the so-called\r                    2.\r\n\n\"safety valve\" provision, 18  U.S.C.   3553(f), which  in certain\r\n\ncases constrains the application of  mandatory minimum sentences.\r\n\nPursuant to this  provision, the sentencing court  is directed to\r\n\nimpose  a sentence  in  accordance with  the guidelines  (without\r\n\nregard  to  any  statutory  minimum)  if  a  convicted  defendant\r\n\nsatisfies five set criteria.   See id.; see also  U.S.S.G.  5C1.2\r                                                          \r\n\n(Nov. 1995)  (implementing the  statute).   The court below  held\r\n\nthat Lynch failed to meet the fifth of these criteria in that she\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Lynch's contention  that the district court  failed to make\r\nspecific subsidiary findings of fact related to the drug quantity\r\nissues  is unavailing.  The sentencing  court's findings need not\r\nbe  precise to the point of pedantry.  Here they are sufficiently\r\nexplicit and comprehensive to withstand criticism.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ndid  not  provide  complete  and  truthful  information  \"to  the\r\n\nGovernment\"  in  the  appropriate  time   frame.    18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3553(f)(5).  Lynch argues that she satisfied this  requirement by\r\n\nproviding the information  to the probation officer in the course\r\n\nof  the  compilation  of the  PSI  Report.    The district  court\r\n\ndisagreed with Lynch's argument.  So do we.\r\n\n          We  need not  tarry.   While this  case was  pending on\r\n\nappeal, a panel of this court decided the precise point, contrary\r\n\nto  the  appellant's  position,   in  United  States  v.

The court determined that the appellant personally participated in transactions involving between two and one-half and four kilograms of cocaine;  that the conspiracy of which she was a member, during the period of her membership, launched transactions involving another five to fifteen kilograms at a minimum;  that many (if not all) of these transactions occurred in the course of jointly undertaken criminal activity (the charged conspiracy) and were foreseeable to her;  and that, therefore, she was responsible (in the relevant conduct sense, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3) for over five kilograms of cocaine in toto, bringing to bear a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence.

Apr. 24, 1996) (concluding that \"government\" as used in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(5) refers exclusively to the prosecutorial authority, and not to the probation department);  see also United States v. Montanez, No. 95-2096, slip op. at 6-7 (1st Cir.  Apr. 24, 1996).

Discerning no hint of error, we summarily affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The appellant's first complaint relates to the district court's drug quantity determination.   The court determined that the appellant personally participated in transactions involving between two and one-half and four kilograms of cocaine;  that the conspiracy of which she was a member, during the period of her membership, launched transactions involving another five to fifteen kilograms at a minimum;  that many (if not all) of these transactions occurred in the course of jointly undertaken criminal activity (the charged conspiracy) and were foreseeable to her;  and that, therefore, she was responsible (in the relevant conduct sense, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3) for over five kilograms of cocaine in toto, bringing to bear a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence.   See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) (providing for mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in cases involving five kilograms or more of cocaine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's findings of fact anent drug quantity only for clear error, and we will set such findings aside only if we are persuaded that the sentencing court has made a \"serious mistake.\"  United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 870 (1st Cir.1993).   We are not so persuaded here;  to the contrary, we believe that the sentencing court's findings are both sufficiently explicit and sufficiently record-rooted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drug quantities need not be determined in a mathematically precise fashion.   Within the margins of reliability, sentencing courts have the authority to make reasonable estimates based on available information.  See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1199 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is, moreover, settled that members of a drug-trafficking conspiracy may be held accountable at sentencing for different drug quantities depending on the circumstances of their involvement.  See United States v. Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195659\"><a href=\"/opinion/195659/united-states-v-delgado-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1237 (1st Cir.1994 ), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In respect to a defendant's accountability for drug transactions in which she did not personally participate, foreseeability is the key.  See Garcia, 954 F.2d at 16.  \"In the usual case, what is foreseeable depends on the scope of the defendant's agreement with the other participants in the criminal enterprise.\"  Munoz, 36 F.3d at 1237.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record reveals that the district court fully understood these principles, applied the correct legal standard, and made a fact-sensitive determination of what trafficked drugs were, in the court's words, \"reasonably foreseeable or actually known to [Lynch] ... during the time she was a knowing and willing participant in th[e] conspiracy.\"   These findings cannot be set aside under the jurisprudence of clear error.   After all, the district court heard over ten weeks of trial testimony, and also had the benefit of a compendious presentence investigation report (PSI Report)--a report that was not contradicted by countervailing evidence in any relevant particulars.   The testimony and the specifics in the PSI Report, viewed favorably to the government, fully substantiate the findings.   No more is exigible.  See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195584\"><a href=\"/opinion/195584/united-states-v-gonzalez-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1994) (discussing utility at sentencing of facts contained in PSI Report);  United States v.

Jimenez-Otero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538475\"><a href=\"/opinion/538475/united-states-v-manuel-jimenez-otero/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 815 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that, when there are two or more plausible views of the evidence, the sentencing court's choice among them cannot be clearly erroneous).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The appellant's second issue involves the so-called \"safety valve\" provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), which in certain cases constrains the application of mandatory minimum sentences.   Pursuant to this provision, the sentencing court is directed to impose a sentence in accordance with the guidelines (without regard to any statutory minimum) if a convicted defendant satisfies five set criteria.   See id.;   see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2 (Nov.1995) (implementing the statute).   The court below held that Lynch failed to meet the fifth of these criteria in that she did not provide complete and truthful information \"to the Government\" in the appropriate time frame.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5).   Lynch argues that she satisfied this requirement by providing the information to the probation officer in the course of the compilation of the PSI Report.   The district court disagreed with Lynch's argument.   So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.   While this case was pending on appeal, a panel of this court decided the precise point, contrary to the appellant's position, in United States v. Jimenez Martinez, No. 95-1511, slip op. at 19 (1st Cir.
