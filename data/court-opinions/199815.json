George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Torruella, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Stephen C. Smith, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 6, 2002\n\f-2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Defendant-appellant, Darren John\n\nHawkins, appeals the district court’s refusal to grant his suppression\n\nmotion. This motion sought to exclude the contents of a jar, which the\n\ndistrict court held had been opened and its contents examined pursuant\n\nto a standardized inventory. Because we hold that it was not clearly\n\nerroneous for the district court to conclude that the police inventory\n\nprocedures contained an unwritten addendum that officers should remove\n\nall contents from a container when inventorying that container, the\n\nsearch of the jar and its contents was permissible as an inventory\n\nsearch. Therefore, we affirm the district court’s decision denying\n\nappellant’s motion to suppress.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          On July 14, 2000, Officer Christopher Hashey observed\n\nappellant driving his motorcycle erratically. Officer Hashey began\n\nfollowing appellant, and the pursuit became a high-speed chase which\n\nresulted in appellant crashing into a semi-tractor trailer truck.\n\nAppellant ended up unconscious on the road, partially under his\n\nmotorcycle, which was, in turn, partially under the truck.\n\n          When paramedics arrived on the scene, they removed appellant\n\nfrom the road and placed him inside the awaiting ambulance. At some\n\npoint, the paramedics began removing appellant’s garments because they\n\nwere soaked with gasoline. One of the paramedics, Andrew Fish, noticed\n\nthat appellant had a transparent plastic baggie in his sock that\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fcontained a green leafy substance. Fish called out to Officer Hashey,\n\nwho came over, took possession of the bag, and identified the substance\n\nas marijuana.    The ambulance departed a short time later.\n\n          Another officer, George Spencer, Jr., was sent to the Eastern\n\nMaine Medical Center with a \"blood kit\" to perform a blood analysis on\n\nthe appellant. After the paramedics arrived with appellant, Fish began\n\ncollecting appellant's clothing from inside the ambulance. It is\n\nstandard procedure to collect any personal belongings left in the\n\nambulance and deliver them to the hospital staff. As Fish was doing\n\nthis, he noticed that appellant's cut-up leather jacket was unusually\n\nheavy. He observed half of a glass jar protruding from the jacket\n\npocket. Fearing that the jacket might also contain a weapon, Fish took\n\nthe jacket inside the hospital where he hoped to find a police officer.\n\nHe found Officer Spencer and turned the jacket over to him.\n\n          Officer Spencer, accompanied by Fish, took the jacket into\n\nthe hospital’s EMT room and removed all of its contents. This included\n\nthe jar, an electronic scale, and a black glove. The jar was about\n\nfive or six inches tall, about three or four inches in diameter,\n\npartially covered by a peanut butter label, and topped with a yellow\n\nscrew-on lid. Officer Spencer opened the jar and reached inside, where\n\nhe felt a plastic bag with something solid inside. He then deposited\n\nthe jacket, jar, scale, and glove in the trunk of his police cruiser.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Meanwhile, two agents from the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency\n\n(\"MDEA\") arrived. Spencer turned over the jacket and its contents to\n\nthese two officers, Robert Hutchings and Mark Leonard. These agents\n\nthen searched the jar. Hutchings, who is also a member of the Bangor\n\nPolice Department, removed the opaque plastic bag from the jar, untied\n\nit, and found three transparent plastic bags containing white powder.\n\nAgent Hutchings believed this to be cocaine, and a field test confirmed\n\nthat belief.\n\n          The Bangor Police Department has a written policy instructing\n\nits officers on how to treat property and evidence that they find.\n\nNothing in the policy tells officers what to do when inventorying\n\ncontainers, such as whether to open those containers. The MDEA also\n\nhas policies regarding inventory searches which do not address the\n\nproper procedures for dealing with a closed container.\n\n          At the suppression hearing, Agent Hutchings testified that\n\nthere is no written policy on how to inventory closed containers.\n\nAgent Hutchings also testified that if he found a coat from a citizen\n\non the street, \"It would be the same as in the situation here.\n\nAnything -- the jacket and its contents within it would be logged and\n\nlabeled and placed into evidence for either safekeeping or for . . .\n\ncourt preparation or for analysis.\"\n\n                                 II.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          Generally, our review of a district court’s denial of a\n\nsuppression motion is plenary. See United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d\n\n1306, 1311 (1st Cir. 1994).    Moreover, we will uphold a district\n\ncourt's decision to deny a suppression motion provided that any\n\nreasonable view of the evidence supports the decision. See United\n\nStates v. Charles, 213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 2000); see also United\n\nStates v. García, 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir. 1993). However, we\n\nreview the factual findings of the district court for clear error. See\n\nUnited States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996). \"A clear\n\nerror exists only if, after considering all the evidence, we are left\n\nwith a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\"\n\nId.; see also United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1992). \"This deference to the district court's findings of facts\n\n'reflects our awareness that the trial judge, who hears the testimony,\n\nobserves the witnesses' demeanor and evaluates the facts first hand,\n\nsits in the best position to determine what actually happened.'\"\n\nCharles, 213 F.3d at 18 (quoting United States v. Young, 105 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 1997)).\n\n                                  A.\n\n          The district court held that the contents of the jar were\n\nproperly obtained during a standardized inventory. To reach that\n\nholding, the district court made a crucial factual finding: that both\n\nthe MDEA and the Bangor Police Department have unwritten addenda to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ftheir inventory policies which require officers to open closed\n\ncontainers.\n\n            Here Agent Hutchings testified that any jacket and its\n\ncontents would be treated similarly, regardless of the circumstances\n\nunder which the police obtained custody of the jacket. Therefore, it\n\nwas not clear error for the district court to find an unwritten policy\n\nrequiring officers to open and investigate all closed containers when\n\nperforming an inventory.\n\n            A warrantless search is permitted under the Fourth Amendment\n\nif it is carried out pursuant to a standardized inventory policy. See\n\nIllinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 647-48 (1983).              Such a\n\nstandardized inventory policy may be unwritten. See United States v.\n\nInfante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States\n\nv. Macera-Londono, 912 F.2d 373, 375 (1st Cir. 1990). Because the\n\ndistrict court found that there was a standardized, albeit unwritten,\n\ninventory policy compelling officers to open containers to determine\n\ntheir contents during an inventory, the drug evidence was properly\n\nobtained.\n\n                                   B.\n\n            Appellant also challenges the search saying that the\n\ninventory was clearly a \"ruse\" used to search for drugs. Regardless of\n\nwhat appellant suggests, the law is clear. The subjective intent of\n\nthe officers is not relevant so long as they conduct a search according\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fto a standardized inventory policy. See Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U.S.\n\n367, 373 (1987). Because the inventory was conducted in accordance\n\nwith standard procedure, it was valid.\n\n                                III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court’s\n\ndenial of the appellant’s motion to suppress.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

Anything &#8212; the jacket and its contents within it would be logged and labeled and placed into evidence for either safekeeping or for ... court preparation or for analysis.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, our review of a district court's denial of a suppression motion is plenary. <i>See United States v. DeMasi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195694\"><a href=\"/opinion/195694/united-states-v-de-masi/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, 1311 (1st Cir.1994). Moreover, we will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion provided that any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision. <i>See United States v. Charles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198941\"><a href=\"/opinion/198941/united-states-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also United States v. Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598972\"><a href=\"/opinion/598972/united-states-v-jose-a-garcia-united-states-v-pablo-h-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1167 (1st Cir.1993). However, we review the factual findings of the district court for clear error. <i>See United States v. McCarthy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196595\"><a href=\"/opinion/196595/united-states-v-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 529 (1st Cir.1996). \"A clear error exists only if, after considering all the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v. McLaughlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578198\"><a href=\"/opinion/578198/united-states-v-bernard-michael-mclaughlin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1992). \"This deference to the district court's findings of facts `reflects our awareness that the trial judge, who hears the testimony, observes the witnesses' demeanor and evaluates the facts first hand, sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.'\" <i>Charles,</i> 213 F.3d at 18 (quoting <i>United States v. Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197172\"><a href=\"/opinion/197172/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the contents of the jar were properly obtained during a standardized inventory. To reach that holding, the district court made a crucial factual finding: that both the MDEA and the Bangor Police Department have unwritten addenda to their inventory policies which require officers to open closed containers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here Agent Hutchings testified that any jacket and its contents would be treated similarly, regardless of the circumstances under which the police obtained custody of the jacket. Therefore, it was not clear error for the district court to find an unwritten policy requiring officers to open and investigate all closed containers when performing an inventory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A warrantless search is permitted under the Fourth Amendment if it is carried out pursuant to a standardized inventory policy. <i>See Illinois v. Lafayette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110976\"><a href=\"/opinion/110976/illinois-v-lafayette/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 647-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110976\"><a href=\"/opinion/110976/illinois-v-lafayette/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2605</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110976\"><a href=\"/opinion/110976/illinois-v-lafayette/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span> (1983). Such a standardized inventory policy may be unwritten. <i>See United States v. Infante-Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195160\"><a href=\"/opinion/195160/united-states-v-infante/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 503 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also United States v. Mancera-Londono,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547048\"><a href=\"/opinion/547048/united-states-v-alfonso-mancera-londono-aka-alfonso-mancera-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, 375 (1st Cir.1990). Because the district court found that there was a standardized, albeit unwritten, inventory policy compelling officers to open containers to determine their contents during an inventory, the drug evidence was properly obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also challenges the search saying that the inventory was clearly a \"ruse\" used to search for drugs. Regardless of what appellant suggests, the law is clear. The subjective intent of the officers is not relevant so long as they conduct a search according to a standardized inventory policy. <i>See Colorado v. Bertine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111788\"><a href=\"/opinion/111788/colorado-v-bertine/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111788\"><a href=\"/opinion/111788/colorado-v-bertine/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span> (1987). Because the inventory was conducted in accordance with standard procedure, it was valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's denial of the appellant's motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
