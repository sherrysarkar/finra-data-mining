We  affirm the  dismissal of  plaintiffs'\r                            \r\n\naction  for the reasons stated  by the district  court in its\r\n\nJanuary 31, 1996 decision.\r\n\nNo basis warranting Judge  Fuste's recusal was stated in\r\n\nany of plaintiffs' motions.\r\n\nWith  respect  to  the district  court's  order  barring\r\n\nplaintiff from proceeding pro se in the future, we clarify as\r\n\nfollows.  The last  sentence of the court's January  31, 1996\r\n\norder is vacated and the following is substituted:\r\n\n     Mr.  Alfredo  Hualde-Redin  is  enjoined  from\r\nfiling any civil action pro se in the United States\r\nDistrict  Court  for the  District  of Puerto  Rico\r\nwithout  first obtaining permission from that court\r\nto proceed pro se.  In seeking leave to proceed pro\r\nse,  Mr.  Alfredo  Hualde-Redin  must  (1)  clearly\r\ncaption his  motion as an \"Application  Pursuant to\r\nCourt Order  Seeking Leave to Proceed  Pro Se,\" (2)\r\nattach  a copy  of this  order to  the motion,  (3)\r\ncertify  that  the  claim  or claims  he  seeks  to\r\npresent  are  new claims  never  before  raised and\r\ndisposed of on the merits by any federal court, (4)\r\ncertify that the claim  or claims are not frivolous\r\nor  taken in  bad  faith, and  (5)  include in  the\r\nmotion the following information:\r\n\n          A.  A list of all lawsuits currently\r\n     pending  or  filed  previously  with  the\r\n     district   court,  including   the  name,\r\n     number, and citation,  if applicable,  of\r\n     each  case,  and  the  current  status or\r\n     disposition of any appeal; and\r\n\n          B.   A  list apprising  the district\r\n     court of all  outstanding injunctions  or\r\n     orders  limiting  plaintiff's  access  to\r\n     federal   court,  including   orders  and\r\n     injunctions  requiring plaintiff  to seek\r\n     leave to file matters pro se or requiring\r\n     him to  be  represented by  an  attorney,\r\n     including the name, number, and citation,\r\n\n                        -2-\r\r\n\n     if  applicable, of  all  such  orders  or\r\n     injunctions.\r\n\nFailure to  comply strictly with the  terms of this\r\ninjunction will  be sufficient grounds  for denying\r\nleave to proceed pro se.\r\n\nThe order, as clarified, is affirmed.  Our clarification does\r\n\nnot   prevent  the  district   court  from  imposing  further\r\n\nconditions  or  sanctions  in   the  future  if  the  present\r\n\ninjunction is  not  sufficient  to  curb  Mr.  Hualde-Redin's\r\n\nfrivolous  and  abusive  litigation.   Even  if  Mr.  Alfredo\r\n\nHualde-Redin  does  certify  in   the  terms  specified,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  retains authority to deny  the Application in\r\n\nthe exercise of its reasoned discretion.\r\n\nAppellees  have  requested  attorneys'  fees   in  their\r\n\nbriefs.   Although  appellants'  appellate arguments  are all\r\n\nfrivolous, we  deny appellees'  request  for attorneys'  fees\r\n\nbecause  appellees have not  yet filed a  separate motion for\r\n\nattorneys' fees  as required  by Fed.  R. App.  P. 38.   This\r\n\ndenial is without prejudice to filing a motion in  compliance\r\n\nwith Fed. R. App. P.  38 and Loc. R. 39.2.   Appellees' costs\r\n\npursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 39 will be allowed.\r\n\nThe judgment, as clarified, is affirmed.\r                                                        \r\n\n                        -3-\r\r\n",
