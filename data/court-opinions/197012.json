Demeris, d/b/a Aki's Gulf (\"Demeris\") pursuant to the\r\n\nPetroleum Marketing  Practices Act,  15 U.S.C.     2801, et  seq.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(the \"Act\").\r\n\n          Demeris was  a  franchisee  of  Cumberland  motor  fuel\r\n\nproducts  and rented  one of  its gasoline  stations.   A dispute\r\n\narose regarding  the respective rights of  Demeris and Cumberland\r\n\nwhen the  latter attempted to terminate  the franchise agreement.\r\n\nDemeris  sought  and  was  granted a  preliminary  injunction  to\r\n\nprevent Cumberland from effectuating the termination.  By its own\r\n\nterms, the preliminary injunction dissolved as of August 1, 1996,\r\n\na  date  which coincided  with  the  termination  period  of  the\r\n\nfranchise agreement.\r\n\n          Cumberland's  main claim  is  that  the District  Court\r\n\nabused its discretion and committed errors of law when it granted\r\n\nthe preliminary injunction to  Demeris, due to Cumberland's clear\r\n\nlegal right  to terminate Demeris's  franchise under 15  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2802.  However, after  reviewing the briefs filed by  the parties\r\n\nafter oral arguments,  which indicated the present  status of the\r\n\nfranchise  agreement  and  briefed  the  issue  of  mootness,  we\r\n\nconclude that Comberland's claim is moot.\r\n\n          It is undisputed that as of August 1, 1996, Demeris had\r\n\nvacated the  premises in question.   Furthermore, it  is Demeris'\r\n\nstated position that \"the franchise ceased operations on August 1\r\n\n[consistent with] the  terms of the injunction and  [pursuant to]\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nthe parties' April 4  [settlement/franchise] agreement.\"  It also\r\n\nappears that  Demeris has  \"decided not to  contest [Cumberland's\r\n\nrejection of  the franchise  assignment proposed by  Demeris] and\r\n\nhas so informed [Cumberland].\"\r\n\n          It is well settled that a case is moot \"when the issues\r\n\npresented  are no longer 'live'.\"  United States Parole Comm'n v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGeraghty,  445 U.S.  388, 395  (1980).   The requirement  that an\r                  \r\n\nactual case and  controversy exist  at the time  a federal  court\r\n\nrenders its decision  is a jurisdictional mandate  of Article III\r\n\nof the Constitution, one that precludes the issuance of  advisory\r\n\nor academic  opinions.
