Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nGary Sinawski for appellant.\r\nPhyllis Gardiner, with whom Andrew Ketterer, Attorney General,\r\nThomas D. Warren, State Solicitor, and Peter J. Brann, Assistant\r\nAttorney General, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 2, 1999\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  Following the 1996 presidential\r\nelection, Maine's Secretary of State informed plaintiff-appellant\r\nMaine Green Party that it was disqualified from official party\r\nstatus because its presidential nominee, Ralph Nader, had failed to\r\nreceive at least 5% of the Maine presidential vote.  See 21-A\r\nM.R.S.A.  301(1)(C) (1992) (requiring, inter alia, previously-\r\nqualified parties to receive at least 5% of the presidential vote\r\nin presidential election years and at least 5% of the gubernatorial\r\nvote in gubernatorial election years to retain official party\r\nstatus).  Plaintiff subsequently filed a declaratory judgment\r\naction claiming, insofar as is here relevant, that  301(1)(C)'s\r\npresidential vote requirement violates plaintiff's First and\r\nFourteenth Amendment rights because it effectively prohibits the\r\nformation of new political parties that lack national\r\norganizations.  In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary\r\njudgment.\r\nAs developed in its summary judgment papers, plaintiff's\r\nargument was a tripartite syllogism:  (1) \"the backing of a\r\nnationally known and reasonably capable national party is essential\r\nfor a presidential candidate of a state party if he or she is to\r\nhave credibility with the voters in that state,\" Plaintiff's\r\nObjection to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Cross\r\nMotion for Summary Judgment with Incorporated Memorandum of Law at\r\n7; (2) Maine's presidential vote requirement has the practical\r\neffect of \"prohibit[ing] the formation of third parties from within\r\nthe State of Maine that have no national organization[s],\" id. at\r\n10, and (3) the presidential vote requirement thus forecloses the\r\ndevelopment of new political parties in Maine, as new parties will\r\nalmost inevitably lack national organizations, see id.  In\r\npresenting this argument, plaintiff also asserted that it had had\r\nno intention of fielding a candidate for the 1996 presidential\r\nelection; it had only done so after learning that it faced\r\ndisqualification and in the hope that Mr. Nader would receive\r\nenough of the vote to obviate the need for this litigation.\r\nThe district court referred the matter to Magistrate\r\nJudge Cohen for a report and recommendation.  Magistrate Judge\r\nCohen recommended that summary judgment be entered for the State\r\nand against plaintiff.  He initially questioned the foundational\r\npremise of plaintiff's argument, reasoning that \"it is possible\r\nthat Maine voters who care enough about the official status of a\r\nnew political party would be willing to vote for that party's\r\npresidential candidate even if that candidate cannot win because he\r\nor she lacks a national organization or presence.\"  Maine Green\r\nParty v. Secretary of State, Civil No. 96-261-B-C, Recommended\r\nDecision on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment at 12 (D. Me. filed\r\nDec. 24, 1997).  In any event, he concluded that the presidential\r\nvote requirement was insufficiently burdensome to warrant strict\r\nscrutiny, see id. at 12-14 (applying Supreme Court and First\r\nCircuit case law), suggesting that \"the restriction at issue here\r\nin no way regulates the organization and development of political\r\nparties,\" id. at 14-15.  In declining to apply strict scrutiny,\r\nMagistrate Judge Cohen contrasted  301(1)(C) with statutes\r\nprohibiting the governing bodies of political parties from\r\nendorsing candidates in their parties' primaries, see Eu v. San\r\nFrancisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 222-33\r\n(1989) (striking down such a statute), and with statutes\r\nprohibiting political parties from allowing independent voters to\r\nparticipate in their primaries, see Tashjian v. Republican Party of\r\nConn., 479 U.S. 208, 213-25 (1986) (similar).  Applying the more\r\nlenient rational basis review, Magistrate Judge Cohen concluded\r\nthat  301(1)(C) passed constitutional muster with room to spare. \r\nSee Maine Green Party, Recommended Decision at 14-16. \r\nApparently after having secured new counsel, plaintiff\r\nobjected to the report and recommendation.  But its objection set\r\nforth an additional argument not urged in the summary judgment\r\npapers:  that it would be unconstitutional to apply  301(1)(C) to\r\na party, like itself, which chooses to organize solely on the state\r\nand local level.  We pause here to emphasize this shift in\r\nplaintiff's position.  Prior to filing its objection to the report\r\nand recommendation, the thrust of plaintiff's argument, as we have\r\nsaid, was that it would be unconstitutional to apply  301(1)(C)'s\r\npresidential vote requirement to a new party, like itself, that\r\nlacked the resources to support a national organization.  In\r\ncontrast, plaintiff's objection for the first time suggested that\r\nplaintiff's lack of a national organization was instead an\r\noutgrowth of the party's philosophical commitment to operate only\r\non the state and local level.  The district court, facing time\r\nconstraints related to the then-upcoming 1996 primary elections,\r\naccepted the magistrate judge's recommended disposition without\r\ncommenting upon the new twist put on plaintiff's argument by\r\nplaintiff's new counsel, or even indicating whether it had given\r\nthe argument plenary consideration.    \r\nOn appeal, plaintiff has effectively elected to develop\r\nand press only the argument that application to it of  301(1)(C)'s\r\npresidential vote requirement unconstitutionally interferes with\r\none of its associational first principles:  to remain a solely\r\nlocal party.  By way of elaborating this position, plaintiff\r\nfurther asserts before us that it has \"a constitutional right to\r\nchoose not to run candidates for president at all.\"  Appellant's\r\nBrief at 13.  The State, though apparently perceiving plaintiff's\r\nargumentative shift, has not presented us with a developed\r\nresponsive argument; it has merely sought to distinguish Eu and\r\nTashjian, and it has made little mention of plaintiff's asserted\r\nright not to run presidential candidates.   \r\nThe distinction between the position taken by plaintiff\r\nat the summary judgment stage and the position taken by plaintiff\r\non appeal strikes us as potentially crucial.  If, on the one hand,\r\nplaintiff was unable to field a viable presidential candidate\r\nbecause it was new and therefore lacked the support and resources\r\nto implement a national organization, we could, at the very least,\r\nrest assured that  301(1)(C) was operating within contemplated\r\ncircumstances.  The statute plainly was intended to assure that\r\nofficial parties be sufficiently supported.  See Jenness v.\r\nFortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442 (1971) (\"[T]here is surely an important\r\nstate interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a\r\nsignificant modicum of support before printing the name of a\r\npolitical organization's candidate on the ballot.\"); see alsoLibertarian Party of Maine v. Diamond, 992 F.2d 365, 371-72 (1stCir. 1993) (state may properly require a political party to\r\ndemonstrate continued \"substantial support\" among the electorate as\r\na condition of official party status).  Use of the presidential\r\nvote requirement to exclude from the ballot a party formed on a\r\nmore traditional model (i.e., one that intends, at least at some\r\npoint in time, to nominate candidates for all elective offices\r\nvoted on within a state) but insufficiently developed at the\r\npresent time to nominate a minimally viable presidential candidate\r\nwould seem consonant with the statute's purpose.  \r\nIf, on the other hand, plaintiff's lack of a national\r\norganization (and concomitant decision not to nominate presidential\r\ncandidates) stemmed from a philosophical commitment to devote\r\nitself solely to issues with direct bearing on Maine or to nominate\r\nonly candidates who could be elected to office by the Maine\r\nelectorate, matters might be different.  Forcing such a party to\r\nfield a presidential candidate might well be regarded as a direct\r\ninfringement of the party's core protected activity   an\r\ninfringement that is, under relevant precedent, to be skeptically\r\nscrutinized.  See Eu, 489 U.S. at 230 (treating as core protected\r\nactivity political party's \"discretion in how to organize itself,\r\nconduct its affairs, and select its leaders\"); Tashjian, 479 U.S.\r\nat 224 (Constitution protects a party's \"determination . . . of the\r\nstructure which best allows it to pursue its political goals\").  \r\n     We come, then, to our fundamental problem:  the argument\r\nplaintiff presses on appeal was not timely asserted in the district\r\ncourt, see Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (\"The district court is under no obligation to discover or\r\narticulate new legal theories for a party challenging a report and\r\nrecommendation issued by a magistrate judge.\");  Paterson-Leitch\r\nCo., Inc. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985,\r\n990 (1st Cir. 1988) (similar); Borden v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human\r\nServs., 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Appellant was entitled to\r\na de novo review by the district court of the [magistrate judge's]\r\nrecommendations to which he objected, however he was not entitled\r\nto a de novo review of an argument never raised.\") (citation\r\nomitted), yet the argument made to the magistrate judge is not\r\nhere renewed, at least not in a developed fashion.   \r\n\nUnder the circumstances, we think the prudent course is\r\nto affirm the judgment of the district court without passing on the\r\nmerits of plaintiff's appellate argument.  Although the district\r\ncourt's boilerplate affirmance of the magistrate judge's report and\r\nrecommendation does not explicitly indicate that it rejected\r\nplaintiff's \"new\" argument on grounds of waiver (as it would have\r\nbeen within its rights to do, see Santiago, 138 F.3d at 4;\r\nPaterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 990-91; Borden, 836 F.2d at 6), we\r\nthink it doubtful that the court gave the argument plenary\r\nconsideration, given its silence on the matter and plaintiff's\r\nutter lack of explanation for (indeed, acknowledgment of) not\r\nhaving advanced the argument earlier.  Moreover, we have\r\nconsiderable doubt as to whether the summary judgment record even\r\nsupports plaintiff's new position; despite a number of affidavits\r\nwhich stated that plaintiff was formed to participate in state and\r\nlocal political activities, plaintiff also filed an affidavit\r\nmaking clear that, during the 1996-97 time frame, a number of\r\nplaintiff's founding members were taking steps towards forming a\r\nnational Green party.  See Declaration of Nancy Allen at  8-9. \r\nWe thus believe that a remand for purposes of clarification would\r\nbe an exercise in empty formalism.\r\nMoreover, a number of the minimalist principles\r\nunderlying our waiver rules support avoidance of a merits ruling in\r\nthis case.  See Cass R. Sunstein, The Supreme Court, 1995 Term  \r\nForeword:  Leaving Things Undecided, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 6-8\r\n(1996) (summarizing the jurisprudential underpinnings of the\r\npresumption towards decisional minimalism) (hereafter \"Sunstein\"). \r\nOur resolution not only avoids an unnecessary constitutional\r\ndecision, see, e.g., Three Affiliated Tribes v. Wold Eng'g, P.C.,\r\n467 U.S. 138, 157 (1984), but it leaves undecided the\r\nconstitutionality of an application of a state statute in\r\ncircumstances that may well be beyond the statute's contemplation\r\nand where we are not even certain that the State would apply it. \r\nWith respect to whether these circumstances are within the\r\nstatute's contemplation, we note that the statute appears to\r\nproceed from the assumption that political parties will wish to\r\nnominate presidential candidates; we have before us no evidence of\r\na legislative intent to keep off the ballot well-supported parties\r\nthat are philosophically opposed to participating in presidential\r\npolitics.  Cf. Sunstein, 110 Harv. L. Rev. at 7 (noting a\r\npresumption against deciding and implementing a statute's\r\nhypothetical purposes).  And with respect to whether the State\r\nwould even apply the statute to a solely local party, we note an\r\nabsence of evidence that plaintiff ever informed the State prior to\r\nits objection to the report and recommendation that it was\r\ncommitted to being a solely local party, or that its local\r\ncharacter implied a commitment to abstain from nominating\r\npresidential candidates.  Cf. id. (courts should strive to avoid\r\nrulings in areas not \"ripe\" for decision or where their decisions\r\nmay well be advisory in fact).  \r\nIn addition, our resolution avoids a merits ruling where\r\nthere has been no real adverse argumentation of the point in\r\nquestion.  Cf. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of\r\nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 572 (1993) (Souter, J., concurring in part\r\nand concurring in the judgment) (\"Sound judicial decisionmaking\r\nrequires 'both a vigorous prosecution and a vigorous defense' of\r\nthe issues in dispute . . . and a constitutional rule announced suasponte is entitled to less deference than one addressed on full\r\nbriefing and argument.\") (citation omitted).  And it does so where\r\nthe costs of an erroneous ruling (a strong possibility given the\r\nlack of adverse argumentation and relevant record development)\r\ncould be very high for states and for developing political parties. \r\nSee Sunstein, 110 Harv. L. Rev. at 18-19.   \r\nBefore concluding, we respond to one other point made in\r\nJudge Campbell's opinion concurring in the judgment.  Although we\r\nalready have explained our disagreement with Judge Campbell that\r\nthe argument made in the summary judgment papers and the argument\r\nmade on appeal are essentially the same, and/or that the argument\r\nmade on appeal was subsumed within the argument made at summary\r\njudgment, see supra at 6-7, we think it important to emphasize that\r\nthis is a qualitatively different situation from one where a claim\r\nmade below   for example, a claim that a search was unreasonable\r\nunder the Fourth Amendment   is amplified by appellate counsel\r\nwith, for example, novel policy arguments never presented to the\r\ndistrict court.  The present situation involves a material shift in\r\na factual position taken by plaintiff as to why it had no national\r\norganization in 1996; it is tantamount to a plaintiff arguing \"I\r\nwas fired because my boss didn't like me\" below and then arguing \"I\r\nwas fired because my boss doesn't like elderly workers such as me\"\r\non appeal.  We think it clear that our waiver rules ought to\r\npreclude such a shift.\r\nAffirmed.  No costs.\r\n\n              (Separate opinion follows). \r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge (concurring in the\r\njudgment).  I agree with my colleagues that the judgment below\r\nshould be affirmed.  I write separately because I disagree with my\r\ncolleagues' application of the waiver rule in the circumstances of\r\nthis case.\r\nMy colleagues hold that appellant Maine Green Party has \r\nwaived its First Amendment \"associational\" argument in its entirety\r\nbecause of a shift in the nature of the argument from the time it\r\nwas first presented to the magistrate judge to the time it was\r\nargued to the district court and, now, on appeal.  With respect, I\r\nbelieve this holding is without support in the case law and that it \r\nrepresents an unworkably narrow application of the conventional\r\nrule that issues not argued in the nisi prius tribunal may not\r\nsubsequently be raised in reviewing courts.     \r\nIt seems to me that the argument now pressed on appeal by\r\nthe Green Party   that Maine's 5% presidential vote requirement\r\nviolated their First Amendment associational right to choose how\r\nthey wish to organize   was sufficiently presented in the first\r\ninstance to the magistrate judge to avoid any question of waiver. \r\nIn its original cross-motion for summary judgment, filed with the\r\nmagistrate judge, the Green Party contended that Maine's 5%\r\npresidential vote requirement \"infringes upon the plaintiffs'\r\nrights to organize as they see fit.\"  (Emphasis supplied.)  The\r\nParty contended that it was organized in Maine around a \"serious\r\ncandidate for Governor\" who gained the support of 33,000 voters for\r\n\"ideas and positions concerning issues of importance on the state\r\nlevel,\" and that its members \"desire to achieve meaningful\r\nparticipation in state and local politics.\"  In support of this\r\nargument, the Green Party cited the controlling Supreme Court\r\nprecedent, to wit, Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central\r\nCom., 489 U.S. 214 (1989) and Tashjian v. Republican Party of\r\nConn., 479 U.S. 208 (1986), and asserted that \"[t]o disqualify the\r\nParty because it has no national organization and no serious\r\ncandidate for the presidency thus violates the members' rights as\r\ndelineated in Eu and Tashjian.\"  \r\nOn appeal, the Green Party and its members, citing, interalia, Eu and Tashjian, continue to state that they want to be\r\nformed locally, and not on a national level, \"either because they\r\nare too new to have a national political organization or because\r\nthey choose to remain local.\"  I see no distinction sufficient to\r\njustify application of the waiver rule between the First Amendment\r\nassociational argument put to the magistrate judge and the argument\r\nnow presented on appeal.      \r\nMy colleagues claim a shift because the 5% presidential\r\nvote criterion (necessitating a strong nationwide presence) was\r\ninitially claimed to be unconstitutionally burdensome only because\r\nthe Maine party was new, while now it is said to be too burdensome\r\nbecause it interferes with the Green Party's philosophy favoring a\r\nlocal, decentralized party.  It is not clear to me, however, that\r\nthe arguments were ever so neatly compartmentalized; and even if\r\nthe original associational argument focused less on philosophy and\r\nmore on the practical difficulties of tying party status to the \r\nshowing of a viable presidential candidate, I do not believe the\r\ndifference in emphasis renders the present formulation a\r\nsignificantly different argument.  Both versions expressly rest on\r\nthe freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment.  The\r\nGreen Party initially claimed, and has continued to claim, that the\r\nMaine ballot access law infringes upon its members' right to\r\norganize as they \"see fit.\"  I think it is improper for us to\r\nrefuse to consider the Party's current variation simply because its\r\nprecursor, which invoked the same constitutional provision and\r\nprecedent, emphasized the unfairness of forcing a newly-formed\r\ngroup to field a presidential candidate capable of attracting\r\nsignificant Maine support while the later version stresses the\r\ndesire of the Green Party to concentrate on candidates for local\r\noffices.  Compare Carribean Mushroom Co. v. Government Develop.\r\nBank, 102 F.3d 1307, 1309-10 (1st Cir. 1996) (variation of argument\r\namounting to a narrowing of position not a new argument).  \r\nMy colleagues cite to no cases where arguments as closely\r\nintertwined as these have been treated as distinct arguments for\r\nwaiver purposes.  My experience with constitutional argumentation\r\nis that appellate courts are broadly tolerant of argumentative\r\nshifts so long as the underlying constitutional provision remains\r\nthe same and no new facts need be found.  Future litigants will not \r\ndare to replace trial counsel with more sophisticated appellate\r\ncounsel if they have to fear that better-honed constitutional \r\narguments, based on the same underlying theory, will be deemed\r\n\"new\" and therefore waived.  This is not a case in which, having\r\nsought relief before the magistrate judge under certain\r\nconstitutional or statutory provisions, appellant has switched to\r\ndifferent provisions.  Nor is this a case where an argument \r\ndepends upon additional factual development in the lower court. \r\nNor does this court need to read cases different from those cited\r\nto the magistrate judge in order to address the present argument. \r\nNor do I discern any major shift in underlying theory.         \r\nThe waiver concept founders here for other reasons also. \r\nI do not think that my colleagues can rely upon Paterson-Leitch v.\r\nMassachusetts Elec., 840 F.2d 985 (1st Cir. 1988), and the other\r\ncited cases to establish that the Green Party is precluded from\r\nraising its current version of the association argument.  In\r\nPaterson-Leitch, for example, having failed to plead or argue\r\nbefore the magistrate judge that it was entitled to sue as a third-\r\nparty beneficiary of a construction management contract, the\r\nplaintiff attempted to assert third-party beneficiary status for\r\nthe first time before the district judge, in its objections to the\r\nmagistrate's recommended disposition.  The district judge expressly\r\nrefused to entertain the argument, finding that it had not been\r\npresented to the magistrate.  We affirmed the district court's\r\nrefusal.  \r\nThe circumstances here are altogether different.  Not\r\nonly does the argument here not raise an issue fundamentally\r\ndifferent from that previously argued to the magistrate judge, the\r\ndistrict judge never, for that or any reason, declined to hear the\r\npresent argument when made, as it was, by the Green Party.  Nor did\r\nthe State of Maine argue below or in this court that the Green\r\nParty's argument before the district court should be disregarded\r\nbecause not previously raised.  It is only this court itself which,\r\nfor the first time, believes that it has detected a sea-change \r\nsuch as to warrant our refusing to decide both the purported new\r\nargument and the original argument put to the magistrate judge.  \r\nI simply do not see how we can assume that the district\r\njudge refused or failed to consider the \"new\" argument.  For all\r\nthat appears, he fully considered it.  While the district court\r\nwould have been \"within its rights\" to refuse to consider a \"new\"\r\nargument, it plainly had the power to do so.  The district court,\r\nit is true, adopted the magistrate judge's report; but presumably\r\nit did so because it believed the magistrate judge had adequately\r\naddressed the associational argument.  This may or may not have\r\nbeen so   that matter would be fair game for our appellate review\r\nbut I don't see how we can read into the court's silence a\r\nrefusal to decide all the arguments put to it, including the ones\r\nwe now decide were waived.  In the absence of any determination by\r\nthe district court that the Green Party's argument was new and\r\nimpermissible, and in the further absence of any contention to this\r\neffect by the State of Maine either here or below, I see no basis\r\nfor our invocation of a waiver ground. \r\nIn sum, I believe that my colleagues have misapplied the\r\nwaiver rule.  The arguments before us are similar to those we\r\nregularly decide, requiring only research and analysis. I think\r\nthat we should address on the merits all the arguments raised. \r\nI would add that if my colleagues are dissatisfied with\r\nthe State of Maine's failure to answer all aspects of the Green\r\nParty's contentions on appeal, they could readily direct the State\r\nof Maine to brief further any of the points not sufficiently\r\ncovered in Maine's brief.\r\nWhile writing separately, I do not dissent from the\r\ncourt's affirmance of the judgment below.  As the Supreme Court\r\nrecently confirmed, the states have broad power to \"enact\r\nreasonable regulations of parties, elections, and ballots to reduce\r\nelection- and campaign-related disorder.\"  Timmons v. Twin Cities\r\nArea New Party, 117 S. Ct. 1364, 1369 (1997).  See also Tashjian,\r\n479 U.S. at 217 (Constitution grants states \"broad power to\r\nprescribe the 'Time, Places and Manner of holding Elections for\r\nSenators and Representatives,' Art. I.  4, which power is matched\r\nby state control over the election process for state offices\"). \r\nFor substantially the reasons set forth in Magistrate Judge Cohen's\r\nwell-reasoned report and recommendation, I believe that the Maine\r\nstatute falls within this broad grant of authority to the states. \r\nIn my view, the State of Maine, like certain other states which\r\nhave taken a similar stance, is entitled to define a political\r\nparty for ballot purposes as an organization that has demonstrated\r\nstrength in the fielding of a presidential candidate as well as\r\nlocal candidates.  I do not believe that the First Amendment takes\r\naway from the states the authority to adopt such a definition\r\nrooted, as it is, in our long national history in which political\r\nparties typically fit that model.  While the 5% presidential vote\r\nrequirement, as Magistrate Judge Cohen noted, requires that new\r\nparties like the Green party wage an \"uphill battle,\" the Green\r\nParty remains free \"to endorse whom it likes, to ally itself with\r\nothers, to nominate candidates for office, and to spread its\r\nmessage to all who will listen.\"  Timmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1371. \r\nAdditionally, there are alternative means for its candidates to get\r\non the ballot.  In these circumstances, I discern no violation of\r\nthe Green Party's associational rights.               \r\nThe Supreme Court has cautioned, \"[n]o bright line\r\nseparates permissible election-related regulation from\r\nunconstitutional infringements on First Amendment freedoms.\" \r\nTimmons, 117 S. Ct. at 1370.  In the present matter, it is far from\r\nclear from existing Supreme Court precedent that the Maine law is\r\nunconstitutional.  Granting the relief sought by the Green Party\r\ncalls for a major jurisprudential leap   a leap having major \r\nimplications not only for Maine but for many other states.  In such\r\ncircumstances, I think that courts of appeals should indulge the\r\npresumption of constitutionality to which state statutes and\r\nconstitutional provisions are entitled, leaving to the Supreme\r\nCourt, should it so desire, the creation of the innovative\r\nconstitutional jurisprudence needed to warrant such a radical\r\ninitiative.

See 21-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 301(1)(C) (1992) (requiring, inter alia, previously-qualified parties<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to receive at least 5% of the presidential vote in presidential election years and at least 5% of the gubernatorial vote in gubernatorial election years to retain official party status).  Plaintiff subsequently filed a declaratory judgment action claiming, insofar as is here relevant, that &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement violates plaintiff's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights because it effectively prohibits the formation of new political parties that lack national organizations.  In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As developed in its summary judgment papers, plaintiff's argument was a tripartite syllogism:  (1) \"the backing of a nationally known and reasonably capable national party is essential for a presidential candidate of a state party if he or she is to have credibility with the voters in that state,\" Plaintiff's Objection to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Cross Motion for Summary Judgment with Incorporated Memorandum of Law at 7;  (2) Maine's presidential vote requirement has the practical effect of \"prohibit [ing] the formation of third parties from within the State of Maine that have no national organization[s],\" id. at 10, and (3) the presidential vote requirement thus forecloses the development of new political parties in Maine, as new parties will almost inevitably lack national organizations, see id.   In presenting this argument, plaintiff also asserted that it had had no intention of fielding a candidate for the 1996 presidential election;  it had only done so after learning that it faced disqualification and in the hope that Mr. Nader would receive enough of the vote to obviate the need for this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Cohen for a report and recommendation.  Magistrate Judge Cohen recommended that summary judgment be entered for the State and against plaintiff.  He initially questioned the foundational premise of plaintiff's argument, reasoning that \"it is possible that Maine voters who care enough about the official status of a new political party would be willing to vote for that party's presidential candidate even if that candidate cannot win because he or she lacks a national organization or presence.\"  Maine Green Party v. Secretary of State, Civil No. 96-261-B-C, Recommended Decision on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment at 12 (D. Me. filed Dec. 24, 1997).  In any event, he concluded that the presidential vote requirement was insufficiently burdensome to warrant strict scrutiny, see id. at 12-14 (applying Supreme Court and First Circuit case law), suggesting that \"the restriction at issue here in no way regulates the organization and development of political parties,\" id. at 14-15.   In declining to apply strict scrutiny, Magistrate Judge Cohen contrasted &#167; 301(1)(C) with statutes prohibiting the governing bodies of political parties from endorsing candidates in their parties' primaries, see Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, 489 U.S. 214, 222-33, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (striking down such a statute), and with statutes prohibiting political parties from allowing independent voters to participate in their primaries, see Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 213-25, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986) (similar).  Applying the more lenient rational basis review, Magistrate Judge Cohen concluded that &#167; 301(1)(C) passed constitutional muster with room to spare.  See Maine Green Party, Recommended Decision at 14-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently after having secured new counsel, plaintiff objected to the report and recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  But its objection set forth an additional argument not urged in the summary judgment papers:  that it would be unconstitutional to apply &#167; 301(1)(C) to a party, like itself, which chooses to organize solely on the state and local level.  We pause here to emphasize this shift in plaintiff's position.  Prior to filing its objection to the report and recommendation, the thrust of plaintiff's argument, as we have said, was that it would be unconstitutional to apply &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement to a new party, like itself, that lacked the resources to support a national organization.  In contrast, plaintiff's objection for the first time suggested that plaintiff's lack of a national organization was instead an outgrowth of the party's philosophical commitment to operate only on the state and local level.  The district court, facing time constraints related to the then-upcoming 1998 primary elections, accepted the magistrate judge's recommended disposition without commenting upon the new twist put on plaintiff's argument by plaintiff's new counsel, or even indicating whether it had given the argument plenary consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiff has effectively elected to develop and press only the argument that application to it of &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement unconstitutionally interferes with one of its associational first principles:  to remain a solely local party.  By way of elaborating this position, plaintiff further asserts before us that it has \"a constitutional right to choose not to run candidates for president at all.\"   Appellant's Brief at 13.  The State, though apparently perceiving plaintiff's argumentative shift, has not presented us with a developed responsive argument;  it has merely sought to distinguish Eu and Tashjian, and it has made little mention of plaintiff's asserted right not to run presidential candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between the position taken by plaintiff at the summary judgment stage and the position taken by plaintiff on appeal strikes us as potentially crucial.  If, on the one hand, plaintiff was unable to field a viable presidential candidate because it was new and therefore lacked the support and resources to implement a national organization, we could, at the very least, rest assured that &#167; 301(1)(C) was operating within contemplated circumstances.  The statute plainly was intended to assure that official parties be sufficiently supported.  See Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 29 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971) (\"[T]here is surely an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization's candidate on the ballot.\");   see also Libertarian Party of Maine v. Diamond, 992 F.2d 365, 371-72 (1st Cir.1993) (state may properly require a political party to demonstrate continued \"substantial support\" among the electorate as a condition of official party status).  Use of the presidential vote requirement to exclude from the ballot a party formed on a more traditional model (i.e., one that intends, at least at some point in time, to nominate candidates for all elective offices voted on within a state) but insufficiently developed at the present time to nominate a minimally viable presidential candidate would seem consonant with the statute's purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on the other hand, plaintiff's lack of a national organization (and concomitant decision not to nominate presidential candidates) stemmed from a philosophical commitment to devote itself solely to issues with direct bearing on Maine or to nominate only candidates who could be elected to office by the Maine electorate, matters might be different.  Forcing such a party to field a presidential candidate might well be regarded as a direct infringement of the party's core protected activity--an infringement that is, under relevant precedent, to be skeptically scrutinized.  See Eu, 489 U.S. at 230, 109 S.Ct. 1013 (treating as core protected activity political party's \"discretion in how to organize itself, conduct its affairs, and select its leaders\");  Tashjian, 479 U.S. at 224, 107 S.Ct. 544 (Constitution protects a party's \"determination ... of the structure which best allows it to pursue its political goals\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come, then, to our fundamental problem:  the argument plaintiff presses on appeal was not timely asserted in the district court, see Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1998) (\"The district court is under no obligation to discover or articulate new legal theories for a party challenging a report and recommendation issued by a magistrate judge.\");  Paterson-Leitch Co., Inc. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir.1988) (similar);  Borden v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Appellant was entitled to a de novo review by the district court of the [magistrate judge's] recommendations to which he objected, however he was not entitled to a de novo review of an argument never raised.\")  (citation omitted)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>, yet the argument made to the magistrate judge is not here renewed, at least not in a developed fashion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the circumstances, we think the prudent course is to affirm the judgment of the district court without passing on the merits of plaintiff's appellate argument.  Although the district court's boilerplate affirmance of the magistrate judge's report and recommendation does not explicitly indicate that it rejected plaintiff's \"new\" argument on grounds of waiver (as it would have been within its rights to do, see Santiago, 138 F.3d at 4;  Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 990-91;  Borden, 836 F.2d at 6), we think it doubtful that the court gave the argument plenary consideration, given its silence on the matter and plaintiff's utter lack of explanation for (indeed, acknowledgment of) not having advanced the argument earlier.  Moreover, we have considerable doubt as to whether the summary judgment record even supports plaintiff's new position;  despite a number of affidavits which stated that plaintiff was formed to participate in state and local political activities, plaintiff also filed an affidavit making clear that, during the 1996-97 time frame, a number of plaintiff's founding members were taking steps towards forming a national Green party.  See Declaration of Nancy Allen at pp 8-9.  We thus believe that a remand for purposes of clarification would be an exercise in empty formalism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, a number of the minimalist principles underlying our waiver rules support avoidance of a merits ruling in this case.  See Cass R. Sunstein, The Supreme Court, 1995 Term--Foreword:  Leaving Things Undecided, 110 Harv.  L.Rev. 4, 6-8 (1996) (summarizing the jurisprudential underpinnings of the presumption towards decisional minimalism) (hereafter \"Sunstein\").  Our resolution not only avoids an unnecessary constitutional decision, see, e.g., Three Affiliated Tribes v. Wold Eng'g, P.C., 467 U.S. 138, 157, 104 S.Ct. 2267, 81 L.Ed.2d 113 (1984), but it leaves undecided the constitutionality of an application of a state statute in circumstances that may well be beyond the statute's contemplation and where we are not even certain that the State would apply it.   With respect to whether these circumstances are within the statute's contemplation, we note that the statute appears to proceed from the assumption that political parties will wish to nominate presidential candidates;  we have before us no evidence of a legislative intent to keep off the ballot well-supported parties that are philosophically opposed to participating in presidential politics.  Cf. Sunstein, 110 Harv.  L.Rev. at 7 (noting a presumption against deciding and implementing a statute's hypothetical purposes).  And with respect to whether the State would even apply the statute to a solely local party, we note an absence of evidence that plaintiff ever informed the State prior to its objection to the report and recommendation that it was committed to being a solely local party, or that its local character implied a commitment to abstain from nominating presidential candidates.  Cf. id.  (courts should strive to avoid rulings in areas not \"ripe\" for decision or where their decisions may well be advisory in fact).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, our resolution avoids a merits ruling where there has been no real adverse argumentation of the point in question.  Cf. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 572, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993) (Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\"Sound judicial decisionmaking requires 'both a vigorous prosecution and a vigorous defense' of the issues in dispute ... and a constitutional rule announced sua sponte is entitled to less deference than one addressed on full briefing and argument.\")  (citation omitted).  And it does so where the costs of an erroneous ruling (a strong possibility given the lack of adverse argumentation and relevant record development) could be very high for states and for developing political parties.  See Sunstein, 110 Harv.  L.Rev. at 18-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before concluding, we respond to one other point made in Judge Campbell's opinion concurring in the judgment.  Although we already have explained our disagreement with Judge Campbell that the argument made in the summary judgment papers and the argument made on appeal are essentially the same, and/or that the argument made on appeal was subsumed within the argument made at summary judgment, see supra at 6-7, we think it important to emphasize that this is a qualitatively different situation from one where a claim made below--for example, a claim that a search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment--is amplified by appellate counsel with, for example, novel policy arguments never presented to the district court.  The present situation involves a material shift in a factual position taken by plaintiff as to why it had no national organization in 1996;  it is tantamount to a plaintiff arguing \"I was fired because my boss didn't like me\" below and then arguing \"I was fired because my boss doesn't like elderly workers such as me\" on appeal.  We think it clear that our waiver rules ought to preclude such a shift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. No costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge (concurring in the judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with my colleagues that the judgment below should be affirmed.  I write separately because I disagree with my colleagues' application of the waiver rule in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues hold that appellant Maine Green Party has waived its First Amendment \"associational\" argument in its entirety because of a shift in the nature of the argument from the time it was first presented to the magistrate judge to the time it was argued to the district court and, now, on appeal.  With respect, I believe this holding is without support in the case law and that it represents an unworkably narrow application of the conventional rule that issues not argued in the nisi prius tribunal may not subsequently be raised in reviewing courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to me that the argument now pressed on appeal by the Green Party--that Maine's 5% presidential vote requirement violated their First Amendment associational right to choose how they wish to organize--was sufficiently presented in the first instance to the magistrate judge to avoid any question of waiver.  In its original cross-motion for summary judgment, filed with the magistrate judge, the Green Party contended that Maine's 5% presidential vote requirement \"infringes upon the plaintiffs' rights to organize as they see fit.  \"  (Emphasis supplied.)   The Party contended that it was organized in Maine around a \"serious candidate for Governor\" who gained the support of 33,000 voters for \"ideas and positions concerning issues of importance on the state level,\" and that its members \"desire to achieve meaningful participation in state and local politics.\"   In support of this argument, the Green Party cited the controlling Supreme Court precedent, to wit, Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Com., 489 U.S. 214, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) and Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986), and asserted that \"[t]o disqualify the Party because it has no national organization and no serious candidate for the presidency thus violates the members' rights as delineated in Eu and Tashjian.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Green Party and its members, citing, inter alia, Eu and Tashjian, continue to state that they want to be formed locally, and not on a national level, \"either because they are too new to have a national political organization or because they choose to remain local.\"   I see no distinction sufficient to justify application of the waiver rule between the First Amendment associational argument put to the magistrate judge and the argument now presented on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues claim a shift because the 5% presidential vote criterion (necessitating a strong nationwide presence) was initially claimed to be unconstitutionally burdensome only because the Maine party was new, while now it is said to be too burdensome because it interferes with the Green Party's philosophy favoring a local, decentralized party.  It is not clear to me, however, that the arguments were ever so neatly compartmentalized;  and even if the original associational argument focused less on philosophy and more on the practical difficulties of tying party status to the showing of a viable presidential candidate, I do not believe the difference in emphasis renders the present formulation a significantly different argument.  Both versions expressly rest on the freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment.  The Green Party initially claimed, and has continued to claim, that the Maine ballot access law infringes upon its members' right to organize as they \"see fit.\"   I think it is improper for us to refuse to consider the Party's current variation simply because its precursor, which invoked the same constitutional provision and precedent, emphasized the unfairness of forcing a newly-formed group to field a presidential candidate capable of attracting significant Maine support while the later version stresses the desire of the Green Party to concentrate on candidates for local offices.  Compare Caribbean Mushroom Co. v. Government Development Bank, 102 F.3d 1307, 1309-10 (1st Cir.1996) (variation of argument amounting to a narrowing of position not a new argument).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues cite to no cases where arguments as closely intertwined as these have been treated as distinct arguments for waiver purposes.  My experience with constitutional argumentation is that appellate courts are broadly tolerant of argumentative shifts so long as the underlying constitutional provision remains the same and no new facts need be found.  Future litigants will not dare to replace trial counsel with more sophisticated appellate counsel if they have to fear that better-honed constitutional arguments, based on the same underlying theory, will be deemed \"new\" and therefore waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  This is not a case in which, having sought relief before the magistrate judge under certain constitutional or statutory provisions, appellant has switched to different provisions.  Nor is this a case where an argument depends upon additional factual development in the lower court.  Nor does this court need to read cases different from those cited to the magistrate judge in order to address the present argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  Nor do I discern any major shift in underlying theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The waiver concept founders here for other reasons also.  I do not think that my colleagues can rely upon Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985 (1st Cir.1988), and the other cited cases to establish that the Green Party is precluded from raising its current version of the association argument.  In Paterson-Leitch, for example, having failed to plead or argue before the magistrate judge that it was entitled to sue as a third-party beneficiary of a construction management contract, the plaintiff attempted to assert third-party beneficiary status for the first time before the district judge, in its objections to the magistrate's recommended disposition.  The district judge expressly refused to entertain the argument, finding that it had not been presented to the magistrate.  We affirmed the district court's refusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances here are altogether different.  Not only does the argument here not raise an issue fundamentally different from that previously argued to the magistrate judge, the district judge never, for that or any reason, declined to hear the present argument when made, as it was, by the Green Party.  Nor did the State of Maine argue below or in this court that the Green Party's argument before the district court should be disregarded because not previously raised.  It is only this court itself which, for the first time, believes that it has detected a sea-change such as to warrant our refusing to decide both the purported new argument and the original argument put to the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I simply do not see how we can assume that the district judge refused or failed to consider the \"new\" argument.  For all that appears, he fully considered it.  While the district court would have been \"within its rights\" to refuse to consider a \"new\" argument, it plainly had the power to do so.  The district court, it is true, adopted the magistrate judge's report;  but presumably it did so because it believed the magistrate judge had adequately addressed the associational argument.  This may or may not have been so--that matter would be fair game for our appellate review--but I don't see how we can read into the court's silence a refusal to decide all the arguments put to it, including the ones we now decide were waived.  In the absence of any determination by the district court that the Green Party's argument was new and impermissible, and in the further absence of any contention to this effect by the State of Maine either here or below, I see no basis for our invocation of a waiver ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, I believe that my colleagues have misapplied the waiver rule.  The arguments before us are similar to those we regularly decide, requiring only research and analysis.  I think that we should address on the merits all the arguments raised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would add that if my colleagues are dissatisfied with the State of Maine's failure to answer all aspects of the Green Party's contentions on appeal, they could readily direct the State of Maine to brief further any of the points not sufficiently covered in Maine's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While writing separately, I do not dissent from the court's affirmance of the judgment below.  As the Supreme Court recently confirmed, the states have broad power to \"enact reasonable regulations of parties, elections, and ballots to reduce election and campaign-related disorder.\"  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 1369, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997).  See also Tashjian, 479 U.S. at 217, 107 S.Ct. 544 (Constitution grants states \"broad power to prescribe the 'Time, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,' Art.  I. &#167; 4, which power is matched by state control over the election process for state offices\").  For substantially the reasons set forth in Magistrate Judge Cohen's well-reasoned report and recommendation, I believe that the Maine statute falls within this broad grant of authority to the states.  In my view, the State of Maine, like certain other states which have taken a similar stance, is entitled to define a political party for ballot purposes as an organization that has demonstrated strength in the fielding of a presidential candidate as well as local candidates.  I do not believe that the First Amendment takes away from the states the authority to adopt such a definition rooted, as it is, in our long national history in which political parties typically fit that model.  While the 5% presidential vote requirement, as Magistrate Judge Cohen noted, requires that new parties like the Green party wage an \"uphill battle,\" the Green Party remains free \"to endorse whom it likes, to ally itself with others, to nominate candidates for office, and to spread its message to all who will listen.\"  Timmons, 117 S.Ct. at 1371, 520 U.S. 351.   Additionally, there are alternative means for its candidates to get on the ballot.  In these circumstances, I discern no violation of the Green Party's associational rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has cautioned, \"[n]o bright line separates permissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements on First Amendment freedoms.\"  Timmons, 117 S.Ct. at 1370, 520 U.S. 351.   In the present matter, it is far from clear from existing Supreme Court precedent that the Maine law is unconstitutional.  Granting the relief sought by the Green Party calls for a major jurisprudential leap--a leap having major implications not only for Maine but for many other states.  In such circumstances, I think that courts of appeals should indulge the presumption of constitutionality to which state statutes and constitutional provisions are entitled, leaving to the Supreme Court, should it so desire, the creation of the innovative constitutional jurisprudence needed to warrant such a radical initiative.  I accordingly concur in affirming the judgment of the district court, but on the merits rather than on the waiver ground put forward by my colleagues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under 21-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 302(1), a party can qualify to appear on the ballot by forming around a non-party candidate for governor or president who was nominated by petition and who received 5% of the total vote in the preceding gubernatorial or presidential election, provided the candidate consents to the formation of the party around him or her.  In 1994, Jonathan Carter, a registered Maine voter not enrolled in any party and nominated by petition, received 6.4% of the 1994 Maine gubernatorial vote.

Yet our careful review of the record has persuaded us that plaintiff's appellate argument was only sufficiently developed in plaintiff's objection to the report and recommendation.  In so ruling, we point out that plaintiff never sought to notify the magistrate judge that the State had misunderstood its position, even though the State's summary judgment motion and opposition to plaintiff's summary judgment motion quite clearly understood plaintiff only to be arguing that its lack of a national organization was a result of its newness as a party.  Nor did plaintiff either file a motion for reconsideration informing the magistrate judge that he had misunderstood its position (the magistrate judge clearly shared the State's understanding of plaintiff's position) or suggest to the district court in the objection to the report and recommendation that the magistrate judge had misunderstood its position</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Again, although a few sentences of plaintiff's appellate brief track points made by plaintiff in its summary judgment papers, plaintiff has presented us with neither a developed account of how the statute undermines the constitutional rights of new parties formed on the traditional model nor an explicit assessment of where the magistrate judge went wrong.  Moreover, in summarizing and then introducing its appellate argument, plaintiff advertises itself as arguing only that &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement, when applied to a party, like itself, that has chosen to remain solely local, runs afoul of the Constitution.  See Appellant's Brief at 12-13 (emphasizing that plaintiff is not claiming \"that Maine's election law is inhospitable to minor parties by itself,\" but only that &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement is unconstitutional \"as applied to plaintiff,\" which has \"a constitutional right to organize itself solely on the local level\");  see also Appellant's Reply Brief at 1 (asserting that plaintiff's appellate \"argument\" (plaintiff uses the singular) was not addressed by the State in its brief)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Unlike my colleagues, I do not perceive a \"material shift in a factual position taken by plaintiff.\"   See supra (emphasis in original).  Rather, the Green Party has refined somewhat the theory under which it claims Maine's 5% presidential vote requirement violates the rights of its members to freely associate, as protected by the First Amendment.  The situation is altogether different from the hypothetical posited by the majority, supra, in which a plaintiff shifts from arguing she was fired for a proper reason (\"my boss didn't like me\") to arguing she was fired for a wholly improper and illegal reason (\"because my boss doesn't like elderly workers such as me\").  Here, there has been no such radical shift in the Green Party's argument;  it has consistently argued that its members' right to organize as they \"see fit\" has been violated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Even supposing the Party is asserting a \"new\" argument rather than merely refining its original argument before the magistrate judge, we would not be obliged to reject deciding it.

Perhaps they believe that was abandoned and replaced by the \"new,\" waived argument, leaving the entire appeal in limbo.  It seems unusual that, merely by making a somewhat more sophisticated argument in the district court and here, the Green Party could have waived not only the new argument but the one the magistrate judge actually decided</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

See 21-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 301(1)(C) (1992) (requiring, inter alia, previously-qualified parties<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to receive at least 5% of the presidential vote in presidential election years and at least 5% of the gubernatorial vote in gubernatorial election years to retain official party status).  Plaintiff subsequently filed a declaratory judgment action claiming, insofar as is here relevant, that &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement violates plaintiff's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights because it effectively prohibits the formation of new political parties that lack national organizations.  In due course, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As developed in its summary judgment papers, plaintiff's argument was a tripartite syllogism:  (1) \"the backing of a nationally known and reasonably capable national party is essential for a presidential candidate of a state party if he or she is to have credibility with the voters in that state,\" Plaintiff's Objection to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Cross Motion for Summary Judgment with Incorporated Memorandum of Law at 7;  (2) Maine's presidential vote requirement has the practical effect of \"prohibit [ing] the formation of third parties from within the State of Maine that have no national organization[s],\" id. at 10, and (3) the presidential vote requirement thus forecloses the development of new political parties in Maine, as new parties will almost inevitably lack national organizations, see id.   In presenting this argument, plaintiff also asserted that it had had no intention of fielding a candidate for the 1996 presidential election;  it had only done so after learning that it faced disqualification and in the hope that Mr. Nader would receive enough of the vote to obviate the need for this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Cohen for a report and recommendation.  Magistrate Judge Cohen recommended that summary judgment be entered for the State and against plaintiff.  He initially questioned the foundational premise of plaintiff's argument, reasoning that \"it is possible that Maine voters who care enough about the official status of a new political party would be willing to vote for that party's presidential candidate even if that candidate cannot win because he or she lacks a national organization or presence.\"  Maine Green Party v. Secretary of State, Civil No. 96-261-B-C, Recommended Decision on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment at 12 (D. Me. filed Dec. 24, 1997).  In any event, he concluded that the presidential vote requirement was insufficiently burdensome to warrant strict scrutiny, see id. at 12-14 (applying Supreme Court and First Circuit case law), suggesting that \"the restriction at issue here in no way regulates the organization and development of political parties,\" id. at 14-15.   In declining to apply strict scrutiny, Magistrate Judge Cohen contrasted &#167; 301(1)(C) with statutes prohibiting the governing bodies of political parties from endorsing candidates in their parties' primaries, see Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 222-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span> (1986) (similar).  Applying the more lenient rational basis review, Magistrate Judge Cohen concluded that &#167; 301(1)(C) passed constitutional muster with room to spare.  See Maine Green Party, Recommended Decision at 14-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently after having secured new counsel, plaintiff objected to the report and recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  But its objection set forth an additional argument not urged in the summary judgment papers:  that it would be unconstitutional to apply &#167; 301(1)(C) to a party, like itself, which chooses to organize solely on the state and local level.  We pause here to emphasize this shift in plaintiff's position.  Prior to filing its objection to the report and recommendation, the thrust of plaintiff's argument, as we have said, was that it would be unconstitutional to apply &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement to a new party, like itself, that lacked the resources to support a national organization.  In contrast, plaintiff's objection for the first time suggested that plaintiff's lack of a national organization was instead an outgrowth of the party's philosophical commitment to operate only on the state and local level.  The district court, facing time constraints related to the then-upcoming 1998 primary elections, accepted the magistrate judge's recommended disposition without commenting upon the new twist put on plaintiff's argument by plaintiff's new counsel, or even indicating whether it had given the argument plenary consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiff has effectively elected to develop and press only the argument that application to it of &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement unconstitutionally interferes with one of its associational first principles:  to remain a solely local party.  By way of elaborating this position, plaintiff further asserts before us that it has \"a constitutional right to choose not to run candidates for president at all.\"   Appellant's Brief at 13.  The State, though apparently perceiving plaintiff's argumentative shift, has not presented us with a developed responsive argument;  it has merely sought to distinguish Eu and Tashjian, and it has made little mention of plaintiff's asserted right not to run presidential candidates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distinction between the position taken by plaintiff at the summary judgment stage and the position taken by plaintiff on appeal strikes us as potentially crucial.  If, on the one hand, plaintiff was unable to field a viable presidential candidate because it was new and therefore lacked the support and resources to implement a national organization, we could, at the very least, rest assured that &#167; 301(1)(C) was operating within contemplated circumstances.  The statute plainly was intended to assure that official parties be sufficiently supported.  See Jenness v. Fortson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108376\"><a href=\"/opinion/108376/jenness-v-fortson/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108376\"><a href=\"/opinion/108376/jenness-v-fortson/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Use of the presidential vote requirement to exclude from the ballot a party formed on a more traditional model (i.e., one that intends, at least at some point in time, to nominate candidates for all elective offices voted on within a state) but insufficiently developed at the present time to nominate a minimally viable presidential candidate would seem consonant with the statute's purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on the other hand, plaintiff's lack of a national organization (and concomitant decision not to nominate presidential candidates) stemmed from a philosophical commitment to devote itself solely to issues with direct bearing on Maine or to nominate only candidates who could be elected to office by the Maine electorate, matters might be different.  Forcing such a party to field a presidential candidate might well be regarded as a direct infringement of the party's core protected activity--an infringement that is, under relevant precedent, to be skeptically scrutinized.  See Eu, 489 U.S. at 230, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the district court's boilerplate affirmance of the magistrate judge's report and recommendation does not explicitly indicate that it rejected plaintiff's \"new\" argument on grounds of waiver (as it would have been within its rights to do, see Santiago, 138 F.3d at 4;  Paterson-Leitch, 840 F.2d at 990-91;  Borden, 836 F.2d at 6), we think it doubtful that the court gave the argument plenary consideration, given its silence on the matter and plaintiff's utter lack of explanation for (indeed, acknowledgment of) not having advanced the argument earlier.  Moreover, we have considerable doubt as to whether the summary judgment record even supports plaintiff's new position;  despite a number of affidavits which stated that plaintiff was formed to participate in state and local political activities, plaintiff also filed an affidavit making clear that, during the 1996-97 time frame, a number of plaintiff's founding members were taking steps towards forming a national Green party.  See Declaration of Nancy Allen at pp 8-9.  We thus believe that a remand for purposes of clarification would be an exercise in empty formalism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, a number of the minimalist principles underlying our waiver rules support avoidance of a merits ruling in this case.  See Cass R. Sunstein, The Supreme Court, 1995 Term--Foreword:  Leaving Things Undecided, 110 Harv.  L.Rev. 4, 6-8 (1996) (summarizing the jurisprudential underpinnings of the presumption towards decisional minimalism) (hereafter \"Sunstein\").  Our resolution not only avoids an unnecessary constitutional decision, see, e.g., Three Affiliated Tribes v. Wold Eng'g, P.C., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111191\"><a href=\"/opinion/111191/three-affiliated-tribes-of-fort-berthold-reservation-v-wold-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 157, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111191\"><a href=\"/opinion/111191/three-affiliated-tribes-of-fort-berthold-reservation-v-wold-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span> (1984), but it leaves undecided the constitutionality of an application of a state statute in circumstances that may well be beyond the statute's contemplation and where we are not even certain that the State would apply it.   With respect to whether these circumstances are within the statute's contemplation, we note that the statute appears to proceed from the assumption that political parties will wish to nominate presidential candidates;  we have before us no evidence of a legislative intent to keep off the ballot well-supported parties that are philosophically opposed to participating in presidential politics.  Cf. Sunstein, 110 Harv.  L.Rev. at 7 (noting a presumption against deciding and implementing a statute's hypothetical purposes).  And with respect to whether the State would even apply the statute to a solely local party, we note an absence of evidence that plaintiff ever informed the State prior to its objection to the report and recommendation that it was committed to being a solely local party, or that its local character implied a commitment to abstain from nominating presidential candidates.  Cf. id.

And it does so where the costs of an erroneous ruling (a strong possibility given the lack of adverse argumentation and relevant record development) could be very high for states and for developing political parties.

Although we already have explained our disagreement with Judge Campbell that the argument made in the summary judgment papers and the argument made on appeal are essentially the same, and/or that the argument made on appeal was subsumed within the argument made at summary judgment, see supra at 6-7, we think it important to emphasize that this is a qualitatively different situation from one where a claim made below--for example, a claim that a search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment--is amplified by appellate counsel with, for example, novel policy arguments never presented to the district court.  The present situation involves a material shift in a factual position taken by plaintiff as to why it had no national organization in 1996;  it is tantamount to a plaintiff arguing \"I was fired because my boss didn't like me\" below and then arguing \"I was fired because my boss doesn't like elderly workers such as me\" on appeal.

With respect, I believe this holding is without support in the case law and that it represents an unworkably narrow application of the conventional rule that issues not argued in the nisi prius tribunal may not subsequently be raised in reviewing courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to me that the argument now pressed on appeal by the Green Party--that Maine's 5% presidential vote requirement violated their First Amendment associational right to choose how they wish to organize--was sufficiently presented in the first instance to the magistrate judge to avoid any question of waiver.  In its original cross-motion for summary judgment, filed with the magistrate judge, the Green Party contended that Maine's 5% presidential vote requirement \"infringes upon the plaintiffs' rights to organize as they see fit.  \"  (Emphasis supplied.)   The Party contended that it was organized in Maine around a \"serious candidate for Governor\" who gained the support of 33,000 voters for \"ideas and positions concerning issues of importance on the state level,\" and that its members \"desire to achieve meaningful participation in state and local politics.\"   In support of this argument, the Green Party cited the controlling Supreme Court precedent, to wit, Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Com., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is not clear to me, however, that the arguments were ever so neatly compartmentalized;  and even if the original associational argument focused less on philosophy and more on the practical difficulties of tying party status to the showing of a viable presidential candidate, I do not believe the difference in emphasis renders the present formulation a significantly different argument.  Both versions expressly rest on the freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment.  The Green Party initially claimed, and has continued to claim, that the Maine ballot access law infringes upon its members' right to organize as they \"see fit.\"   I think it is improper for us to refuse to consider the Party's current variation simply because its precursor, which invoked the same constitutional provision and precedent, emphasized the unfairness of forcing a newly-formed group to field a presidential candidate capable of attracting significant Maine support while the later version stresses the desire of the Green Party to concentrate on candidates for local offices.  Compare Caribbean Mushroom Co. v. Government Development Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197137\"><a href=\"/opinion/197137/caribbean-mushroom-v-the-government/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1307</span></a></span>, 1309-10 (1st Cir.1996) (variation of argument amounting to a narrowing of position not a new argument).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues cite to no cases where arguments as closely intertwined as these have been treated as distinct arguments for waiver purposes.  My experience with constitutional argumentation is that appellate courts are broadly tolerant of argumentative shifts so long as the underlying constitutional provision remains the same and no new facts need be found.  Future litigants will not dare to replace trial counsel with more sophisticated appellate counsel if they have to fear that better-honed constitutional arguments, based on the same underlying theory, will be deemed \"new\" and therefore waived.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  This is not a case in which, having sought relief before the magistrate judge under certain constitutional or statutory provisions, appellant has switched to different provisions.  Nor is this a case where an argument depends upon additional factual development in the lower court.  Nor does this court need to read cases different from those cited to the magistrate judge in order to address the present argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  Nor do I discern any major shift in underlying theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The waiver concept founders here for other reasons also.  I do not think that my colleagues can rely upon Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502424\"><a href=\"/opinion/502424/paterson-leitch-company-inc-v-massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1988), and the other cited cases to establish that the Green Party is precluded from raising its current version of the association argument.  In Paterson-Leitch, for example, having failed to plead or argue before the magistrate judge that it was entitled to sue as a third-party beneficiary of a construction management contract, the plaintiff attempted to assert third-party beneficiary status for the first time before the district judge, in its objections to the magistrate's recommended disposition.  The district judge expressly refused to entertain the argument, finding that it had not been presented to the magistrate.  We affirmed the district court's refusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances here are altogether different.  Not only does the argument here not raise an issue fundamentally different from that previously argued to the magistrate judge, the district judge never, for that or any reason, declined to hear the present argument when made, as it was, by the Green Party.  Nor did the State of Maine argue below or in this court that the Green Party's argument before the district court should be disregarded because not previously raised.  It is only this court itself which, for the first time, believes that it has detected a sea-change such as to warrant our refusing to decide both the purported new argument and the original argument put to the magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I simply do not see how we can assume that the district judge refused or failed to consider the \"new\" argument.  For all that appears, he fully considered it.  While the district court would have been \"within its rights\" to refuse to consider a \"new\" argument, it plainly had the power to do so.  The district court, it is true, adopted the magistrate judge's report;  but presumably it did so because it believed the magistrate judge had adequately addressed the associational argument.  This may or may not have been so--that matter would be fair game for our appellate review--but I don't see how we can read into the court's silence a refusal to decide all the arguments put to it, including the ones we now decide were waived.  In the absence of any determination by the district court that the Green Party's argument was new and impermissible, and in the further absence of any contention to this effect by the State of Maine either here or below, I see no basis for our invocation of a waiver ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, I believe that my colleagues have misapplied the waiver rule.  The arguments before us are similar to those we regularly decide, requiring only research and analysis.  I think that we should address on the merits all the arguments raised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would add that if my colleagues are dissatisfied with the State of Maine's failure to answer all aspects of the Green Party's contentions on appeal, they could readily direct the State of Maine to brief further any of the points not sufficiently covered in Maine's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While writing separately, I do not dissent from the court's affirmance of the judgment below.

I. &#167; 4, which power is matched by state control over the election process for state offices\").  For substantially the reasons set forth in Magistrate Judge Cohen's well-reasoned report and recommendation, I believe that the Maine statute falls within this broad grant of authority to the states.  In my view, the State of Maine, like certain other states which have taken a similar stance, is entitled to define a political party for ballot purposes as an organization that has demonstrated strength in the fielding of a presidential candidate as well as local candidates.  I do not believe that the First Amendment takes away from the states the authority to adopt such a definition rooted, as it is, in our long national history in which political parties typically fit that model.  While the 5% presidential vote requirement, as Magistrate Judge Cohen noted, requires that new parties like the Green party wage an \"uphill battle,\" the Green Party remains free \"to endorse whom it likes, to ally itself with others, to nominate candidates for office, and to spread its message to all who will listen.\"  Timmons, 117 S.Ct. at 1371, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118102\"><a href=\"/opinion/118102/timmons-v-twin-cities-area-new-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>.   Additionally, there are alternative means for its candidates to get on the ballot.  In these circumstances, I discern no violation of the Green Party's associational rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has cautioned, \"[n]o bright line separates permissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements on First Amendment freedoms.\"  Timmons, 117 S.Ct. at 1370, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118102\"><a href=\"/opinion/118102/timmons-v-twin-cities-area-new-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>.   In the present matter, it is far from clear from existing Supreme Court precedent that the Maine law is unconstitutional.  Granting the relief sought by the Green Party calls for a major jurisprudential leap--a leap having major implications not only for Maine but for many other states.  In such circumstances, I think that courts of appeals should indulge the presumption of constitutionality to which state statutes and constitutional provisions are entitled, leaving to the Supreme Court, should it so desire, the creation of the innovative constitutional jurisprudence needed to warrant such a radical initiative.  I accordingly concur in affirming the judgment of the district court, but on the merits rather than on the waiver ground put forward by my colleagues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under 21-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 302(1), a party can qualify to appear on the ballot by forming around a non-party candidate for governor or president who was nominated by petition and who received 5% of the total vote in the preceding gubernatorial or presidential election, provided the candidate consents to the formation of the party around him or her.  In 1994, Jonathan Carter, a registered Maine voter not enrolled in any party and nominated by petition, received 6.4% of the 1994 Maine gubernatorial vote.  Subsequently, Mr. Carter consented to plaintiff qualifying as an official party \"on his coattails\" pursuant to &#167; 302(1)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Paul Manetti, Esq., filed the complaint and wrote plaintiff's summary judgment papers.

Yet our careful review of the record has persuaded us that plaintiff's appellate argument was only sufficiently developed in plaintiff's objection to the report and recommendation.  In so ruling, we point out that plaintiff never sought to notify the magistrate judge that the State had misunderstood its position, even though the State's summary judgment motion and opposition to plaintiff's summary judgment motion quite clearly understood plaintiff only to be arguing that its lack of a national organization was a result of its newness as a party.  Nor did plaintiff either file a motion for reconsideration informing the magistrate judge that he had misunderstood its position (the magistrate judge clearly shared the State's understanding of plaintiff's position) or suggest to the district court in the objection to the report and recommendation that the magistrate judge had misunderstood its position</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Again, although a few sentences of plaintiff's appellate brief track points made by plaintiff in its summary judgment papers, plaintiff has presented us with neither a developed account of how the statute undermines the constitutional rights of new parties formed on the traditional model nor an explicit assessment of where the magistrate judge went wrong.  Moreover, in summarizing and then introducing its appellate argument, plaintiff advertises itself as arguing only that &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement, when applied to a party, like itself, that has chosen to remain solely local, runs afoul of the Constitution.  See Appellant's Brief at 12-13 (emphasizing that plaintiff is not claiming \"that Maine's election law is inhospitable to minor parties by itself,\" but only that &#167; 301(1)(C)'s presidential vote requirement is unconstitutional \"as applied to plaintiff,\" which has \"a constitutional right to organize itself solely on the local level\");  see also Appellant's Reply Brief at 1 (asserting that plaintiff's appellate \"argument\" (plaintiff uses the singular) was not addressed by the State in its brief)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Unlike my colleagues, I do not perceive a \"material shift in a factual position taken by plaintiff.\"   See supra (emphasis in original).  Rather, the Green Party has refined somewhat the theory under which it claims Maine's 5% presidential vote requirement violates the rights of its members to freely associate, as protected by the First Amendment.  The situation is altogether different from the hypothetical posited by the majority, supra, in which a plaintiff shifts from arguing she was fired for a proper reason (\"my boss didn't like me\") to arguing she was fired for a wholly improper and illegal reason (\"because my boss doesn't like elderly workers such as me\").  Here, there has been no such radical shift in the Green Party's argument;  it has consistently argued that its members' right to organize as they \"see fit\" has been violated</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Even supposing the Party is asserting a \"new\" argument rather than merely refining its original argument before the magistrate judge, we would not be obliged to reject deciding it.

Perhaps they believe that was abandoned and replaced by the \"new,\" waived argument, leaving the entire appeal in limbo.  It seems unusual that, merely by making a somewhat more sophisticated argument in the district court and here, the Green Party could have waived not only the new argument but the one the magistrate judge actually decided</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
