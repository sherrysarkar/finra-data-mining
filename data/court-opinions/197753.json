David, 940  F.2d 722,  726 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1991) (David I), and  we proceeded to affirm his convictions\r                             \r\n\non a myriad of charges.  Inasmuch  as the predicate facts are set\r\n\nout at length  in that opinion, we  offer only a pr cis  of those\r\n\nevents to set the stage for the instant appeal.\r\n\n          In David I,  the government charged that,  during 1986,\r                              \r\n\n1987, and 1988,  David, thirteen codefendants, and  various other\r\n\npersons  engaged in extensive cocaine trafficking.  Mirroring the\r\n\nprosecution's  theory that  a  shift  from  domestic  to  foreign\r\n\nsuppliers transmogrified the  operation, the indictment described\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Congress   subsequently  enacted   the  Antiterrorism   and\r\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132,\r\n110 Stat.  1214 (codified  in scattered  sections of  28 U.S.C.).\r\nThe new law took effect on April 24, 1996.  The Supreme Court has\r\ndetermined,  in  general, that  AEDPA  does not  apply  to habeas\r\npetitions that were pending on AEDPA's effective date.  See Lindh\r                                                                           \r\nv. Murphy, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 2067-68 (1997) (discussing amendments\r                   \r\nto habeas  procedures in cases  brought under 28 U.S.C.    2254);\r\nsee also Martin v. Bissonette, 118 F.3d 871,  874 (1st Cir. 1997)\r                                       \r\n(applying  Lindh).   We believe  that  this rationale  applies to\r                          \r\nsection 2255 motions  (which are, after all, a  species of habeas\r\npetitions).  Thus, we measure  the petitioner's case against pre-\r\nAEDPA benchmarks.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ntwo conspiracies:  one beginning  in 1986 and ending in  March of\r\n\n1988, and the other taking up where the first left off and ending\r\n\nlater that  year.  Following a nine-week  trial, a jury found the\r\n\npetitioner guilty on  twenty-two counts,  including charges  that\r\n\nhe:  (a)  engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise (CCE), see\r                                                                           \r\n\n21 U.S.C.    848; (b)  participated in both conspiracies,  see 21\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.   846; (c) possessed  cocaine with intent to distribute on\r\n\nseveral occasions, see 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1); and (d) facilitated\r                                \r\n\nnumerous drug transactions by using the telephone, see 21  U.S.C.\r                                                                \r\n\n  843(b).\r\n\n          At  the   disposition  hearing,  the   district  court,\r\n\nemploying  the January 1988 edition of the sentencing guidelines,\r\n\ngrouped  related offenses,  see  USSG  3D1.1(a);  used  available\r                                         \r\n\ndrug-quantity evidence  to fix  a base offense  level of  36, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nUSSG  2D1.1; added two levels  for possession of a firearm during\r\n\nthe commission of an offense, see USSG  2D1.1(b); added four more\r                                           \r\n\nlevels for the petitioner's leadership role, see USSG  3B1.1; and\r                                                          \r\n\nsubtracted  two levels for acceptance of responsibility, see USSG\r                                                                      \r\n\n 3E1.1.  In the end,  the district court sentenced the petitioner\r\n\nwithin  the  computed  guideline  sentencing  range,  imposing  a\r\n\nthirty-year incarcerative term  on the CCE and  various \"grouped\"\r\n\npossession  counts and  shorter  periods  of  immurement  on  the\r\n\nremaining charges.  The court designated all the sentences to run\r\n\nconcurrently.\r\n\n          Represented by new counsel, David appealed.  We vacated\r\n\nthe   conspiracy  convictions  as   violative  of   the  multiple\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\npunishments  prong of  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause,  given  the\r\n\nconviction and sentence on the encompassing CCE count.  See David\r                                                                           \r\n\nI, 940 F.2d at 738  (citing United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 148,  152-53 (1st  Cir. 1991)).   In all other  respects, we\r\n\naffirmed the convictions and the corresponding sentences.\r\n\n          On  January  7,  1994,  while  still  incarcerated, the\r\n\npetitioner  retained fresh counsel  and filed a  motion for post-\r\n\nconviction relief in  the district court.   Judge Gertner assumed\r\n\nresponsibility  for  the  motion  in  place  of  the  late  Judge\r\n\nMcNaught,  who  had  presided  over the  trial  and  had  imposed\r\n\nsentence.   She ultimately denied it  on January 2, 1997, but did\r\n\nnot  deign to  hold an  evidentiary hearing.   Without  missing a\r\n\nbeat, the  petitioner  changed counsel  again.   His new  lawyers\r\n\nfiled a  motion for reconsideration  on February 26,  1997, which\r\n\nJudge Gertner also  denied.  The  petitioner appeals solely  from\r\n\nthe original denial of post-conviction relief.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                             Analysis\r                                       Analysis\r                                               \r\n\n          The  petitioner  advanced  three  claims  in the  court\r\n\nbelow.   Two of  these claims  related  to the  propriety of  the\r\n\nsentencing calculations; one questioned  the firearms enhancement\r\n\nand the second  questioned the upward adjustment for  role in the\r\n\noffense.  The  remaining claim posited ineffective  assistance of\r\n\ntrial counsel, stemming not only from an alleged failure to raise\r\n\nthis  pair of  sentencing objections,  but  also from  an alleged\r\n\nfailure promptly to relay a potentially favorable plea bargain to\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthe petitioner.  On appeal,  David has not continued his campaign\r\n\nagainst  the role-in-the-offense  adjustment,  and  we deem  that\r\n\nchallenge abandoned.   See, e.g., United  States v. Zannino,  895\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 1, 17  (1st Cir. 1990).   He does, however, renew  the other\r\n\ntwo claims.  After a brief introduction, we address each of them.\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n                           Introduction\r                                     Introduction\r                                                 \r\n\n          Section 2255  is not a  surrogate for a  direct appeal.\r\n\nRather, the statute  provides for post-conviction relief  in four\r\n\ninstances, namely, if  the petitioner's sentence (1)  was imposed\r\n\nin  violation of the Constitution, or  (2) was imposed by a court\r\n\nthat  lacked jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum,\r\n\nor (4) was  otherwise subject to collateral attack.   See Hill v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States, 368 U.S. 424, 426-27 (1962) (construing statute).\r                        \r\n\nThe  catch-all fourth category includes only assignments of error\r\n\nthat reveal  \"fundamental defect[s]\" which, if  uncorrected, will\r\n\n\"result[]   in   a   complete   miscarriage   of   justice,\"   or\r\n\nirregularities  that  are  \"inconsistent   with  the  rudimentary\r\n\ndemands of  fair procedure.\"  Id. at 428.   In other words, apart\r                                           \r\n\nfrom  claims  of  constitutional  or  jurisdictional  nature,   a\r\n\ncognizable   section   2255   claim   must  reveal   \"exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances\" that make  the need for redress evident.   See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nThe burden is  on the petitioner to  make out a case  for section\r\n\n2255 relief.  See Mack v. United  States, 635 F.2d 20, 26-27 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1980).\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r                                            \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n                     The Firearms Enhancement\r                               The Firearms Enhancement\r                                                       \r\n\n          The   petitioner  asserts  that,  as  of  the  date  of\r\n\ndisposition  (August 1, 1989),  the guidelines did  not authorize\r\n\nthe  two-level sentence enhancement imposed by Judge McNaught for\r\n\nthe use of a firearm   an enhancement that tacked at least sixty-\r\n\nseven  additional months  onto  David's  sentence.    This  claim\r\n\npresents a bit  of a moving target.   In his section  2255 motion\r\n\nand  in  the court  below,  David  asseverated that  a  two-level\r\n\nincrease only  could have materialized if it  were authorized for\r\n\nthe CCE conviction,  and that the two-level  firearms enhancement\r\n\nwas unavailable because the applicable sentencing guideline, USSG\r\n\n 2D1.5, did not make reference to it.\r\n\n          Having  secured yet a  fourth set  of attorneys  in the\r\n\ninterim,  the petitioner  recast his  argument in his  motion for\r\n\nreconsideration, and now  has come hard about.  In this venue, he\r\n\nbarely mentions section  2D1.5, but, rather, shapes  his argument\r\n\naround USSG  2D1.1.   Paying very little heed to the fact that he\r\n\ninitially told the  lower court that section 2D1.1  did not apply\r\n\nat all, he now maintains that section 2D1.1  is the correct focal\r\n\npoint, but that it cannot support the enhancement.\r\n\n          We  approach  this  moving   target  with  considerable\r\n\ncaution.   It is well established that a  party may not unveil an\r\n\nargument in the court of appeals that he did not seasonably raise\r\n\nin the district court.  See United  States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27,\r                                                             \r\n\n30 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Singleton v.

City  of Boston,  969 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n1273, 1278-79 (1st Cir. 1992); In re Sun Pipe Line Co.,  831 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n22, 24  (1st Cir. 1987).   Although the petitioner  contends that\r\n\nthe argument  he  makes  today is  merely  a  more  sophisticated\r\n\nstatement of a refrain contained in his section 2255 motion, that\r\n\nis  plainly  not  the  case.   The  two  arguments  are  markedly\r\n\ndifferent.  Consequently, the newer version is by the boards.\r\n\n          The petitioner  correctly reminds us that  an appellate\r\n\ncourt has  discretionary power to  override a forfeiture  of this\r\n\ntype.  To justify deploying this seldom-used power, however,  the\r\n\nnewly emergent contention must be one that practically guarantees\r\n\nthe appellant's success.  See Slade,  980 F.2d at 31.  Here,  the\r                                             \r\n\nforfeited argument is  considerably less than robust.  We explain\r\n\nbriefly.\r\n\n          The  firearms enhancement  about  which the  petitioner\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Even were we disposed to consider the argument  advanced in\r\nthe petitioner's untimely  motion for  reconsideration, we  could\r\nnot do so because the petitioner has not appealed from the denial\r\nof that  motion.   See Barrett v.  United States, 965  F.2d 1184,\r                                                          \r\n1188 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ncomplains arose out of  a discrete set of facts.  In June 1987, a\r\n\ndrug courier  by the  name of  Filin, employed  by David  and his\r\n\nconfederates, tried to purloin a  shipment of cocaine by faking a\r\n\nrobbery.    The  petitioner  saw through  the  charade  and later\r\n\nthreatened  Filin  at  gunpoint   in  an  attempt  to  coerce   a\r\n\nconfession.\r\n\n          Under  the sentencing regime imposed by the guidelines,\r\n\nthe law in effect on the date of the disposition hearing governs,\r\n\nabsent ex post facto concerns.   See United States v. Harotunian,\r                                                                          \r\n\n920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990).  Hewing to this line, the\r\n\ngovernment defends the enhancement by pointing to the  version of\r\n\nUSSG  2D1.1(b)(1)  that took  effect on January  15, 1988.   That\r\n\nguideline provided for a two-level upward adjustment if a firearm\r\n\n\"was  possessed  during   commission  of  the  offense.\"     USSG\r\n\n 2D1.1(b)(1).  The government concedes that \"the offense\" must be\r\n\nan offense to which the guidelines attached, thus restricting the\r\n\nenhancement in this case to the two drug distribution counts that\r\n\ntranspired in  1988, namely, counts 15 and  16.3  Notwithstanding\r\n\nthis  concession, the government  posits that the  phrase \"during\r\n\ncommission  of the offense\"  requires reference to  the \"relevant\r\n\nconduct\" guideline, which  in its 1988 iteration  indicated (with\r\n\ncertain  exceptions not germane here) that an \"offense\" generally\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3These  counts,  each of  which  charged a  violation  of 21\r\nU.S.C.    841(a)(1),  are  the  only  post-guidelines  counts  of\r\nconviction  that are legally  capable of supporting  the firearms\r\nenhancement.   The CCE  sentencing paradigm  did not provide  for\r\nsuch an enhancement, and the two conspiracy convictions have been\r\nvacated.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nis deemed  to include  \"all acts  . .  . committed  or aided  and\r\n\nabetted  by  the  defendant  .  .  .  that  occurred  during  the\r\n\ncommission  of the offense of conviction,\" USSG  1B1.3(a)(1), and\r\n\nthat, with respect to \"grouped\" offenses, see  USSG  3D1.2(d), an\r                                                       \r\n\n\"offense\" generally  is deemed to include all \"acts and omissions\r\n\nthat were part of the same course  of conduct or common scheme or\r\n\nplan as the offense of conviction,\" USSG  1B1.3(a)(2).  Since the\r\n\nFilin  episode was part  of the same course  of conduct or common\r\n\nscheme or plan  as the vignettes on  which counts 15 and  16 were\r\n\npremised, the government's thesis  runs, the petitioner possessed\r\n\nthe gun \"during commission of the offense.\"\r\n\n          The  petitioner's  counter-argument  is  somewhat  more\r\n\nconvoluted.    As  a  general  matter,  he   maintains  that  the\r\n\ngovernment  defines  \"the  offense\"  too  broadly  and  that  the\r\n\nphrase's  scope is  restricted  to  the  specific  offense(s)  of\r\n\nconviction  and does  not include  \"relevant  conduct.\"   On this\r\n\nbasis, he argues,  his proven use of a  firearm could not support\r\n\nthe  enhancement because that use did not  occur in the course of\r\n\nan  offense of  conviction  to  which  the  guidelines  attached.\r\n\nIndeed,  he  adds,  since  the  gun use  took  place  before  the\r\n\neffective  date of  the guidelines,  it could  not  possibly have\r\n\noccurred as part of such an offense.\r\n\n          After studying  the guideline provision, we  reject the\r\n\npetitioner's hypothesis.   We  conclude instead  that the  phrase\r\n\n\"the  offense,\"  fairly read,  bears  the  broader interpretation\r\n\nascribed to  it by  the government and  the district court.   Our\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nconclusion is grounded in the  language, structure, and theory of\r\n\nthe  sentencing guidelines, and it is  reinforced by an amendment\r\n\nthat the Sentencing  Commission adopted subsequent to  the events\r\n\nat issue here.   See USSG App. C,  Amend. 394 (Nov. 1991).   That\r                              \r\n\namendment deleted the \"during commission of the offense\" language\r\n\nfrom  section 2D1.1(b)(1)  and  thus confirmed  the  government's\r\n\ninterpretation of the guideline as extending to relevant conduct.\r\n\n          We  do  not  embrace the  petitioner's  suggestion that\r\n\nAmendment  394   is  inapposite.    The  general   rule  is  that\r\n\nrevisionary  amendments to the  guidelines   that  is, amendments\r\n\nwhich change  the law in  a substantive way    cannot  be applied\r\n\nretroactively   by   a   sentencing   court   to  a   defendant's\r\n\ndisadvantage.   See United  States v. Rostoff,  53 F.3d  398, 406\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).   By contrast, clarifying amendments    that is,\r\n\namendments  which  do  not  change  the  law,  but  which  merely\r\n\nelucidate its intended meaning   can be freely used by sentencing\r\n\n(or    sentence-reviewing)   courts    as   interpretive    aids,\r\n\nprospectively or retrospectively.   See Isabel v.  United States,\r                                                                          \r\n\n980 F.2d 60,  62 (1st Cir. 1992); United  States v. Ruiz-Batista,\r                                                                          \r\n\n956 F.2d 351, 353-54 (1st Cir. 1992).  When determining whether a\r\n\nguideline amendment is  revisionary as opposed to  clarifying, an\r\n\ninquiring court must accord substantial respect to the Sentencing\r\n\nCommission's view  on the subject.   See Isabel, 980  F.2d at 62.\r                                                         \r\n\nIn effecting Amendment 394, the Sentencing Commission stated that\r\n\n\"[t]his  amendment clarifies that the provisions of   1B1.3(a)(2)\r\n\n[incorporating as  relevant conduct all  acts which were  part of\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nthe same course of conduct as the offense of conviction] apply to\r\n\nthe   adjustments   in      2D1.1(b)(1).\"      The   Commission's\r\n\ncharacterization of Amendment 394 appears apt:  it is designed to\r\n\ndisambiguate  the  guideline provision  and thereby  mitigate any\r\n\nconfusion caused by the original wording.\r\n\n          That is game,  set, and match.   Because Amendment  394\r\n\nworked  no substantive change in preexistent law, a sentencing or\r\n\nreviewing court may apply it retroactively.  See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLaCroix, 28 F.3d 223,  227 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994);  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nValencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 234  n.4 (1st Cir. 1993); see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nUSSG  1B1.11(b)(2) (Nov. 1993).  We do so here.\r\n\n          The   Commission's   language   could   not   be   more\r\n\nstraightforward.  Amendment 394 makes it plain that the \"relevant\r\n\nconduct\"  provisions (such as  section 1B1.3(a)(2)) apply  to the\r\n\nadjustments  in  section  2D1.1(b)(1)   (such  as  the   firearms\r\n\nenhancement).   Accordingly,  Amendment 394  fully validates  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's use  of a  \"relevant conduct\"  approach to  the\r\n\nfirearms enhancement.\r\n\n          The   petitioner's  fallback   position   is  no   more\r\n\npersuasive.  He contends that, even if the  sentencing guidelines\r\n\npermit the  enhancement  when  a firearm  was  used  during  pre-\r\n\nguidelines  conduct \"relevant\"  to a  post-guidelines  offense of\r\n\nconviction, his  gun use  does not so  qualify because  the Filin\r\n\nincident (which  took place  in 1987)  was not  part of  the same\r\n\ncourse of conduct,  common scheme, or plan that  underlays counts\r\n\n15 and 16 (both of which  focus on events that occurred in  April\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nof 1988).\r\n\n          This contention  depends on an  artificial distinction.\r\n\nThe petitioner  notes that his  use of a firearm  occurred within\r\n\nthe  time frame of  the so-called  first conspiracy,  whereas the\r\n\nconduct underlying  the  two  post-guidelines  drug  distribution\r\n\ncounts occurred within  the time  frame of  the so-called  second\r\n\nconspiracy.   Based  on this  chronology,  he theorizes  that the\r\n\nenhancing  conduct   the  gun use    cannot be  \"relevant\" to the\r\n\noffenses of conviction.\r\n\n          The fallacy in this theory is that \"a course of conduct\r\n\nor common  scheme  or  plan,\"  as that  phrase  is  used  in  the\r\n\nsentencing  guidelines, is broader  than, rather than coterminous\r\n\nwith, the  definition of a  \"conspiracy\" as  that term of  art is\r\n\nused in the overall criminal law.  See United States v. Wood, 924\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 399, 403  (1st Cir. 1991); see also United States v. Spence,\r                                                                          \r\n\n125 F.3d 1192, 1195 (8th Cir. 1997);  United States v. Boney, 977\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 624, 635  (D.C. Cir. 1992).  Thus,  whether or not enveloped\r\n\nwithin the  same conspiracy,  offenses may  qualify as  occurring\r\n\nwithin  the same course  of conduct as  long as  they are related\r\n\nsufficiently  to allow  a rational  factfinder  to conclude  that\r\n\n\"they are part of . .  . [an] ongoing series of offenses.\"   USSG\r\n\n 1B1.3(a), comment.  (n.9(B)).  In  the same vein, \"[f]or  two or\r\n\nmore offenses  to constitute  part of a  common scheme  or plan,\"\r\n\nthey only need to \"be substantially connected to each other by at\r\n\nleast one  common factor, such as .  . . accomplices, [or] common\r\n\npurpose. . . .\"  USSG  1B1.3(a), comment. (n. 9(A)).\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\n          This dichotomy makes  a world of difference.   Although\r\n\nthe  petitioner's  drug  trafficking  resulted  in  two  separate\r\n\ncharged conspiracies, the  framing of the charges  cannot obscure\r\n\nthe  fact that, throughout  the cocaine trafficking  described in\r\n\nthe indictment,  the  petitioner and  his  principal  accomplices\r\n\nremained  at the  center of  an ongoing  enterprise devoted  to a\r\n\nsingle purpose.4  The shift in the source of supply permitted the\r\n\nprosecutor  to divide  the enterprise  into two  segments and  to\r\n\ncharge  some defendants  accordingly,  but  the petitioner  never\r\n\ndeviated  from his main business:  the acquisition, distribution,\r\n\nand  sale  of  cocaine  in   a  specific  region.    Because  the\r\n\npetitioner's  activities during 1986,  1987, and 1988 constituted\r\n\nan ongoing series of offenses, the  district court did not err in\r\n\nimposing the firearms enhancement.\r\n\n                                C.\r                                          C.\r                                            \r\n\n                Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r                          Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r                                                           \r\n\n          Insofar as  the petitioner's ineffective  assistance of\r\n\ncounsel claim relates to the sentencing phase, it is  impuissant.\r\n\nThe petitioner received  an appropriate sentence, see  supra Part\r                                                                      \r\n\nII(B), and, absent any prejudice, an ineffective assistance claim\r\n\ncannot prosper.  See  Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1,  8-9 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1994).   We turn, then, to  a consideration of the remaining tine\r\n\nof   the  petitioner's  claim:    that  he  received  substandard\r\n\nassistance  because   his  trial   counsel  failed   promptly  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The  David I  record discloses  that at  least  three other\r                            \r\nringleaders  (Yehuda Yarden,  Joseph  Zalmanovich, and  Mordechai\r\nMizrahi) were involved with the petitioner in both conspiracies.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\ncommunicate a favorable plea bargain to him.\r\n\n          The genesis of this claim is as follows.  In his motion\r\n\n(or,  more  accurately,  in a  memorandum  accompanying  it), the\r\n\npetitioner averred that he learned at some  indeterminate time of\r\n\na  favorable plea  offer  extended  by  the  government  but  not\r\n\ncommunicated to  him until after  its withdrawal.  Had  the offer\r\n\nbeen made  known to  him, the petitioner  ruminates, he  \"likely\"\r\n\nwould  have accepted  it.   The averment  contains no  specifics,\r\n\ne.g.,  who  made  the  proposal,  when  it  was  tendered,   what\r\n\nconditions were attached to it, why  it was withdrawn, or how the\r\n\npetitioner came to hear of it.5\r\n\n          Judge Gertner dismissed the  unsupported allegation out\r\n\nof hand.   On appeal, the  petitioner argues only that  the judge\r\n\nerred in  brushing aside  the allegation without  a hearing.   We\r\n\nreview the district court's denial of  an evidentiary hearing for\r\n\nabuse of discretion.   See United States v. Garcia, 954  F.2d 12,\r                                                            \r\n\n19 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n          A prisoner who invokes section 2255 is not entitled  to\r\n\nan evidentiary hearing as a  matter of right.  See United  States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. McGill,  11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).   Even if a hearing\r                   \r\n\nis requested, a district court properly may forgo it when (1) the\r\n\nmotion   is  inadequate  on   its  face,  or   (2)  the  movant's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5In  his  papers,  the petitioner  merely  asserted  that he\r\n\"later learned that during pre-trial period the Government made a\r\nplea offer .  . .  in return  for a sentence  of 19  years and  6\r\nmonths.

A representative case is Machibroda v. United States, 368\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 487  (1962), in which  the petitioner's section  2255 motion\r\n\nalleged   that  his   guilty  plea   resulted   from  an   unkept\r\n\nprosecutorial  promise.    After the  trial  court  dismissed the\r\n\nmotion without  an evidentiary hearing  and the court  of appeals\r\n\naffirmed,  the  Supreme  Court   reversed,  noting  that   \"[t]he\r\n\npetitioner's  motion  and  affidavit contain  charges  which  are\r\n\ndetailed and  specific.\"  Id.  at 495.   In a pithy  passage that\r                                       \r\n\npossesses particular pertinence  for present purposes, the  Court\r\n\ncautioned  that a habeas petitioner is not automatically entitled\r\n\nto  a  hearing  and  normally  should  not  receive  one  if  his\r\n\nallegations are \"vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nThis  is true,  the  Court wrote,  even \"if  the record  does not\r\n\nconclusively and expressly belie [the] claim.\"  Id.\r                                                             \r\n\n          Inferior courts routinely  have applied the  Machibroda\r                                                                           \r\n\nstandard  in determining  the need  for  evidentiary hearings  on\r\n\nsection  2255 motions.   Allegations  that are  so evanescent  or\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nbereft  of detail  that they  cannot  reasonably be  investigated\r\n\n(and,   thus,  corroborated  or  disproved)  do  not  warrant  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing.   See Dalli v. United States,  491 F.2d 758,\r                                                           \r\n\n761 (2d Cir. 1974) (holding  that the district court  supportably\r\n\nrefused to convene  an evidentiary hearing when  the petitioner's\r\n\nallegations were  \"vague, indefinite and  conclusory\"); see  also\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmos v. Minnesota, 849 F.2d 1070, 1072 (8th Cir. 1988) (upholding\r                           \r\n\nthe  denial of  an evidentiary  hearing  in a  section 2254  case\r\n\ninasmuch as petitioner \"offered only general allegations\").\r\n\n          In this instance, the district court was not obliged to\r\n\ncredit  the petitioner's threadbare  allusions to a  phantom plea\r\n\nbargain.   Who,  what, when,  where, and  how details  might have\r\n\nplaced matters  of  ascertainable fact  at  issue and  thus  have\r\n\nbolstered the  case for  an evidentiary  hearing,  but none  were\r\n\nforthcoming.    To  the  contrary,  the  petitioner  offered  the\r\n\ndistrict  court no names,  dates, places, or  other details, even\r\n\nthough  such details  presumably were  within  his ken.   In  the\r\n\nabsence of any  particulars, the lower court  justifiably treated\r\n\nthe petitioner's conclusory averments as mere buzznacking.\r\n\n          The  petitioner points  to  United States  v. Rodriguez\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodriguez, 929 F.2d 747 (1st  Cir. 1991) (per curiam), as support\r                   \r\n\nfor his contention that, when  a section 2255 motion alleges that\r\n\ndefense counsel failed  to inform the defendant of  a plea offer,\r\n\nthe district court  must hold an evidentiary hearing.   That case\r\n\nprovides David with cold comfort,  for the court there took pains\r\n\nto admonish petitioners  that, in order to  secure an evidentiary\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nhearing on  such a claim,  they must tender more  than conclusory\r\n\nallegations.  See id. at 752.  Rodriguez, unlike David, \"provided\r                               \r\n\nadequate  factual  specifications beyond  bald  speculation,\" and\r\n\ntherefore merited an evidentiary hearing.

The petitioner's  sentencing\r\n\narguments are  procedurally defective  and substantively  infirm.\r\n\nBy  like token, his  unparticularized claim  that a  phantom plea\r\n\nbargain lapsed for want of timely communication is much too vague\r\n\nto demand an evidentiary hearing.  Hence, the court below did not\r\n\nerr in rejecting David's section 2255 motion.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                17\r\r\n",

David appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct appeal, we described the petitioner's case as \"involv[ing] a spider web of drug dealing, with David at the web's center,\" United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 726 (1st Cir.1991) (David I ), and we proceeded to affirm his convictions on a myriad of charges.  Inasmuch as the predicate facts are set out at length in that opinion, we offer only a precis of those events to set the stage for the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In David I, the government charged that, during 1986, 1987, and 1988, David, thirteen codefendants, and various other persons engaged in extensive cocaine trafficking.  Mirroring the prosecution's theory that a shift from domestic to foreign suppliers transmogrified the operation, the indictment described two conspiracies:  one beginning in 1986 and ending in March of 1988, and the other taking up where the first left off and ending later that year.  Following a nine-week trial, a jury found the petitioner guilty on twenty-two counts, including charges that he:  (a) engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE), see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848;  (b) participated in both conspiracies, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846;  (c) possessed cocaine with intent to distribute on several occasions, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1);  and (d) facilitated numerous drug transactions by using the telephone, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court, employing the January 1988 edition of the sentencing guidelines, grouped related offenses, see USSG &#167; 3D1.1(a);  used available drug-quantity evidence to fix a base offense level of 36, see USSG &#167; 2D1.1;  added two levels for possession of a firearm during the commission of an offense, see USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b);  added four more levels for the petitioner's leadership role, see USSG &#167; 3B1.1;  and subtracted two levels for acceptance of responsibility, see USSG &#167; 3E1.1.  In the end, the district court sentenced the petitioner within the computed guideline sentencing range, imposing a thirty-year incarcerative term on the CCE and various \"grouped\" possession counts and shorter periods of immurement on the remaining charges.  The court designated all the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Represented by new counsel, David appealed.  We vacated the conspiracy convictions as violative of the multiple punishments prong of the Double Jeopardy Clause, given the conviction and sentence on the encompassing CCE count.  See David I, 940 F.2d at 738 (citing United States v. Rivera-Martinez, 931 F.2d 148, 152-53 (1st Cir.1991)).  In all other respects, we affirmed the convictions and the corresponding sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 7, 1994, while still incarcerated, the petitioner retained fresh counsel and filed a motion for post-conviction relief in the district court.  Judge Gertner assumed responsibility for the motion in place of the late Judge McNaught, who had presided over the trial and had imposed sentence.  She ultimately denied it on January 2, 1997, but did not deign to hold an evidentiary hearing.  Without missing a beat, the petitioner changed counsel again.  His new lawyers filed a motion for reconsideration on February 26, 1997, which Judge Gertner also denied.  The petitioner appeals solely from the original denial of post-conviction relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner advanced three claims in the court below.  Two of these claims related to the propriety of the sentencing calculations;  one questioned the firearms enhancement and the second questioned the upward adjustment for role in the offense.  The remaining claim posited ineffective assistance of trial counsel, stemming not only from an alleged failure to raise this pair of sentencing objections, but also from an alleged failure promptly to relay a potentially favorable plea bargain to the petitioner.  On appeal, David has not continued his campaign against the role-in-the-offense adjustment, and we deem that challenge abandoned.  See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).  He does, however, renew the other two claims.  After a brief introduction, we address each of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Introduction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2255 is not a surrogate for a direct appeal.  Rather, the statute provides for post-conviction relief in four instances, namely, if the petitioner's sentence (1) was imposed in violation of the Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a court that lacked jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum, or (4) was otherwise subject to collateral attack.  See Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 426-27, 82 S.Ct. 468, 470-71, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962) (construing statute).  The catch-all fourth category includes only assignments of error that reveal \"fundamental defect[s]\" which, if uncorrected, will \"result[ ] in a complete miscarriage of justice,\" or irregularities that are \"inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"  Id. at 428, 82 S.Ct. at 471.   In other words, apart from claims of constitutional or jurisdictional nature, a cognizable section 2255 claim must reveal \"exceptional circumstances\" that make the need for redress evident.  See id.   The burden is on the petitioner to make out a case for section 2255 relief.  See Mack v. United States, 635 F.2d 20, 26-27 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>The Firearms Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner asserts that, as of the date of disposition (August 1, 1989), the guidelines did not authorize the two-level sentence enhancement imposed by Judge McNaught for the use of a firearm--an enhancement that tacked at least sixty-seven additional months onto David's sentence.  This claim presents a bit of a moving target.  In his section 2255 motion and in the court below, David asseverated that a two-level increase only could have materialized if it were authorized for the CCE conviction, and that the two-level firearms enhancement was unavailable because the applicable sentencing guideline, USSG &#167; 2D1.5, did not make reference to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having secured yet a fourth set of attorneys in the interim, the petitioner recast his argument in his motion for reconsideration, and now has come hard about.  In this venue, he barely mentions section 2D1.5, but, rather, shapes his argument around USSG &#167; 2D1.1.  Paying very little heed to the fact that he initially told the lower court that section 2D1.1 did not apply at all, he now maintains that section 2D1.1 is the correct focal point, but that it cannot support the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We approach this moving target with considerable caution.  It is well established that a party may not unveil an argument in the court of appeals that he did not seasonably raise in the district court.  See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992);  see also Singleton v. United States, 26 F.3d 233, 240 (1st Cir.1994) (invoking this principle in a section 2255 case);  United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1158 n. 9 (1st Cir.1993) (invoking this principle in respect to sentencing issues).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To apply the principle here, we must measure the petitioner's current argument against that limned in his section 2255 motion and advanced before Judge Gertner, not by reference to the theory that he belatedly surfaced in his request for reconsideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184, 1187 n. 3 (1st Cir.1992);  Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d 1273, 1278-79 (1st Cir.1992);  Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 24 (1st Cir.1987).  Although the petitioner contends that the argument he makes today is merely a more sophisticated statement of a refrain contained in his section 2255 motion, that is plainly not the case.  The two arguments are markedly different.  Consequently, the newer version is by the boards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner correctly reminds us that an appellate court has discretionary power to override a forfeiture of this type.  To justify deploying this seldom-used power, however, the newly emergent contention must be one that practically guarantees the appellant's success.  See Slade, 980 F.2d at 31.   Here, the forfeited argument is considerably less than robust.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The firearms enhancement about which the petitioner complains arose out of a discrete set of facts.  In June 1987, a drug courier by the name of Filin, employed by David and his confederates, tried to purloin a shipment of cocaine by faking a robbery.  The petitioner saw through the charade and later threatened Filin at gunpoint in an attempt to coerce a confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the sentencing regime imposed by the guidelines, the law in effect on the date of the disposition hearing governs, absent ex post facto concerns.  See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990).  Hewing to this line, the government defends the enhancement by pointing to the version of USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) that took effect on January 15, 1988.  That guideline provided for a two-level upward adjustment if a firearm \"was possessed during commission of the offense.\"  USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).  The government concedes that \"the offense\" must be an offense to which the guidelines attached, thus restricting the enhancement in this case to the two drug distribution counts that transpired in 1988, namely, counts 15 and 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Notwithstanding this concession, the government posits that the phrase \"during commission of the offense\" requires reference to the \"relevant conduct\" guideline, which in its 1988 iteration indicated (with certain exceptions not germane here) that an \"offense\" generally is deemed to include \"all acts ... committed or aided and abetted by the defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,\" USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1), and that, with respect to \"grouped\" offenses, see USSG &#167; 3D1.2(d), an \"offense\" generally is deemed to include all \"acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,\" USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2).  Since the Filin episode was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the vignettes on which counts 15 and 16 were premised, the government's thesis runs, the petitioner possessed the gun \"during commission of the offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's counter-argument is somewhat more convoluted.  As a general matter, he maintains that the government defines \"the offense\" too broadly and that the phrase's scope is restricted to the specific offense(s) of conviction and does not include \"relevant conduct.\"   On this basis, he argues, his proven use of a firearm could not support the enhancement because that use did not occur in the course of an offense of conviction to which the guidelines attached.  Indeed, he adds, since the gun use took place before the effective date of the guidelines, it could not possibly have occurred as part of such an offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After studying the guideline provision, we reject the petitioner's hypothesis.  We conclude instead that the phrase \"the offense,\" fairly read, bears the broader interpretation ascribed to it by the government and the district court.  Our conclusion is grounded in the language, structure, and theory of the sentencing guidelines, and it is reinforced by an amendment that the Sentencing Commission adopted subsequent to the events at issue here.  See USSG App.  C, Amend.  394 (Nov. 1991).  That amendment deleted the \"during commission of the offense\" language from section 2D1.1(b)(1) and thus confirmed the government's interpretation of the guideline as extending to relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not embrace the petitioner's suggestion that Amendment 394 is inapposite.  The general rule is that revisionary amendments to the guidelines--that is, amendments which change the law in a substantive way--cannot be applied retroactively by a sentencing court to a defendant's disadvantage.  See United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 406 (1st Cir.1995).  By contrast, clarifying amendments--that is, amendments which do not change the law, but which merely elucidate its intended meaning--can be freely used by sentencing (or sentence-reviewing) courts as interpretive aids, prospectively or retrospectively.  See Isabel v. United States, 980 F.2d 60, 62 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Ruiz-Batista, 956 F.2d 351, 353-54 (1st Cir.1992).  When determining whether a guideline amendment is revisionary as opposed to clarifying, an inquiring court must accord substantial respect to the Sentencing Commission's view on the subject.  See Isabel, 980 F.2d at 62.   In effecting Amendment 394, the Sentencing Commission stated that \"[t]his amendment clarifies that the provisions of &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) [incorporating as relevant conduct all acts which were part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction] apply to the adjustments in &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).\"   The Commission's characterization of Amendment 394 appears apt:  it is designed to disambiguate the guideline provision and thereby mitigate any confusion caused by the original wording.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is game, set, and match.  Because Amendment 394 worked no substantive change in preexistent law, a sentencing or reviewing court may apply it retroactively.  See United States v. LaCroix, 28 F.3d 223, 227 n. 4 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Valencia-Lucena, 988 F.2d 228, 234 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993);  see also USSG &#167; 1B1.11(b)(2) (Nov. 1993).  We do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's language could not be more straightforward.  Amendment 394 makes it plain that the \"relevant conduct\" provisions (such as section 1B1.3(a)(2)) apply to the adjustments in section 2D1.1(b)(1) (such as the firearms enhancement).  Accordingly, Amendment 394 fully validates the district court's use of a \"relevant conduct\" approach to the firearms enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's fallback position is no more persuasive.  He contends that, even if the sentencing guidelines permit the enhancement when a firearm was used during pre-guidelines conduct \"relevant\" to a post-guidelines offense of conviction, his gun use does not so qualify because the Filin incident (which took place in 1987) was not part of the same course of conduct, common scheme, or plan that underlays counts 15 and 16 (both of which focus on events that occurred in April of 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention depends on an artificial distinction.  The petitioner notes that his use of a firearm occurred within the time frame of the so-called first conspiracy, whereas the conduct underlying the two post-guidelines drug distribution counts occurred within the time frame of the so-called second conspiracy.  Based on this chronology, he theorizes that the enhancing conduct--the gun use--cannot be \"relevant\" to the offenses of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fallacy in this theory is that \"a course of conduct or common scheme or plan,\" as that phrase is used in the sentencing guidelines, is broader than, rather than coterminous with, the definition of a \"conspiracy\" as that term of art is used in the overall criminal law.  See United States v. Wood, 924 F.2d 399, 403 (1st Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Spence, 125 F.3d 1192, 1195 (8th Cir.1997);  United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 635 (D.C.Cir.1992).  Thus, whether or not enveloped within the same conspiracy, offenses may qualify as occurring within the same course of conduct as long as they are related sufficiently to allow a rational factfinder to conclude that \"they are part of ... [an] ongoing series of offenses.\"  USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a), comment.  (n.9(B)).  In the same vein, \"[f]or two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan,\" they only need to \"be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as ... accomplices, [or] common purpose....\"  USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a), comment.  (n. 9(A)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dichotomy makes a world of difference.  Although the petitioner's drug trafficking resulted in two separate charged conspiracies, the framing of the charges cannot obscure the fact that, throughout the cocaine trafficking described in the indictment, the petitioner and his principal accomplices remained at the center of an ongoing enterprise devoted to a single purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The shift in the source of supply permitted the prosecutor to divide the enterprise into two segments and to charge some defendants accordingly, but the petitioner never deviated from his main business:  the acquisition, distribution, and sale of cocaine in a specific region.  Because the petitioner's activities during 1986, 1987, and 1988 constituted an ongoing series of offenses, the district court did not err in imposing the firearms enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim relates to the sentencing phase, it is impuissant.  The petitioner received an appropriate sentence, see supra Part II(B), and, absent any prejudice, an ineffective assistance claim cannot prosper.  See Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir.1994).  We turn, then, to a consideration of the remaining tine of the petitioner's claim:  that he received substandard assistance because his trial counsel failed promptly to communicate a favorable plea bargain to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of this claim is as follows.  In his motion (or, more accurately, in a memorandum accompanying it), the petitioner averred that he learned at some indeterminate time of a favorable plea offer extended by the government but not communicated to him until after its withdrawal.  Had the offer been made known to him, the petitioner ruminates, he \"likely\" would have accepted it.  The averment contains no specifics, e.g., who made the proposal, when it was tendered, what conditions were attached to it, why it was withdrawn, or how the petitioner came to hear of it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Gertner dismissed the unsupported allegation out of hand.  On appeal, the petitioner argues only that the judge erred in brushing aside the allegation without a hearing.  We review the district court's denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 19 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A prisoner who invokes section 2255 is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right.  See United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir.1993).  Even if a hearing is requested, a district court properly may forgo it when (1) the motion is inadequate on its face, or (2) the movant's allegations, even if true, do not entitle him to relief, or (3) the movant's allegations \"need not be accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record, or are 'inherently incredible.' \"  Id. at 225-26 (citation omitted) ;  see also Rule 4(b), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To progress to an evidentiary hearing, a habeas petitioner must do more than proffer gauzy generalities or drop self-serving hints that a constitutional violation lurks in the wings.  A representative case is Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962), in which the petitioner's section 2255 motion alleged that his guilty plea resulted from an unkept prosecutorial promise.  After the trial court dismissed the motion without an evidentiary hearing and the court of appeals affirmed, the Supreme Court reversed, noting that \"[t]he petitioner's motion and affidavit contain charges which are detailed and specific.\"  Id. at 495, 82 S.Ct. at 514.   In a pithy passage that possesses particular pertinence for present purposes, the Court cautioned that a habeas petitioner is not automatically entitled to a hearing and normally should not receive one if his allegations are \"vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible.\"  Id. This is true, the Court wrote, even \"if the record does not conclusively and expressly belie [the] claim.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inferior courts routinely have applied the Machibroda standard in determining the need for evidentiary hearings on section 2255 motions.  Allegations that are so evanescent or bereft of detail that they cannot reasonably be investigated (and, thus, corroborated or disproved) do not warrant an evidentiary hearing.  See Dalli v. United States, 491 F.2d 758, 761 (2d Cir.1974) (holding that the district court supportably refused to convene an evidentiary hearing when the petitioner's allegations were \"vague, indefinite and conclusory\");  see also Amos v. Minnesota, 849 F.2d 1070, 1072 (8th Cir.1988) (upholding the denial of an evidentiary hearing in a section 2254 case inasmuch as petitioner \"offered only general allegations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court was not obliged to credit the petitioner's threadbare allusions to a phantom plea bargain.  Who, what, when, where, and how details might have placed matters of ascertainable fact at issue and thus have bolstered the case for an evidentiary hearing, but none were forthcoming.  To the contrary, the petitioner offered the district court no names, dates, places, or other details, even though such details presumably were within his ken.  In the absence of any particulars, the lower court justifiably treated the petitioner's conclusory averments as mere buzznacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner points to United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F.2d 747 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam), as support for his contention that, when a section 2255 motion alleges that defense counsel failed to inform the defendant of a plea offer, the district court must hold an evidentiary hearing.  That case provides David with cold comfort, for the court there took pains to admonish petitioners that, in order to secure an evidentiary hearing on such a claim, they must tender more than conclusory allegations.  See id. at 752.   Rodriguez, unlike David, \"provided adequate factual specifications beyond bald speculation,\" and therefore merited an evidentiary hearing.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the petitioner has put forth less than the bare minimum that is necessary to warrant an evidentiary hearing.  On this gossamer showing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to license a fishing expedition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The petitioner's sentencing arguments are procedurally defective and substantively infirm.  By like token, his unparticularized claim that a phantom plea bargain lapsed for want of timely communication is much too vague to demand an evidentiary hearing.  Hence, the court below did not err in rejecting David's section 2255 motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Congress subsequently enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.).  The new law took effect on April 24, 1996.  The Supreme Court has determined, in general, that AEDPA does not apply to habeas petitions that were pending on AEDPA's effective date.  See Lindh v. Murphy, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 2067-68, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997) (discussing amendments to habeas procedures in cases brought under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254);  see also Martin v. Bissonette, 118 F.3d 871, 874 (1st Cir.1997) (applying Lindh ).  We believe that this rationale applies to section 2255 motions (which are, after all, a species of habeas petitions).  Thus, we measure the petitioner's case against pre-AEDPA benchmarks</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Even were we disposed to consider the argument advanced in the petitioner's untimely motion for reconsideration, we could not do so because the petitioner has not appealed from the denial of that motion.

David, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 726 (1st Cir.1991) (David I ), and we proceeded to affirm his convictions on a myriad of charges.  Inasmuch as the predicate facts are set out at length in that opinion, we offer only a precis of those events to set the stage for the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In David I, the government charged that, during 1986, 1987, and 1988, David, thirteen codefendants, and various other persons engaged in extensive cocaine trafficking.  Mirroring the prosecution's theory that a shift from domestic to foreign suppliers transmogrified the operation, the indictment described two conspiracies:  one beginning in 1986 and ending in March of 1988, and the other taking up where the first left off and ending later that year.  Following a nine-week trial, a jury found the petitioner guilty on twenty-two counts, including charges that he:  (a) engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE), see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848;  (b) participated in both conspiracies, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846;  (c) possessed cocaine with intent to distribute on several occasions, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1);  and (d) facilitated numerous drug transactions by using the telephone, see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court, employing the January 1988 edition of the sentencing guidelines, grouped related offenses, see USSG &#167; 3D1.1(a);  used available drug-quantity evidence to fix a base offense level of 36, see USSG &#167; 2D1.1;  added two levels for possession of a firearm during the commission of an offense, see USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b);  added four more levels for the petitioner's leadership role, see USSG &#167; 3B1.1;  and subtracted two levels for acceptance of responsibility, see USSG &#167; 3E1.1.  In the end, the district court sentenced the petitioner within the computed guideline sentencing range, imposing a thirty-year incarcerative term on the CCE and various \"grouped\" possession counts and shorter periods of immurement on the remaining charges.  The court designated all the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Represented by new counsel, David appealed.  We vacated the conspiracy convictions as violative of the multiple punishments prong of the Double Jeopardy Clause, given the conviction and sentence on the encompassing CCE count.  See David I, 940 F.2d at 738 (citing United States v. Rivera-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559873\"><a href=\"/opinion/559873/united-states-v-hector-rivera-martinez-aka-el-men/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152-53 (1st Cir.1991)).  In all other respects, we affirmed the convictions and the corresponding sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 7, 1994, while still incarcerated, the petitioner retained fresh counsel and filed a motion for post-conviction relief in the district court.  Judge Gertner assumed responsibility for the motion in place of the late Judge McNaught, who had presided over the trial and had imposed sentence.  She ultimately denied it on January 2, 1997, but did not deign to hold an evidentiary hearing.  Without missing a beat, the petitioner changed counsel again.  His new lawyers filed a motion for reconsideration on February 26, 1997, which Judge Gertner also denied.  The petitioner appeals solely from the original denial of post-conviction relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner advanced three claims in the court below.  Two of these claims related to the propriety of the sentencing calculations;  one questioned the firearms enhancement and the second questioned the upward adjustment for role in the offense.  The remaining claim posited ineffective assistance of trial counsel, stemming not only from an alleged failure to raise this pair of sentencing objections, but also from an alleged failure promptly to relay a potentially favorable plea bargain to the petitioner.  On appeal, David has not continued his campaign against the role-in-the-offense adjustment, and we deem that challenge abandoned.  See, e.g., United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).  He does, however, renew the other two claims.  After a brief introduction, we address each of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Introduction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2255 is not a surrogate for a direct appeal.  Rather, the statute provides for post-conviction relief in four instances, namely, if the petitioner's sentence (1) was imposed in violation of the Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a court that lacked jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum, or (4) was otherwise subject to collateral attack.  See Hill v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106329\"><a href=\"/opinion/106329/hill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span>, 426-27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106329\"><a href=\"/opinion/106329/hill-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span> (1962) (construing statute).  The catch-all fourth category includes only assignments of error that reveal \"fundamental defect[s]\" which, if uncorrected, will \"result[ ] in a complete miscarriage of justice,\" or irregularities that are \"inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"  Id. at 428, 82 S.Ct. at 471.   In other words, apart from claims of constitutional or jurisdictional nature, a cognizable section 2255 claim must reveal \"exceptional circumstances\" that make the need for redress evident.  See id.   The burden is on the petitioner to make out a case for section 2255 relief.  See Mack v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384539\"><a href=\"/opinion/384539/harold-omar-mack-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 26-27 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>The Firearms Enhancement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner asserts that, as of the date of disposition (August 1, 1989), the guidelines did not authorize the two-level sentence enhancement imposed by Judge McNaught for the use of a firearm--an enhancement that tacked at least sixty-seven additional months onto David's sentence.  This claim presents a bit of a moving target.  In his section 2255 motion and in the court below, David asseverated that a two-level increase only could have materialized if it were authorized for the CCE conviction, and that the two-level firearms enhancement was unavailable because the applicable sentencing guideline, USSG &#167; 2D1.5, did not make reference to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having secured yet a fourth set of attorneys in the interim, the petitioner recast his argument in his motion for reconsideration, and now has come hard about.  In this venue, he barely mentions section 2D1.5, but, rather, shapes his argument around USSG &#167; 2D1.1.  Paying very little heed to the fact that he initially told the lower court that section 2D1.1 did not apply at all, he now maintains that section 2D1.1 is the correct focal point, but that it cannot support the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We approach this moving target with considerable caution.  It is well established that a party may not unveil an argument in the court of appeals that he did not seasonably raise in the district court.  See United States v. Slade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1992);  see also Singleton v.

Although the petitioner contends that the argument he makes today is merely a more sophisticated statement of a refrain contained in his section 2255 motion, that is plainly not the case.  The two arguments are markedly different.  Consequently, the newer version is by the boards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner correctly reminds us that an appellate court has discretionary power to override a forfeiture of this type.  To justify deploying this seldom-used power, however, the newly emergent contention must be one that practically guarantees the appellant's success.  See Slade, 980 F.2d at 31.   Here, the forfeited argument is considerably less than robust.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The firearms enhancement about which the petitioner complains arose out of a discrete set of facts.  In June 1987, a drug courier by the name of Filin, employed by David and his confederates, tried to purloin a shipment of cocaine by faking a robbery.  The petitioner saw through the charade and later threatened Filin at gunpoint in an attempt to coerce a confession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the sentencing regime imposed by the guidelines, the law in effect on the date of the disposition hearing governs, absent ex post facto concerns.  See United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990).  Hewing to this line, the government defends the enhancement by pointing to the version of USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) that took effect on January 15, 1988.  That guideline provided for a two-level upward adjustment if a firearm \"was possessed during commission of the offense.\"  USSG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).  The government concedes that \"the offense\" must be an offense to which the guidelines attached, thus restricting the enhancement in this case to the two drug distribution counts that transpired in 1988, namely, counts 15 and 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Notwithstanding this concession, the government posits that the phrase \"during commission of the offense\" requires reference to the \"relevant conduct\" guideline, which in its 1988 iteration indicated (with certain exceptions not germane here) that an \"offense\" generally is deemed to include \"all acts ... committed or aided and abetted by the defendant ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,\" USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1), and that, with respect to \"grouped\" offenses, see USSG &#167; 3D1.2(d), an \"offense\" generally is deemed to include all \"acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,\" USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2).  Since the Filin episode was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the vignettes on which counts 15 and 16 were premised, the government's thesis runs, the petitioner possessed the gun \"during commission of the offense.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's counter-argument is somewhat more convoluted.  As a general matter, he maintains that the government defines \"the offense\" too broadly and that the phrase's scope is restricted to the specific offense(s) of conviction and does not include \"relevant conduct.\"   On this basis, he argues, his proven use of a firearm could not support the enhancement because that use did not occur in the course of an offense of conviction to which the guidelines attached.  Indeed, he adds, since the gun use took place before the effective date of the guidelines, it could not possibly have occurred as part of such an offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After studying the guideline provision, we reject the petitioner's hypothesis.  We conclude instead that the phrase \"the offense,\" fairly read, bears the broader interpretation ascribed to it by the government and the district court.  Our conclusion is grounded in the language, structure, and theory of the sentencing guidelines, and it is reinforced by an amendment that the Sentencing Commission adopted subsequent to the events at issue here.  See USSG App.  C, Amend.  394 (Nov. 1991).  That amendment deleted the \"during commission of the offense\" language from section 2D1.1(b)(1) and thus confirmed the government's interpretation of the guideline as extending to relevant conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not embrace the petitioner's suggestion that Amendment 394 is inapposite.  The general rule is that revisionary amendments to the guidelines--that is, amendments which change the law in a substantive way--cannot be applied retroactively by a sentencing court to a defendant's disadvantage.  See United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 406 (1st Cir.1995).  By contrast, clarifying amendments--that is, amendments which do not change the law, but which merely elucidate its intended meaning--can be freely used by sentencing (or sentence-reviewing) courts as interpretive aids, prospectively or retrospectively.  See Isabel v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595487\"><a href=\"/opinion/595487/maurice-isabel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Ruiz-Batista, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577675\"><a href=\"/opinion/577675/united-states-v-elvis-leonidas-ruiz-batista/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 353-54 (1st Cir.1992).  When determining whether a guideline amendment is revisionary as opposed to clarifying, an inquiring court must accord substantial respect to the Sentencing Commission's view on the subject.  See Isabel, 980 F.2d at 62.   In effecting Amendment 394, the Sentencing Commission stated that \"[t]his amendment clarifies that the provisions of &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) [incorporating as relevant conduct all acts which were part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction] apply to the adjustments in &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).\"   The Commission's characterization of Amendment 394 appears apt:  it is designed to disambiguate the guideline provision and thereby mitigate any confusion caused by the original wording.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is game, set, and match.  Because Amendment 394 worked no substantive change in preexistent law, a sentencing or reviewing court may apply it retroactively.  See United States v. LaCroix, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195454\"><a href=\"/opinion/195454/united-states-v-lacroix/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 227 n. 4 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Valencia-Lucena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602341\"><a href=\"/opinion/602341/united-states-v-carlos-valencia-lucena-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 234 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993);  see also USSG &#167; 1B1.11(b)(2) (Nov. 1993).  We do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission's language could not be more straightforward.  Amendment 394 makes it plain that the \"relevant conduct\" provisions (such as section 1B1.3(a)(2)) apply to the adjustments in section 2D1.1(b)(1) (such as the firearms enhancement).  Accordingly, Amendment 394 fully validates the district court's use of a \"relevant conduct\" approach to the firearms enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's fallback position is no more persuasive.  He contends that, even if the sentencing guidelines permit the enhancement when a firearm was used during pre-guidelines conduct \"relevant\" to a post-guidelines offense of conviction, his gun use does not so qualify because the Filin incident (which took place in 1987) was not part of the same course of conduct, common scheme, or plan that underlays counts 15 and 16 (both of which focus on events that occurred in April of 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This contention depends on an artificial distinction.  The petitioner notes that his use of a firearm occurred within the time frame of the so-called first conspiracy, whereas the conduct underlying the two post-guidelines drug distribution counts occurred within the time frame of the so-called second conspiracy.  Based on this chronology, he theorizes that the enhancing conduct--the gun use--cannot be \"relevant\" to the offenses of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fallacy in this theory is that \"a course of conduct or common scheme or plan,\" as that phrase is used in the sentencing guidelines, is broader than, rather than coterminous with, the definition of a \"conspiracy\" as that term of art is used in the overall criminal law.  See United States v. Wood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555054\"><a href=\"/opinion/555054/united-states-v-darryl-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 403 (1st Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Spence, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746787\"><a href=\"/opinion/746787/united-states-v-timothy-wayne-spence/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span>, 1195 (8th Cir.1997);  United States v. Boney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593165\"><a href=\"/opinion/593165/united-states-v-jermaine-boney-united-states-of-america-v-donald-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 635 (D.C.Cir.1992).  Thus, whether or not enveloped within the same conspiracy, offenses may qualify as occurring within the same course of conduct as long as they are related sufficiently to allow a rational factfinder to conclude that \"they are part of ... [an] ongoing series of offenses.\"  USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a), comment.  (n.9(B)).  In the same vein, \"[f]or two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan,\" they only need to \"be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as ... accomplices, [or] common purpose....\"  USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a), comment.  (n. 9(A)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dichotomy makes a world of difference.  Although the petitioner's drug trafficking resulted in two separate charged conspiracies, the framing of the charges cannot obscure the fact that, throughout the cocaine trafficking described in the indictment, the petitioner and his principal accomplices remained at the center of an ongoing enterprise devoted to a single purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The shift in the source of supply permitted the prosecutor to divide the enterprise into two segments and to charge some defendants accordingly, but the petitioner never deviated from his main business:  the acquisition, distribution, and sale of cocaine in a specific region.  Because the petitioner's activities during 1986, 1987, and 1988 constituted an ongoing series of offenses, the district court did not err in imposing the firearms enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <p>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim relates to the sentencing phase, it is impuissant.  The petitioner received an appropriate sentence, see supra Part II(B), and, absent any prejudice, an ineffective assistance claim cannot prosper.  See Scarpa v. Dubois, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir.1994).  We turn, then, to a consideration of the remaining tine of the petitioner's claim:  that he received substandard assistance because his trial counsel failed promptly to communicate a favorable plea bargain to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of this claim is as follows.  In his motion (or, more accurately, in a memorandum accompanying it), the petitioner averred that he learned at some indeterminate time of a favorable plea offer extended by the government but not communicated to him until after its withdrawal.  Had the offer been made known to him, the petitioner ruminates, he \"likely\" would have accepted it.  The averment contains no specifics, e.g., who made the proposal, when it was tendered, what conditions were attached to it, why it was withdrawn, or how the petitioner came to hear of it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Gertner dismissed the unsupported allegation out of hand.  On appeal, the petitioner argues only that the judge erred in brushing aside the allegation without a hearing.  We review the district court's denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A prisoner who invokes section 2255 is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right.  See United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 225 (1st Cir.1993).  Even if a hearing is requested, a district court properly may forgo it when (1) the motion is inadequate on its face, or (2) the movant's allegations, even if true, do not entitle him to relief, or (3) the movant's allegations \"need not be accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record, or are 'inherently incredible.' \"  Id. at 225-26 (citation omitted) ;  see also Rule 4(b), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To progress to an evidentiary hearing, a habeas petitioner must do more than proffer gauzy generalities or drop self-serving hints that a constitutional violation lurks in the wings.  A representative case is Machibroda v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106335\"><a href=\"/opinion/106335/machibroda-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106335\"><a href=\"/opinion/106335/machibroda-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span> (1962), in which the petitioner's section 2255 motion alleged that his guilty plea resulted from an unkept prosecutorial promise.  After the trial court dismissed the motion without an evidentiary hearing and the court of appeals affirmed, the Supreme Court reversed, noting that \"[t]he petitioner's motion and affidavit contain charges which are detailed and specific.\"  Id. at 495, 82 S.Ct. at 514.   In a pithy passage that possesses particular pertinence for present purposes, the Court cautioned that a habeas petitioner is not automatically entitled to a hearing and normally should not receive one if his allegations are \"vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible.\"  Id. This is true, the Court wrote, even \"if the record does not conclusively and expressly belie [the] claim.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inferior courts routinely have applied the Machibroda standard in determining the need for evidentiary hearings on section 2255 motions.  Allegations that are so evanescent or bereft of detail that they cannot reasonably be investigated (and, thus, corroborated or disproved) do not warrant an evidentiary hearing.  See Dalli v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"316864\"><a href=\"/opinion/316864/barthelmio-dalli-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 761 (2d Cir.1974) (holding that the district court supportably refused to convene an evidentiary hearing when the petitioner's allegations were \"vague, indefinite and conclusory\");  see also Amos v. Minnesota, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507826\"><a href=\"/opinion/507826/donald-ray-amos-v-the-state-of-minnesota-and-the-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span>, 1072 (8th Cir.1988) (upholding the denial of an evidentiary hearing in a section 2254 case inasmuch as petitioner \"offered only general allegations\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court was not obliged to credit the petitioner's threadbare allusions to a phantom plea bargain.  Who, what, when, where, and how details might have placed matters of ascertainable fact at issue and thus have bolstered the case for an evidentiary hearing, but none were forthcoming.  To the contrary, the petitioner offered the district court no names, dates, places, or other details, even though such details presumably were within his ken.  In the absence of any particulars, the lower court justifiably treated the petitioner's conclusory averments as mere buzznacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner points to United States v.

That case provides David with cold comfort, for the court there took pains to admonish petitioners that, in order to secure an evidentiary hearing on such a claim, they must tender more than conclusory allegations.  See id. at 752.   Rodriguez, unlike David, \"provided adequate factual specifications beyond bald speculation,\" and therefore merited an evidentiary hearing.
