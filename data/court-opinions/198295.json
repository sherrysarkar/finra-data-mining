Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n      Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nSpencer C. Demetros, by appointment of the court, with whom\r\nLaw Offices of Spencer C. Demetros was on brief for petitioner.\r\nAlicia M. Milligan, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, and Margaret E.\r\nCurran and Zechariah Chafee, Assistant United States Attorneys,\r\nwere on brief for respondent.\r\n\nJanuary 22, 1999\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Juan Brache sought collateral\r\nrelief under 28 U.S.C.  2255 from a jury conviction under 18\r\nU.S.C.  924(c)(1) for using or carrying a firearm during and in\r\nrelation to a drug-trafficking crime.  Brache claimed that the jury\r\ninstruction as to \"use\" of a firearm under section 924(c)(1) was\r\noverbroad--measured by the definition later adopted by Bailey v.\r\nUnited States, 516 U.S. 137, 143-46 (1995).  Although the\r\ngovernment admits that the instruction was not correct, it argues\r\n(and the district court agreed) that relief was not warranted.  We\r\naffirm.\r\nThe necessary history is brief.  In January 1994, Brache\r\nwas tried by a jury and convicted of possessing cocaine with intent\r\nto distribute, 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1), possessing a firearm after a\r\nfelony conviction, 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1), and using or carrying a\r\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug crime, id.  924(c).   As\r\nrequired by statute, the 5-year prison sentence on the use or carry\r\ncount was made to run consecutively after the concurrent 21-month\r\nsentences on the first two counts.\r\nAt the time of the trial, various circuits, including\r\nthis one, employed a broad definition of \"use,\" see, e.g., United\r\nStates v. McFadden, 13 F.3d 463, 465 (1st Cir. 1994), permitting\r\nconviction if the weapon was merely available, and the jury was so\r\ninstructed.  Brache made no objection at trial and no claim of\r\nerror on his direct appeal to this instruction.  He did appeal on\r\nother grounds, but these were rejected in an unpublished per curiamopinion, United States v. Brache, No. 94-1366 (1st Cir., Feb. 9,\r\n1995).  Later that same year, the Supreme Court in Baileyinterpreted the \"use\" requirement of section 924(c)(1) to require\r\nactive use, contrary to the definition previously approved in this\r\ncircuit and given in the instruction at Brache's trial.  Bailey,\r\n516 U.S. at 143-46.\r\nIn January 1996, Brache moved under 28 U.S.C.  2255 to\r\ninvalidate his section 924(c)(1) conviction on the ground that the\r\ninstruction as to \"use\" was prejudicial error in light of Bailey. \r\nIn February 1997, the district court denied the motion.  See Brachev. United States, 957 F. Supp. 20 (D.R.I. 1997).  The district\r\ncourt assumed that Bailey would apply \"retroactively\" to a\r\nconviction that became final before Bailey--as the Supreme Court\r\nlater confirmed in Bousley v. United States, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 1609-\r\n10 (1998)--but concluded that the evidence warranted Brache's\r\nconviction under the \"carry\" prong of the statute.  See Brache, 957\r\nF. Supp. at 25.  Brache now appeals.\r\nWe affirm the district court, but upon a different ground\r\nbased on an intervening Supreme Court decision.  The district court\r\nwas quite right that the evidence would have justified a conviction\r\nof Brache for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug\r\ncrime.  The evidence at trial showed that the police had conducted\r\na raid in April 1993 at a house in Providence, Rhode Island.  As\r\nthe police approached the second-floor apartment in which Brache\r\nwas located, a detective stationed in the basement (because\r\nforewarned by a tip) witnessed a .38-caliber pistol, several .38-\r\ncaliber bullets, and a cigarette pack containing 21 small bags of\r\ncocaine fall to the floor at the base of the basement chimney.  A\r\nvent in the wall of the living room in the raided apartment\r\nconnected to the chimney shaft.  Other evidence proved that someone\r\nwas dealing drugs from the apartment.\r\nThere were two other persons in the apartment along with\r\nBrache when the police entered; one was a drunkard from the\r\nneighborhood and another a prostitute.  Yet both were in the\r\nkitchen when the police entered, while Brache alone was seen\r\nentering the kitchen from the living room.  The gun and cigarette\r\npack bore no fingerprints, but Brache was smoking a brand of\r\ncigarette matching the pack that had been dropped into the basement\r\nalong with the pistol.  In short, the evidence pointed to Brache as\r\nculprit, but this judgment was up to the jury.\r\nFrom the jury's verdict on the first two counts, it is\r\nevident that the jury agreed that Brache was the one who possessed\r\nthe drugs, intended to distribute them, and also possessed the gun. \r\nTo reach this conclusion, the jury must have believed that Brache\r\nhad carried the gun and the drugs into the living room and dropped\r\nthem into the basement; this inference, after all, was easy to draw\r\nfrom the testimony and--more important--supplies the only direct\r\nevidence to support any of his convictions.  To this extent, the\r\njury's verdict itself establishes that Brache both possessed the\r\ndrugs with intent to distribute and carried the gun.\r\nHowever, we do not know from the jury verdict whether the\r\njury concluded that Brache carried the gun \"during and in relation\r\nto\" a drug trafficking crime.  It must be assumed, favorably to\r\nBrache, that the jury convicted only on the use prong--easy to do\r\nunder the old definition of use--and never considered the carry\r\nprong of the statute.  And if the jury had confronted the carrying\r\nprong, perhaps it might have thought that because Brache was\r\nridding himself of the evidence, when he carried the gun to the\r\nvent, his carriage of the gun was no longer \"in relation to\" a drug\r\ntrafficking crime--or perhaps even that the drugs were no longer\r\nbeing possessed with \"intent to distribute.\"\r\nIn practice, these niceties might well have meant nothing\r\nto the jury once it concluded that Brache carried both the gun and\r\nthe drugs.  But while the breath of the \"during and in relation to\"\r\nrequirement would easily have permitted conviction on the carry\r\nprong, the vagueness of the phrase makes it harder to predict just\r\nwhat a jury would have done on our somewhat unusual facts. \r\nFurther, Supreme Court precedent leaves it unclear just how far we\r\nare permitted to speculate about likely outcomes where, as here,\r\nthe mis-instruction makes it uncertain whether the jury did in fact\r\nfind a necessary element of the crime, an issue we are happy to\r\ndefer.  Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993).\r\nIn all events, an intervening Supreme Court decision\r\nvirtually compels affirmance on a procedural ground.  Because \r\nBrache did not object to the faulty \"use\" definition, he cannot\r\nprevail on collateral attack unless he can show both \"cause\" and\r\n\"prejudice\" or, alternatively, that he is \"actually innocent.\" \r\nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485, 496 (1986).  Brache claims\r\nthat he had \"cause\" for not objecting to the jury instruction\r\nbecause there was \"no reasonable basis in existing law,\" Reed v.\r\nRoss, 468 U.S. 1, 15 (1984), for a challenge to the broad\r\ndefinition of \"use\" in the court's instruction.\r\nIn a different situation, we might find Brache's argument\r\nattractive, since the instruction was at the time correct under\r\nFirst Circuit precedent.  Here, however, the Supreme Court has made\r\nthe determination for us.  In Bousley, the Court ruled that a\r\nsection 2255 petitioner who argued that his guilty plea for \"using\"\r\na firearm under section 924(c)(1) was invalid--because the\r\ndefinition of \"use\" explained to him by the district court had been\r\nimproperly broad--had procedurally defaulted because he had not\r\npursued the claim on direct appeal.  See Bousley, 118 S. Ct. at\r\n1611.  The Court stated that \"the Federal Reporters were replete\r\nwith cases involving challenges to the notion that 'use' is\r\nsynonymous with mere 'possession'\"  at the time of the petitioner's\r\nplea.  Id.\r\nBrache argues that Bousley does not control the result of\r\nthis case because this case involves jury instructions and Bousleyinvolved a defendant who pled guilty.  But a defendant who pleads\r\nguilty pursuant to a mistaken understanding of \"use\" is misled as\r\nmuch as a jury given the same instruction.  And, in either case,\r\nthe defendant had the opportunity to challenge the definition in\r\nthe trial court and on appeal.  Indeed, the defendant who pleads\r\narguably suffers the greater disadvantage, since he alone may not\r\nget his plea bargain if he insists upon reserving a legal issue for\r\nappeal.\r\nWe could also grant collateral relief if Brache showed\r\nthat he was actually innocent of a violation of section 924(c)(1),\r\na test that is implemented by asking if without the error \"it is\r\nmore likely than not that no reasonable juror\" would have convicted\r\nhim.  Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995).  As we have already\r\nsaid, the jury's implicit findings in this case are tantamount to\r\nthe conclusion that Brache carried the gun during and in relation\r\nto a drug trafficking crime.  This case is very far away from\r\nactual innocence.\r\nOn the present facts, few would think that Brache was\r\nwrongly imprisoned under the use-and-carry statute.  But more than\r\na few might be startled at Bousley's conclusion that the \"use\"\r\nissue had to be raised at all to avoid the cause and prejudice bar. \r\nAfter all, the request for a narrower construction of \"use\" had\r\nearlier been rejected in this circuit.  See United States v.\r\nCleveland, 106 F.3d 1056, 1065 (1st Cir. 1997).  One might question\r\nwhether litigants should be encouraged to raise over and over\r\nissues seemingly already settled in the circuit.\r\nIt is useful to put Bousley in context.  The reach of\r\nhabeas as a remedy was greatly enlarged by the Supreme Court in the\r\n1960s, e.g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391 (1963), while at the same\r\ntime the Constitution was read to regulate more and more of state\r\ncriminal procedural and evidence law, e.g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S.\r\n643 (1961); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).  As with most\r\nrevolutions, a counter-reaction developed, e.g., Friendly, Is\r\nInnocence Irrelevant?  Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38\r\nU. Chi. L. Rev. 142 (1970), but few of the landmark Warren Court\r\nprecedents have been explicitly overruled.\r\nInstead, both the Supreme Court and Congress have\r\nmaintained, at least theoretically, the potentially broad reach of\r\nhabeas but hedged it with a raft of new limitations that are\r\nlargely procedural in character, and are framed and applied with\r\nconsiderable strictness. The cause and prejudice rule is major\r\nelement in this construct.  Whether the present configuration of\r\nhabeas doctrine is the happiest solution may be open to debate, but\r\nit is a compromise of conflicting pressures and is in any event\r\nbinding upon us.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

Although the government admits that the instruction was not correct, it argues (and the district court agreed) that relief was not warranted.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The necessary history is brief.  In January 1994, Brache was tried by a jury and convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), possessing a firearm after a felony conviction, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), and using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime, id. &#167; 924(c).  As required by statute, the 5-year prison sentence on the use or carry count was made to run consecutively after the concurrent 21-month sentences on the first two counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the trial, various circuits, including this one, employed a broad definition of \"use,\" see, e.g., United States v. McFadden, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195146\"><a href=\"/opinion/195146/united-states-v-mcfadden/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 465 (1st Cir.1994), permitting conviction if the weapon was merely available, and the jury was so instructed.  Brache made no objection at trial and no claim of error on his direct appeal to this instruction.  He did appeal on other grounds, but these were rejected in an unpublished per curiam opinion, United States v. Brache, No. 94-1366, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">54081</span></span> (1st Cir.1995).  Later that same year, the Supreme Court in Bailey interpreted the \"use\" requirement of section 924(c)(1) to require active use, contrary to the definition previously approved in this circuit and given in the instruction at Brache's trial.  Bailey, 516 U.S. at 143-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In February 1997, the district court denied the motion.  See Brache v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span> (D.R.I.1997).  The district court assumed that Bailey would apply \"retroactively\" to a conviction that became final before Bailey--as the Supreme Court later confirmed in Bousley v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Brache, 957 F.Supp. at 25.   Brache now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court, but upon a different ground based on an intervening Supreme Court decision.  The district court was quite right that the evidence would have justified a conviction of Brache for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime.  The evidence at trial showed that the police had conducted a raid in April 1993 at a house in Providence, Rhode Island.  As the police approached the second-floor apartment in which Brache was located, a detective stationed in the basement (because forewarned by a tip) witnessed a .38-caliber pistol, several .38-caliber bullets, and a cigarette pack containing 21 small bags of cocaine fall to the floor at the base of the basement chimney.  A vent in the wall of the living room in the raided apartment connected to the chimney shaft.  Other evidence proved that someone was dealing drugs from the apartment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were two other persons in the apartment along with Brache when the police entered;  one was a drunkard from the neighborhood and another a prostitute.  Yet both were in the kitchen when the police entered, while Brache alone was seen entering the kitchen from the living room.  The gun and cigarette pack bore no fingerprints, but Brache was smoking a brand of cigarette matching the pack that had been dropped into the basement along with the pistol.  In short, the evidence pointed to Brache as culprit, but this judgment was up to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the jury's verdict on the first two counts, it is evident that the jury agreed that Brache was the one who possessed the drugs, intended to distribute them, and also possessed the gun.  To reach this conclusion, the jury must have believed that Brache had carried the gun and the drugs into the living room and dropped them into the basement;  this inference, after all, was easy to draw from the testimony and--more important--supplies the only direct evidence to support any of his convictions.  To this extent, the jury's verdict itself establishes that Brache both possessed the drugs with intent to distribute and carried the gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we do not know from the jury verdict whether the jury concluded that Brache carried the gun \"during and in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime.  It must be assumed, favorably to Brache, that the jury convicted only on the use prong--easy to do under the old definition of use--and never considered the carry prong of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  And if the jury had confronted the carrying prong, perhaps it might have thought that because Brache was ridding himself of the evidence, when he carried the gun to the vent, his carriage of the gun was no longer \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime--or perhaps even that the drugs were no longer being possessed with \"intent to distribute.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In practice, these niceties might well have meant nothing to the jury once it concluded that Brache carried both the gun and the drugs.  But while the breadth of the \"during and in relation to\" requirement would easily have permitted conviction on the carry prong, the vagueness of the phrase makes it harder to predict just what a jury would have done on our somewhat unusual facts.  Further, Supreme Court precedent leaves it unclear just how far we are permitted to speculate about likely outcomes where, as here, the mis-instruction makes it uncertain whether the jury did in fact find a necessary element of the crime, an issue we are happy to defer.

Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because Brache did not object to the faulty \"use\" definition, he cannot prevail on collateral attack unless he can show both \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" or, alternatively, that he is \"actually innocent.\"  Murray v. Carrier, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 485, 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111727\"><a href=\"/opinion/111727/murray-v-carrier/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Brache claims that he had \"cause\" for not objecting to the jury instruction because there was \"no reasonable basis in existing law,\" Reed v.

Here, however, the Supreme Court has made the determination for us.  In Bousley, the Court ruled that a section 2255 petitioner who argued that his guilty plea for \"using\" a firearm under section 924(c)(1) was invalid--because the definition of \"use\" explained to him by the district court had been improperly broad--had procedurally defaulted because he had not pursued the claim on direct appeal.  See Bousley, 118 S.Ct. at 1611.   The Court stated that \"the Federal Reporters were replete with cases involving challenges to the notion that 'use' is synonymous with mere 'possession' \" at the time of the petitioner's plea.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brache argues that Bousley does not control the result of this case because this case involves jury instructions and Bousley involved a defendant who pled guilty.  But a defendant who pleads guilty pursuant to a mistaken understanding of \"use\" is misled as much as a jury given the same instruction.  And, in either case, the defendant had the opportunity to challenge the definition in the trial court and on appeal.  Indeed, the defendant who pleads arguably suffers the greater disadvantage, since he alone may not get his plea bargain if he insists upon reserving a legal issue for appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We could also grant collateral relief if Brache showed that he was actually innocent of a violation of section 924(c)(1), a test that is implemented by asking if without the error \"it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror\" would have convicted him.  Schlup v. Delo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117893\"><a href=\"/opinion/117893/schlup-v-delo/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 327, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117893\"><a href=\"/opinion/117893/schlup-v-delo/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span> (1995).  As we have already said, the jury's implicit findings in this case are tantamount to the conclusion that Brache carried the gun during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.  This case is very far away from actual innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the present facts, few would think that Brache was wrongly imprisoned under the use-and-carry statute.  But more than a few might be startled at Bousley 's conclusion that the \"use\" issue had to be raised at all to avoid the cause and prejudice bar.  After all, the request for a narrower construction of \"use\" had earlier been rejected in this circuit.  See United States v. Cleveland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197214\"><a href=\"/opinion/197214/united-states-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></a></span>, 1065 (1st Cir.1997).
