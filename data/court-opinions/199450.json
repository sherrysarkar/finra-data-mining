Franklyn Rivera Santiago appeals the\n\nsentence imposed following his guilty plea to various narcotics-\n\nrelated offenses.     Counsel for Rivera has submitted an Anders\n\nbrief and a motion to withdraw, asserting that there are no\n\nmeritorious issues to be raised on appeal.             See Anders v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738; 1st Cir. Loc. R. 46.4(a)(4).          Rivera\n\nhas not filed a separate brief, although he has been informed of\n\nhis right to do so.

Those convictions were reversed on\n\nappeal   by this court, and prior to a second trial, Rivera pled\n\nguilty to one count of attempting to possess narcotics with\n\nintent to distribute.      The district court, noting Rivera's\n\nstatus as a police officer, sentenced Rivera at the high end of\n\nthe   applicable   guideline   imprisonment   range.    In   contrast,\n\nAlamo, who also pled guilty and who was assigned the same base-\n\noffense level as Rivera, was apparently sentenced at the low end\n\nof the guideline range.
