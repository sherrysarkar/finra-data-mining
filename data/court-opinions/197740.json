After a thorough review of  the record and\r                           \r\n\nthe briefs  submitted by the  parties, we affirm.   Appellant\r\n\nAntonius Turner  (\"Turner\") challenges  the district  court's\r\n\ndenial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from his car\r\n\nduring a traffic stop.   He contends the officers who stopped\r\n\nhim lacked a  \"reasonable suspicion\" that  he was engaged  in\r\n\ncriminal activity, see Delaware v. Prouse, 440  U.S. 648, 663\r                                                     \r\n\n(1979), but  we disagree.   Given  Turner's  long history  of\r\n\ndriving  without a  license and  ignoring  warnings that  his\r\n\nfailure to  obtain a  license would result  in his  arrest--a\r\n\nhistory with which the arresting officer was quite familiar--\r\n\nit was manifestly reasonable for the officer to assume Turner\r\n\nwas persisting in his failure to obtain a driver's license.\r\n\n     Turner  has  filed  a supplemental  brief  pro  se which\r                                                                   \r\n\nraises a number of additional issues, but his arguments fail.\r\n\nEven  if  the  district  court  did  not  fully  comply  with\r\n\nFed.R.Crim.P. 11  when it accepted  his guilty plea,  we find\r\n\nthat  any error was  harmless, since Turner  fully understood\r\n\nthe  quantity of  drugs to  which  he was  admitting and  the\r\n\nsentence  upon which the  parties had agreed.   Fed.R.Crim.P.\r\n\n11(h).  Further,  we see no evidence  in the record  that his\r\n\nplea was involuntary.   His claim that  his sentence violated\r\n\nthe  eighth amendment  was  not  preserved  for  appeal,  and\r\n\nnowhere  in  the record  does  it  appear  that  Turner  ever\r\n\nobjected  to  the  probation  officer's  statement  that  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nsubstance  at issue  was cocaine  base, or  that he  made any\r\n\nother  objections to  the Presentence  Report.   By  pleading\r\n\nguilty,  he waived  his right to  challenge any  speedy trial\r\n\nviolation.   United States  v. Cordero,  42 F.3d  697, 698-99\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1994).  We  do not reach any  conclusion regarding\r\n\nthe merits  of his  ineffective assistance  claim, since  the\r\n\nrecord on this  issue is not fully developed.   United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Carrington,  96 F.3d  1, 6  (1st Cir.  1996).   Turner may\r                         \r\n\nraise this  issue by filing a motion  pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2255 in the  district court.  The motion  should be supported\r\n\nby  a  signed affidavit  from  Turner  stating at  a  minimum\r\n\nwhether his attorney  advised him before  his guilty plea  of\r\n\nthe results of the second weighing of the cocaine seized from\r\n\nhim on the night of his arrest.\r\n\n     Affirmed.
