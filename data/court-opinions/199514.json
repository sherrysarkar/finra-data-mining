José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Arnaldo Wilson-Lopez   on    Petition    for   Certificate   of\nAppealability, pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                         JULY 24, 2001\n\f\f    Per Curiam.         Arnaldo Wilson-Lopez seeks a certificate of\n\nappealability (COA) to appeal from the denial of his motion\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.           “It is well established that a\n\nparty may not unveil an argument in the court of appeals that he\n\ndid not seasonably raise in the district court.” David v. United\n\nStates, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998). Therefore, we focus\n\nexclusively on the issues identified in this COA which were also\n\nraised below.     Wilson-Lopez seeks to vacate his conviction\n\nfollowing a guilty plea to Count One of the indictment, charging\n\nhim with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in\n\nexcess of 500 grams of heroin.            He asks that his sentence be\n\nvacated and a new sentence imposed solely for his guilty plea to\n\nCount Five, charging him with carrying a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a drug trafficking offense.\n\n    The ground on which Wilson-Lopez seeks § 2255 relief is\n\nineffective    assistance     of   counsel   in    the   form   of   1)   his\n\nattorney’s    failure    to   investigate    and   discover     exculpatory\n\nevidence with respect to Count One and 2) her advice that\n\npetitioner     plead     guilty    to     Count    One    notwithstanding\n\npetitioner’s protestations of innocence and inadequate factual\n\nsupport for the plea.1\n\n\n    1  Petitioner raises a claim pursuant to   Apprendi v. New\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) in his COA. Even assuming that such\nclaim was raised before the district court, it is meritless.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f     Wilson-Lopez has not identified any exculpatory evidence\n\nthat his attorney failed to discover in advance of his guilty\n\nplea, much less shown that such evidence “would have led counsel\n\nto change his recommendation to the plea.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474\n\nU.S. 52, 58 (1985).         Wilson-Lopez’ attempt to rely upon certain\n\naffidavits of his co-defendants (included in their un-translated\n\nform as a supplement to his § 2255 motion) is unavailing.                    The\n\naffidavits were provided to Wilson-Lopez prior to the time that\n\nhe   pled    guilty    and    their     evidentiary        force   depends   on\n\ncredibility determinations by the fact finder.\n\n     The record supports a finding that there was adequate\n\nfactual     support   for    the    guilty   plea.   The    evidence   against\n\nWilson-Lopez was strong.           He stipulated to arriving at the scene\n\nof the pre-arranged drug sale with two co-defendants who were\n\ndirectly involved in its negotiation.            There is a video tape of\n\nhim remaining on the scene in his parked car, holding a semi-\n\nautomatic weapon.       “Mere presence at the scene of a crime is\n\ninsufficient to prove membership in a conspiracy.” United States\n\nv. Ocampo, 964 F.2d 80, 82 (1st Cir. 1992).                On the other hand,\n\n“proof of direct participation in the sale of drugs is not\n\nrequired to convict in a drug conspiracy case.” United States v.\n\n\n\nWilson-Lopez’ sentence was below the 40-year statutory maximum\nand, therefore, there was no Apprendi-based error.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fMarrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 773 (1 st Cir. 1998).             And “the\n\nfactfinder may fairly infer . . . that it runs counter to human\n\nexperience to suppose that criminal conspirators would welcome\n\ninnocent participants as witnesses to their crimes.” United\n\nStates v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n    We agree with the district court’s statement in its Order\n\nand Opinion denying the § 2255 motion, that Wilson-Lopez did not\n\n“sufficiently detail how his participation in the conspiracy to\n\nrob an individual bringing money for the drug transaction was\n\nindependent of the conspiracy to distribute narcotics.”               The\n\nevidence is to the contrary, suggesting that any plan to rob the\n\npurchaser of the drugs was in furtherance of the conspiracy to\n\npossess and distribute heroin.\n\n    Wilson-Lopez has failed to make a substantial showing of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.         We agree with the district\n\ncourt’s   finding    that   defense   counsel’s    recommendation    that\n\npetitioner   plead   guilty   to   Count   One   was   reasonable.    The\n\nrequest for a certificate of appealability is denied.2\n\n\n\n\n    2 To the extent that petitioner is arguing that his guilty\nplea was involuntary and unknowing because his attorney\nmisrepresented the sentence he could receive if he did not plead\nguilty, that argument was rejected by this court on direct\nappeal and may not be relitigated on collateral review. See\nSingleton v. United States, 26 F.3d 233, 240 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
