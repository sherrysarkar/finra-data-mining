Garca-Prez, with whom Bufete Bennazar, C.S.P. was on\r\nbrief, for appellees.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                   October 13, 1998\r\n                                               SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.  Edward Hernndez- Torres, his\r\nwife Mara de los Angeles Jimnez, and the conjugal partnership\r\nconstituted between them (collectively \"Hernndez\") sued Master\r\nFoods Interamerica (\"MFI\") and its parent company, Mars, Inc.\r\n(\"Mars\"), for religious discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C.\r\n2000e-2, e-3 (\"Title VII\") and Puerto Rican Law.  Hernndez\r\nalleged in his complaint that MFI subjected him to a hostile work\r\nenvironment and constructively discharged him. \r\nAt the conclusion of the jury trial, the district court granted\r\njudgment as a matter of law to defendants on the constructive\r\ndischarge claim.  The jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\ndefendants on the hostile work environment claim.  Hernndez\r\nmoved for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure 59, which the district court denied.  \r\nHernndez appeals from the district court's judgment as a matter\r\nof law and the denial of his motion for a new trial.  We have\r\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1367, and we\r\naffirm.\r\n                      BACKGROUND\r\nHernndez began working for MFI in 1987, first temporarily and\r\nlater permanently, as an accounts payable clerk.  He was\r\nsupervised by Angel Rodrguez in 1988, Hctor Rodrguez in 1991,\r\n     and Julio Ocampo throughout his employment. \r\nHe had become involved with a Christian group known as Defensores\r\nde la Fe shortly before he obtained a position at MFI.  He\r\nalleges that his supervisors, including Ocampo, were fully aware\r\nof his fundamentalist beliefs when they offered him a job and\r\nthat he rarely engaged in religious activities during scheduled\r\n                     work hours.\r\n   Hernndez made the following allegations of religious\r\n           discrimination and retaliation:\r\n        A.  1988 Incident with Angel Rodrguez\r\nHernndez contends that Angel Rodrguez repeatedly told offensive\r\nreligious jokes in his presence and unjustly criticized\r\nHernndez' work.  Hernndez lashed out at Rodrguez on one such\r\noccasion, prompting Rodrguez to reprimand Hernndez in writing\r\nfor insubordination and the use of profane language.  He\r\nresponded with a complaint in which he alleged that Rodrguez was\r\npersecuting him for religious reasons.  Upon Ocampo's\r\nintervention, Hernndez admitted his insubordination and\r\n                apologized in writing.\r\n            B.  1991 Incident with Ocampo\r\nOcampo spotted Hernndez reading the Bible during his lunch break\r\nsometime after the summer of 1991.  Although Ocampo knew that\r\nHernndez was at lunch, he told Rodrguez to instruct Hernndez\r\nto stop reading the Bible.  Hernndez did not file a complaint or\r\n       make a written record of the incident. \r\nHernndez received training for MFI's new accounting system in\r\n1992.  Shortly thereafter, Ocampo granted Hernndez' request for\r\na temporary employee to help Hernndez implement the accounts\r\npayable systems and complete his preexisting duties.  Hernndez\r\nlater began working with the refurbished payroll conversion\r\n                       system.\r\n     C.  September 2, 1992, Incident with Ocampo\r\nOn September 2, 1992, Hernndez was on the telephone when a co-\r\nworker passed him a religious pamphlet.  Hernndez alleges that\r\nOcampo noticed the religious tract on his desk, called him into a\r\nconference room and threatened to fire him if he was caught\r\nreading or even speaking of religious matters again.  Hernndez\r\nconsulted Nellie Negrn, MFI's personnel manager, the same day\r\nand attempted to file a state insurance fund application to\r\nobtain treatment for stress.  Negrn dissuaded him from filing\r\nthe claim and he eventually attended sessions with MFI's in-house\r\npsychologists.  Hctor Rodrguez sent Hernndez a memorandum on\r\nSeptember 3 requesting that he refrain from reading nonjob-\r\nrelated materials during work hours.  Hernndez wrote a letter\r\nclarifying that he had been reading religious literature and\r\napologizing for his conduct.  He contends that Ocampo challenged\r\nhim to a fight after reading this letter, which prompted\r\nHernndez to apprise the personnel department of the encounter\r\nand resubmit his state insurance fund application.  Negrn's\r\nassistant arranged a meeting with Ocampo and various MFI\r\nofficials to discuss the incident.  Ocampo extended an apology to\r\n   Hernndez after the meeting, which he accepted.\r\nHernndez alleges that despite Ocampo's apology, his employment\r\nsituation worsened following the September 1992 incident. \r\nSpecifically, he felt pressured to complete his assigned tasks in\r\neight hours and feared that working overtime would result in his\r\ndischarge from MFI.  In fact, he was granted overtime each time\r\nhe requested it and was the only accounting employee who received\r\npayment for the extra work.  Hernndez also noted a marked\r\nincrease in electronic messages assigning him additional duties \r\ncommenting on his lack of productivity after September 1992. \r\nHowever, his supervisors, including Ocampo, continued to commend\r\nhis performance, and Ocampo approved the hiring of another\r\ntemporary employee to ease Hernndez' burden in November 1992.\r\nHernndez resigned on February 2, 1993, after learning that\r\nOcampo had decided to terminate his temporary help.  Rodrguez\r\nconfirmed Hernndez' resignation in a February 2 memo which made\r\nno reference to religious discrimination.  At Ocampo's request,\r\nHernndez continued to work until the end of the week.  Although\r\nHernndez initially cited stress-related reasons for his\r\nresignation, in a February 5 memorandum he referred to the\r\nSeptember 1992 incident with Ocampo as the source of his\r\n               employment difficulties.                           DISCUSSION\r\n        I.  REFUSAL TO INSTRUCT ON RETALIATION\r\nThe district court denied Hernndez' motion for a new trial,\r\nrejecting his contention that the court should have instructed\r\nthe jury on the retaliation claim.  It stated that it refused to\r\ngive an instruction because \"there was no evidence in the Record\r\nto support the allegation that Defendants discriminated against\r\nPlaintiff as a result of his opposition to any alleged employment\r\npractice.\"  Hernndez contends that the court erred in refusing\r\nto instruct on retaliation. He argues that Ocampo's retaliatory\r\nconduct, which resulted in a workplace permeated with harassment\r\nand in Hernndez' ultimate \"discharge,\" was supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence at trial. \r\n Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against\r\nan employee: \r\n     It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\r\n     discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has\r\n     opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this\r\n     subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted,\r\n     or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\r\n     hearing under this subchapter.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.  2000e-3(a).  To establish a prima facie case of\r\nretaliation in the workplace, Hernndez must demonstrate that: \r\n(1) He engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2) he\r\nsuffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action\r\nis causally connected to the protected activity.  See Fennell v.\r\nFirst Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nWe assume for purposes of this disposition that Hernndez engaged\r\nin protected activity and that his informal complaint to the\r\npersonnel department constituted sufficient opposition.  His\r\nappeal fails, however, because he did not suffer an adverse\r\nemployment action.  Section 2000e-3 encompasses a variety of\r\nadverse employment actions, including demotions, disadvantageous\r\ntransfers or assignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted\r\nnegative job evaluations, and toleration of harassment by other\r\nemployees.  See Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (citing 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Employment\r\nDiscrimination,  87.20, at 17-101 to 17-107 (1994)).  The\r\nevidence reflects none of such actions.  \r\nHernndez complains that he received an increased amount of\r\nelectronic messages which contained onerous assignments and what\r\nHernndez interpreted as critical reports on his productivity. \r\nThis influx of electronic messages does not, however, rise to the\r\nlevel of an adverse action because MFI supervisors similarly\r\nurged all MFI accounting employees to implement the new systems\r\nquickly and efficiently.  Significantly, Hernndez continued to\r\nreceive favorable performance evaluations from his supervisors,\r\nincluding a November 25 memorandum lauding his installation of\r\nthe payroll system.  Ocampo's alleged admonition that Hernndez\r\ncomplete his work within an eight hour period \"or else\" does not\r\nconstitute adverse action.  Hernndez was granted overtime each\r\ntime he requested it and was the only accounting employee who\r\nreceived temporary assistance and payment for working overtime. \r\nCf. DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(holding that divesting employee of assignments and\r\nresponsibilities establishes an adverse employment action).\r\nHernndez has failed to offer facts indicating that his informal\r\ncomplaint caused any adverse actions.  Specifically, Hernndez'\r\naccusations are \"lacking in the concrete documentation necessary\r\nto prove the causal link between [his] protected activity and\r\n[his] retaliatory treatment.\"  See Ramos v. Roche Prods., Inc.,\r\n936 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1991).  First, the additional\r\nresponsibilities outlined in the electronic messages, though\r\nonerous, resulted from a policy that Hernndez agreed to\r\nimplement long before Ocampo asked him to \"go outside.\"  See,\r\ne.g., Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Ctr., Inc., 31\r\nF.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding that employee failed to\r\nestablish causal link between employee's involvement in protected\r\nunion activity and August 1990 probation because there was no\r\nevidence in the record that union activity occurred before then);\r\nRamos, 936 F.2d at 49 (noting that petitioner was passed over for\r\npromotion twice before signing affidavit with EEOC in reaching\r\nconclusion that petitioner failed to establish causal link\r\nbetween protected activity and adverse employment action).\r\nIn addition, that Ocampo imposed disadvantageous assignments and\r\ndirected that work be completed in eight hours \"or else\" does not\r\nconstitute retaliation.  Hernndez' accounting coworkers were\r\nrequired to work long hours as well.  If Hernndez was singled\r\nout, it was in a laudatory fashion as the only accounting\r\nemployee to receive overtime pay or temporary assistance in late\r\n1992 and early 1993.  In sum, he failed to present evidence\r\nsufficient to raise an  inference that the additional stress he\r\nexperienced at MFI after September 1992 resulted from retaliation\r\nrather than from the previously agreed upon implementation of\r\nMFI's new accounting system.\r\nFinally, Hernndez' claim that he suffered a retaliatory\r\nconstructive discharge fails.  A \"discharge\" under  2000e-3(a)\r\nmay be constructive as well as a direct firing.  See Hart v. University Sys., 938 F. Supp. 104, 111 (D.N.H. 1996) (holding\r\nthat employee established material issue of fact as to\r\nretaliatory constructive discharge); see also Munday v. Waste\r\nManagement of N. America, Inc., 126 F.3d 239, 243 (4th Cir. 1997)\r\n(explaining that constructive discharge is adverse employment\r\naction when \"record discloses that it was in retaliation for the\r\nemployee's exercise of rights protected by the Act\"), cert.\r\ndenied, 118 S. Ct. 1053 (1998).  To prove a retaliatory\r\nconstructive discharge, Hernndez must establish that his work\r\nenvironment was hostile.  See Smith v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 943\r\nF.2d 164, 166 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that magistrate judge found\r\nthat employee established hostile work environment element of\r\nconstructive discharge); see also Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118\r\nF.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding that constructive discharge\r\nclaim \"rises or falls on the determination of the hostile work\r\nenvironment facts\"); Konstantopoulos v.  Westvaco Corp., 112 F.3d\r\n710, 718 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that in light of court's\r\nconclusion that no hostile work environment existed when\r\npetitioner left her place of employment, she cannot prove \"the\r\nnecessary predicate to maintain a constructive discharge claim\"),\r\ncert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1079 (1998); Landgraf v. USI Film\r\nProds., 968 F.2d 427, 430 (5th Cir. 1992) (\"To prove constructive\r\ndischarge, the plaintiff must demonstrate a greater severity or\r\npervasiveness of harassment than the minimum required to prove a\r\nhostile working environment.\").  Because the jury, with all of\r\nHernndez' evidence on his retaliation claim before it, returned\r\nan adverse verdict on his hostile work environment claim, he\r\ncannot succeed on his retaliatory constructive discharge claim. \r\nHernndez argues that another jury might find the requisite\r\nhostile work environment, but he has had his day in court and is\r\nnot entitled to a new trial on that speculation alone.  The jury\r\nhaving rejected the hostile work environment claim, it\r\nnecessarily rejected the basis for the retaliatory constructive\r\ndischarge claim.\r\nII.  REJECTION OF PROFFERED HARRIS INSTRUCTION\r\nThe district court's hostile work environment instruction\r\ncorrectly informed the jury of the requisite elements of\r\nHernndez' claim, stating in pertinent part:\r\n     You must determine whether there was hostile religious harassment\r\n     based on the totality of the circumstances, and you may consider\r\n     the following factors:  The total physical environment of the\r\n     plaintiff's work area; the nature of the unwelcome acts or words;\r\n     the frequency of the offensive encounters; the severity of the\r\n     conduct; and the context in which the religious harassment\r\n     occurred; whether the conduct was unwelcome; and the effect o[n]\r\n     the plaintiff's psychological well-being . . . .\r\n\nHernndez unpersuasively argues that the court failed to follow\r\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17 (1993), when it\r\nrefused to instruct the jury that \"to be actionable, a hostile\r\nenvironment need not seriously affect an employee's psychological\r\nwell-being or lead the employee to suffer injury.\"\r\nThe court's instruction, fairly read, conforms to the HarrisCourt's holding that \"while psychological harm, like any other\r\nrelevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is\r\nrequired.\"  Id. at 23.  The instruction adequately explained the\r\nlaw regarding Hernndez' hostile work environment claim.  SeeMcKinnon v. Skil Corp., 638 F.2d 270, 274 (1st Cir. 1981) (\"As\r\nlong as the judge's instruction properly apprises the jury of the\r\napplicable law, failure to give the exact instruction requested\r\ndoes not prejudice the objecting party.\").\r\nIII.  REJECTION OF \"MOTIVATING FACTOR\" INSTRUCTIONS\r\nHernndez argues that the district court erred in refusing to\r\ninstruct the jury that an employee's religious beliefs need only \r\nbe a motivating factor rather than the sole reason for actionable\r\nmistreatment under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  See 42 U.S.C.\r\n2000e-2(m). \r\nThe court declined to give Hernndez' proposed instructions and\r\noverruled his objection, noting that a jury instruction on\r\nmotivation is inapposite in the context of a hostile work\r\nenvironment claim.  The court further held that its hostile work\r\nenvironment charge adequately instructed the jury that Hernndez'\r\nreligious convictions did not have to be the sole motivating\r\nfactor for the alleged harassment and hostile work environment.\r\nThe court's instruction, fairly read, does not imply that\r\nHernndez was required to prove that religious discrimination\r\nconstituted the sole motivation for defendants' conduct.  It \r\n\"properly apprise[d] the jury of the applicable law.\"  SeeMcKinnon, 638 F.2d at 274.\r\nIV.  CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE CLAIM\r\nHernndez contends that the evidence was sufficient to warrant\r\nsubmission of his constructive discharge claim to a jury. As\r\ndiscussed above, Hernndez' constructive discharge claim fails\r\nbecause the jury rendered an adverse verdict on the requisite\r\nhostile work environment claim.  \r\nV.  ADMISSION AND EXCLUSION OF WITNESS TESTIMONY\r\nWe review the admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 185 (1st\r\nCir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1469 (1997).  We review the\r\ndistrict court's balancing of probative value against prejudicial\r\nimpact to determine \"whether the balance actually struck is so\r\negregiously one-sided that it requires reversal.\"  Espeaignnettev. Gene Tierney Co., 43 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994).     A.  Admission of Sandra Marrero's Testimony\r\nHernndez argues that the district court, over his repeated\r\nobjection, erroneously permitted Sandra Marrero to testify.  He\r\nfurther contends that defendants violated Federal Rule of Civil\r\nProcedure 26(a)(3) because Marrero went unnamed during the\r\ndiscovery period.  He complains that had her identity been\r\ntimely disclosed, he might have deposed her instead of another\r\nwitness in conformity with the court's allotment of five\r\ndepositions.  The court ruled that Hernndez' argument was\r\n\"meritless\" and did \"not require additional discussion.\"  \r\nThe district court did not err.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\r\n26(a)(3) does not require disclosure of a prospective witness'\r\nidentity during the discovery period.  Rather, Rule 26(a)(3)(C)\r\ndeclares that \"[u]nless otherwise directed by the court, these\r\ndisclosures shall be made at least 30 days before trial.\" \r\nMarrero was named as a witness in the October 16, 1996, pretrial\r\norder, well over thirty days before trial commenced on November\r\n21, 1996.\r\nB.  Exclusion of Victor Nales and Jasmin Vsquez as                 \r\nWitnesses\r\n\nHernndez argues that the district court erred in excluding the\r\ntestimony of Victor Nales and Jasmin Vsquez.  Hernndez alleges\r\nthat Nales and Vsquez were identified in his initial\r\nadministrative complaint and were included in the collective\r\ndescription \"employees or representatives of the defendants\"\r\noffered during the discovery period.  He further contends that\r\nthe court's decision to exclude Nales and Vsquez affected the\r\noutcome of the trial because they were the only former MFI\r\nemployees listed in the pretrial order and thus would have\r\ncorroborated his testimony.  The district court summarily\r\ndismissed Hernndez' claim, noting that the issue did \"not\r\nrequire additional discussion.\"   \r\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion.  The exclusion\r\nof Nales and Vsquez as witnesses was harmless because the\r\npretrial order did not distinguish between the testimony of \r\nNales and Vsquez and that of the eight MFI employees listed in\r\nthe same group of prospective witnesses.  Without specifying what\r\nNales and Vsquez would have testified at trial, Hernndez has\r\nnot shown that their testimony would not be cumulative.  See Hallv. Arthur, 141 F.3d 844, 849 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that\r\nexclusion of testimony was harmless because testimony was\r\ncumulative and \"defendants did not make their offer of proof in\r\nthe form of questions and answers\").  Hernndez' general\r\nassertion that the prospective witnesses would have corroborated\r\nhis testimony concerning religious harassment at MFI is\r\ninsufficient.  See McDonald v. Steward, 132 F.3d 225, 232 (5th\r\nCir. 1998) (\"The burden of proving substantial prejudice lies\r\nwith the party asserting error.\") (citing Federal Deposit Ins.\r\nCorp. v. Mijalis, 15 F.3d 1314, 1319 (5th Cir. 1994)).\r\n                      CONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the district court's entry of judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw and its denial of Hernndez' motion for a new trial.\n",

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331 and 1367, and we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez began working for MFI in 1987, first temporarily and later permanently, as an accounts payable clerk.  He was supervised by Angel Rodrguez in 1988, Hector Rodrguez in 1991, and Julio Ocampo throughout his employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had become involved with a Christian group known as Defensores de la Fe shortly before he obtained a position at MFI.  He alleges that his supervisors, including Ocampo, were fully aware of his fundamentalist beliefs when they offered him a job and that he rarely engaged in religious activities during scheduled work hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez made the following allegations of religious discrimination and retaliation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. 1988 Incident with Angel Rodrguez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez contends that Angel Rodrguez repeatedly told offensive religious jokes in his presence and unjustly criticized Hernandez' work.  Hernandez lashed out at Rodrguez on one such occasion, prompting Rodrguez to reprimand Hernandez in writing for insubordination and the use of profane language.  He responded with a complaint in which he alleged that Rodrguez was persecuting him for religious reasons.  Upon Ocampo's intervention, Hernandez admitted his insubordination and apologized in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. 1991 Incident with Ocampo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocampo spotted Hernandez reading the Bible during his lunch break sometime after the summer of 1991.  Although Ocampo knew that Hernandez was at lunch, he told Rodrguez to instruct Hernandez to stop reading the Bible.  Hernandez did not file a complaint or make a written record of the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez received training for MFI's new accounting system in 1992.  Shortly thereafter, Ocampo granted Hernandez' request for a temporary employee to help Hernandez implement the accounts payable systems and complete his preexisting duties.  Hernandez later began working with the refurbished payroll conversion system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. September 2, 1992, Incident with Ocampo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 1992, Hernandez was on the telephone when a coworker passed him a religious pamphlet.  Hernandez alleges that Ocampo noticed the religious tract on his desk, called him into a conference room and threatened to fire him if he was caught reading or even speaking of religious matters again.  Hernandez consulted Nellie Negrn, MFI's personnel manager, the same day and attempted to file a state insurance fund application to obtain treatment for stress.  Negrn dissuaded him from filing the claim and he eventually attended sessions with MFI's in-house psychologists.  Hector Rodrguez sent Hernandez a memorandum on September 3 requesting that he refrain from reading nonjob-related materials during work hours.  Hernandez wrote a letter clarifying that he had been reading religious literature and apologizing for his conduct.  He contends that Ocampo challenged him to a fight after reading this letter, which prompted Hernandez to apprise the personnel department of the encounter and resubmit his state insurance fund application.  Negrn's assistant arranged a meeting with Ocampo and various MFI officials to discuss the incident.  Ocampo extended an apology to Hernandez after the meeting, which he accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez alleges that despite Ocampo's apology, his employment situation worsened following the September 1992 incident.  Specifically, he felt pressured to complete his assigned tasks in eight hours and feared that working overtime would result in his discharge from MFI.  In fact, he was granted overtime each time he requested it and was the only accounting employee who received payment for the extra work.  Hernandez also noted a marked increase in electronic messages assigning him additional duties commenting on his lack of productivity after September 1992.  However, his supervisors, including Ocampo, continued to commend his performance, and Ocampo approved the hiring of another temporary employee to ease Hernandez' burden in November 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez resigned on February 2, 1993, after learning that Ocampo had decided to terminate his temporary help.  Rodrguez confirmed Hernandez' resignation in a February 2 memo which made no reference to religious discrimination.  At Ocampo's request, Hernandez continued to work until the end of the week.  Although Hernandez initially cited stress-related reasons for his resignation, in a February 5 memorandum he referred to the September 1992 incident with Ocampo as the source of his employment difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. REFUSAL TO INSTRUCT ON RETALIATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Hernandez' motion for a new trial, rejecting his contention that the court should have instructed the jury on the retaliation claim.  It stated that it refused to give an instruction because \"there was no evidence in the Record to support the allegation that Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff as a result of his opposition to any alleged employment practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Hernandez contends that the court erred in refusing to instruct on retaliation.  He argues that Ocampo's retaliatory conduct, which resulted in a workplace permeated with harassment and in Hernandez' ultimate \"discharge,\" was supported by substantial evidence at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a).  To establish a prima facie case of retaliation in the workplace, Hernandez must demonstrate that:  (1) He engaged in protected conduct under Title VII;  (2) he suffered an adverse employment action;  and (3) the adverse action is causally connected to the protected activity.  See Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume for purposes of this disposition that Hernandez engaged in protected activity and that his informal complaint to the personnel department constituted sufficient opposition.  His appeal fails, however, because he did not suffer an adverse employment action.  Section 2000e-3 encompasses a variety of adverse employment actions, including demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations, and toleration of harassment by other employees.  See Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13, 15 (1st Cir.1994) (citing 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Employment Discrimination, &#167; 87.20, at 17-101 to 17-107 (1994)).  The evidence reflects none of such actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez complains that he received an increased amount of electronic messages which contained onerous assignments and what Hernandez interpreted as critical reports on his productivity.  This influx of electronic messages does not, however, rise to the level of an adverse action because MFI supervisors similarly urged all MFI accounting employees to implement the new systems quickly and efficiently.  Significantly, Hernandez continued to receive favorable performance evaluations from his supervisors, including a November 25 memorandum lauding his installation of the payroll system.  Ocampo's alleged admonition that Hernandez complete his work within an eight hour period \"or else\" does not constitute adverse action.  Hernandez was granted overtime each time he requested it and was the only accounting employee who received temporary assistance and payment for working overtime.  Cf. DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir.1997) (holding that divesting employee of assignments and responsibilities establishes an adverse employment action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez has failed to offer facts indicating that his informal complaint caused any adverse actions.  Specifically, Hernandez' accusations are \"lacking in the concrete documentation necessary to prove the causal link between [his] protected activity and [his] retaliatory treatment.\"   See Ramos v. Roche Prods., Inc., 936 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir.1991).  First, the additional responsibilities outlined in the electronic messages, though onerous, resulted from a policy that Hernandez agreed to implement long before Ocampo asked him to \"go outside.\"   See, e.g., Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Ctr., Inc., 31 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that employee failed to establish causal link between employee's involvement in protected union activity and August 1990 probation because there was no evidence in the record that union activity occurred before then);  Ramos, 936 F.2d at 49 (noting that petitioner was passed over for promotion twice before signing affidavit with EEOC in reaching conclusion that petitioner failed to establish causal link between protected activity and adverse employment action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, that Ocampo imposed disadvantageous assignments and directed that work be completed in eight hours \"or else\" does not constitute retaliation.  Hernandez' accounting coworkers were required to work long hours as well.  If Hernandez was singled out, it was in a laudatory fashion as the only accounting employee to receive overtime pay or temporary assistance in late 1992 and early 1993.  In sum, he failed to present evidence sufficient to raise an inference that the additional stress he experienced at MFI after September 1992 resulted from retaliation rather than from the previously agreed upon implementation of MFI's new accounting system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hernandez' claim that he suffered a retaliatory constructive discharge fails.  A \"discharge\" under &#167; 2000e-3(a) may be constructive as well as a direct firing.  See Hart v. University Sys., 938 F.Supp. 104, 111 (D.N.H.1996) (holding that employee established material issue of fact as to retaliatory constructive discharge);  see also Munday v. Waste Management of N. America, Inc., 126 F.3d 239, 243 (4th Cir.1997) (explaining that constructive discharge is adverse employment action when \"record discloses that it was in retaliation for the employee's exercise of rights protected by the Act\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1053, 140 L.Ed.2d 116 (1998).  To prove a retaliatory constructive discharge, Hernandez must establish that his work environment was hostile.  See Smith v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 943 F.2d 164, 166 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that magistrate judge found that employee established hostile work environment element of constructive discharge);  see also Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir.1997) (holding that constructive discharge claim \"rises or falls on the determination of the hostile work environment facts\");  Konstantopoulos v. Westvaco Corp., 112 F.3d 710, 718 (3d Cir.1997) (holding that in light of court's conclusion that no hostile work environment existed when petitioner left her place of employment, she cannot prove \"the necessary predicate to maintain a constructive discharge claim\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1079, 140 L.Ed.2d 137 (1998);  Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 968 F.2d 427, 430 (5th Cir.1992) (\"To prove constructive discharge, the plaintiff must demonstrate a greater severity or pervasiveness of harassment than the minimum required to prove a hostile working environment.\").  Because the jury, with all of Hernandez' evidence on his retaliation claim before it, returned an adverse verdict on his hostile work environment claim, he cannot succeed on his retaliatory constructive discharge claim.  Hernandez argues that another jury might find the requisite hostile work environment, but he has had his day in court and is not entitled to a new trial on that speculation alone.  The jury having rejected the hostile work environment claim, it necessarily rejected the basis for the retaliatory constructive discharge claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>II. REJECTION OF PROFFERED HARRIS INSTRUCTION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's hostile work environment instruction correctly informed the jury of the requisite elements of Hernandez' claim, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>You must determine whether there was hostile religious harassment based on the totality of the circumstances, and you may consider the following factors:  The total physical environment of the plaintiff's work area;  the nature of the unwelcome acts or words;  the frequency of the offensive encounters;  the severity of the conduct;  and the context in which the religious harassment occurred;  whether the conduct was unwelcome;  and the effect o[n] the plaintiff's psychological well-being....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez unpersuasively argues that the court failed to follow Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993), when it refused to instruct the jury that \"to be actionable, a hostile environment need not seriously affect an employee's psychological well-being or lead the employee to suffer injury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's instruction, fairly read, conforms to the Harris Court's holding that \"while psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is required.\"  Id. at 23, 114 S.Ct. 367.   The instruction adequately explained the law regarding Hernandez' hostile work environment claim.  See McKinnon v. Skil Corp., 638 F.2d 270, 274 (1st Cir.1981) (\"As long as the judge's instruction properly apprises the jury of the applicable law, failure to give the exact instruction requested does not prejudice the objecting party.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>III. REJECTION OF \"MOTIVATING FACTOR\" INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that an employee's religious beliefs need only be a motivating factor rather than the sole reason for actionable mistreatment under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e-2(m).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court declined to give Hernandez' proposed instructions and overruled his objection, noting that a jury instruction on motivation is inapposite in the context of a hostile work environment claim.  The court further held that its hostile work environment charge adequately instructed the jury that Hernandez' religious convictions did not have to be the sole motivating factor for the alleged harassment and hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's instruction, fairly read, does not imply that Hernandez was required to prove that religious discrimination constituted the sole motivation for defendants' conduct.  It \"properly apprise[d] the jury of the applicable law.\"   See McKinnon, 638 F.2d at 274.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE CLAIM</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez contends that the evidence was sufficient to warrant submission of his constructive discharge claim to a jury.  As discussed above, Hernandez' constructive discharge claim fails because the jury rendered an adverse verdict on the requisite hostile work environment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>V. ADMISSION AND EXCLUSION OF WITNESS TESTIMONY</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the admission or exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.  See Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 185 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1469, 137 L.Ed.2d 682 (1997).  We review the district court's balancing of probative value against prejudicial impact to determine \"whether the balance actually struck is so egregiously one-sided that it requires reversal.\"  Espeaignnette v. Gene Tierney Co., 43 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Admission of Sandra Marrero's Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that the district court, over his repeated objection, erroneously permitted Sandra Marrero to testify.  He further contends that defendants violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(3) because Marrero went unnamed during the discovery period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He complains that had her identity been timely disclosed, he might have deposed her instead of another witness in conformity with the court's allotment of five depositions.  The court ruled that Hernandez' argument was \"meritless\" and did \"not require additional discussion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not err.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(3) does not require disclosure of a prospective witness' identity during the discovery period.  Rather, Rule 26(a)(3)(C) declares that \"[u]nless otherwise directed by the court, these disclosures shall be made at least 30 days before trial.\"   Marrero was named as a witness in the October 16, 1996, pretrial order, well over thirty days before trial commenced on November 21, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>B. Exclusion of Victor Nales and Jasmin Vasquez as Witnesses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez argues that the district court erred in excluding the testimony of Victor Nales and Jasmin Vasquez.  Hernandez alleges that Nales and Vasquez were identified in his initial administrative complaint and were included in the collective description \"employees or representatives of the defendants\" offered during the discovery period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  He further contends that the court's decision to exclude Nales and Vasquez affected the outcome of the trial because they were the only former MFI employees listed in the pretrial order and thus would have corroborated his testimony.  The district court summarily dismissed Hernandez' claim, noting that the issue did \"not require additional discussion.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion.  The exclusion of Nales and Vasquez as witnesses was harmless because the pretrial order did not distinguish between the testimony of Nales and Vasquez and that of the eight MFI employees listed in the same group of prospective witnesses.  Without specifying what Nales and Vasquez would have testified at trial, Hernandez has not shown that their testimony would not be cumulative.  See Hall v. Arthur, 141 F.3d 844, 849 (8th Cir.1998) (holding that exclusion of testimony was harmless because testimony was cumulative and \"defendants did not make their offer of proof in the form of questions and answers\").  Hernandez' general assertion that the prospective witnesses would have corroborated his testimony concerning religious harassment at MFI is insufficient.  See McDonald v. Steward, 132 F.3d 225, 232 (5th Cir.1998) (\"The burden of proving substantial prejudice lies with the party asserting error.\")  (citing Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Mijalis, 15 F.3d 1314, 1319 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's entry of judgment as a matter of law and its denial of Hernandez' motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Hernandez brought claims under Puerto Rico Laws Annotated title 29, &#167; 185(a)(1995);  Puerto Rico Laws Annotated title 29, &#167; 146 (1995);  and general provisions of the Puerto Rican civil code governing tortious and contractual acts.

He was supervised by Angel Rodrguez in 1988, Hector Rodrguez in 1991, and Julio Ocampo throughout his employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He had become involved with a Christian group known as Defensores de la Fe shortly before he obtained a position at MFI.  He alleges that his supervisors, including Ocampo, were fully aware of his fundamentalist beliefs when they offered him a job and that he rarely engaged in religious activities during scheduled work hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez made the following allegations of religious discrimination and retaliation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. 1988 Incident with Angel Rodrguez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez contends that Angel Rodrguez repeatedly told offensive religious jokes in his presence and unjustly criticized Hernandez' work.  Hernandez lashed out at Rodrguez on one such occasion, prompting Rodrguez to reprimand Hernandez in writing for insubordination and the use of profane language.  He responded with a complaint in which he alleged that Rodrguez was persecuting him for religious reasons.  Upon Ocampo's intervention, Hernandez admitted his insubordination and apologized in writing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. 1991 Incident with Ocampo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocampo spotted Hernandez reading the Bible during his lunch break sometime after the summer of 1991.  Although Ocampo knew that Hernandez was at lunch, he told Rodrguez to instruct Hernandez to stop reading the Bible.  Hernandez did not file a complaint or make a written record of the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez received training for MFI's new accounting system in 1992.  Shortly thereafter, Ocampo granted Hernandez' request for a temporary employee to help Hernandez implement the accounts payable systems and complete his preexisting duties.  Hernandez later began working with the refurbished payroll conversion system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. September 2, 1992, Incident with Ocampo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 1992, Hernandez was on the telephone when a coworker passed him a religious pamphlet.  Hernandez alleges that Ocampo noticed the religious tract on his desk, called him into a conference room and threatened to fire him if he was caught reading or even speaking of religious matters again.  Hernandez consulted Nellie Negrn, MFI's personnel manager, the same day and attempted to file a state insurance fund application to obtain treatment for stress.  Negrn dissuaded him from filing the claim and he eventually attended sessions with MFI's in-house psychologists.  Hector Rodrguez sent Hernandez a memorandum on September 3 requesting that he refrain from reading nonjob-related materials during work hours.  Hernandez wrote a letter clarifying that he had been reading religious literature and apologizing for his conduct.  He contends that Ocampo challenged him to a fight after reading this letter, which prompted Hernandez to apprise the personnel department of the encounter and resubmit his state insurance fund application.  Negrn's assistant arranged a meeting with Ocampo and various MFI officials to discuss the incident.  Ocampo extended an apology to Hernandez after the meeting, which he accepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez alleges that despite Ocampo's apology, his employment situation worsened following the September 1992 incident.  Specifically, he felt pressured to complete his assigned tasks in eight hours and feared that working overtime would result in his discharge from MFI.  In fact, he was granted overtime each time he requested it and was the only accounting employee who received payment for the extra work.  Hernandez also noted a marked increase in electronic messages assigning him additional duties commenting on his lack of productivity after September 1992.  However, his supervisors, including Ocampo, continued to commend his performance, and Ocampo approved the hiring of another temporary employee to ease Hernandez' burden in November 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez resigned on February 2, 1993, after learning that Ocampo had decided to terminate his temporary help.  Rodrguez confirmed Hernandez' resignation in a February 2 memo which made no reference to religious discrimination.  At Ocampo's request, Hernandez continued to work until the end of the week.  Although Hernandez initially cited stress-related reasons for his resignation, in a February 5 memorandum he referred to the September 1992 incident with Ocampo as the source of his employment difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. REFUSAL TO INSTRUCT ON RETALIATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Hernandez' motion for a new trial, rejecting his contention that the court should have instructed the jury on the retaliation claim.  It stated that it refused to give an instruction because \"there was no evidence in the Record to support the allegation that Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff as a result of his opposition to any alleged employment practice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Hernandez contends that the court erred in refusing to instruct on retaliation.  He argues that Ocampo's retaliatory conduct, which resulted in a workplace permeated with harassment and in Hernandez' ultimate \"discharge,\" was supported by substantial evidence at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a).  To establish a prima facie case of retaliation in the workplace, Hernandez must demonstrate that:  (1) He engaged in protected conduct under Title VII;  (2) he suffered an adverse employment action;  and (3) the adverse action is causally connected to the protected activity.  See Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718191\"><a href=\"/opinion/718191/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1305-34-fedrserv3d-1566-rachel-l-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 535 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume for purposes of this disposition that Hernandez engaged in protected activity and that his informal complaint to the personnel department constituted sufficient opposition.  His appeal fails, however, because he did not suffer an adverse employment action.  Section 2000e-3 encompasses a variety of adverse employment actions, including demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations, and toleration of harassment by other employees.  See Wyatt v. City of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195603\"><a href=\"/opinion/195603/wyatt-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1994) (citing 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Employment Discrimination, &#167; 87.20, at 17-101 to 17-107 (1994)).  The evidence reflects none of such actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez complains that he received an increased amount of electronic messages which contained onerous assignments and what Hernandez interpreted as critical reports on his productivity.  This influx of electronic messages does not, however, rise to the level of an adverse action because MFI supervisors similarly urged all MFI accounting employees to implement the new systems quickly and efficiently.  Significantly, Hernandez continued to receive favorable performance evaluations from his supervisors, including a November 25 memorandum lauding his installation of the payroll system.  Ocampo's alleged admonition that Hernandez complete his work within an eight hour period \"or else\" does not constitute adverse action.  Hernandez was granted overtime each time he requested it and was the only accounting employee who received temporary assistance and payment for working overtime.  Cf. DeNovellis v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746214\"><a href=\"/opinion/746214/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1520-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45029-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 306 (1st Cir.1997) (holding that divesting employee of assignments and responsibilities establishes an adverse employment action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hernandez has failed to offer facts indicating that his informal complaint caused any adverse actions.  Specifically, Hernandez' accusations are \"lacking in the concrete documentation necessary to prove the causal link between [his] protected activity and [his] retaliatory treatment.\"   See Ramos v. Roche Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563224\"><a href=\"/opinion/563224/nixa-ramos-v-roche-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1991).  First, the additional responsibilities outlined in the electronic messages, though onerous, resulted from a policy that Hernandez agreed to implement long before Ocampo asked him to \"go outside.\"   See, e.g., Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Ctr., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195529\"><a href=\"/opinion/195529/hoeppner-v-crotched-mountain/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that employee failed to establish causal link between employee's involvement in protected union activity and August 1990 probation because there was no evidence in the record that union activity occurred before then);  Ramos, 936 F.2d at 49 (noting that petitioner was passed over for promotion twice before signing affidavit with EEOC in reaching conclusion that petitioner failed to establish causal link between protected activity and adverse employment action).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, that Ocampo imposed disadvantageous assignments and directed that work be completed in eight hours \"or else\" does not constitute retaliation.  Hernandez' accounting coworkers were required to work long hours as well.  If Hernandez was singled out, it was in a laudatory fashion as the only accounting employee to receive overtime pay or temporary assistance in late 1992 and early 1993.  In sum, he failed to present evidence sufficient to raise an inference that the additional stress he experienced at MFI after September 1992 resulted from retaliation rather than from the previously agreed upon implementation of MFI's new accounting system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hernandez' claim that he suffered a retaliatory constructive discharge fails.  A \"discharge\" under &#167; 2000e-3(a) may be constructive as well as a direct firing.  See Hart v. University Sys., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Because the jury, with all of Hernandez' evidence on his retaliation claim before it, returned an adverse verdict on his hostile work environment claim, he cannot succeed on his retaliatory constructive discharge claim.  Hernandez argues that another jury might find the requisite hostile work environment, but he has had his day in court and is not entitled to a new trial on that speculation alone.  The jury having rejected the hostile work environment claim, it necessarily rejected the basis for the retaliatory constructive discharge claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>II.

He further contends that defendants violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(3) because Marrero went unnamed during the discovery period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He complains that had her identity been timely disclosed, he might have deposed her instead of another witness in conformity with the court's allotment of five depositions.

The exclusion of Nales and Vasquez as witnesses was harmless because the pretrial order did not distinguish between the testimony of Nales and Vasquez and that of the eight MFI employees listed in the same group of prospective witnesses.  Without specifying what Nales and Vasquez would have testified at trial, Hernandez has not shown that their testimony would not be cumulative.  See Hall v. Arthur, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753049\"><a href=\"/opinion/753049/john-hall-and-linda-hall-v-james-arthur-md-and-allan-c-gocio-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 849 (8th Cir.1998) (holding that exclusion of testimony was harmless because testimony was cumulative and \"defendants did not make their offer of proof in the form of questions and answers\").  Hernandez' general assertion that the prospective witnesses would have corroborated his testimony concerning religious harassment at MFI is insufficient.  See McDonald v. Steward, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749807\"><a href=\"/opinion/749807/willie-ray-mcdonald-v-j-steward-library-supervisor-michael-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 232 (5th Cir.1998) (\"The burden of proving substantial prejudice lies with the party asserting error.\")  (citing Federal Deposit Ins.
