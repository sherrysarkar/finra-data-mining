On April 10, 1997, a federal\n\ngrand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned a\n\nthree-count indictment against a number of individuals.                              In\n\nCount      2   of   the    indictment,    the     grand    jury    charged    several\n\npersons, including Juan R. Merced-Morales, with conspiring to\n\ndistribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.       Following a five-week trial, a petit jury found Merced-\n\nMorales        guilty     as   charged.     The    district       court    thereafter\n\nsentenced him to serve 292 months in prison.                        Merced-Morales\n\nappeals.1       Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm.\n\n               The appellant's basic argument entails a challenge to\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence.                    This challenge invokes a\n\nfamiliar standard of review:              when evaluating the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence presented against a defendant in a criminal case,\n\nan    appellate      court      must   \"canvass    the     evidence       (direct   and\n\ncircumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution\n\nand    decide       whether     that   evidence,     including      all     plausible\n\ninferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder\n\nto    conclude       beyond     a   reasonable     doubt    that    the     defendant\n\n\n       1\n      Merced-Morales stood trial with eight other alleged\ncoconspirators (all of whom were found guilty), and we\nconsolidated the nine ensuing appeals. Seven of them, including\nthis one, were argued together on September 14, 2000. The other\ntwo were submitted on the briefs to the same panel.     Because\nthis appeal raises at least one issue peculiar to Merced-\nMorales, we have chosen to decide it in a separate opinion.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcommitted the charged crime.\"        United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d\n\n490, 494 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           The statute of conviction here is 21 U.S.C. § 846.             To\n\nconvict a defendant of violating that statute, the government\n\nmust \"show beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed\n\nand that a particular defendant agreed to participate in it,\n\nintending to commit the underlying substantive offense.\"             United\n\nStates v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993).              Proof\n\nof the illicit agreement requires \"no particular formalities.\"\n\nId.   Thus, a defendant may join in a drug-trafficking conspiracy\n\nwithout    knowing   the   full   extent    of   the   enterprise   or   the\n\nidentities of all the coconspirators.              See United States v.\n\nRivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989).               By like\n\ntoken, the government may satisfy its burden through either\n\ndirect or circumstantial evidence, or through any combination of\n\nthe two.    See United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 772\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 33\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).     In short, both the conspiracy's existence and\n\na particular defendant's membership in it may be inferred from\n\nthe participants' \"words and actions and the interdependence of\n\nactivities and persons involved.\"          United States v. Boylan, 898\n\nF.2d 230, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          Against this backdrop, we turn to the appellant's\n\nprincipal assignment of error.         Merced-Morales concedes, as he\n\nmust, that the government proved the existence of a large, long-\n\nlasting conspiracy to peddle various controlled substances.             The\n\nquestion, then, is whether the government also proved that he\n\nwas part and parcel of it.            The record dictates that this\n\nquestion must be answered affirmatively.\n\n          At trial, the government adduced competent evidence\n\nthat Merced-Morales sold contraband at a drug point operated by\n\nthe conspiracy in the Ramos Antonini housing project, and that,\n\non occasion, he carried a firearm to protect that drug point.\n\nThis evidence suffices to undergird his conviction.            See, e.g.,\n\nRivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d at 1079 (holding that \"[t]he fact that\n\n[the   defendant]      participated    in    one   retail   link   of   the\n\ndistribution     chain,   knowing     that    it   extended   beyond    his\n\nindividual role, [is] sufficient\" to demonstrate his culpability\n\nas a member of a drug-trafficking conspiracy).\n\n          The appellant seeks to deflect the force of this proof\n\nby   assailing   the    credibility    of    the   government's    several\n\nwitnesses.     But that line of attack avails him naught.                In\n\npassing upon challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we\n\nare bound to refrain from making independent judgments as to\n\nwitness credibility.       See Noah, 130 F.3d at 494; United States\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fv. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).     We recently\n\nsummed up this principle in United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d\n\n480 (1st Cir. 2000), in which we wrote that \"[e]xcept in the\n\nmost unusual circumstances . . . credibility determinations are\n\nfor the jury, not for an appellate court.\"     Id. at 483.   The\n\ncircumstances here are not extraordinary, so this case comes\n\nwithin the sweep of the general rule, rather than the long-odds\n\nexception to it.\n\n         The appellant puts a twist on his credibility theme,\n\nattempting to invoke the specter of a witness-bribery statute\n\nthat provides in pertinent part:\n\n         Whoever . . . directly or indirectly, gives,\n         offers or promises anything of value to any\n         person, for or because of the testimony\n         under oath or affirmation given or to be\n         given by such person as a witness upon a\n         trial, hearing, or other proceeding, before\n         any court . . . authorized by the laws of\n         the United States to hear evidence or take\n         testimony . . . shall be fined under this\n         title or imprisoned for not more than two\n         years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2).   In 1998, a Tenth Circuit panel held that\n\nthis statute forbade testimony given in exchange for promised\n\nleniency, and applied an exclusionary rule to remedy perceived\n\nviolations.   See United States v. Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343 (10th\n\nCir. 1998) (Singleton I).      The appellant acknowledges that\n\nSingleton I has been withdrawn and that the Tenth Circuit,\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fsitting en banc, has repudiated it.                  See     United States v.\n\nSingleton,    165    F.3d   1297,    1298    (10th   Cir.     1999)      (en   banc)\n\n(Singleton    II),    cert.      denied,    527   U.S.     1024   (1999).         The\n\nappellant also acknowledges that this court has disavowed its\n\nreasoning.    See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 198 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).    He nonetheless argues that the spirit of Singleton\n\nI persists, and that the rationale behind the decision — namely,\n\nthat   testimony     from   government       witnesses      who   have    received\n\ninducements to testify is inherently unreliable — justifies the\n\nreversal of the jury verdict in this case.\n\n           We reject this specious argument.               While the testimony\n\nof cooperating witnesses must always be scrutinized with care,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), the witnesses here were subjected to withering cross-\n\nexamination by several sets of defense counsel, and the jury was\n\nproperly instructed to weigh their testimony in light of the\n\npromises made and inducements tendered.                    The jury apparently\n\nfound the witnesses credible.               We know of no authority that\n\nwould permit us, in the circumstances of this case, to second-\n\nguess the jury's assessment.          We therefore decline to accept the\n\nappellant's    reading      of   either     the   letter    or    the    spirit   of\n\nsection 201(c)(2).       See Lara, 181 F.3d at 198; Singleton II, 165\n\nF.3d at 1298; see also United States v. Lowery, 166 F.3d 1119,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f1122-24 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Ramsey, 165 F.3d 980,\n\n987 (D.C. Cir. 1999); United States v. Ware, 161 F.3d 414, 418-\n\n25 (6th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1045 (1999); United\n\nStates v. Haese, 162 F.3d 359, 366-68 (5th Cir. 1998), cert.\n\ndenied, 526 U.S. 1138 (1999).\n\n            The appellant's second assignment of error addresses\n\nhis sentence.     He complains that the district court should have\n\nlowered his offense level because he was, at most, a \"minor\" or\n\n\"minimal\"     participant      in   the       offense     of    conviction.       This\n\ncomplaint lacks force.\n\n            USSG §3B1.2 permits a sentencing court to shrink a\n\ndefendant's     offense     level        by       four    levels    for   \"minimal\"\n\nparticipation or two levels for \"minor\" participation.                        To earn\n\neither   adjustment,      however,            a    defendant       must   prove     an\n\nentitlement to it.       See    United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330,\n\n332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).              Moreover, if the sentencing court\n\nrefuses to grant such an adjustment, the defendant has the\n\nburden   of   demonstrating         to   the      court    of   appeals   that     the\n\nsentencing court's role-in-the-offense determination was clearly\n\nerroneous.     See id.    This is a heavy burden, and the appellant\n\ncannot carry it in the instant case.                       Cf. United States v.\n\nGraciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995) (warning that                        battles\n\nover a defendant's precise role in the offense almost always\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fwill be won or lost before the sentencing court).                 We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           Merced-Morales tries to portray himself as merely a bit\n\nplayer in the sprawling narcotics extravaganza orchestrated by\n\nJosé Vega-Figueroa and Carlos Hernández-Vega, suggesting that\n\nothers played much more prominent supporting parts.                But role-\n\nin-the-offense   adjustments    do    not     hinge    exclusively    on   the\n\ncomparative conduct of persons within a criminal enterprise.                To\n\nthe contrary, the availability vel non of a role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustment also depends \"on comparing each offender's actions\n\nand relative culpability with the elements of the offense.\"\n\nOcasio, 914 F.2d at 333.       In other words, a defendant seeking\n\nsuch an adjustment must show that he was \"substantially less\n\nculpable than the average participant.\"           Id.\n\n           Measured    by   these        benchmarks,     the     appellant's\n\ninitiative fails.     The indictment in this case charged Merced-\n\nMorales with conspiring to distribute narcotics — and the proof,\n\ntaken in the light most flattering to the verdict, showed that\n\nhe did exactly that.     Moreover, he was not merely an occasional\n\nparticipant,   but    functioned    as    a   dealer    on   a   regular   and\n\nsustained basis.      After hearing arguments on the question, the\n\nlower court determined unequivocally that Merced-Morales was\n\nneither a \"minimal\" nor \"minor\" participant in the conspiracy,\n\nbut, rather, a full-fledged member.\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f            Tarrying    would   serve    no   useful   purpose.    \"[T]he\n\ndetermination of a defendant's role in an offense is necessarily\n\nfact-specific.\"    Graciani, 61 F.3d at 75.       Given the elements of\n\nthe offense of which Merced-Morales was convicted, the evidence\n\namassed by the government, the allocation of the burden of proof\n\nvis-à-vis    downward   role-in-the-offense       adjustments,    and   the\n\nstandard of appellate review, we see no hint of clear error in\n\nthe sentencing court's decision to deny a downward adjustment in\n\nthis instance.\n\n            We need go no further.        We conclude, without serious\n\nquestion, that the evidence introduced at trial, taken in the\n\nlight most congenial to the government's theory of the case,\n\namply supported the appellant's conviction.             We also conclude\n\nthat the lower court did not clearly err in refusing to treat\n\nthe appellant as a \"minor\" or \"minimal\" participant with respect\n\nto the offense of conviction.           Accordingly, the judgment below\n\nmust be\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",

In short, both the conspiracy's existence and\n\na particular defendant's membership in it may be inferred from\n\nthe participants' \"words and actions and the interdependence of\n\nactivities and persons involved.\"          United States v.

Merced-Morales concedes, as he\n\nmust, that the government proved the existence of a large, long-\n\nlasting conspiracy to peddle various controlled substances.             The\n\nquestion, then, is whether the government also proved that he\n\nwas part and parcel of it.            The record dictates that this\n\nquestion must be answered affirmatively.\n\n          At trial, the government adduced competent evidence\n\nthat Merced-Morales sold contraband at a drug point operated by\n\nthe conspiracy in the Ramos Antonini housing project, and that,\n\non occasion, he carried a firearm to protect that drug point.\n\nThis evidence suffices to undergird his conviction.            See, e.g.,\n\nRivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d at 1079 (holding that \"[t]he fact that\n\n[the   defendant]      participated    in    one   retail   link   of   the\n\ndistribution     chain,   knowing     that    it   extended   beyond    his\n\nindividual role, [is] sufficient\" to demonstrate his culpability\n\nas a member of a drug-trafficking conspiracy).\n\n          The appellant seeks to deflect the force of this proof\n\nby   assailing   the    credibility    of    the   government's    several\n\nwitnesses.     But that line of attack avails him naught.                In\n\npassing upon challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we\n\nare bound to refrain from making independent judgments as to\n\nwitness credibility.

The\n\ncircumstances here are not extraordinary, so this case comes\n\nwithin the sweep of the general rule, rather than the long-odds\n\nexception to it.\n\n         The appellant puts a twist on his credibility theme,\n\nattempting to invoke the specter of a witness-bribery statute\n\nthat provides in pertinent part:\n\n         Whoever . . . directly or indirectly, gives,\n         offers or promises anything of value to any\n         person, for or because of the testimony\n         under oath or affirmation given or to be\n         given by such person as a witness upon a\n         trial, hearing, or other proceeding, before\n         any court . . . authorized by the laws of\n         the United States to hear evidence or take\n         testimony . . . shall be fined under this\n         title or imprisoned for not more than two\n         years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2).   In 1998, a Tenth Circuit panel held that\n\nthis statute forbade testimony given in exchange for promised\n\nleniency, and applied an exclusionary rule to remedy perceived\n\nviolations.

He nonetheless argues that the spirit of Singleton\n\nI persists, and that the rationale behind the decision — namely,\n\nthat   testimony     from   government       witnesses      who   have    received\n\ninducements to testify is inherently unreliable — justifies the\n\nreversal of the jury verdict in this case.\n\n           We reject this specious argument.               While the testimony\n\nof cooperating witnesses must always be scrutinized with care,\n\nsee, e.g., United States v. LiCausi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198296\"><a href=\"/opinion/198296/united-states-v-licausi/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), the witnesses here were subjected to withering cross-\n\nexamination by several sets of defense counsel, and the jury was\n\nproperly instructed to weigh their testimony in light of the\n\npromises made and inducements tendered.                    The jury apparently\n\nfound the witnesses credible.               We know of no authority that\n\nwould permit us, in the circumstances of this case, to second-\n\nguess the jury's assessment.

He complains that the district court should have\n\nlowered his offense level because he was, at most, a \"minor\" or\n\n\"minimal\"     participant      in   the       offense     of    conviction.       This\n\ncomplaint lacks force.\n\n            USSG §3B1.2 permits a sentencing court to shrink a\n\ndefendant's     offense     level        by       four    levels    for   \"minimal\"\n\nparticipation or two levels for \"minor\" participation.                        To earn\n\neither   adjustment,      however,            a    defendant       must   prove     an\n\nentitlement to it.       See    United States v. Ocasio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n332-33 (1st Cir. 1990).              Moreover, if the sentencing court\n\nrefuses to grant such an adjustment, the defendant has the\n\nburden   of   demonstrating         to   the      court    of   appeals   that     the\n\nsentencing court's role-in-the-offense determination was clearly\n\nerroneous.     See id.    This is a heavy burden, and the appellant\n\ncannot carry it in the instant case.                       Cf. United States v.\n\nGraciani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1st Cir. 1995) (warning that                        battles\n\nover a defendant's precise role in the offense almost always\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fwill be won or lost before the sentencing court).                 We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           Merced-Morales tries to portray himself as merely a bit\n\nplayer in the sprawling narcotics extravaganza orchestrated by\n\nJosé Vega-Figueroa and Carlos Hernández-Vega, suggesting that\n\nothers played much more prominent supporting parts.                But role-\n\nin-the-offense   adjustments    do    not     hinge    exclusively    on   the\n\ncomparative conduct of persons within a criminal enterprise.                To\n\nthe contrary, the availability vel non of a role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustment also depends \"on comparing each offender's actions\n\nand relative culpability with the elements of the offense.\"\n\nOcasio, 914 F.2d at 333.       In other words, a defendant seeking\n\nsuch an adjustment must show that he was \"substantially less\n\nculpable than the average participant.\"           Id.\n\n           Measured    by   these        benchmarks,     the     appellant's\n\ninitiative fails.     The indictment in this case charged Merced-\n\nMorales with conspiring to distribute narcotics — and the proof,\n\ntaken in the light most flattering to the verdict, showed that\n\nhe did exactly that.     Moreover, he was not merely an occasional\n\nparticipant,   but    functioned    as    a   dealer    on   a   regular   and\n\nsustained basis.      After hearing arguments on the question, the\n\nlower court determined unequivocally that Merced-Morales was\n\nneither a \"minimal\" nor \"minor\" participant in the conspiracy,\n\nbut, rather, a full-fledged member.\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f            Tarrying    would   serve    no   useful   purpose.    \"[T]he\n\ndetermination of a defendant's role in an offense is necessarily\n\nfact-specific.\"    Graciani, 61 F.3d at 75.       Given the elements of\n\nthe offense of which Merced-Morales was convicted, the evidence\n\namassed by the government, the allocation of the burden of proof\n\nvis-à-vis    downward   role-in-the-offense       adjustments,    and   the\n\nstandard of appellate review, we see no hint of clear error in\n\nthe sentencing court's decision to deny a downward adjustment in\n\nthis instance.\n\n            We need go no further.        We conclude, without serious\n\nquestion, that the evidence introduced at trial, taken in the\n\nlight most congenial to the government's theory of the case,\n\namply supported the appellant's conviction.             We also conclude\n\nthat the lower court did not clearly err in refusing to treat\n\nthe appellant as a \"minor\" or \"minimal\" participant with respect\n\nto the offense of conviction.           Accordingly, the judgment below\n\nmust be\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f</pre>",
