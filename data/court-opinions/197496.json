Clark\r                                                      , City Solicitor, was on\r\nbrief, for appellees.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n                       August 6, 1997\r\n                                        \r\n\nHon. John R. Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\r\r\n\n          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.  This suit arises out of damage\r\n\nto plaintiff's two vintage airplanes, which were stored at the\r\n\nCity of Manchester Airport in Londonderry, New Hampshire.\r\n\nAfter unsuccessfully bringing tort and breach of contract\r\n\nclaims against the city and others in state court, Mark Edwards\r\n\nalleged violations of his civil rights in federal district\r\n\ncourt. The district court held that the federal suit was in\r\n\nlarge part an impermissible attack on a judgment by the state\r\n\ncourt and dismissed the complaint. We affirm.\r\n\n                             I.\r\n\n          Mark Edwards began keeping his airplanes at the\r\n\nairport in 1973 pursuant to an oral agreement. In 1990, the\r\n\nairport instituted new licensing, insurance and indemnity\r\n\nrequirements for its tenants. Edwards had his airplanes\r\n\ninspected for licensing purposes and discovered damage to the\r\n\nplanes, dating from around 1987, caused, he believed, by sand\r\n\nand other debris blown about by jet and propeller wash. The\r\n\ndamage apparently rendered the airplanes inoperable. Without\r\n\nrepairs, which would cost at least $25,000 for one of the\r\n\nplanes alone, Edwards was unable to comply with the defendants'\r\n\nnew leasing requirements.\r\n\n          Edwards brought suit in state court seeking\r\n\ncompensatory damages and an injunction preventing the\r\n\ndefendants from moving or further harming the planes. Edwards'\r\n\nclaims were based on theories of breach of bailment contract\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nand conversion in tort. The action was dismissed in June 1995.\r\n\nThe state court reasoned that the contract claim failed because\r\n\nEdwards had not pleaded facts sufficient to allege a bailment\r\n\ncontract, and that the tort claim failed because N.H. Rev.\r\n\nStat. Ann. S 422:17 bars on sovereign immunity grounds any tort\r\n\naction based on \"the construction, maintenance, operation,\r\n\nsuperintendence or management of any air navigation facility.\"\r\n\nThe dismissal was summarily affirmed by the Supreme Court of\r\n\nNew Hampshire in December 1995 and April 1996.\r\n\n          The defendants began eviction proceedings in state\r\n\ncourt. Edwards raised several counterclaims, arguing that the\r\n\nsovereign immunity statute was unconstitutional for numerous\r\n\nreasons, but later non-suited the counterclaims. The city\r\n\nprevailed in the eviction proceeding in April 1996 and took\r\n\nnon-exclusive possession of one of the airplanes. The aircraft\r\n\nhas since been stored by the city at its own expense.\r\n\nPlaintiff now claims that defendants \"have undertaken to\r\n\ndispose [of] the appellant's one aircraft remaining on the\r\n\nairport grounds without complying with applicable state law\r\n\nthat prescribes a procedure that must be followed for such\r\n\nactions.\"\r\n\n          Plaintiff initiated a federal action in October 1996.\r\n\nHe filed an amended complaint in November 1996, accompanied by\r\n\n1.  The counterclaims of unconstitutionality seemed to be based\r\non the state rather than the federal constitution.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\na motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary\r\n\ninjunction. The amended complaint asserted four causes of\r\n\naction under 42 U.S.C. S  1983: (1) the state court\r\n\ninterpretation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. S 422:17 violated\r\n\nplaintiff's rights to procedural and substantive due process of\r\n\nlaw in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2)\r\n\nthe state court interpretation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. S 422:17\r\n\ndeprived plaintiff of his property without due process of law\r\n\nin violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; (3) N.H.\r\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. S 422:17 is facially unconstitutional in that\r\n\nit deprives individuals of equal protection of law as\r\n\nguaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (4) the\r\n\nstate court interpretation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. S 422:17\r\n\nviolated the Contracts Clause. The amended complaint also\r\n\nincluded supplemental state law causes of action.\r\n\n          Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The district\r\n\ncourt held a status conference and issued an order directing\r\n\nplaintiff to show cause why the complaint should not be\r\n\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction. The court dismissed the\r\n\ncomplaint in December 1996, concluding that the federal claims\r\n\nwere barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and res judicata,\r\n\n2.  Although the district court apprised counsel of its\r\ninterest in the relationship of the \r                                               Rooker-Feldman doctrine to\r\nthis case, neither party addressed the issue. The court\r\nnevertheless based its decision on that ground. As a\r\njurisdictional issue, it was within the court's purview to\r\nbring up sua sponte.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nand declining to exercise jurisdiction over the supplemental\r\n\nstate law claims. This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The \r                         Rooker-Feldman doctrine prohibits federal courts\r\n\nother than the Supreme Court from engaging in direct review of\r\n\nstate court decisions.   See  District \r                                                   of  \r                                                       Columbia \r                                                                Court \r                                                                       of\r\n\nAppeals v.  Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476 (1983);     Rooker v.\r\n\nFidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16 (1923). A corollary\r\n\nof the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is that lower federal courts\r\n\nlack jurisdiction to consider claims inextricably intertwined\r\n\nwith review of state judicial proceedings. This kind of\r\n\ninterrelationship occurs if resolution of the claims in federal\r\n\ncourt would amount to federal appellate review of the state\r\n\ncourt decision. Lancellotti v. \r                                           Fay, 909 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1990).\r\n\n          Here, three of Edwards' federal causes of action are\r\n\n\"as applied\" challenges to the constitutionality of N.H. Rev.\r\n\nStat. Ann. S 422:17. Edwards argues that the state courts\r\n\nviolated the federal Constitution by refusing to hear his\r\n\nclaims against the defendants. He argues that his claims\r\n\nconcerning the unconstitutionality of the New Hampshire statute\r\n\n\"were only brought . . . after his attempt to litigate in state\r\n\ncourt was unsuccessful, due to the application of a state\r\n\nsovereign immunity statute to him.\" But \"[i]t is well-\r\n\nestablished that lower federal courts have no jurisdiction to\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nhear appeals from state court decisions, even if the state\r\n\njudgment is challenged as unconstitutional.\"    Schneider v.\r\n\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico\r                                             , 917 F.2d 620, 628 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1990).\r\n\n          As the district court aptly stated, these claims are\r\n\na \"not-so-cleverly disguised\" attack on the decisions of the\r\n\nstate court.   Edwards v.  City  \r                                            of \r                                                Manchester, No. 96-517-M\r\n\n(D.N.H. Dec. 17, 1996). As such, under the     Rooker-Feldman\r\n\ndoctrine, we lack jurisdiction to consider them.\r\n\n          Plaintiff's only remaining federal cause of action,\r\n\nwhich is based on the Equal Protection Clause, is a facial\r\n\nconstitutional challenge to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. S 422:17. The\r\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar a party from challenging\r\n\nthe constitutionality of a state statute on its face.\r\n\nSchneider, 917 F.2d at 628. However, this claim is\r\n\n3.  Plaintiff's claim -- that the    Rooker-Feldman doctrine\r\ncannot be applied here because \"the courts of the State of New\r\nHampshire never had nor assumed jurisdiction\" over his state\r\ncourt suit -- is without merit.  Cf. United \r                                                        States v.  United\r\nMine Workers of America\r                                  , 330 U.S. 258, 292 n.57 (1947) (noting\r\nthat it cannot \"be broadly asserted that a judgment is always\r\na nullity if jurisdiction . . . is wanting\" because \"a court\r\nhas jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction\" (internal\r\nquotation marks and citation omitted)).\r\n\n4.  One of these federal claims arguably involves an issue on\r\nwhich the state court has not passed. Plaintiff's claim that\r\nhe has been deprived of property without due process of law is\r\nbased in part on his allegation that the defendants are\r\nplanning to sell his one airplane remaining at the airport\r\nwithout following the proper state procedures. Edwards could\r\nhave raised his concerns about the disposition of his airplane\r\nat the eviction proceedings, and thus the claim is barred by\r\nres judicata principles.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nnevertheless barred by the doctrine of res judicata.    Res\r\n\njudicata precludes later litigation of matters that could have\r\n\nbeen litigated (as well as those that actually were litigated)\r\n\nin an earlier action between the same parties for the same\r\n\ncause of action.  In \r                                 re \r                                    Alfred \r                                           P., 495 A.2d 1264, 1265 (N.H.\r\n\n1985); see \r                       also ERG, \r                                 Inc. v. Barnes, 624 A.2d 555, 558 (N.H.\r\n\n1993) (defining \"cause of action\" as \"embrac[ing] all theories\r\n\non which relief could be claimed arising out of the same\r\n\nfactual transaction\"). Here, plaintiff could have raised his\r\n\nequal protection challenge to the statute during the state\r\n\ncourt proceedings. The claim is, in any event, without merit,\r\n\nas it is rational for a state to grant sovereign immunity in\r\n\nthe form of the New Hampshire statute.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r\n\n5.  A federal court applies state law to determine the\r\npreclusive effect of a state court decision. 28 U.S.C.

Rev. Stat. Ann. S 422:17\r\n\nviolated the Contracts Clause. The amended complaint also\r\n\nincluded supplemental state law causes of action.\r\n\n          Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The district\r\n\ncourt held a status conference and issued an order directing\r\n\nplaintiff to show cause why the complaint should not be\r\n\ndismissed for want of jurisdiction. The court dismissed the\r\n\ncomplaint in December 1996, concluding that the federal claims\r\n\nwere barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and res judicata,\r\n\n2.  Although the district court apprised counsel of its\r\ninterest in the relationship of the \r                                               Rooker-Feldman doctrine to\r\nthis case, neither party addressed the issue. The court\r\nnevertheless based its decision on that ground. As a\r\njurisdictional issue, it was within the court's purview to\r\nbring up sua sponte.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nand declining to exercise jurisdiction over the supplemental\r\n\nstate law claims. This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The \r                         Rooker-Feldman doctrine prohibits federal courts\r\n\nother than the Supreme Court from engaging in direct review of\r\n\nstate court decisions.

A corollary\r\n\nof the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is that lower federal courts\r\n\nlack jurisdiction to consider claims inextricably intertwined\r\n\nwith review of state judicial proceedings. This kind of\r\n\ninterrelationship occurs if resolution of the claims in federal\r\n\ncourt would amount to federal appellate review of the state\r\n\ncourt decision.

Rev.\r\n\nStat. Ann. S 422:17. Edwards argues that the state courts\r\n\nviolated the federal Constitution by refusing to hear his\r\n\nclaims against the defendants. He argues that his claims\r\n\nconcerning the unconstitutionality of the New Hampshire statute\r\n\n\"were only brought . . . after his attempt to litigate in state\r\n\ncourt was unsuccessful, due to the application of a state\r\n\nsovereign immunity statute to him.\" But \"[i]t is well-\r\n\nestablished that lower federal courts have no jurisdiction to\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nhear appeals from state court decisions, even if the state\r\n\njudgment is challenged as unconstitutional.\"    Schneider v.\r\n\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico\r                                             , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550639\"><a href=\"/opinion/550639/robert-e-schneider-jr-v-colegio-de-abogados-de-puerto-rico-robert-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1990).\r\n\n          As the district court aptly stated, these claims are\r\n\na \"not-so-cleverly disguised\" attack on the decisions of the\r\n\nstate court.

As such, under the     Rooker-Feldman\r\n\ndoctrine, we lack jurisdiction to consider them.\r\n\n          Plaintiff's only remaining federal cause of action,\r\n\nwhich is based on the Equal Protection Clause, is a facial\r\n\nconstitutional challenge to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. S 422:17. The\r\n\nRooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar a party from challenging\r\n\nthe constitutionality of a state statute on its face.\r\n\nSchneider, 917 F.2d at 628. However, this claim is\r\n\n3.  Plaintiff's claim -- that the    Rooker-Feldman doctrine\r\ncannot be applied here because \"the courts of the State of New\r\nHampshire never had nor assumed jurisdiction\" over his state\r\ncourt suit -- is without merit.  Cf. United \r                                                        States v.

One of these federal claims arguably involves an issue on\r\nwhich the state court has not passed. Plaintiff's claim that\r\nhe has been deprived of property without due process of law is\r\nbased in part on his allegation that the defendants are\r\nplanning to sell his one airplane remaining at the airport\r\nwithout following the proper state procedures. Edwards could\r\nhave raised his concerns about the disposition of his airplane\r\nat the eviction proceedings, and thus the claim is barred by\r\nres judicata principles.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nnevertheless barred by the doctrine of res judicata.    Res\r\n\njudicata precludes later litigation of matters that could have\r\n\nbeen litigated (as well as those that actually were litigated)\r\n\nin an earlier action between the same parties for the same\r\n\ncause of action.
