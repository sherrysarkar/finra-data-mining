On  April  21, 1991,  Angel\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nRodriguez shot  to  death his  two  young children  and  then\r\n\nkilled  himself.     This tragedy  occurred  four days  after\r\n\nRodriguez's wife,  Flor Maria Soto, complained  to the police\r\n\nabout  the  physical  and  emotional abuse  she  suffered  at\r\n\nRodriguez's  hands.    The   police,  knowing  Rodriguez  had\r\n\nthreatened to kill Soto  and her family  if Soto went to  the\r\n\npolice to have him jailed for his  spousal abuse, nonetheless\r\n\nviolated  their obligations  of confidentiality  and informed\r\n\nRodriguez of Soto's complaints.   Having done so,  the police\r\n\ndid not jail Rodriguez or take  steps to protect Soto and her\r\n\nfamily.   Soto's lawsuit alleges  that Rodriguez did  what he\r\n\nhad  threatened to do and that the state created this danger.\r\n\nRather than pursue  any claims available to  her under Puerto\r\n\nRican law, Soto chose to bring suit in federal court alleging\r\n\nconstitutional tort theories.\r\n\n          Soto brought suit under  42 U.S.C.   1983, claiming\r\n\nthat the actions of  the defendants, Carlos Flores, a  police\r\n\nofficer,   and   Ismael   Betancourt-Lebron,  Puerto   Rico's\r\n\nsuperintendent  of police,  violated her  and her  children's\r\n\nrights to substantive due process  and to equal protection of\r\n\nthe  laws.   The district court  granted summary  judgment in\r\n\nfavor  of  the defendants.   We  do  not reach  the difficult\r\n\nquestion of whether Soto, in her capacity as a representative\r\n\nof  her dead children, has presented a due process claim that\r\n\nwould  survive summary  judgment,  because we  find that  the\r\r\n\ndefendant  officers  are protected  by qualified  immunity on\r\n\nthat  claim.   As to the  equal protection claim,  we adopt a\r\n\nstandard  for  measuring  such  claims  in  domestic violence\r\n\ncases.   Testing the evidence against that  standard, we find\r\n\nthat   Soto  has   not   adduced   sufficient   evidence   of\r\n\ndiscriminatory   intent   to   survive    summary   judgment.\r\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court.                   \r\n\n                           I. Facts\r\n\n          We recite  the facts in the light most favorable to\r\n\nthe  plaintiff, the  party opposing  summary judgment.   Flor\r\n\nMaria Soto married Angel  Rodriguez, nicknamed Rafi, in 1981.\r\n\nRodriguez  and Soto had two children: Sally was born in 1983,\r\n\nand  Chayanne, a  boy, in  1988.   Approximately a  year into\r\n\ntheir marriage, Rodriguez began to abuse Soto emotionally and\r\n\nphysically.    This  abuse,  often connected  to  Rodriguez's\r\n\ndrinking, continued throughout their marriage.  The abuse was\r\n\napparent  to family  and friends.   As  one neighbor  put it,\r\n\n\"anyone who visited them could tell that [Soto] was an abused\r\n\nwife.\" Despite his constant  mistreatment of Soto,  Rodriguez\r\n\nnever abused the children. \r\n\n          Rodriguez did gardening and vehicle repair work for\r\n\nthe police  officers at Palmer Police  Station, a sub-station\r\n\nof  the Rio  Grande  precinct.   Rodriguez  was friends  with\r\n\nseveral of  the officers from Palmer  Station, including Luis\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nCarrasquillo-Morales  (\"Carrasquillo\")1 and  defendant Carlos\r\n\nFlores-Moreira (\"Flores\").    Rodriguez visited  the  station\r\n\nalmost daily.   Many of the  officers, when on patrol  in the\r\n\narea,   would visit the  Rodriguez-Soto home for  coffee or a\r\n\ndrink.    Flores  and Rodriguez  were  particularly friendly;\r\n\nabout once  a week, during  his patrol  rounds, Flores  would\r\n\nstop by the house for an hour's visit.\r\n\n          On Wednesday, April 17, 1991, Rodriguez struck Soto\r\n\nabout  her face  and  neck,  bruising  her,  and  called  her\r\n\ninsulting names.  When  Rodriguez fell drunkenly asleep, Soto\r\n\ngathered the children and went to her mother's house.  Soto's\r\n\nmother,  Hipolita Vega, convinced her to go to the police and\r\n\nfile a  complaint.  In nine  years of beatings,  some of them\r\n\nworse than  the one on April  17, Soto had never  sought help\r\n\nbecause  she  believed  that  the police  would  do  nothing,\r\n\nbecause she had  nowhere to go, and because she was afraid of\r\n\nRodriguez.    Rodriguez  had  threatened her  with  a  gun on\r\n\nseveral occasions and  told her  that he would  kill her  and\r\n\nother  members of  her  family if  she  went to  the  police.\r\n\nKnowing  that Rodriguez  was friendly  with the  police, Soto\r\n\nfeared that the police would do nothing except tell Rodriguez\r\n\nthat she had complained.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Carrasquillo was originally named  as a defendant in this\r\naction, but defaulted in the district  court proceedings.  In\r\norder to have a  final judgment from which she  could appeal,\r\nSoto  sought and  was granted  a  voluntary dismissal  of her\r\nclaim against Carrasquillo.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          On that night, despite her fear, Soto went with her\r\n\nmother and her children  to the Palmer Police Station.   When\r\n\nshe arrived, she was met by  Flores, who was the desk officer\r\n\non duty.   Flores could see  that Soto was crying  and marked\r\n\nwith bruises, \"pretty ugly hematomas.\"    Soto explained that\r\n\nRodriguez had beaten her.  Flores then radioed for the patrol\r\n\nofficers to come in and take her complaint, referring to Soto\r\n\non the radio as \"Rafi's wife\" and saying that it was a Law 54\r\n\ncase.  During  the fifteen  to twenty minutes  that Soto  and\r\n\nFlores waited for the patrol officers  to arrive, Flores told\r\n\nSoto that he himself had domestic violence problems, and that\r\n\nhis wife wanted  him to be  put in  jail.  He  urged Soto  to\r\n\npatch things up  with Rodriguez.   Soto responded by  telling\r\n\nFlores that Rodriguez's  beatings were too much  to stand and\r\n\nthat,  as Flores  knew,  Rodriguez was  a heavy  drinker, who\r\n\nbecame violent when drunk.  Soto told Flores about everything\r\n\nthat Rodriguez  had done and what he would do to her.  Flores\r\n\noffered  Soto  the  opportunity  to  stay  overnight  at  the\r\n\nstation.  \r\n\n          Sergeant Orta,2 the supervisor, arrived, and Flores\r\n\ntold  him that Soto was \"the lady with the Law 54 complaint.\"\r\n\nWhen  the  patrol officers,  Carrasquillo  and  Jose Serrano,\r\n\narrived, Flores  said, \"This is  Rafi's wife,\" and  told them\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  district  court  denied  a  belated  motion  to  add\r\nSergeant  Orta as a defendant.   No appeal  is taken from the\r\ndenial of that motion.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthat she was there on a Law 54 complaint.   Carrasquillo took\r\n\nSoto into an interview  room, three steps away from  the desk\r\n\nat which Flores sat.  Soto  was nervous and crying.  The door\r\n\nto the  interview room remained open, and  Flores listened to\r\n\neverything  that  was  said   in  Soto's  conversation   with\r\n\nCarrasquillo.\r\n\n          In the interview room, Soto told Carrasquillo about\r\n\nRodriguez's   behavior,   and   showed   him   her   bruises.\r\n\nCarrasquillo asked Soto whether she wanted  Rodriguez jailed.\r\n\nSoto  replied by  explaining her  situation to  the officers.\r\n\nSpecifically, she told  Carrasquillo that Rodriguez  had told\r\n\nher that  if she put  him in jail,  he would get  out quickly\r\n\nbecause his family had money and that he would then kill her.\r\n\nShe told Carrasquillo that Rodriguez had told her that if she\r\n\nattempted to put  him in jail,  he would kill her  mother and\r\n\nsisters so  that she would go  to the wake and  he would then\r\n\nkill her there.\r\n\n          Having told  the police officers  about Rodriguez's\r\n\nthreats,  Soto  asked  them   to  do  what  was  appropriate.\r\n\nAlthough  Soto  did  not  use the  words  \"domestic  violence\r\n\ncomplaint,\" she believed that  by describing her situation to\r\n\nthe  officers  she  was  initiating  the  complaint  process.\r\n\nCarrasquillo  wrote  down  everything  she  said  during  the\r\n\ninterview, and Soto assumed that he was drafting  a complaint\r\n\nagainst Rodriguez.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Soto's effort to get  police assistance came a year\r\n\nand a half after a new law aimed at curbing domestic violence\r\n\nhad gone into  effect.   In November 1989,  the Puerto  Rican\r\n\nlegislature  enacted one  of the nation's  most comprehensive\r\n\ndomestic  violence laws,  the Domestic  Abuse  Prevention and\r\n\nIntervention  Act, known popularly as \"Law  54.\"  In addition\r\n\nto defining criminal domestic  violence broadly, Law 54 makes\r\n\narrest of an abuser mandatory whenever an officer has grounds\r\n\nto  believe that Law  54 has been  violated.   P.R. Laws Ann.\r\n\ntit.  8,    631-635, 638  (Supp. 1995).   Police officers are\r\n\nrequired  to take all  steps necessary to  prevent abuse from\r\n\nrecurring,   including   providing   the   complainant   with\r\n\ninformation  about  social  services and,  if  she  expresses\r\n\nconcern for her safety, with  transportation to a safe place.\r\n\nId.   640.  Law 54  also requires that police officers file a\r               \r\n\nwritten report on all domestic violence incidents, whether or\r\n\nnot  any charges  are ever  filed.   Id.    641.   The police\r                                                    \r\n\nsuperintendent  is   charged  with  establishing   \"norms  to\r\n\nguarantee confidentiality with regard  to the identity of the\r\n\npersons  involved in  incidents of  domestic violence.\"   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nImplementing  regulations  issued  by the  superintendent  of\r\n\npolice  detail the  officer's responsibilities,  and instruct\r\n\nthat  arrest  determinations  are   not  to  be  affected  by\r\n\nirrelevant factors, including victim  reluctance.   Rules and\r\n\nProcedures to Attend  to Domestic Violence  Incidents, Puerto\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nRico  Police  General  Order  No.  86-26m   (Rev.  1).    The\r\n\nregulations   explicitly  state   that  police   attempts  at\r\n\nmediation or reconciliation shall not substitute for  arrest.\r\n\nId.  at 4.   The regulations  require that  domestic violence\r               \r\n\nreports  be kept  confidential, in  separate files,  and that\r\n\ncopies only be issued upon a court order.   Id. at 19.  These\r                                                           \r\n\nregulations explicitly recognize that:\r\n\n          Domestic  violence . .  . frequently ends\r\n          in intra-family homicide  and it  affects\r\n          all   the   components  of   the  family,\r\n          including the children.\r\n\nId. at 1.\r               \r\n\n           Despite this legal framework, at the conclusion of\r\n\nhis  interview  with  Soto,  Carrasquillo  took   no  action.\r\n\nCarrasquillo  did not  tell  Soto about  the availability  of\r\n\nbattered women's shelters  or about procedures  for obtaining\r\n\nan  order of  protection.   Nor  did  he prepare  a  domestic\r\n\nviolence report.   Instead,  Carrasquillo wrote up  an \"Other\r\n\nServices  Report,\"  which  falsely indicated  that  Soto  had\r\n\nvisited  the  police  solely  for advice  relating  to  child\r\n\ncustody.3  Soto returned to Vega's house. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Soto contends that she  signed a domestic violence report\r\nat  the station that night and that the Other Services Report\r\nproduced  by the  defense is  an after-the-fact  forgery, and\r\npart  of  a cover-up,  which included  pressure on  Flores to\r\ncommit perjury.   Her claim  of forgery is  supported by  the\r\ntestimony  of a  handwriting  expert, and  Flores's testimony\r\nsuggests that pressure was put on him.      \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          Carrasquillo  discussed  Soto's complaint  with his\r\n\nsupervisor, Sergeant Orta, that  evening.  When Sergeant Orta\r\n\nsigned  the   Other  Services   Report  he  did   so  despite\r\n\ninformation that this was a Law 54 situation and that the men\r\n\nunder his supervision  were not doing what  the law required.\r\n\nSergeant  Orta discussed  the  \"Other  Services\" report  with\r\n\nFlores.4     Flores  told him  that  Rodriguez and  Soto  had\r\n\nmarital problems because Rodriguez  was an alcoholic.  Flores\r\n\nsaid he would talk to Rodriguez the next day. \r\n\n          Sometime the  next day, April  18, Officer  Flores,\r\n\ndespite knowing  of Rodriguez's  threats to commit  murder if\r\n\nSoto went to the police in an effort to jail him, went to the\r\n\nRodriguez-Soto home and told  Rodriguez about Soto's visit to\r\n\nthe police station.  That  night, Rodriguez arrived at Vega's\r\n\nhome, very upset.   He  told Vega and  Glorivee Soto,  Soto's\r\n\nsister,  that \"the boys\" from the police station had told him\r\n\nthat  Soto wanted to  put him in  jail and that  he would not\r\n\nallow that to happen.  Vega managed to calm him and he left.\r\n\n          The next day, Friday,  April 19, Rodriguez ran into\r\n\nthe plaintiff  at  a local  tire  shop.   Rodriguez,  visibly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  A  police department internal  investigation followed the\r\nkillings.  On  August 31, 1992,  the examiner concluded  that\r\nCarrasquillo and Sergeant Orta, the supervisor who signed the\r\nOther  Services  Report  prepared  by  Carrasquillo,  merited\r\nreprimands  for   failing  to  act  pursuant   to  the  norms\r\nestablished by Law 54.   Neither Betancourt-Lebron nor Flores\r\nwas  a subject  of  that investigation,  although Flores  was\r\ninterviewed regarding his knowledge of the events.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nupset, told plaintiff that  Officer Flores had been  to their\r\n\nhome  and had told  him that Soto  was going to  throw him in\r\n\njail.  Soto, fearing violence, denied  it.  She tried to calm\r\n\nRodriguez down, but Rodriguez  kept repeating that Flores had\r\n\ntold him she wanted him jailed. \r\n\n          On  Saturday,  the  twentieth of  April,  Rodriguez\r\n\nagain  came to  Vega's home  and invited  Soto to  the beach.\r\n\nSoto refused to  go, but  the children, excited  at the  rare\r\n\nprospect  of an outing with  their father, got  into the car.\r\n\nRodriguez  did not bring the children back that day as he had\r\n\npromised.  Soto went twice  to try to pick them up,  but both\r\n\ntimes Rodriguez refused to give the children to her.\r\n\n          Finally, at  8:00 p.m.  on April 21,  Soto, mindful\r\n\nthat the next day was  a school day, went back to  the family\r\n\nhome determined to  get the children.   As she  stood on  the\r\n\nlawn, Soto heard  both children tell  Rodriguez that she  had\r\n\narrived.  Sally shouted, \"Run, Mommy, please run!\"  Rodriguez\r\n\nthen shot his  son in the forehead.  Soto  heard Sally say to\r\n\nher  father,  \"Daddy, no,  Daddy, no.\"   Rodriguez  then shot\r\n\nSally through her mouth.  Soto heard a third shot.  Rodriguez\r\n\nhad killed himself.      When    the     police,    including\r\n\nCarrasquillo and  Serrano, arrived, Rodriguez was  dead.  The\r\n\nchildren were still alive  and the police rushed them  to the\r\n\nhospital.  Both children were dead on arrival.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          On the wall  of the room  where Rodriguez shot  his\r\n\nchildren, Rodriguez  had  written a  message which  confirmed\r\n\nthat Flores had told him of  Soto's visit to the police.  The\r\n\nmessage said,  among other things, \"you left  me, and Officer\r\n\nFlores knows it,\" and \"Law 54, which is only a tool for women\r\n\nto make men do whatever they want, is not liberty.\" \r\n\n                    II. Procedural History\r\n\n          Soto's initial section 1983 complaint  alleged that\r\n\nthe  acts and omissions of Officer Flores deprived her of her\r\n\nrights  to due process and  to equal protection  of the laws.\r\n\nAdditionally,  she  alleged  that Superintendent  Betancourt-\r\n\nLebron  was liable  for  his failure  to  properly train  and\r\n\nsupervise his subordinate officers.\r\n\n          After discovery, Flores and Betancourt-Lebron moved\r\n\nto dismiss,  and, in  the alternative, for  summary judgment.\r\n\nIn  addition to arguing that  Soto's claims lacked merit, the\r\n\ndefendants   asserted  that   they   were  entitled   to  the\r\n\nprotections  of  qualified immunity.    In  an opinion  dated\r\n\nJanuary 20, 1995, the  district court granted the  motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment.   As to  the due process  claim, the  court\r\n\nheld that, because an individual may not bring a section 1983\r\n\naction  for deprivation of due  process based on  injury to a\r\n\nfamily member, the death of Soto's children did not give rise\r\n\nto  a cognizable claim.   Soto v. Carrasquillo,  878 F. Supp.\r                                                          \r\n\n324, 327 (D.P.R. 1996)(citing Valdivieso-Ortiz v. Burgos, 807\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nF.2d 6,  7-10 (1st Cir.  1986)).  As to  the equal protection\r\n\nclaim, the court held  that Soto had failed to  adduce enough\r\n\nevidence  on discriminatory  intent  and causation  to defeat\r\n\nsummary judgment. Soto, 878 F. Supp. at 331-32.\r                                  \r\n\n          Soto  requested  reconsideration;  as  part  of her\r\n\nmotion, she asked for  leave to amend her complaint  to bring\r\n\nthe action as a representative of her children.  The district\r\n\ncourt  treated the  complaint as  amended, but  dismissed the\r\n\nclaim  on behalf  of  the  children,  holding  it  barred  by\r\n\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County, 489 U.S. 189 (1989).  The court\r                                        \r\n\naccordingly denied Soto's  motion for reconsideration.   Soto\r\n\nappeals.\r\n\n                 III. The Section 1983 Claims\r\n\n          Soto  presses  two  distinct claims.    First,  she\r\n\nalleges  that the  defendants' actions  violated her  and her\r\n\nchildren's rights to  due process.  Second, Soto asserts that\r\n\nthe defendants  had  a custom  or  policy of  providing  less\r\n\nprotection to victims of domestic violence than to victims of\r\n\nother  assaults,   that  this   was  the  result   of  gender\r\n\ndiscrimination,  that  this  caused her  injuries,  and  that\r\n\ndefendants thus violated  her right to equal  protection.  We\r\n\nconsider each of these claims in turn. \r\n\n          A  claim  under  section  1983  has  two  essential\r\n\nelements.  First, the challenged conduct must be attributable\r\n\nto a person acting under color of state law (including Puerto\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nRico law); second, the  conduct must have worked a  denial of\r\n\nrights  secured  by  the  Constitution  or  by  federal  law.\r\n\nMartinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 984 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n116  S.  Ct. 515  (1995).   The  second element  requires the\r\n\nplaintiff to prove  not only a deprivation  of federal right,\r\n\nbut also that the defendant's conduct was  a cause in fact of\r\n\nthe   alleged   deprivation.     See   Maldonado-Santiago  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nVelazquez-Garcia, 821 F.2d 822, 831  (1st Cir. 1987)(\"Section\r                            \r\n\n1983  imposes  a causation  requirement  similar  to that  of\r\n\nordinary tort law.\").  \r\n\nA. The Due Process Claim\r                                    \r\n\n          Soto  claims that  the deaths  of her  children are\r\n\nattributable  to  the  defendants' actions,  and  that  those\r\n\nactions  deprived both her and her children of what she terms\r\n\na  \"substantive  due process  life  interest.\"5   We  examine\r\n\nseparately Soto's individual claim and her claim on behalf of\r\n\nher children.\r\n\n          1.   Soto's Individual Claim.\r                                                   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Some victims  of abuse  have brought section  1983 claims\r\nalleging   that  official   nonfeasance   deprived  them   of\r\nprocedural due  process.   See, e.g., Meador  v. Cabinet  for\r                                                                         \r\nHuman  Resources,  902 F.2d  474,  476-77  (6th Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\ndenied, 448 U.S. 867 (1990);  Coffman v. Wilson Police Dep't,\r                                                                        \r\n739 F. Supp. 257,  263-66 (E.D. Pa.  1990).  In these  cases,\r\nthe plaintiffs argued that  state law made certain protective\r\nprocesses mandatory, and thus created entitlements subject to\r\ndue  process  protection  against  deprivation.    See,  e.g,\r                                                                         \r\nCoffman, 739 F. Supp at 263-64.  However, from our reading of\r                   \r\nthe record, Soto  does not  appear to make  a procedural  due\r\nprocess   claim.    Thus,  we  do  not  address  whether  the\r\nprotective provisions of Law 54 create such an entitlement.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          The  district  court   held  that   Soto,  in   her\r\n\nindividual  capacity, could  not  bring a  due process  claim\r\n\nbased on injury to her children.   Soto, 878 F. Supp. at 327.\r                                                   \r\n\nOn  appeal, Soto argues both that the district court erred in\r\n\nso  holding and  that  the injury  she  complains of  is  not\r\n\nlimited to the loss of the companionship of her children, but\r\n\nalso  comprehends   the  mental  anguish  she   has  suffered\r\n\npersonally.\r\n\n          We review  the  district court's  grant of  summary\r\n\njudgment de novo.  Dominique v. Weld, 73 F.3d 1156, 1158 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1996).  We examine, viewing the record in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving  party, whether the district court\r\n\ncorrectly  applied  the  substantive   law  and  whether  any\r\n\ndisputed facts  have the potential  to change the  outcome of\r\n\nthe suit.   See Martinez v.  Colon, 54 F.3d 980,  983-84 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir. 1995).\r\n\n          There is no absolute constitutional right to  enjoy\r\n\nthe  companionship  of one's  family  members  free from  all\r\n\nencroachments by the state.   See Valdivieso-Ortiz v. Burgos,\r                                                                        \r\n\n807  F.2d 6, 8  (1st Cir. 1986).   \"State action that affects\r\n\nthe parental relationship only incidentally . . . even though\r\n\nthe deprivation may  be permanent . . . is  not sufficient to\r\n\nestablish a  violation  of a  identified  liberty  interest.\"\r\n\nPittsley v. Warish, 927  F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n502 U.S. 879 (1991).  Thus, the death of a family member will\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nnot  ordinarily  give  those  still alive  a  cognizable  due\r\n\nprocess  claim   under   section 1983.     See  Manarite   v.\r                                                                    \r\n\nSpringfield, 957 F.2d 953, 960 (1st Cir.)(child could not sue\r                       \r\n\npolice  for  failure  to  prevent  father's  suicide),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 506 U.S. 837 (1992); Valdivieso-Ortiz, 807 F.2d at 10\r                                                         \r\n\n(stepfather and siblings had no cause of action  where prison\r\n\nguards beat inmate to death).  Here, the defendants' actions,\r\n\ndespite the  tragic outcome,  were not specifically  aimed at\r\n\nending  or affecting Soto's  relationship with  her children.\r\n\nNor can Soto successfully distinguish her case from the cited\r\n\nprecedents  of  this court  by  pointing  to  her own  mental\r\n\nanguish.   The question is not  one of a degree of suffering,\r\n\nbut  whether  the  plaintiff  can establish  a  violation  of\r\n\nfederal  right.     While   Soto's  loss  was   of  enormous,\r\n\nheartbreaking  magnitude, the  Constitution does  not protect\r\n\nagainst  all  harms.   She  herself  was  not  deprived of  a\r\n\nconstitutionally protected interest, and  she may not bring a\r\n\nsection 1983 due process claim on her own behalf.\r\n\n          2.    Soto's  Claim  as  a  Representative  of  Her\r                                                                         \r\n\n          Children.\r                              \r\n\n          In deciding Soto's  motion for reconsideration, the\r\n\ndistrict court granted Soto's  request to amend her complaint\r\n\nso  as to bring a claim  as a representative of her children.\r\n\nThe court then found that the children's claim was foreclosed\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nby DeShaney, dismissed  the claim and  denied the motion  for\r                       \r\n\nreconsideration of the due process claim. \r\n\n          Review of denial of a motion for reconsideration is\r\n\nfor  abuse  of  discretion.    See  Airline  Pilots  Ass'n v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nPrecision Valley Aviation,  Inc., 26 F.3d 220,  227 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1994).   For  purposes  of this  appeal,  we consider  Soto's\r\n\ncomplaint,  as amended,  to determine  if the  district court\r\n\ncommitted   legal  error   in   holding  that   Soto,  as   a\r\n\nrepresentative of  her children, failed to state a claim upon\r\n\nwhich  relief could  be  granted.

We\r\n\nagree that if Soto's argument were simply that Flores and his\r\n\nbrother  officers  failed   to  protect  her  children   from\r\n\nRodriguez,  it  would clearly  fail.

She  claims,  and her  claim  has support  in  the\r\n\nrecord,  that Officer  Flores visited  Rodriguez at  home and\r\n\ntold him that Soto had been to the police station and  wished\r\n\nto jail  him.  She further alleges that when he did so Flores\r\n\nwas fully aware of  how Rodriguez would likely react  to this\r\n\ninformation,  not  only   because  Flores  knew   Rodriguez's\r\n\ncharacter well,  but also because Flores  knew that Rodriguez\r\n\nhad  threatened to murder her  and her family  members if she\r\n\nwent to  the police and attempted to stop his abuse by having\r\n\nhim  jailed.   Soto alleges  that Flores  misused information\r\n\nthat he had obtained  in an official capacity, and  that this\r\n\naffirmative act rendered her  children more vulnerable to the\r\n\ndanger posed by Rodriguez and thus led to their deaths.  \r\n\n          Soto  alleges that Flores's conduct violated a duty\r\n\nof   constitutional  dimension   owed  to   Soto's  children.\r\n\nDeShaney clearly establishes  that the state does not  have a\r                    \r\n\nconstitutional  duty to  protect  its  citizens from  private\r\n\nviolence.

In a creation\r                      \r\n\nof risk situation,  where the  ultimate harm is  caused by  a\r\n\nthird party,  courts must  be careful to  distinguish between\r\n\nconventional torts and constitutional violations, as well  as\r\n\nbetween  state inaction and action.  See id.; Pinder, 54 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 1175-78.  \r\n\n          The scope  of any  permissible section  1983 action\r\n\nbased  on  a  state-created  danger  theory  is  a  difficult\r\n\nquestion. See,  e.g., Pinder, 54  F.3d at 1175;  Monahan, 961\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at  993-94.   Because we  find that  this  claim may  be\r\n\nresolved  on immunity grounds,  we choose  not to  reach this\r\n\nquestion. \r\n\n          3. Qualified Immunity.\r                                            \r\n\n          Assuming arguendo that Soto had stated a claim that\r\n\nFlores   and   Betancourt-Lebron   violated  her   children's\r\n\nconstitutional   rights,  the   issue  becomes   whether  the\r\n\ndefendants are entitled, as they argue, to qualified immunity\r\n\nfrom suit.    There  are  two prongs  to  qualified  immunity\r\n\nanalysis.   See St. Hilaire  v.  Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nCir. 1995).  First, the court must determine, as  a matter of\r\n\nlaw, whether the constitutional right in question was clearly\r\n\nestablished at  the time of the  alleged violation.  Id.   If\r                                                                    \r\n\nthe  right is  clearly established, the  court must  then ask\r\n\nwhether a  reasonable similarly situated officer \"should have\r\n\nunderstood that the challenged  conduct violated\" that right.\r\n\nId. \r               \r\n\n          To  begin,  Soto's   arguments  against   qualified\r\n\nimmunity appear  to misconstrue  the doctrine.   Soto argues,\r\n\nwith evidentiary  support, that  not only did  the defendants\r\n\nviolate Law 54  and the pertinent regulations, but  also that\r\n\nthey  knew or  reasonably should  have known  that they  were\r\n\nviolating it.  According to Soto, \"[n]o good faith defense is\r\n\npossible if  the official  knew he was  violating plaintiff's\r\n\nrights.\"\r\n\n          The  Supreme  Court has  considered,  and rejected,\r\n\nthis approach to qualified immunity.   Davis v. Scherer,  468\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 183, 193-95 (1984).  In Davis, the plaintiff argued that\r                                              \r\n\nofficial  conduct that  contravened a  statute  or regulation\r\n\ncould  not be  objectively reasonable  because officials  may\r\n\nreasonably  be expected  to  conform their  conduct to  legal\r\n\nnorms.  Id. at 193.  The Court rejected this approach because\r                       \r\n\nit would \"disrupt the balance . . . between  the interests in\r\n\nvindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in  public\r\n\nofficials' effective  performance of  their duties.\"   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\n195.   \"Officials sued  for constitutional violations  do not\r\n\nlose  their qualified immunity  merely because  their conduct\r\n\nviolates some statutory or administrative provision.\" Id.  at\r                                                                     \r\n\n194; see also  Borucki v. Ryan,  827 F.2d 836, 847  n.18 (1st\r                                          \r\n\nCir. 1987).  Accordingly, Soto's arguments with regard to Law\r\n\n54, even if  her alleged facts are  true, do not resolve  the\r\n\nqualified immunity question.  The focus is rather  on whether\r\n\nthere is clearly settled  law on the constitutional violation\r\n\nat issue.      This  inquiry is  sharpened  by two  narrowing\r\n\nprinciples.    The  right  must  be  stated  with  sufficient\r\n\nparticularity so that a \"'reasonable officer would understand\r\n\nthat what he  is doing  violates that right'\"  and the  right\r\n\nmust  have been  \"clearly  established  at  the time  of  the\r\n\ndefendants' alleged  improper actions, and  . .  . not .  . .\r\n\nthrough the  use of hindsight.\"  Souza  v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423,\r                                                           \r\n\n425 (1st Cir.  1995) (quoting Anderson v.

The  issue   is  thus   whether  the\r\n\nconstitutional duty  not to affirmatively  abuse governmental\r\n\npower so as to  create danger to individuals and  render them\r\n\nmore  vulnerable to  harm  was clearly  established in  April\r\n\n1991, the time of the events giving rise to this suit.\r\n\n          What the Third  Circuit termed the  \"'state-created\r\n\ndanger theory,'\"  Kneipp v.

Since DeShaney, seven circuit courts of appeals\r                                        \r\n\nhave  recognized  that state-created  dangers may,  in proper\r\n\ncircumstances,  give  rise  to  constitutional  claims  under\r\n\nsection 1983.

The first case from this\r\n\ncourt to  discuss the contours  of that doctrine  was Monahan\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Of course, a  violation of\r\n\nclearly settled law may be found even where the Supreme Court\r\n\nand the  circuit in question have  not specifically addressed\r\n\nthe question.  See 2 Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties\r                                                                         \r\n\nLitigation:  The Law of Section  1983,   8.07,  at 134-35 (3d\r                                                 \r\n\ned. 1991) (citing cases). \r\n\n          However,  we cannot  extract a  clearly established\r\n\nright from a somewhat confusing  body of caselaw through  the\r\n\nuse of  hindsight, or \"permit claims of qualified immunity to\r\n\nturn  on  the  eventual  outcome of  a  hitherto  problematic\r\n\nconstitutional  analysis.\"    Martinez-Rodriguez   v.

The  distinction   between  affirmatively\r\n\nrendering citizens more vulnerable to harm and simply failing\r\n\nto protect  them  has been  blurred.   Moreover, courts  have\r\n\nsometimes  found that  a  given action,  while rendering  the\r\n\nplaintiff  more  vulnerable to  danger, did  not amount  to a\r\n\nconstitutional violation,  but instead should be  viewed as a\r\n\nstate law tort.   See, e.g., Cannon v. Taylor,  782 F.2d 947,\r                                                         \r\n\n950  (11th Cir. 1986).   It is more  recent judicial opinions\r\n\nthat have  begun to  clarify the  contours of  this doctrine.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Kneipp,  95 F.3d  at 1208-10; Pinder,  54 F.3d  at\r                                                           \r\n\n1174-1177.\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n          We conclude therefore that, in  1991, \"the contours\r\n\nof  the right were [not] sufficiently plain that a reasonably\r\n\nprudent state actor  would have realized not  merely that his\r\n\nconduct  might be  wrong, but that  it violated  a particular\r\n\nconstitutional right.\"  Martinez-Rodriguez,  53 F.3d at  988.\r                                                      \r\n\nAccordingly, we find that the defendants are entitled  to the\r\n\nprotections of  qualified immunity,  and affirm  the district\r\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment  on plaintiff's substantive\r\n\ndue process claim.\r\n\nB.

Soto has adduced evidence sufficient to create\r\n\nan  issue as  to  whether there  was  a custom  or policy  of\r\n\nproviding  less  protection  to  domestic  violence  victims.\r\n\nCloser questions are whether Soto adduces evidence sufficient\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nto permit the drawing of the necessary inference of an intent\r                                                                         \r\n\nto  discriminate  against  women  and  whether Soto  provides\r\n\nsufficient  evidence that  her  injuries were  caused by  the\r                                                                 \r\n\nalleged custom or policy. \r\n\n          Soto's argument may be  summarized as follows:  (1)\r\n\nthat the Preamble to Law 54 explicitly recognizes that \"women\r\n\nare usually the victims of . . . conjugal abuse\" and that Law\r\n\n54  expresses  a  legislative  intent to  protect  women  and\r\n\nchildren from  domestic violence;9 (2) that,  although 95% of\r\n\ndomestic violence  complaints involve females  as victims and\r\n\nmales  as perpetrators, one out of every four persons in jail\r\n\nin Puerto  Rico for domestic  violence is female;10  (3) that\r\n\nstatements  of  the individual  in  charge of  the  police in\r\n\nPuerto Rico, Betancourt-Lebron, demonstrate  both that Law 54\r\n\nis not enforced as  are other laws and that  his disagreement\r\n\nwith the law, which may reasonably be understood to be gender\r\n\nmotivated,   has  led   to  non-enforcement   by  subordinate\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.

While  Soto admits  that  she presented  no evidence  of\r\narrest  rates  for  men  charged with  domestic  violence  as\r\ncompared  to arrest  rates  for women  charged with  domestic\r\nviolence, she  asserts that such  comparisons are  impossible\r\nbecause Puerto Rico has chosen not to gather this data. \r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nofficers; (4) that there  was no police training  on domestic\r\n\nviolence prior to the events at issue; (5) that statements by\r\n\nSergeant   Orta,  and   Officers   Flores  and   Carrasquillo\r\n\nacknowledge that  police officers in the  Rio Grande precinct\r\n\nin  1991 did  not  enforce Law  54;  (6) that  statements  by\r\n\nindividual officers demonstrate gender bias and stereotyping,\r\n\nindicating that  the Law was not  enforced for discriminatory\r\n\nreasons; (7) that the non-discriminatory  reasons offered for\r\n\nthe  non-enforcement are  pretextual;  (8) that  differential\r\n\nenforcement of Law  54 therefore permits  an inference of  an\r\n\nintent to discriminate; and (9) that her injuries were caused\r\n\nby the non-enforcement of the domestic violence law. \r\n\n          Defendants argue that no intent to discriminate can\r\n\nbe inferred  from mere  non-enforcement of  a law.

As  the Third  Circuit has recognized  in the  Title VII\r\ncontext, it is rare that discrimination wears its garb openly\r\nand it more often comes \"masked  in subtle forms.\"  Triers of\r\nfact  may recognize those more subtle forms for what they are\r\nand coded  comments may  raise inferences  of discrimination.\r\nAman v.

It is  in  this light  that we\r\n\nevaluate Soto's equal protection claim. \r\n\n          This is not the usual case in which plaintiffs seek\r\n\nto  prove  discriminatory  intent   from  the  mere  fact  of\r\n\ndifferential  impact.  Nor is this the more common case where\r\n\na  plaintiff in a civil rights action seeks to use the courts\r\n\nto upset the  majoritarian preferences expressed  through the\r\n\nlegislative  process.    Rather,  plaintiff  here  seeks  the\r\n\nbenefit  of  the  protection afforded  by  that  majoritarian\r\n\nlegislative process and argues that  she has been deprived of\r\n\nthat protection by the actions of individual public officials\r\n\nmotivated by a contrary, gender-discriminatory intent.\r\n\n          The  statutory   language  of  Law   54,  and   the\r\n\nlegislative  intent  evident  from  its  preamble,  serve  to\r\n\ndifferentiate  this case  from the  typical  disparate impact\r\n\ncase. The Law's prefatory \"Statement of Motives\" states that:\r\n\n          Although  men as  well  as  women may  be\r\n          victims of conjugal  abuse, studies  show\r\n          that women are usually the victims of the\r\n          aggressive  and  violent conduct  that we\r\n          call   conjugal   abuse.   .   .   .

Here, the  Statement  of\r                          \r\n\nMotives of  Law 54  contains an explicit  legislative finding\r\n\nthat  domestic violence has a greater impact on women and the\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nLaw  expresses  an intent  to ameliorate  that impact.   This\r\n\nlegislative finding is evidence that underenforcement  of Law\r\n\n54  would indeed  have a  greater impact  on women  and might\r\n\ntherefore be motivated by gender discrimination.\r\n\n          Moreover, the express legislative desire  to assist\r\n\nwomen  victims of  domestic violence  and recognition  of the\r\n\nproblem of discrimination within responsible institutions are\r\n\nimportant  factors to be considered in the \"give and take\" of\r\n\nthe   situation.

With  Law 54,  the legislature  of Puerto\r\n\nRico has expressed, through the democratic process, an intent\r\n\nto protect the female  victims of domestic violence and   has\r                                                                   \r\n\nnoted that enforcement agencies have been discriminatory  and\r\n\npart of the  problem.   Thus, underenforcement of  Law 54  by\r\n\nthose charged with  administering the  law may in  fact be  a\r\n\nsubversion   of   majoritarian   processes  for   individual,\r\n\nillegitimate  motives.   We  believe, in  this context,  that\r\n\naction by officials leading to non-enforcement of Law  54 may\r\n\nbe  some   evidence   of  discriminatory   intent  by   those\r                    \r\n\nindividuals.  The policy Soto  challenges is, of course,  not\r\n\nLaw 54, but the  decision not to  implement the Law when  she\r\n\nsought its  protections.   In determining what,  if anything,\r\n\nmotivated  that decision,  the  factfinder  may consider  the\r\n\npurposes of  the Law itself, and  draw appropriate inferences\r\n\nabout what might motivate a decision not to effectuate  those\r\n\npurposes.   As the Law  expressly seeks to  aid women victims\r\n\nand  eradicate  institutional  discriminatory   attitudes,  a\r\n\ndecision  not  to  implement  the  Law  may  well  have  been\r\n\n                             -34-\r                                          34\r\r\n\nmotivated not \"in spite  of,\" but \"because of\"  the resulting\r\n\nimpact on women.  We  review the record to see  whether there\r\n\nissufficient evidence of intentas to eachof named defendants.\r                        \r\n\n          1. The Rio Grande Precinct\r                                                \r\n\n          In reviewing whether the  failure to enforce Law 54\r\n\nwas motivated by discriminatory intent, we look first  to the\r\n\nactions of the officers in the Rio Grande precinct.  The  key\r\n\nactor at the precinct level was Sergeant Orta.  Orta was told\r\n\nSoto  was making a  Law 54 complaint, yet  he signed an Other\r\n\nServices Report in violation  of Law 54 and took  no steps to\r\n\nhave Rodriguez arrested.  Nor did he take any steps to remove\r\n\nSoto  and her children from harm's  way.  He knew that Flores\r\n\nwas  going to talk to Rodriguez and  did not try to stop him.\r\n\nHe thus ratified and condoned  the officers' disregard of Law\r\n\n54. \r\n\n          Orta's  statements, as  described below,  suggest a\r\n\ndiscriminatory attitude towards women; this attitude may have\r\n\nbeen one of the reasons behind the lack of enforcement of Law\r\n\n54  at  the Palmer  substation  of the  Rio  Grande precinct.\r\n\nSergeant Orta  made statements  which a trier  of fact  could\r\n\neasily  find  reveal  gender-discriminatory  stereotypes  and\r\n\nbiases.  He testified as follows:\r\n\n          Q: What is your opinion of Act 54?\r\n\n          A: I told you the first time, and I remit\r\n          myself to the record,  that I am in total\r\n          disagreement  with that  Act.   I believe\r\n          that  it   is  very  unjust   related  to\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\n          aggressions  against women  and I  do not\r\n          agree with that.\r\n\n          Q: Why  do you believe it  is very unjust\r\n          with  relation   to  aggressions  against\r\n          women?\r\n\n          A:  Sometimes  men,  including myself  of\r\n          course,  but sometimes one  drinks on the\r\n          outside or has a  woman on the side  or a\r\n          friend  on  the  side,  and  one  has  an\r\n          argument with one's lady friend  and goes\r\n          home and takes it out on the wife.  And I\r\n          believe that is not just.\r\n\n                         . . .\r\n\n          Q: Then  I ask  you, again, what  is your\r\n          opinion with relation to the law?\r\n\n          A: Well,  the thing  is that the  law, in\r\n          spite  of it  mentioning both  parties as\r\n          being  able  to  complain, the  woman  is\r\n          always   the   person  who   is  injured.\r\n          Credibility  is given to the woman, where\r\n          there  are  occasions  when that  doesn't\r\n          happen that way. \r\n\n          The weight to be  given to Sergeant Orta's comments\r\n\ndepends upon many factors.   See National Amusements, 43 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 743 (ambiguous comments standing alone are insufficient to\r\n\nraise an  inference of racial  animus).

Officer  Flores  testified that  almost\r\n\neveryone in  his police detachment  \"shied away from\"  Law 54\r\n\ncomplaints.   Asked  what  happened to  the victims  when the\r\n\nofficers did  not want to take  complaints, Flores responded,\r\n\n\"Well, they  had to continue complaining.\"   Flores testified\r\n\nthat proper Law 54 procedures were followed only about 75% of\r\n\nthe  time, and then just by certain officers.  Sergeant Orta,\r\n\nFlores's  direct  supervisor, stated  that,  despite Law  54,\r\n\ndomestic violence  complaints were not given great importance\r\n\nin  1991 and were commonly  handled in the  station as \"Other\r\n\nServices\" reports.  There would  certainly be enough facts to\r\n\nraise a reasonable inference that the failure to  enforce Law\r\n\n54 at the precinct level was based on gender discrimination.\r\n\n          That, however,  does not answer the  question as to\r\n\nwhether Officer  Flores, who is the defendant here, acted out\r\n\nof   gender-based   discriminatory  intent   in   talking  to\r\n\nRodriguez.   It was  not within Flores's  responsibilities to\r\n\ntake Soto's complaint  or to  arrest Rodriguez.   We find  no\r\n\nevidence to  suggest that  Flores's motivation in  talking to\r\n\nRodriguez was  based on gender  discrimination.  There  is no\r\n\nevidence that  Flores himself attempted  to avoid enforcement\r\n\nof  Law  54 at  all,  much less  for  discriminatory reasons.\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nFlores, despite  the lack of official  training, undertook to\r\n\nget some  training for himself.  When Soto came to the Palmer\r\n\nsubstation, Flores  called in the two  patrol officers, whose\r\n\nresponsibility  it was to take  the complaint and  act on it.\r\n\nFlores described  Soto's complaint as  a Law 54  complaint to\r\n\nthe patrol officers, as he did to Sergeant Orta.  There is no\r\n\nevidence  that  Flores  intervened and  talked  to  Rodriguez\r\n\nbecause  of  a  gender-discriminatory  motive;   rather,  the\r\n\nrelationship between the two  men provides a strong inference\r\n\nthat Flores believed his friendship could  provide a basis to\r\n\nresolve the  matter.  Sadly, he was wrong.  That he was wrong\r\n\ndoes  not  turn  his  action into  one  motivated  by  gender\r\n\ndiscrimination.  \r\n\n          2. Police Superintendent Betancourt-Lebron\r                                                                \r\n\n          Plaintiff   asserts  that   Betancourt-Lebron,  the\r\n\nsuperintendant of police for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\r\n\nshould  be  held responsible  because  he  failed to  provide\r\n\nadequate  training,  and  because  that failure  was  due  to\r\n\ngender- discriminatory  bias.14  This claim  is based largely\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  We will assume  arguendo, but do not decide,  that there\r\nwas  evidence of a causal  link between lack  of training and\r\nthe events at  the precinct.   The street  level officers  --\r\nFlores and Carrasquillo -- both  testified that they had  not\r\nreceived formal training on Law 54, and were not even given a\r\ncopy of the law.  Both officers were left with understandings\r\nof the law that were flatly wrong.  Both erroneously believed\r\nthat the victim had  to specifically request a Law  54 order,\r\nand that  the victim had to  sign a closed report  if she did\r\nnot wish to  proceed to  get a restraining  order.   Sergeant\r\nOrta  also testified  that he  did not  receive comprehensive\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\non Betancourt-Lebron's public statements.   For example, when\r\n\nLaw 54  had  been in  effect  for eight  months,  Betancourt-\r\n\nLebron, was quoted in the press as saying:\r\n\n          I  don't believe that [Law 54] is solving\r\n          anything because it  has not lessened the\r\n          fights  between husbands  and wives.   On\r\n          the contrary, there  is evidence that  it\r\n          continues to increase. \r\n\nHe  went on  to  say that  domestic  violence should  not  be\r\n\ntreated  with  laws  that  punish the  aggressors,  but  with\r\n\npsychologists   and  social  workers.     This  statement  of\r\n\ndisagreement  with the  law's  decision to  criminalize  such\r\n\nconduct  is not,  in  itself, a  statement of  discriminatory\r\n\nintent.    Plaintiff posits  that  the  statement in  context\r\n\nshould be read as discriminatory.\r\n\n          Soto's expert witness,  Mercedes Rodriguez,  opined\r\n\nthat, because  one of the  most dramatic changes  achieved by\r\n\nLaw  54 was  the criminalization  of domestic  violence, this\r\n\nstatement by  Betancourt-Lebron was  \"one of the  most severe\r\n\nblows, that a public official of [his] stature\" could give to\r\n\nthe law.  Rodriguez  called these statements \"a  deviation on\r\n\nthe  part  of the  institutional leadership.\"     It  was the\r\n\nposition of the Women's  Affairs Commission that Betancourt's\r\n\npublic  statements  \"would promote  rank and  file's negative\r\n\nattitudes  toward women  victims and  their rights  under Law\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ntraining in Law 54  until 1993, two years after  the incident\r\nat issue here.\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\n54.\"  The  Superintendent's public statements, in  opposition\r\n\nto   a  law  he  was  charged  with  enforcing,  were  widely\r\n\ndisseminated.   It is reasonable  to infer, as  Soto's expert\r\n\nand   the  Women's  Affairs  Commission  suggest,  that  they\r\n\ninfluenced many of the rank and file in the police.  But that\r\n\nthe statements  had influence does  not mean  that they  were\r\n\nmotivated by discrimination.\r\n\n          Additionally,  Betancourt-Lebron acknowledged  that\r\n\nhe   foresaw  that  police   officers  would   have  problems\r\n\nimplementing  Law 54  because  its procedures  differed  from\r\n\nother  laws,  and because  \"of  active  resistance from  some\r\n\nmembers of the Force toward the law.\"  There  is no evidence,\r\n\nhowever, that he was aware of discriminatory attitudes at the\r\n\nRio  Grande precinct,  much less  that, in  the face  of such\r\n\nknowledge, he failed to act to curb those attitudes.   Nor is\r\n\nthere  any comparative evidence as  to what, if any, training\r\n\nBetancourt-Lebron implemented  when other new  laws went into\r\n\neffect.    Evidence  that  Law  54,  which  was  specifically\r\n\nintended to assist abused women, was handled differently than\r\n\nother new  major law enforcement initiatives  could, perhaps,\r\n\nsupport  an  inference of  discriminatory  intent.   But  the\r\n\nrecord is devoid of such evidence.\r\n\n          Somewhat  more   probative  of  Betancourt-Lebron's\r\n\nintent  is   his  relationship  with   the  Women's   Affairs\r\n\nCommission.   Betancourt-Lebron declined to meet,  for a year\r\n\n                             -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\nafter  approval   of  Law   54,  with  the   Women's  Affairs\r\n\nCommission.    Law  54  directs the  Commission  to  evaluate\r\n\nimplementation  of the law and to promote the response of law\r\n\nenforcement  agencies to victims.  See P.R. Laws ann. tit. 8,\r                                                  \r\n\n   651 (Supp. 1995).   The initial report  of the Commission,\r\n\ncovering   the   first   year   of   implementation,   noted:\r\n\n\"Coordination  with  the  Police  of  Puerto  Rico  to  train\r\n\npersonnel  as to domestic  violence problems  and Law  54 has\r\n\nbeen  virtually  impossible.\"    In  fact,  Betancourt-Lebron\r\n\nreturned none of the  numerous phone calls or letters  to him\r\n\nfrom  the  Executive  Director  of the  Commission,  who  was\r\n\nconcerned  about  the  Police Department's  apparent  lack of\r\n\ninterest in implementing the law.\r\n\n          In  the  end,  this  evidence,  while  painting  an\r\n\nunwholesome  picture,  is  not  enough  to  meet  the  strict\r\n\nstandards  imposed   by   the  Supreme   Court  for   showing\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent in equal  protection claims.  As Feeney\r                                                                         \r\n\nsays, the intent to be shown must be more than an  \"awareness\r\n\nof  consequences.\"  Feeney, 442  U.S. at 279.   The defendant\r                                      \r\n\nmust have \"selected . . . a course of action at least in part\r\n\n'because  of' not merely 'in spite of' its adverse effects on\r\n\nan identifiable  group.\"  Id.  An  expression of disagreement\r                                         \r\n\nwith Law  54 and a  failure to meet with  the Women's Affairs\r\n\nCommission, while  some evidence of  discriminatory intent on\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\nthe  part  of Betancourt-Lebron,  is too  slender a  stalk on\r\n\nwhich to rest.\r\n\n          Thus, we  conclude that plaintiff  has fallen short\r\n\nof  her  difficult burden  of  proving discriminatory  intent\r\n\nagainst  these   defendants  as   required  to  establish   a\r\n\nconstitutional  tort.   In  so saying,  we  do not  of course\r\n\ncondone the actions and failures of duties we have described.\r\n\nThe  deaths of children,  which may have  followed from risks\r\n\narguably created by the actions of public officials, are very\r\n\nserious   matters.  Whether   this  deplorable   scenario  is\r\n\nactionable  under Puerto Rican law  we leave, as  we must, to\r\n\nothers.\r\n\n          Accordingly,  the grant of summary judgment against\r\n\nplaintiff is affirmed.\r                                 \r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\n          TORRUELLA,  Chief Judge (concurring).

This tragedy occurred four days after Rodriguez's wife, Flor Maria Soto, complained to the police about the physical and emotional abuse she suffered at Rodriguez's hands.  The police, knowing Rodriguez had threatened to kill Soto and her family if Soto went to the police to have him jailed for his spousal abuse, nonetheless violated their obligations of confidentiality and informed Rodriguez of Soto's complaints.  Having done so, the police did not jail Rodriguez or take steps to protect Soto and her family.  Soto's lawsuit alleges that Rodriguez did what he had threatened to do and that the state created this danger.  Rather than pursue any claims available to her under Puerto Rican law, Soto chose to bring suit in federal court alleging constitutional tort theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, claiming that the actions of the defendants, Carlos Flores, a police officer, and Ismael Betancourt-Lebron, Puerto Rico's superintendent of police, violated her and her children's rights to substantive due process and to equal protection of the laws.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.  We do not reach the difficult question of whether Soto, in her capacity as a representative of her dead children, has presented a due process claim that would survive summary judgment, because we find that the defendant officers are protected by qualified immunity on that claim.  As to the equal protection claim, we adopt a standard for measuring such claims in domestic violence cases.  Testing the evidence against that standard, we find that Soto has not adduced sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to survive summary judgment.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the party opposing summary judgment.  Flor Maria Soto married Angel Rodriguez, nicknamed Rafi, in 1981.  Rodriguez and Soto had two children:  Sally was born in 1983, and Chayanne, a boy, in 1988.  Approximately a year into their marriage, Rodriguez began to abuse Soto emotionally and physically.  This abuse, often connected to Rodriguez's drinking, continued throughout their marriage.  The abuse was apparent to family and friends.  As one neighbor put it, \"anyone who visited them could tell that [Soto] was an abused wife.\"   Despite his constant mistreatment of Soto, Rodriguez never abused the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez did gardening and vehicle repair work for the police officers at Palmer Police Station, a sub-station of the Rio Grande precinct.  Rodriguez was friends with several of the officers from Palmer Station, including Luis Carrasquillo-Morales (\"Carrasquillo\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and defendant Carlos Flores-Moreira (\"Flores\").  Rodriguez visited the station almost daily.  Many of the officers, when on patrol in the area, would visit the Rodriguez-Soto home for coffee or a drink.  Flores and Rodriguez were particularly friendly;  about once a week, during his patrol rounds, Flores would stop by the house for an hour's visit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Wednesday, April 17, 1991, Rodriguez struck Soto about her face and neck, bruising her, and called her insulting names.  When Rodriguez fell drunkenly asleep, Soto gathered the children and went to her mother's house.  Soto's mother, Hipolita Vega, convinced her to go to the police and file a complaint.  In nine years of beatings, some of them worse than the one on April 17, Soto had never sought help because she believed that the police would do nothing, because she had nowhere to go, and because she was afraid of Rodriguez.  Rodriguez had threatened her with a gun on several occasions and told her that he would kill her and other members of her family if she went to the police.  Knowing that Rodriguez was friendly with the police, Soto feared that the police would do nothing except tell Rodriguez that she had complained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that night, despite her fear, Soto went with her mother and her children to the Palmer Police Station.  When she arrived, she was met by Flores, who was the desk officer on duty.  Flores could see that Soto was crying and marked with bruises, \"pretty ugly hematomas.\"   Soto explained that Rodriguez had beaten her.  Flores then radioed for the patrol officers to come in and take her complaint, referring to Soto on the radio as \"Rafi's wife\" and saying that it was a Law 54 case.  During the fifteen to twenty minutes that Soto and Flores waited for the patrol officers to arrive, Flores told Soto that he himself had domestic violence problems, and that his wife wanted him to be put in jail.  He urged Soto to patch things up with Rodriguez.  Soto responded by telling Flores that Rodriguez's beatings were too much to stand and that, as Flores knew, Rodriguez was a heavy drinker, who became violent when drunk.  Soto told Flores about everything that Rodriguez had done and what he would do to her.  Flores offered Soto the opportunity to stay overnight at the station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sergeant Orta,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the supervisor, arrived, and Flores told him that Soto was \"the lady with the Law 54 complaint.\"   When the patrol officers, Carrasquillo and Jose Serrano, arrived, Flores said, \"This is Rafi's wife,\" and told them that she was there on a Law 54 complaint.  Carrasquillo took Soto into an interview room, three steps away from the desk at which Flores sat.  Soto was nervous and crying.  The door to the interview room remained open, and Flores listened to everything that was said in Soto's conversation with Carrasquillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interview room, Soto told Carrasquillo about Rodriguez's behavior, and showed him her bruises.  Carrasquillo asked Soto whether she wanted Rodriguez jailed.  Soto replied by explaining her situation to the officers.  Specifically, she told Carrasquillo that Rodriguez had told her that if she put him in jail, he would get out quickly because his family had money and that he would then kill her.  She told Carrasquillo that Rodriguez had told her that if she attempted to put him in jail, he would kill her mother and sisters so that she would go to the wake and he would then kill her there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having told the police officers about Rodriguez's threats, Soto asked them to do what was appropriate.  Although Soto did not use the words \"domestic violence complaint,\" she believed that by describing her situation to the officers she was initiating the complaint process.  Carrasquillo wrote down everything she said during the interview, and Soto assumed that he was drafting a complaint against Rodriguez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's effort to get police assistance came a year and a half after a new law aimed at curbing domestic violence had gone into effect.  In November 1989, the Puerto Rican legislature enacted one of the nation's most comprehensive domestic violence laws, the Domestic Abuse Prevention and Intervention Act, known popularly as \"Law 54.\"   In addition to defining criminal domestic violence broadly, Law 54 makes arrest of an abuser mandatory whenever an officer has grounds to believe that Law 54 has been violated.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 8, &#167;&#167; 631-635, 638 (Supp.1995).  Police officers are required to take all steps necessary to prevent abuse from recurring, including providing the complainant with information about social services and, if she expresses concern for her safety, with transportation to a safe place.  Id. &#167; 640.  Law 54 also requires that police officers file a written report on all domestic violence incidents, whether or not any charges are ever filed.  Id. &#167; 641.  The police superintendent is charged with establishing \"norms to guarantee confidentiality with regard to the identity of the persons involved in incidents of domestic violence.\"  Id. Implementing regulations issued by the superintendent of police detail the officer's responsibilities, and instruct that arrest determinations are not to be affected by irrelevant factors, including victim reluctance.  Rules and Procedures to Attend to Domestic Violence Incidents, Puerto Rico Police General Order No. 86-26m (Rev.1).  The regulations explicitly state that police attempts at mediation or reconciliation shall not substitute for arrest.  Id. at 4. The regulations require that domestic violence reports be kept confidential, in separate files, and that copies only be issued upon a court order.  Id. at 19.   These regulations explicitly recognize that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Domestic violence ... frequently ends in intra-family homicide and it affects all the components of the family, including the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this legal framework, at the conclusion of his interview with Soto, Carrasquillo took no action.  Carrasquillo did not tell Soto about the availability of battered women's shelters or about procedures for obtaining an order of protection.  Nor did he prepare a domestic violence report.  Instead, Carrasquillo wrote up an \"Other Services Report,\" which falsely indicated that Soto had visited the police solely for advice relating to child custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Soto returned to Vega's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrasquillo discussed Soto's complaint with his supervisor, Sergeant Orta, that evening.  When Sergeant Orta signed the Other Services Report he did so despite information that this was a Law 54 situation and that the men under his supervision were not doing what the law required.  Sergeant Orta discussed the \"Other Services\" report with Flores.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Flores told him that Rodriguez and Soto had marital problems because Rodriguez was an alcoholic.  Flores said he would talk to Rodriguez the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime the next day, April 18, Officer Flores, despite knowing of Rodriguez's threats to commit murder if Soto went to the police in an effort to jail him, went to the Rodriguez-Soto home and told Rodriguez about Soto's visit to the police station.  That night, Rodriguez arrived at Vega's home, very upset.  He told Vega and Glorivee Soto, Soto's sister, that \"the boys\" from the police station had told him that Soto wanted to put him in jail and that he would not allow that to happen.  Vega managed to calm him and he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Friday, April 19, Rodriguez ran into the plaintiff at a local tire shop.  Rodriguez, visibly upset, told plaintiff that Officer Flores had been to their home and had told him that Soto was going to throw him in jail.  Soto, fearing violence, denied it.  She tried to calm Rodriguez down, but Rodriguez kept repeating that Flores had told him she wanted him jailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Saturday, the twentieth of April, Rodriguez again came to Vega's home and invited Soto to the beach.  Soto refused to go, but the children, excited at the rare prospect of an outing with their father, got into the car.  Rodriguez did not bring the children back that day as he had promised.  Soto went twice to try to pick them up, but both times Rodriguez refused to give the children to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, at 8:00 p.m.  on April 21, Soto, mindful that the next day was a school day, went back to the family home determined to get the children.  As she stood on the lawn, Soto heard both children tell Rodriguez that she had arrived.  Sally shouted, \"Run, Mommy, please run!\"   Rodriguez then shot his son in the forehead.  Soto heard Sally say to her father, \"Daddy, no, Daddy, no.\"   Rodriguez then shot Sally through her mouth.  Soto heard a third shot.  Rodriguez had killed himself.  When the police, including Carrasquillo and Serrano, arrived, Rodriguez was dead.  The children were still alive and the police rushed them to the hospital.  Both children were dead on arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the wall of the room where Rodriguez shot his children, Rodriguez had written a message which confirmed that Flores had told him of Soto's visit to the police.  The message said, among other things, \"you left me, and Officer Flores knows it,\" and \"Law 54, which is only a tool for women to make men do whatever they want, is not liberty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's initial section 1983 complaint alleged that the acts and omissions of Officer Flores deprived her of her rights to due process and to equal protection of the laws.  Additionally, she alleged that Superintendent Betancourt-Lebron was liable for his failure to properly train and supervise his subordinate officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, Flores and Betancourt-Lebron moved to dismiss, and, in the alternative, for summary judgment.  In addition to arguing that Soto's claims lacked merit, the defendants asserted that they were entitled to the protections of qualified immunity.  In an opinion dated January 20, 1995, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment.  As to the due process claim, the court held that, because an individual may not bring a section 1983 action for deprivation of due process based on injury to a family member, the death of Soto's children did not give rise to a cognizable claim.  Soto v. Carrasquillo, 878 F.Supp. 324, 327 (D.P.R.1995)(citing Valdivieso Ortiz v. Burgos, 807 F.2d 6, 7-10 (1st Cir.1986)).  As to the equal protection claim, the court held that Soto had failed to adduce enough evidence on discriminatory intent and causation to defeat summary judgment.  Soto, 878 F.Supp. at 331-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto requested reconsideration;  as part of her motion, she asked for leave to amend her complaint to bring the action as a representative of her children.  The district court treated the complaint as amended, but dismissed the claim on behalf of the children, holding it barred by  DeShaney v.  Winnebago County, 489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989).  The court accordingly denied Soto's motion for reconsideration.  Soto appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Section 1983 Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto presses two distinct claims.  First, she alleges that the defendants' actions violated her and her children's rights to due process.  Second, Soto asserts that the defendants had a custom or policy of providing less protection to victims of domestic violence than to victims of other assaults, that this was the result of gender discrimination, that this caused her injuries, and that defendants thus violated her right to equal protection.  We consider each of these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim under section 1983 has two essential elements.  First, the challenged conduct must be attributable to a person acting under color of state law (including Puerto Rico law);  second, the conduct must have worked a denial of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.  Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 984 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 515, 133 L.Ed.2d 423 (1995).  The second element requires the plaintiff to prove not only a deprivation of federal right, but also that the defendant's conduct was a cause in fact of the alleged deprivation.  See Maldonado Santiago v. Velazquez Garcia, 821 F.2d 822, 831 (1st Cir.1987)(\"Section 1983 imposes a causation requirement similar to that of ordinary tort law.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Due Process Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto claims that the deaths of her children are attributable to the defendants' actions, and that those actions deprived both her and her children of what she terms a \"substantive due process life interest.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We examine separately Soto's individual claim and her claim on behalf of her children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Soto, 878 F.Supp. at 327.   On appeal, Soto argues both that the district court erred in so holding and that the injury she complains of is not limited to the loss of the companionship of her children, but also comprehends the mental anguish she has suffered personally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.  Dominique v. Weld, 73 F.3d 1156, 1158 (1st Cir.1996).  We examine, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law and whether any disputed facts have the potential to change the outcome of the suit.  See Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 983-84 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no absolute constitutional right to enjoy the companionship of one's family members free from all encroachments by the state.  See Valdivieso Ortiz v. Burgos, 807 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1986).  \"State action that affects the parental relationship only incidentally ... even though the deprivation may be permanent ... is not sufficient to establish a violation of a identified liberty interest.\"  Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 879, 112 S.Ct. 226, 116 L.Ed.2d 183 (1991).  Thus, the death of a family member will not ordinarily give those still alive a cognizable due process claim under section 1983.  See Manarite v. Springfield, 957 F.2d 953, 960 (1st Cir.)  (child could not sue police for failure to prevent father's suicide), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 837, 113 S.Ct. 113, 121 L.Ed.2d 70 (1992);  Valdivieso Ortiz, 807 F.2d at 10 (stepfather and siblings had no cause of action where prison guards beat inmate to death).  Here, the defendants' actions, despite the tragic outcome, were not specifically aimed at ending or affecting Soto's relationship with her children.  Nor can Soto successfully distinguish her case from the cited precedents of this court by pointing to her own mental anguish.  The question is not one of a degree of suffering, but whether the plaintiff can establish a violation of federal right.  While Soto's loss was of enormous, heartbreaking magnitude, the Constitution does not protect against all harms.  She herself was not deprived of a constitutionally protected interest, and she may not bring a section 1983 due process claim on her own behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

The court then found that the children's claim was foreclosed by DeShaney, dismissed the claim and denied the motion for reconsideration of the due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of denial of a motion for reconsideration is for abuse of discretion.  See Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 26 F.3d 220, 227 (1st Cir.1994).  For purposes of this appeal, we consider Soto's complaint, as amended, to determine if the district court committed legal error in holding that Soto, as a representative of her children, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  See Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx, 496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2460-61, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990) (district court abuses discretion when it makes error of law);  cf.  Glassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617 (1st Cir.1996)(in reviewing denial of leave to amend complaint, court considers whether complaint as amended would state cognizable claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue, and the district court held, that any claim on behalf of Soto's children is barred by DeShaney, which held that \"a State's failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\"  489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. at 1004.   We agree that if Soto's argument were simply that Flores and his brother officers failed to protect her children from Rodriguez, it would clearly fail.  See, e.g, Pinder v. Johnson, 54 F.3d 1169 (4th Cir.)  (en banc) (rejecting due process claim based upon police failure to protect domestic violence victim), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 530, 133 L.Ed.2d 436 (1995);  Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696 (9th Cir.1988)(same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Soto alleges more than a mere failure to protect.  She claims, and her claim has support in the record, that Officer Flores visited Rodriguez at home and told him that Soto had been to the police station and wished to jail him.  She further alleges that when he did so Flores was fully aware of how Rodriguez would likely react to this information, not only because Flores knew Rodriguez's character well, but also because Flores knew that Rodriguez had threatened to murder her and her family members if she went to the police and attempted to stop his abuse by having him jailed.  Soto alleges that Flores misused information that he had obtained in an official capacity, and that this affirmative act rendered her children more vulnerable to the danger posed by Rodriguez and thus led to their deaths.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto alleges that Flores's conduct violated a duty of constitutional dimension owed to Soto's children.  DeShaney clearly establishes that the state does not have a constitutional duty to protect its citizens from private violence.  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. at 1004.   However, in DeShaney, the Supreme Court also recognized a distinction between the case before it and other cases in which the state created the risk faced by the plaintiff:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>While the State may have been aware of the dangers that [the plaintiff] faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.  [By returning the plaintiff child to his abusive father, the State] placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006.   The situation here arises from the state actor's affirmative acts, which played a part in creating the danger to the children and rendered them more vulnerable to harm.  Soto thus contends that it falls outside the scope of DeShaney, in that it \"implicates the alternate framework of &#167; 1983 liability wherein a plaintiff alleges that some conduct by an officer directly caused harm to the plaintiff.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Pinder, 54 F.3d at 1176 n. *  (emphasis in original);  see also Dwares v. City of New York, 985 F.2d 94, 99 (2d Cir.1993)(\"[T]hough an allegation simply that police officers had failed to act upon reports of past violence would not implicate the victim's rights under the Due Process Clause, an allegation that the officers in some way had assisted in creating or increasing the danger to the victim would indeed implicate those rights.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not every negligent, or even willfully reckless, state action that renders a person more vulnerable to danger \"take[s] on the added character of [a] violation[ ] of the federal Constitution.\"  Monahan v. Dorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc., 961 F.2d 987, 993 (1st Cir.1992).  In a creation of risk situation, where the ultimate harm is caused by a third party, courts must be careful to distinguish between conventional torts and constitutional violations, as well as between state inaction and action.  See id.;  Pinder, 54 F.3d at 1175-78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of any permissible section 1983 action based on a state-created danger theory is a difficult question.  See, e.g., Pinder, 54 F.3d at 1175;  Monahan, 961 F.2d at 993-94.   Because we find that this claim may be resolved on immunity grounds, we choose not to reach this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Qualified Immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that Soto had stated a claim that Flores and Betancourt-Lebron violated her children's constitutional rights, the issue becomes whether the defendants are entitled, as they argue, to qualified immunity from suit.  There are two prongs to qualified immunity analysis.  See St. Hilaire v. Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995).  First, the court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the constitutional right in question was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.  Id. If the right is clearly established, the court must then ask whether a reasonable similarly situated officer \"should have understood that the challenged conduct violated\" that right.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, Soto's arguments against qualified immunity appear to misconstrue the doctrine.  Soto argues, with evidentiary support, that not only did the defendants violate Law 54 and the pertinent regulations, but also that they knew or reasonably should have known that they were violating it.  According to Soto, \"[n]o good faith defense is possible if the official knew he was violating plaintiff's rights.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has considered, and rejected, this approach to qualified immunity.  Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 193-95, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3018-19, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984).  In Davis, the plaintiff argued that official conduct that contravened a statute or regulation could not be objectively reasonable because officials may reasonably be expected to conform their conduct to legal norms.  Id. at 193, 104 S.Ct. at 3018.   The Court rejected this approach because it would \"disrupt the balance ... between the interests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective performance of their duties.\"  Id. at 195, 104 S.Ct. at 3019.  \"Officials sued for constitutional violations do not lose their qualified immunity merely because their conduct violates some statutory or administrative provision.\"  Id. at 194, 104 S.Ct. at 3019;  see also Borucki v. Ryan, 827 F.2d 836, 847 n. 18 (1st Cir.1987).  Accordingly, Soto's arguments with regard to Law 54, even if her alleged facts are true, do not resolve the qualified immunity question.  The focus is rather on whether there is clearly settled law on the constitutional violation at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This inquiry is sharpened by two narrowing principles.  The right must be stated with sufficient particularity so that a \" 'reasonable officer would understand that what he is doing violates that right' \" and the right must have been \"clearly established at the time of the defendants' alleged improper actions, and ... not ... through the use of hindsight.\"  Souza v. Pina, 53 F.3d 423, 425 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)).  The issue is thus whether the constitutional duty not to affirmatively abuse governmental power so as to create danger to individuals and render them more vulnerable to harm was clearly established in April 1991, the time of the events giving rise to this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the Third Circuit termed the \" 'state-created danger theory,' \" Kneipp v. Tedder, 95 F.3d 1199, 1201 (3d Cir.1996), has been recognized by some federal courts as a viable mechanism for establishing a constitutional claim at least since 1979.  See White v. Rochford, 592 F.2d 381, 383 (7th Cir.1979) (finding Due Process Clause violation where \"unjustified and arbitrary refusal of police officers to lend aid to children endangered by the performance of official duty ... ultimately result[ed] in physical and emotional injury to the children\");  see also Cornelius v. Town of Highland Lake, 880 F.2d 348 (11th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1066, 110 S.Ct. 1784, 108 L.Ed.2d 785 (1990);  Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583 (9th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 938, 111 S.Ct. 341, 112 L.Ed.2d 305 (1990);  Checki v. Webb, 785 F.2d 534, 538 (5th Cir.1986).  In DeShaney, the Supreme Court acknowledged that state actions that create dangers or render private citizens more vulnerable to harm could amount to constitutional violations.  See DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006.   Since DeShaney, seven circuit courts of appeals have recognized that state-created dangers may, in proper circumstances, give rise to constitutional claims under section 1983.  See Kneipp, 95 F.3d at 1208 (citing cases and tracing history of state-created danger theory).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this history would appear to militate in favor of finding that there is clearly established law in this area, in 1991 the First Circuit had not yet addressed the issue of state-created dangers.  The first case from this court to discuss the contours of that doctrine was Monahan v. Dorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc., 961 F.2d 987 (1st Cir.1992), and that case held that, on the facts alleged, there was no constitutional violation.  Of course, a violation of clearly settled law may be found even where the Supreme Court and the circuit in question have not specifically addressed the question.  See 2 Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation:  The Law of Section 1983, &#167; 8.07, at 134-35 (3d ed.1991) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we cannot extract a clearly established right from a somewhat confusing body of caselaw through the use of hindsight, or \"permit claims of qualified immunity to turn on the eventual outcome of a hitherto problematic constitutional analysis.\"  Martinez Rodriguez v. Colon Pizarro, 54 F.3d 980, 989 (1st Cir.1995).  The history of the state-created danger theory, although recently comprehensively described by the Third Circuit in Kneipp, is an uneven one.  The distinction between affirmatively rendering citizens more vulnerable to harm and simply failing to protect them has been blurred.  Moreover, courts have sometimes found that a given action, while rendering the plaintiff more vulnerable to danger, did not amount to a constitutional violation, but instead should be viewed as a state law tort.  See, e.g., Cannon v. Taylor, 782 F.2d 947, 950 (11th Cir.1986).  It is more recent judicial opinions that have begun to clarify the contours of this doctrine.  See, e.g., Kneipp, 95 F.3d at 1208-10;  Pinder, 54 F.3d at 1174-1177.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude therefore that, in 1991, \"the contours of the right were [not] sufficiently plain that a reasonably prudent state actor would have realized not merely that his conduct might be wrong, but that it violated a particular constitutional right.\"  Martinez Rodriguez, 54 F.3d at 988.   Accordingly, we find that the defendants are entitled to the protections of qualified immunity, and affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on plaintiff's substantive due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Equal Protection Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In DeShaney, the Supreme Court acknowledged that \"[t]he State may not, of course, selectively deny its protective services to certain disfavored minorities without violating the Equal Protection Clause.\"  489 U.S. at 197 n. 3, 109 S.Ct. at 1004 n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto alleges an equal protection violation in her assertion that \"[d]efendants have a custom, policy and practice of treating complaints from, or on behalf of, women threatened with violence in domestic disputes differently from other complaints of violence.  Defendants have discriminated on the basis of the sex of the complaining victim.\"   The district court measured Soto's equal protection claim<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> under the standard for such claims brought by domestic violence victims that was first articulated by the Tenth Circuit in Watson v. City of Kansas City, 857 F.2d 690 (10th Cir.1988), and subsequently adopted by several other circuits.  Under the Watson standard, a plaintiff seeking to defeat a motion for summary judgment must:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>proffer sufficient evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to infer that it is the policy or custom of the police to provide less protection to victims of domestic violence than to other victims of violence, that discrimination against women was a motivating factor, and that the plaintiff was injured by the policy or custom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ricketts v.

Soto, 878 F.Supp. at 329.   We agree.  The court also found that plaintiff had failed to meet her burden in opposing summary judgment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> on either the discriminatory intent prong or the causation prong of the Watson standard.  Id. at 332.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a matter of first impression for this court, we adopt the Watson standard for section 1983 equal protection claims brought by domestic violence victims.  Several other circuits have considered similar claims.  These tragedies follow a sadly similar pattern;  an abuse victim, after repeatedly seeking police protection from her abuser, is gravely injured or killed.  The victim, or her next of kin, claims under section 1983 that law enforcement policies provide lesser protection to victims of domestic violence and discriminate on the basis of gender.  See, e.g, Navarro v. Block, 72 F.3d 712 (9th Cir.1995);  Eagleston v. Guido, 41 F.3d 865 (2d Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 53, 133 L.Ed.2d 18 (1995);  Ricketts, 36 F.3d at 775;  Brown v.

See Watson, 857 F.2d at 694.   Soto has adduced evidence sufficient to create an issue as to whether there was a custom or policy of providing less protection to domestic violence victims.  Closer questions are whether Soto adduces evidence sufficient to permit the drawing of the necessary inference of an intent to discriminate against women and whether Soto provides sufficient evidence that her injuries were caused by the alleged custom or policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's argument may be summarized as follows:  (1) that the Preamble to Law 54 explicitly recognizes that \"women are usually the victims of ... conjugal abuse\" and that Law 54 expresses a legislative intent to protect women and children from domestic violence;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  (2) that, although 95% of domestic violence complaints involve females as victims and males as perpetrators, one out of every four persons in jail in Puerto Rico for domestic violence is female;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  (3) that statements of the individual in charge of the police in Puerto Rico, Betancourt-Lebron, demonstrate both that Law 54 is not enforced as are other laws and that his disagreement with the law, which may reasonably be understood to be gender motivated, has led to non-enforcement by subordinate officers;  (4) that there was no police training on domestic violence prior to the events at issue;  (5) that statements by Sergeant Orta, and Officers Flores and Carrasquillo acknowledge that police officers in the Rio Grande precinct in 1991 did not enforce Law 54;  (6) that statements by individual officers demonstrate gender bias and stereotyping, indicating that the Law was not enforced for discriminatory reasons;  (7) that the non-discriminatory reasons offered for the non-enforcement are pretextual;  (8) that differential enforcement of Law 54 therefore permits an inference of an intent to discriminate;  and (9) that her injuries were caused by the non-enforcement of the domestic violence law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that no intent to discriminate can be inferred from mere non-enforcement of a law.  It is a truism that under current Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence, a showing of disproportionate impact alone is not enough to establish a constitutional violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  See Washington v.

While \"impact provides an important starting point\" for a court seeking to determine if the adverse effect reflects invidious gender-based discrimination, \"purposeful discrimination is 'the condition that offends the Constitution.' \"  Personnel Administrator v.

Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1989);  see Siegel, \"The Rule of Love\":  Wife Beating as Prerogative and Privacy, 105 Yale L.J. 2117, 2190-94 (1996)(modern doctrines of equal protection have encouraged the development of facially neutral policies that are difficult to challenge on constitutional grounds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A domestic violence victim seeking to prove an equal protection violation must thus show that the relevant policymakers and actors were motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory purpose.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274, 99 S.Ct. at 2293-94.   The Supreme Court has defined discriminatory purpose as being:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences....  It implies that the decisionmaker ... selected or reaffirmed a course of action at least in part \"because of,\" not merely \"in spite of\" its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 279, 99 S.Ct. at 2296.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without the smoking gun of an overtly discriminatory statement by a decisionmaker, it may be very difficult to offer sufficient proof of such a purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  See, e.g., Eagleston, 41 F.3d at 878 (statistics showing that domestic violence complaints were less likely to result in arrest than were stranger assault complaints and evidence of under-enforcement of official domestic violence policy did not constitute evidence of discriminatory intent or purpose);  Ricketts, 36 F.3d at 781 (although over 90% of victims of domestic abuse are women, and police statements offered support for discriminatory intent toward domestic disputes, plaintiff presented no evidence of intent to discriminate against women).  It is true, as Soto points out, that some courts have allowed the equal protection claims of domestic violence victims to proceed on an arguably lesser showing.  See Balistreri, 901 F.2d at 701 (remark of officer that plaintiff's husband was entitled to hit her because she was \"carrying on\" suggested an animus against women sufficient to allow plaintiff's complaint to survive motion to dismiss);  Thurman v. City of Torrington, 595 F.Supp. 1521, 1528-29 (D.Conn.1984)(viewing equal protection claim of domestic violence victim in terms of \"increasingly outdated misconception\" of husband's prerogative to discipline his wife) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  However, we think that the stringent standards imposed by the majority of circuit courts are more in keeping with the Supreme Court's approach to equal protection challenges to facially neutral policies.  It is in this light that we evaluate Soto's equal protection claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the usual case in which plaintiffs seek to prove discriminatory intent from the mere fact of differential impact.  Nor is this the more common case where a plaintiff in a civil rights action seeks to use the courts to upset the majoritarian preferences expressed through the legislative process.  Rather, plaintiff here seeks the benefit of the protection afforded by that majoritarian legislative process and argues that she has been deprived of that protection by the actions of individual public officials motivated by a contrary, gender-discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory language of Law 54, and the legislative intent evident from its preamble, serve to differentiate this case from the typical disparate impact case.  The Law's prefatory \"Statement of Motives\" states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>Although men as well as women may be victims of conjugal abuse, studies show that women are usually the victims of the aggressive and violent conduct that we call conjugal abuse....  The investigators figure that 60% of all married women in Puerto Rico are victims of conjugal abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statement of Motives, Domestic Abuse Prevention and Intervention Act, Act No. 54 (Aug. 15, 1989) (citation omitted).  This recognition that the problem of domestic violence impacts women most heavily is reiterated in the text of Law 54 itself:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>In developing the public policy on this matter, we must give attention to the handling of the difficulties that domestic abuse presents, especially for women and children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws ann. tit. 8, &#167; 601 (Supp.1995) (emphasis added).  Law 54 also explicitly recognizes that discrimination has impeded institutional responses to domestic violence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>Domestic abuse is one of the most critical manifestations of the effect of inequities in the relationships between men and women.  The discriminatory ideas, attitudes, and conduct also permeate those social institutions called upon to resolve and prevent the problem of domestic abuse and its consequences.   The efforts of these institutions to identify, understand and handle abuse have been limited, and often inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the more usual equal protection case, a plaintiff will present evidence of disparate impact upon a disfavored group in an attempt to provide an \"important starting point\" for proof of discriminatory intent.  See, e.g., Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274, 99 S.Ct. at 2293.   Here, the Statement of Motives of Law 54 contains an explicit legislative finding that domestic violence has a greater impact on women and the Law expresses an intent to ameliorate that impact.  This legislative finding is evidence that under-enforcement of Law 54 would indeed have a greater impact on women and might therefore be motivated by gender discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the express legislative desire to assist women victims of domestic violence and recognition of the problem of discrimination within responsible institutions are important factors to be considered in the \"give and take\" of the situation.  See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 n. 24, 99 S.Ct. at 2296 n. 24 (discriminatory intent is often \"made clear from what has been called ... 'the give and take of the situation' \") (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court has said that the discriminatory intent inquiry should look not only at the different impact a policy has on a disfavored group, but also at the history behind the development of a policy, including looking at the problems it was intended to address.  See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68, 97 S.Ct. at 564-65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that decisions such as Feeney and Arlington Heights are rooted in an appropriate judicial deference to democratic processes and rational legislative preferences, the rationale of deference is less compelling here.  See, e.g., Feeney, 442 U.S. at 271, 99 S.Ct. at 2292 (\"The calculus of effects, the manner in which a particular law reverberates in a society, is a legislative and not a judicial responsibility....[I]t  is presumed that 'even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process ....' \" (citations omitted));  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 563 (\"[I]t is because legislators and administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous competing considerations that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of arbitrariness or irrationality.\").  With Law 54, the legislature of Puerto Rico has expressed, through the democratic process, an intent to protect the female victims of domestic violence and has noted that enforcement agencies have been discriminatory and part of the problem.  Thus, under-enforcement of Law 54 by those charged with administering the law may in fact be a subversion of majoritarian processes for individual, illegitimate motives.  We believe, in this context, that action by officials leading to non-enforcement of Law 54 may be some evidence of discriminatory intent by those individuals.  The policy Soto challenges is, of course, not Law 54, but the decision not to implement the Law when she sought its protections.  In determining what, if anything, motivated that decision, the factfinder may consider the purposes of the Law itself, and draw appropriate inferences about what might motivate a decision not to effectuate those purposes.  As the Law expressly seeks to aid women victims and eradicate institutional discriminatory attitudes, a decision not to implement the Law may well have been motivated not \"in spite of,\" but \"because of\" the resulting impact on women.  We review the record to see whether there is sufficient evidence of intent as to each of named defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Rio Grande Precinct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing whether the failure to enforce Law 54 was motivated by discriminatory intent, we look first to the actions of the officers in the Rio Grande precinct.  The key actor at the precinct level was Sergeant Orta.  Orta was told Soto was making a Law 54 complaint, yet he signed an Other Services Report in violation of Law 54 and took no steps to have Rodriguez arrested.  Nor did he take any steps to remove Soto and her children from harm's way.  He knew that Flores was going to talk to Rodriguez and did not try to stop him.  He thus ratified and condoned the officers' disregard of Law 54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta's statements, as described below, suggest a discriminatory attitude towards women;  this attitude may have been one of the reasons behind the lack of enforcement of Law 54 at the Palmer substation of the Rio Grande precinct.  Sergeant Orta made statements which a trier of fact could easily find reveal gender-discriminatory stereotypes and biases.  He testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>Q: What is your opinion of Act 54?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>A: I told you the first time, and I remit myself to the record, that I am in total disagreement with that Act.  I believe that it is very unjust related to aggressions against women and I do not agree with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p>Q: Why do you believe it is very unjust with relation to aggressions against women?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>A: Sometimes men, including myself of course, but sometimes one drinks on the outside or has a woman on the side or a friend on the side, and one has an argument with one's lady friend and goes home and takes it out on the wife.  And I believe that is not just.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>Q: Then I ask you, again, what is your opinion with relation to the law?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>A: Well, the thing is that the law, in spite of it mentioning both parties as being able to complain, the woman is always the person who is injured.  Credibility is given to the woman, where there are occasions when that doesn't happen that way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weight to be given to Sergeant Orta's comments depends upon many factors.  See National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 743 (ambiguous comments standing alone are insufficient to raise an inference of racial animus).  The defendants here have not offered a plausible alternative interpretation for comments which in context suggest discrimination.  See Alexis v. McDonald's Restaurants, Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 348 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[A] rational factfinder would be hard-pressed to glean a more plausible inference [than discriminatory intent], particularly since [defendant] has tendered no alternative interpretation supported by the present record.\").  The comments were made by a person whose actions allegedly contributed to the plaintiff's injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sergeant Orta's statements are very troubling.  His hostility to enforcing the domestic violence law could certainly be understood as arising from archaic stereotypes which assume that men enjoy certain prerogatives towards women, including beating them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Gender-based \"classifications may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.\"  United States v. Virginia, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2275 (citation omitted).  Although Sergeant Orta is not a defendant here, he was a supervisor and his attitudes are evidence of whether the failure to enforce Law 54 at the precinct level was based on discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 54 was enforced sporadically, at best, in the precinct in 1991.  Officer Flores testified that almost everyone in his police detachment \"shied away from\" Law 54 complaints.  Asked what happened to the victims when the officers did not want to take complaints, Flores responded, \"Well, they had to continue complaining.\"   Flores testified that proper Law 54 procedures were followed only about 75% of the time, and then just by certain officers.  Sergeant Orta, Flores's direct supervisor, stated that, despite Law 54, domestic violence complaints were not given great importance in 1991 and were commonly handled in the station as \"Other Services\" reports.  There would certainly be enough facts to raise a reasonable inference that the failure to enforce Law 54 at the precinct level was based on gender discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That, however, does not answer the question as to whether Officer Flores, who is the defendant here, acted out of gender-based discriminatory intent in talking to Rodriguez.  It was not within Flores's responsibilities to take Soto's complaint or to arrest Rodriguez.  We find no evidence to suggest that Flores's motivation in talking to Rodriguez was based on gender discrimination.  There is no evidence that Flores himself attempted to avoid enforcement of Law 54 at all, much less for discriminatory reasons.  Flores, despite the lack of official training, undertook to get some training for himself.  When Soto came to the Palmer substation, Flores called in the two patrol officers, whose responsibility it was to take the complaint and act on it.  Flores described Soto's complaint as a Law 54 complaint to the patrol officers, as he did to Sergeant Orta.  There is no evidence that Flores intervened and talked to Rodriguez because of a gender-discriminatory motive;  rather, the relationship between the two men provides a strong inference that Flores believed his friendship could provide a basis to resolve the matter.  Sadly, he was wrong. That he was wrong does not turn his action into one motivated by gender discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Police Superintendent Betancourt-Lebron</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff asserts that Betancourt-Lebron, the superintendent of police for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, should be held responsible because he failed to provide adequate training, and because that failure was due to gender-discriminatory bias.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  This claim is based largely on Betancourt-Lebron's public statements.  For example, when Law 54 had been in effect for eight months, Betancourt-Lebron, was quoted in the press as saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>I don't believe that [Law 54] is solving anything because it has not lessened the fights between husbands and wives.  On the contrary, there is evidence that it continues to increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He went on to say that domestic violence should not be treated with laws that punish the aggressors, but with psychologists and social workers.  This statement of disagreement with the law's decision to criminalize such conduct is not, in itself, a statement of discriminatory intent.  Plaintiff posits that the statement in context should be read as discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's expert witness, Mercedes Rodriguez, opined that, because one of the most dramatic changes achieved by Law 54 was the criminalization of domestic violence, this statement by Betancourt-Lebron was \"one of the most severe blows, that a public official of [his] stature\" could give to the law.  Rodriguez called these statements \"a deviation on the part of the institutional leadership.\"   It was the position of the Women's Affairs Commission that Betancourt's public statements \"would promote rank and file's negative attitudes toward women victims and their rights under Law 54.\"   The Superintendent's public statements, in opposition to a law he was charged with enforcing, were widely disseminated.  It is reasonable to infer, as Soto's expert and the Women's Affairs Commission suggest, that they influenced many of the rank and file in the police.  But that the statements had influence does not mean that they were motivated by discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Betancourt-Lebron acknowledged that he foresaw that police officers would have problems implementing Law 54 because its procedures differed from other laws, and because \"of active resistance from some members of the Force toward the law.\"   There is no evidence, however, that he was aware of discriminatory attitudes at the Rio Grande precinct, much less that, in the face of such knowledge, he failed to act to curb those attitudes.  Nor is there any comparative evidence as to what, if any, training Betancourt-Lebron implemented when other new laws went into effect.  Evidence that Law 54, which was specifically intended to assist abused women, was handled differently than other new major law enforcement initiatives could, perhaps, support an inference of discriminatory intent.  But the record is devoid of such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Somewhat more probative of Betancourt-Lebron's intent is his relationship with the Women's Affairs Commission.  Betancourt-Lebron declined to meet, for a year after approval of Law 54, with the Women's Affairs Commission.  Law 54 directs the Commission to evaluate implementation of the law and to promote the response of law enforcement agencies to victims.  See P.R. Laws ann. tit. 8, &#167; 651 (Supp.1995).  The initial report of the Commission, covering the first year of implementation, noted:  \"Coordination with the Police of Puerto Rico to train personnel as to domestic violence problems and Law 54 has been virtually impossible.\"   In fact, Betancourt-Lebron returned none of the numerous phone calls or letters to him from the Executive Director of the Commission, who was concerned about the Police Department's apparent lack of interest in implementing the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, this evidence, while painting an unwholesome picture, is not enough to meet the strict standards imposed by the Supreme Court for showing discriminatory intent in equal protection claims.  As Feeney says, the intent to be shown must be more than an \"awareness of consequences.\"  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, 99 S.Ct. at 2296.   The defendant must have \"selected ... a course of action at least in part 'because of' not merely 'in spite of' its adverse effects on an identifiable group.\"  Id. An expression of disagreement with Law 54 and a failure to meet with the Women's Affairs Commission, while some evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of Betancourt-Lebron, is too slender a stalk on which to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that plaintiff has fallen short of her difficult burden of proving discriminatory intent against these defendants as required to establish a constitutional tort.  In so saying, we do not of course condone the actions and failures of duties we have described.  The deaths of children, which may have followed from risks arguably created by the actions of public officials, are very serious matters.  Whether this deplorable scenario is actionable under Puerto Rican law we leave, as we must, to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment against plaintiff is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TORRUELLA, Chief Judge (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur with the majority's opinion.

Wilson Police Dep't, 739 F.Supp. 257, 263-66 (E.D.Pa.1990).  In these cases, the plaintiffs argued that state law made certain protective processes mandatory, and thus created entitlements subject to due process protection against deprivation.  See, e.g, Coffman, 739 F.Supp. at 263-64.   However, from our reading of the record, Soto does not appear to make a procedural due process claim.  Thus, we do not address whether the protective provisions of Law 54 create such an entitlement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The distinction between duty-to-protect cases and danger-creation cases was colorfully described by the Seventh Circuit in Bowers v.

This tragedy occurred four days after Rodriguez's wife, Flor Maria Soto, complained to the police about the physical and emotional abuse she suffered at Rodriguez's hands.  The police, knowing Rodriguez had threatened to kill Soto and her family if Soto went to the police to have him jailed for his spousal abuse, nonetheless violated their obligations of confidentiality and informed Rodriguez of Soto's complaints.  Having done so, the police did not jail Rodriguez or take steps to protect Soto and her family.  Soto's lawsuit alleges that Rodriguez did what he had threatened to do and that the state created this danger.  Rather than pursue any claims available to her under Puerto Rican law, Soto chose to bring suit in federal court alleging constitutional tort theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto brought suit under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, claiming that the actions of the defendants, Carlos Flores, a police officer, and Ismael Betancourt-Lebron, Puerto Rico's superintendent of police, violated her and her children's rights to substantive due process and to equal protection of the laws.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.  We do not reach the difficult question of whether Soto, in her capacity as a representative of her dead children, has presented a due process claim that would survive summary judgment, because we find that the defendant officers are protected by qualified immunity on that claim.  As to the equal protection claim, we adopt a standard for measuring such claims in domestic violence cases.  Testing the evidence against that standard, we find that Soto has not adduced sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to survive summary judgment.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the party opposing summary judgment.  Flor Maria Soto married Angel Rodriguez, nicknamed Rafi, in 1981.  Rodriguez and Soto had two children:  Sally was born in 1983, and Chayanne, a boy, in 1988.  Approximately a year into their marriage, Rodriguez began to abuse Soto emotionally and physically.  This abuse, often connected to Rodriguez's drinking, continued throughout their marriage.  The abuse was apparent to family and friends.  As one neighbor put it, \"anyone who visited them could tell that [Soto] was an abused wife.\"   Despite his constant mistreatment of Soto, Rodriguez never abused the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodriguez did gardening and vehicle repair work for the police officers at Palmer Police Station, a sub-station of the Rio Grande precinct.  Rodriguez was friends with several of the officers from Palmer Station, including Luis Carrasquillo-Morales (\"Carrasquillo\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and defendant Carlos Flores-Moreira (\"Flores\").  Rodriguez visited the station almost daily.  Many of the officers, when on patrol in the area, would visit the Rodriguez-Soto home for coffee or a drink.  Flores and Rodriguez were particularly friendly;  about once a week, during his patrol rounds, Flores would stop by the house for an hour's visit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Wednesday, April 17, 1991, Rodriguez struck Soto about her face and neck, bruising her, and called her insulting names.  When Rodriguez fell drunkenly asleep, Soto gathered the children and went to her mother's house.  Soto's mother, Hipolita Vega, convinced her to go to the police and file a complaint.  In nine years of beatings, some of them worse than the one on April 17, Soto had never sought help because she believed that the police would do nothing, because she had nowhere to go, and because she was afraid of Rodriguez.  Rodriguez had threatened her with a gun on several occasions and told her that he would kill her and other members of her family if she went to the police.  Knowing that Rodriguez was friendly with the police, Soto feared that the police would do nothing except tell Rodriguez that she had complained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that night, despite her fear, Soto went with her mother and her children to the Palmer Police Station.  When she arrived, she was met by Flores, who was the desk officer on duty.  Flores could see that Soto was crying and marked with bruises, \"pretty ugly hematomas.\"   Soto explained that Rodriguez had beaten her.  Flores then radioed for the patrol officers to come in and take her complaint, referring to Soto on the radio as \"Rafi's wife\" and saying that it was a Law 54 case.  During the fifteen to twenty minutes that Soto and Flores waited for the patrol officers to arrive, Flores told Soto that he himself had domestic violence problems, and that his wife wanted him to be put in jail.  He urged Soto to patch things up with Rodriguez.  Soto responded by telling Flores that Rodriguez's beatings were too much to stand and that, as Flores knew, Rodriguez was a heavy drinker, who became violent when drunk.  Soto told Flores about everything that Rodriguez had done and what he would do to her.  Flores offered Soto the opportunity to stay overnight at the station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sergeant Orta,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the supervisor, arrived, and Flores told him that Soto was \"the lady with the Law 54 complaint.\"   When the patrol officers, Carrasquillo and Jose Serrano, arrived, Flores said, \"This is Rafi's wife,\" and told them that she was there on a Law 54 complaint.  Carrasquillo took Soto into an interview room, three steps away from the desk at which Flores sat.  Soto was nervous and crying.  The door to the interview room remained open, and Flores listened to everything that was said in Soto's conversation with Carrasquillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interview room, Soto told Carrasquillo about Rodriguez's behavior, and showed him her bruises.  Carrasquillo asked Soto whether she wanted Rodriguez jailed.  Soto replied by explaining her situation to the officers.  Specifically, she told Carrasquillo that Rodriguez had told her that if she put him in jail, he would get out quickly because his family had money and that he would then kill her.  She told Carrasquillo that Rodriguez had told her that if she attempted to put him in jail, he would kill her mother and sisters so that she would go to the wake and he would then kill her there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having told the police officers about Rodriguez's threats, Soto asked them to do what was appropriate.  Although Soto did not use the words \"domestic violence complaint,\" she believed that by describing her situation to the officers she was initiating the complaint process.  Carrasquillo wrote down everything she said during the interview, and Soto assumed that he was drafting a complaint against Rodriguez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's effort to get police assistance came a year and a half after a new law aimed at curbing domestic violence had gone into effect.  In November 1989, the Puerto Rican legislature enacted one of the nation's most comprehensive domestic violence laws, the Domestic Abuse Prevention and Intervention Act, known popularly as \"Law 54.\"   In addition to defining criminal domestic violence broadly, Law 54 makes arrest of an abuser mandatory whenever an officer has grounds to believe that Law 54 has been violated.  P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 8, &#167;&#167; 631-635, 638 (Supp.1995).  Police officers are required to take all steps necessary to prevent abuse from recurring, including providing the complainant with information about social services and, if she expresses concern for her safety, with transportation to a safe place.  Id. &#167; 640.  Law 54 also requires that police officers file a written report on all domestic violence incidents, whether or not any charges are ever filed.  Id. &#167; 641.  The police superintendent is charged with establishing \"norms to guarantee confidentiality with regard to the identity of the persons involved in incidents of domestic violence.\"  Id. Implementing regulations issued by the superintendent of police detail the officer's responsibilities, and instruct that arrest determinations are not to be affected by irrelevant factors, including victim reluctance.  Rules and Procedures to Attend to Domestic Violence Incidents, Puerto Rico Police General Order No. 86-26m (Rev.1).  The regulations explicitly state that police attempts at mediation or reconciliation shall not substitute for arrest.  Id. at 4. The regulations require that domestic violence reports be kept confidential, in separate files, and that copies only be issued upon a court order.  Id. at 19.   These regulations explicitly recognize that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Domestic violence ... frequently ends in intra-family homicide and it affects all the components of the family, including the children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this legal framework, at the conclusion of his interview with Soto, Carrasquillo took no action.  Carrasquillo did not tell Soto about the availability of battered women's shelters or about procedures for obtaining an order of protection.  Nor did he prepare a domestic violence report.  Instead, Carrasquillo wrote up an \"Other Services Report,\" which falsely indicated that Soto had visited the police solely for advice relating to child custody.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Soto returned to Vega's house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carrasquillo discussed Soto's complaint with his supervisor, Sergeant Orta, that evening.  When Sergeant Orta signed the Other Services Report he did so despite information that this was a Law 54 situation and that the men under his supervision were not doing what the law required.  Sergeant Orta discussed the \"Other Services\" report with Flores.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Flores told him that Rodriguez and Soto had marital problems because Rodriguez was an alcoholic.  Flores said he would talk to Rodriguez the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime the next day, April 18, Officer Flores, despite knowing of Rodriguez's threats to commit murder if Soto went to the police in an effort to jail him, went to the Rodriguez-Soto home and told Rodriguez about Soto's visit to the police station.  That night, Rodriguez arrived at Vega's home, very upset.  He told Vega and Glorivee Soto, Soto's sister, that \"the boys\" from the police station had told him that Soto wanted to put him in jail and that he would not allow that to happen.  Vega managed to calm him and he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Friday, April 19, Rodriguez ran into the plaintiff at a local tire shop.  Rodriguez, visibly upset, told plaintiff that Officer Flores had been to their home and had told him that Soto was going to throw him in jail.  Soto, fearing violence, denied it.  She tried to calm Rodriguez down, but Rodriguez kept repeating that Flores had told him she wanted him jailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Saturday, the twentieth of April, Rodriguez again came to Vega's home and invited Soto to the beach.  Soto refused to go, but the children, excited at the rare prospect of an outing with their father, got into the car.  Rodriguez did not bring the children back that day as he had promised.  Soto went twice to try to pick them up, but both times Rodriguez refused to give the children to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, at 8:00 p.m.  on April 21, Soto, mindful that the next day was a school day, went back to the family home determined to get the children.  As she stood on the lawn, Soto heard both children tell Rodriguez that she had arrived.  Sally shouted, \"Run, Mommy, please run!\"   Rodriguez then shot his son in the forehead.  Soto heard Sally say to her father, \"Daddy, no, Daddy, no.\"   Rodriguez then shot Sally through her mouth.  Soto heard a third shot.  Rodriguez had killed himself.  When the police, including Carrasquillo and Serrano, arrived, Rodriguez was dead.  The children were still alive and the police rushed them to the hospital.  Both children were dead on arrival.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the wall of the room where Rodriguez shot his children, Rodriguez had written a message which confirmed that Flores had told him of Soto's visit to the police.  The message said, among other things, \"you left me, and Officer Flores knows it,\" and \"Law 54, which is only a tool for women to make men do whatever they want, is not liberty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's initial section 1983 complaint alleged that the acts and omissions of Officer Flores deprived her of her rights to due process and to equal protection of the laws.  Additionally, she alleged that Superintendent Betancourt-Lebron was liable for his failure to properly train and supervise his subordinate officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, Flores and Betancourt-Lebron moved to dismiss, and, in the alternative, for summary judgment.  In addition to arguing that Soto's claims lacked merit, the defendants asserted that they were entitled to the protections of qualified immunity.  In an opinion dated January 20, 1995, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment.  As to the due process claim, the court held that, because an individual may not bring a section 1983 action for deprivation of due process based on injury to a family member, the death of Soto's children did not give rise to a cognizable claim.  Soto v. Carrasquillo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court treated the complaint as amended, but dismissed the claim on behalf of the children, holding it barred by  DeShaney v.  Winnebago County, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Section 1983 Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto presses two distinct claims.  First, she alleges that the defendants' actions violated her and her children's rights to due process.  Second, Soto asserts that the defendants had a custom or policy of providing less protection to victims of domestic violence than to victims of other assaults, that this was the result of gender discrimination, that this caused her injuries, and that defendants thus violated her right to equal protection.  We consider each of these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim under section 1983 has two essential elements.  First, the challenged conduct must be attributable to a person acting under color of state law (including Puerto Rico law);  second, the conduct must have worked a denial of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law.

The question is not one of a degree of suffering, but whether the plaintiff can establish a violation of federal right.

She further alleges that when he did so Flores was fully aware of how Rodriguez would likely react to this information, not only because Flores knew Rodriguez's character well, but also because Flores knew that Rodriguez had threatened to murder her and her family members if she went to the police and attempted to stop his abuse by having him jailed.  Soto alleges that Flores misused information that he had obtained in an official capacity, and that this affirmative act rendered her children more vulnerable to the danger posed by Rodriguez and thus led to their deaths.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto alleges that Flores's conduct violated a duty of constitutional dimension owed to Soto's children.  DeShaney clearly establishes that the state does not have a constitutional duty to protect its citizens from private violence.  DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. at 1004.   However, in DeShaney, the Supreme Court also recognized a distinction between the case before it and other cases in which the state created the risk faced by the plaintiff:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>While the State may have been aware of the dangers that [the plaintiff] faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.

The situation here arises from the state actor's affirmative acts, which played a part in creating the danger to the children and rendered them more vulnerable to harm.  Soto thus contends that it falls outside the scope of DeShaney, in that it \"implicates the alternate framework of &#167; 1983 liability wherein a plaintiff alleges that some conduct by an officer directly caused harm to the plaintiff.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Pinder, 54 F.3d at 1176 n. *  (emphasis in original);  see also Dwares v.

In a creation of risk situation, where the ultimate harm is caused by a third party, courts must be careful to distinguish between conventional torts and constitutional violations, as well as between state inaction and action.

Qualified Immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that Soto had stated a claim that Flores and Betancourt-Lebron violated her children's constitutional rights, the issue becomes whether the defendants are entitled, as they argue, to qualified immunity from suit.  There are two prongs to qualified immunity analysis.  See St. Hilaire v. Laconia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709033\"><a href=\"/opinion/709033/kathy-st-hilaire-etc-v-city-of-laconia/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1995).  First, the court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the constitutional right in question was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.  Id. If the right is clearly established, the court must then ask whether a reasonable similarly situated officer \"should have understood that the challenged conduct violated\" that right.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, Soto's arguments against qualified immunity appear to misconstrue the doctrine.  Soto argues, with evidentiary support, that not only did the defendants violate Law 54 and the pertinent regulations, but also that they knew or reasonably should have known that they were violating it.  According to Soto, \"[n]o good faith defense is possible if the official knew he was violating plaintiff's rights.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has considered, and rejected, this approach to qualified immunity.  Davis v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span> (1984).  In Davis, the plaintiff argued that official conduct that contravened a statute or regulation could not be objectively reasonable because officials may reasonably be expected to conform their conduct to legal norms.  Id. at 193, 104 S.Ct. at 3018.   The Court rejected this approach because it would \"disrupt the balance ... between the interests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective performance of their duties.\"  Id. at 195, 104 S.Ct. at 3019.  \"Officials sued for constitutional violations do not lose their qualified immunity merely because their conduct violates some statutory or administrative provision.\"  Id. at 194, 104 S.Ct. at 3019;  see also Borucki v. Ryan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493606\"><a href=\"/opinion/493606/robert-a-borucki-v-w-michael-ryan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 847 n. 18 (1st Cir.1987).  Accordingly, Soto's arguments with regard to Law 54, even if her alleged facts are true, do not resolve the qualified immunity question.  The focus is rather on whether there is clearly settled law on the constitutional violation at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This inquiry is sharpened by two narrowing principles.

In DeShaney, the Supreme Court acknowledged that state actions that create dangers or render private citizens more vulnerable to harm could amount to constitutional violations.  See DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006.   Since DeShaney, seven circuit courts of appeals have recognized that state-created dangers may, in proper circumstances, give rise to constitutional claims under section 1983.  See Kneipp, 95 F.3d at 1208 (citing cases and tracing history of state-created danger theory).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this history would appear to militate in favor of finding that there is clearly established law in this area, in 1991 the First Circuit had not yet addressed the issue of state-created dangers.  The first case from this court to discuss the contours of that doctrine was Monahan v. Dorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581513\"><a href=\"/opinion/581513/kevin-monahan-v-dorchester-counseling-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992), and that case held that, on the facts alleged, there was no constitutional violation.  Of course, a violation of clearly settled law may be found even where the Supreme Court and the circuit in question have not specifically addressed the question.  See 2 Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation:  The Law of Section 1983, &#167; 8.07, at 134-35 (3d ed.1991) (citing cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we cannot extract a clearly established right from a somewhat confusing body of caselaw through the use of hindsight, or \"permit claims of qualified immunity to turn on the eventual outcome of a hitherto problematic constitutional analysis.\"  Martinez Rodriguez v.

The history of the state-created danger theory, although recently comprehensively described by the Third Circuit in Kneipp, is an uneven one.  The distinction between affirmatively rendering citizens more vulnerable to harm and simply failing to protect them has been blurred.  Moreover, courts have sometimes found that a given action, while rendering the plaintiff more vulnerable to danger, did not amount to a constitutional violation, but instead should be viewed as a state law tort.  See, e.g., Cannon v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463829\"><a href=\"/opinion/463829/lemuel-cannon-jr-individually-and-as-temporary-administrator-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span>, 950 (11th Cir.1986).  It is more recent judicial opinions that have begun to clarify the contours of this doctrine.

See Watson, 857 F.2d at 694.   Soto has adduced evidence sufficient to create an issue as to whether there was a custom or policy of providing less protection to domestic violence victims.  Closer questions are whether Soto adduces evidence sufficient to permit the drawing of the necessary inference of an intent to discriminate against women and whether Soto provides sufficient evidence that her injuries were caused by the alleged custom or policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's argument may be summarized as follows:  (1) that the Preamble to Law 54 explicitly recognizes that \"women are usually the victims of ... conjugal abuse\" and that Law 54 expresses a legislative intent to protect women and children from domestic violence;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  (2) that, although 95% of domestic violence complaints involve females as victims and males as perpetrators, one out of every four persons in jail in Puerto Rico for domestic violence is female;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  (3) that statements of the individual in charge of the police in Puerto Rico, Betancourt-Lebron, demonstrate both that Law 54 is not enforced as are other laws and that his disagreement with the law, which may reasonably be understood to be gender motivated, has led to non-enforcement by subordinate officers;  (4) that there was no police training on domestic violence prior to the events at issue;  (5) that statements by Sergeant Orta, and Officers Flores and Carrasquillo acknowledge that police officers in the Rio Grande precinct in 1991 did not enforce Law 54;  (6) that statements by individual officers demonstrate gender bias and stereotyping, indicating that the Law was not enforced for discriminatory reasons;  (7) that the non-discriminatory reasons offered for the non-enforcement are pretextual;  (8) that differential enforcement of Law 54 therefore permits an inference of an intent to discriminate;  and (9) that her injuries were caused by the non-enforcement of the domestic violence law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that no intent to discriminate can be inferred from mere non-enforcement of a law.

It is true, as Soto points out, that some courts have allowed the equal protection claims of domestic violence victims to proceed on an arguably lesser showing.  See Balistreri, 901 F.2d at 701 (remark of officer that plaintiff's husband was entitled to hit her because she was \"carrying on\" suggested an animus against women sufficient to allow plaintiff's complaint to survive motion to dismiss);  Thurman v.

However, we think that the stringent standards imposed by the majority of circuit courts are more in keeping with the Supreme Court's approach to equal protection challenges to facially neutral policies.  It is in this light that we evaluate Soto's equal protection claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the usual case in which plaintiffs seek to prove discriminatory intent from the mere fact of differential impact.  Nor is this the more common case where a plaintiff in a civil rights action seeks to use the courts to upset the majoritarian preferences expressed through the legislative process.  Rather, plaintiff here seeks the benefit of the protection afforded by that majoritarian legislative process and argues that she has been deprived of that protection by the actions of individual public officials motivated by a contrary, gender-discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory language of Law 54, and the legislative intent evident from its preamble, serve to differentiate this case from the typical disparate impact case.  The Law's prefatory \"Statement of Motives\" states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>Although men as well as women may be victims of conjugal abuse, studies show that women are usually the victims of the aggressive and violent conduct that we call conjugal abuse....

This recognition that the problem of domestic violence impacts women most heavily is reiterated in the text of Law 54 itself:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>In developing the public policy on this matter, we must give attention to the handling of the difficulties that domestic abuse presents, especially for women and children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R.

Law 54 also explicitly recognizes that discrimination has impeded institutional responses to domestic violence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>Domestic abuse is one of the most critical manifestations of the effect of inequities in the relationships between men and women.  The discriminatory ideas, attitudes, and conduct also permeate those social institutions called upon to resolve and prevent the problem of domestic abuse and its consequences.   The efforts of these institutions to identify, understand and handle abuse have been limited, and often inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the more usual equal protection case, a plaintiff will present evidence of disparate impact upon a disfavored group in an attempt to provide an \"important starting point\" for proof of discriminatory intent.  See, e.g., Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274, 99 S.Ct. at 2293.   Here, the Statement of Motives of Law 54 contains an explicit legislative finding that domestic violence has a greater impact on women and the Law expresses an intent to ameliorate that impact.  This legislative finding is evidence that under-enforcement of Law 54 would indeed have a greater impact on women and might therefore be motivated by gender discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the express legislative desire to assist women victims of domestic violence and recognition of the problem of discrimination within responsible institutions are important factors to be considered in the \"give and take\" of the situation.  See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 n. 24, 99 S.Ct. at 2296 n. 24 (discriminatory intent is often \"made clear from what has been called ... 'the give and take of the situation' \") (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court has said that the discriminatory intent inquiry should look not only at the different impact a policy has on a disfavored group, but also at the history behind the development of a policy, including looking at the problems it was intended to address.  See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68, 97 S.Ct. at 564-65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that decisions such as Feeney and Arlington Heights are rooted in an appropriate judicial deference to democratic processes and rational legislative preferences, the rationale of deference is less compelling here.  See, e.g., Feeney, 442 U.S. at 271, 99 S.Ct. at 2292 (\"The calculus of effects, the manner in which a particular law reverberates in a society, is a legislative and not a judicial responsibility....[I]t  is presumed that 'even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process ....' \" (citations omitted));  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. at 563 (\"[I]t is because legislators and administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous competing considerations that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of arbitrariness or irrationality.\").  With Law 54, the legislature of Puerto Rico has expressed, through the democratic process, an intent to protect the female victims of domestic violence and has noted that enforcement agencies have been discriminatory and part of the problem.  Thus, under-enforcement of Law 54 by those charged with administering the law may in fact be a subversion of majoritarian processes for individual, illegitimate motives.  We believe, in this context, that action by officials leading to non-enforcement of Law 54 may be some evidence of discriminatory intent by those individuals.  The policy Soto challenges is, of course, not Law 54, but the decision not to implement the Law when she sought its protections.  In determining what, if anything, motivated that decision, the factfinder may consider the purposes of the Law itself, and draw appropriate inferences about what might motivate a decision not to effectuate those purposes.  As the Law expressly seeks to aid women victims and eradicate institutional discriminatory attitudes, a decision not to implement the Law may well have been motivated not \"in spite of,\" but \"because of\" the resulting impact on women.  We review the record to see whether there is sufficient evidence of intent as to each of named defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Rio Grande Precinct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing whether the failure to enforce Law 54 was motivated by discriminatory intent, we look first to the actions of the officers in the Rio Grande precinct.  The key actor at the precinct level was Sergeant Orta.  Orta was told Soto was making a Law 54 complaint, yet he signed an Other Services Report in violation of Law 54 and took no steps to have Rodriguez arrested.  Nor did he take any steps to remove Soto and her children from harm's way.  He knew that Flores was going to talk to Rodriguez and did not try to stop him.  He thus ratified and condoned the officers' disregard of Law 54.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Orta's statements, as described below, suggest a discriminatory attitude towards women;  this attitude may have been one of the reasons behind the lack of enforcement of Law 54 at the Palmer substation of the Rio Grande precinct.  Sergeant Orta made statements which a trier of fact could easily find reveal gender-discriminatory stereotypes and biases.  He testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>Q: What is your opinion of Act 54?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p>A: I told you the first time, and I remit myself to the record, that I am in total disagreement with that Act.

And I believe that is not just.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>Q: Then I ask you, again, what is your opinion with relation to the law?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>A: Well, the thing is that the law, in spite of it mentioning both parties as being able to complain, the woman is always the person who is injured.  Credibility is given to the woman, where there are occasions when that doesn't happen that way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The weight to be given to Sergeant Orta's comments depends upon many factors.  See National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 743 (ambiguous comments standing alone are insufficient to raise an inference of racial animus).  The defendants here have not offered a plausible alternative interpretation for comments which in context suggest discrimination.  See Alexis v. McDonald's Restaurants, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196337\"><a href=\"/opinion/196337/alexis-v-mcdonalds-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 348 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[A] rational factfinder would be hard-pressed to glean a more plausible inference [than discriminatory intent], particularly since [defendant] has tendered no alternative interpretation supported by the present record.\").  The comments were made by a person whose actions allegedly contributed to the plaintiff's injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sergeant Orta's statements are very troubling.  His hostility to enforcing the domestic violence law could certainly be understood as arising from archaic stereotypes which assume that men enjoy certain prerogatives towards women, including beating them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Gender-based \"classifications may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.\"  United States v.

Although Sergeant Orta is not a defendant here, he was a supervisor and his attitudes are evidence of whether the failure to enforce Law 54 at the precinct level was based on discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 54 was enforced sporadically, at best, in the precinct in 1991.  Officer Flores testified that almost everyone in his police detachment \"shied away from\" Law 54 complaints.  Asked what happened to the victims when the officers did not want to take complaints, Flores responded, \"Well, they had to continue complaining.\"   Flores testified that proper Law 54 procedures were followed only about 75% of the time, and then just by certain officers.  Sergeant Orta, Flores's direct supervisor, stated that, despite Law 54, domestic violence complaints were not given great importance in 1991 and were commonly handled in the station as \"Other Services\" reports.  There would certainly be enough facts to raise a reasonable inference that the failure to enforce Law 54 at the precinct level was based on gender discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That, however, does not answer the question as to whether Officer Flores, who is the defendant here, acted out of gender-based discriminatory intent in talking to Rodriguez.  It was not within Flores's responsibilities to take Soto's complaint or to arrest Rodriguez.  We find no evidence to suggest that Flores's motivation in talking to Rodriguez was based on gender discrimination.  There is no evidence that Flores himself attempted to avoid enforcement of Law 54 at all, much less for discriminatory reasons.  Flores, despite the lack of official training, undertook to get some training for himself.  When Soto came to the Palmer substation, Flores called in the two patrol officers, whose responsibility it was to take the complaint and act on it.  Flores described Soto's complaint as a Law 54 complaint to the patrol officers, as he did to Sergeant Orta.  There is no evidence that Flores intervened and talked to Rodriguez because of a gender-discriminatory motive;  rather, the relationship between the two men provides a strong inference that Flores believed his friendship could provide a basis to resolve the matter.  Sadly, he was wrong. That he was wrong does not turn his action into one motivated by gender discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Police Superintendent Betancourt-Lebron</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff asserts that Betancourt-Lebron, the superintendent of police for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, should be held responsible because he failed to provide adequate training, and because that failure was due to gender-discriminatory bias.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  This claim is based largely on Betancourt-Lebron's public statements.  For example, when Law 54 had been in effect for eight months, Betancourt-Lebron, was quoted in the press as saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>I don't believe that [Law 54] is solving anything because it has not lessened the fights between husbands and wives.  On the contrary, there is evidence that it continues to increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He went on to say that domestic violence should not be treated with laws that punish the aggressors, but with psychologists and social workers.  This statement of disagreement with the law's decision to criminalize such conduct is not, in itself, a statement of discriminatory intent.  Plaintiff posits that the statement in context should be read as discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soto's expert witness, Mercedes Rodriguez, opined that, because one of the most dramatic changes achieved by Law 54 was the criminalization of domestic violence, this statement by Betancourt-Lebron was \"one of the most severe blows, that a public official of [his] stature\" could give to the law.  Rodriguez called these statements \"a deviation on the part of the institutional leadership.\"   It was the position of the Women's Affairs Commission that Betancourt's public statements \"would promote rank and file's negative attitudes toward women victims and their rights under Law 54.\"   The Superintendent's public statements, in opposition to a law he was charged with enforcing, were widely disseminated.  It is reasonable to infer, as Soto's expert and the Women's Affairs Commission suggest, that they influenced many of the rank and file in the police.  But that the statements had influence does not mean that they were motivated by discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Betancourt-Lebron acknowledged that he foresaw that police officers would have problems implementing Law 54 because its procedures differed from other laws, and because \"of active resistance from some members of the Force toward the law.\"   There is no evidence, however, that he was aware of discriminatory attitudes at the Rio Grande precinct, much less that, in the face of such knowledge, he failed to act to curb those attitudes.  Nor is there any comparative evidence as to what, if any, training Betancourt-Lebron implemented when other new laws went into effect.  Evidence that Law 54, which was specifically intended to assist abused women, was handled differently than other new major law enforcement initiatives could, perhaps, support an inference of discriminatory intent.  But the record is devoid of such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Somewhat more probative of Betancourt-Lebron's intent is his relationship with the Women's Affairs Commission.  Betancourt-Lebron declined to meet, for a year after approval of Law 54, with the Women's Affairs Commission.  Law 54 directs the Commission to evaluate implementation of the law and to promote the response of law enforcement agencies to victims.  See P.R. Laws ann. tit. 8, &#167; 651 (Supp.1995).  The initial report of the Commission, covering the first year of implementation, noted:  \"Coordination with the Police of Puerto Rico to train personnel as to domestic violence problems and Law 54 has been virtually impossible.\"   In fact, Betancourt-Lebron returned none of the numerous phone calls or letters to him from the Executive Director of the Commission, who was concerned about the Police Department's apparent lack of interest in implementing the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, this evidence, while painting an unwholesome picture, is not enough to meet the strict standards imposed by the Supreme Court for showing discriminatory intent in equal protection claims.  As Feeney says, the intent to be shown must be more than an \"awareness of consequences.\"  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, 99 S.Ct. at 2296.   The defendant must have \"selected ... a course of action at least in part 'because of' not merely 'in spite of' its adverse effects on an identifiable group.\"  Id. An expression of disagreement with Law 54 and a failure to meet with the Women's Affairs Commission, while some evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of Betancourt-Lebron, is too slender a stalk on which to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we conclude that plaintiff has fallen short of her difficult burden of proving discriminatory intent against these defendants as required to establish a constitutional tort.  In so saying, we do not of course condone the actions and failures of duties we have described.  The deaths of children, which may have followed from risks arguably created by the actions of public officials, are very serious matters.  Whether this deplorable scenario is actionable under Puerto Rican law we leave, as we must, to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment against plaintiff is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TORRUELLA, Chief Judge (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur with the majority's opinion.

In these cases, the plaintiffs argued that state law made certain protective processes mandatory, and thus created entitlements subject to due process protection against deprivation.  See, e.g, Coffman, 739 F.Supp. at 263-64.   However, from our reading of the record, Soto does not appear to make a procedural due process claim.  Thus, we do not address whether the protective provisions of Law 54 create such an entitlement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The distinction between duty-to-protect cases and danger-creation cases was colorfully described by the Seventh Circuit in Bowers v.

While holding that \"there is no constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen,\" Judge Posner pointed out that \"[i]f the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him, ... it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.\"  Id. at 618</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The district court correctly found that Valdivieso Ortiz 's bar on section 1983 actions for due process violations based on the death of a family member has not been extended to equal protection claims.
