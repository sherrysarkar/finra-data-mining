Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Stahl, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Jeffrey Silverstein and Billings & Silverstein on brief for\nappellant.\n     Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         January 26, 2001\n\f           Per   Curiam.         On   December   5,    2000,   this   court\n\ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the\n\nissue of whether the lower court committed plain error when\n\nit used a base offense level of 37 to compute appellant\n\nJames Raymond Walker, Jr.’s (“Walker’s”) sentence.                      The\n\ncourt has received the parties supplemental briefs, and we\n\nare in accordance with the parties’ joint recommendation\n\nthat the case be remanded for re-sentencing.\n\n           Section 4B1.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\nsets a defendant’s base offense level by reference to the\n\n“offense statutory maximum” for any underlying crimes of\n\nviolence   for   which     the    defendant      was   convicted.       See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(A) at app. note 2.              Two of the crimes of\n\nviolence for which Walker was convicted (the robberies) each\n\ncarried maximum terms of imprisonment of 20 years, and the\n\nthird crime of violence (use of a firearm during a crime of\n\nviolence) carried a maximum term of imprisonment of seven\n\nyears (consecutive).       Possession of a firearm by a convicted\n\nfelon (Count VI), which in Walker’s case did carry the\n\npossibility of a life sentence, is not a crime of violence\n\nfor purposes of section 4B1.1.              See United States v. Bell,\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f966 F.2d 703, 707 (1st Cir. 1992). The base offense level for\n\nan offense carrying a statutory maximum of 20 years or more,\n\nbut less than 25 years, is 32.            U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(C).        Thus,\n\nunder the career offender guideline, Walker’s offense level\n\nwould have been 32, not 37 as determined by the sentencing\n\ncourt.\n\n           But     Walker    also   was    an    armed    career   criminal\n\nbecause he was subject to the enhanced sentence under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(e), so U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4 is relevant here, too.\n\nSection 4B1.4 provides that where a defendant is an armed\n\ncareer criminal, his offense level is the greatest of: 1)\n\nthe offense level applicable under chapters two and three of\n\nthe sentencing guidelines (in this case, 29), 2) the offense\n\nlevel for a career offender (in this case, 32), or 3) 34,\n\nif, like Walker, the defendant used or possessed the firearm\n\nin    connection    with    a   crime     of    violence.      U.S.S.G.    §\n\n4B1.4(b)(1) - (3).        The greatest of these is 34, so Walker’s\n\nbase offense level should have been 34.                  After a reduction\n\nfor    acceptance    of     responsibility       and     assignment   of   a\n\nCriminal History Category of VI, see U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(c)(2),\n\nthe applicable sentencing range should have been 188 to 235\n\nmonths.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           This court may reverse for plain error affecting\n\nsubstantial rights.            See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); United\n\nStates v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).                           The\n\nsentence Walker received was 27 months longer than the top\n\nof the applicable sentencing guideline range, so we conclude\n\nthat plain error is present here.                 We vacate the judgment of\n\nthe   district        court    and       remand     for       re-sentencing      in\n\naccordance      with   this    opinion.           The    question      originally\n\nbriefed    by   the    parties       –   whether        the    prior   crimes    of\n\nviolence were “related” for purposes of section 4B1.1 – is\n\nrendered    moot,      since   both       the     base    offense      level    and\n\nCriminal History Category are to be determined by section\n\n4B1.4 instead.\n\n           Judgment       vacated        and    matter        remanded   for    re-\n\nsentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f",
