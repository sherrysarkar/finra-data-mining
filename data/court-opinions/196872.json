She charged\r\n\nFleet with violation of the handicap discrimination provisions of\r\n\nthe  Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I. Gen. Laws  \r\n\n28-5-1,  et  seq.,  on  account of  Fleet's  alleged  refusal  to\r                           \r\n\nreasonably accommodate the symptoms she experienced from Multiple\r\n\nSclerosis (\"MS\").1  \r\n\n          MS is  a degenerative nerve disorder  which can produce\r\n\nsymptoms  ranging  from fatigue  and  numbness  to paralysis  and\r\n\ndeath.  The severity of symptoms is related in part to the amount\r\n\nof  stress experienced by the  patient.  In  D'Aprile's case, she\r\n\nalleges that her symptoms were  sufficiently in abeyance that she\r\n\nwas capable of  performing her  job as a  Senior Systems  Support\r\n\nAnalyst.     She   contends,   however,  that   she  needed   the\r\n\naccommodation  of  being  permitted  to  work  only  a  part-time\r\n\nschedule  for a short time (one to  two months) so that she could\r\n\nslowly  reacclimate herself to  full-time work.   Her  claim that\r\n\nFleet  refused  to  provide this  accommodation  constitutes  the\r\n\ngravamen of her case.   \r\n\n          On  November  22,  1995,  the  district  court  granted\r\n\nFleet's  motion  for  summary   judgment.    The  district  court\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   R.I. Gen.  Laws    28-5-7(1) generally  makes it unlawful  to\r\nrefuse to hire,  or to  discriminate against an  employee on  the\r\nbasis  of handicap.   R.I.  Gen. Laws    28-5-7(1)(i)-(iii).   In\r\naddition, the  statute specifically makes it  unlawful \"to refuse\r\nto reasonably accommodate an employee's or prospective employee's\r\nhandicap   unless  the   employer   can   demonstrate  that   the\r\naccommodation would  pose a  hardship on the  employer's program,\r\nenterprise, or business.\"  R.I. Gen. Laws   28-5-7(1)(iv).\r\r\n\nconcluded  that  summary judgment  was  mandated  by our  earlier\r\n\ndecision  in August v. Offices Unlimited, Inc., 981 F.2d 576 (1st\r                                                        \r\n\nCir. 1992).   Because we  disagree that August  mandates judgment\r                                                        \r\n\nfor the defendant in this case, we reverse.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          In  November 1991,  D'Aprile commenced  employment with\r\n\nFleet on a  full-time basis.  In January of  1992, D'Aprile began\r\n\nto experience the  first symptoms of  MS, a numbness  in her  leg\r\n\nwhich lasted for  four days.  Then, in July of 1992, she began to\r\n\nexperience numbness in the entire left side of her body, and took\r\n\na medical leave of absence for the entire month of July.\r\n\n          D'Aprile's symptoms  recurred in  October  of 1992,  at\r\n\nwhich time  she  was diagnosed  with  MS.   As  a result  of  her\r\n\nsymptoms, D'Aprile was unable  to travel to work from  October 1,\r\n\n1992 until January 31, 1993.  In the beginning of  this period of\r\n\nabsence, during October and  November, D'Aprile continued to work\r\n\nat home, and  Fleet provided her with a computer  to allow her to\r\n\ndo so.   By the  end of November,  however, D'Aprile's  condition\r\n\ndeteriorated to the point that she completely ceased working. \r\n\n          In   January  of   1993,  D'Aprile's   symptoms  abated\r\n\nsomewhat, and she  expressed a  desire to  return to  work.   Her\r\n\ndoctor advised her that she should return to a full-time position\r\n\nin stages, beginning with  part-time work.  Accordingly, D'Aprile\r\n\nlater asked  her supervisor,  Debbie Sullivan, for  permission to\r\n\nreturn on  a  part-time  basis  for  a  two  month  period.    In\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nparticular,  she  asked if  she could  work  three days  per week\r\n\n(taking  Mondays and Fridays off) until she felt strong enough to\r\n\nresume  a full-time schedule.   She told Sullivan  that she would\r\n\ntake  eight vacation days for  the first month  so that she could\r\n\ncontinue receiving  a full-time  salary.  According  to D'Aprile,\r\n\nSullivan told her that her proposed arrangement sounded okay, and\r\n\nthat she  was willing to \"work with\" D'Aprile, but that she would\r\n\nhave  to get  back  to her  about it  after  checking with  Diane\r\n\nDeCosta, the Human Resources Manager.\r\n\n          D'Aprile  states  that on  January  19,  1993, Sullivan\r\n\ncalled her back and  told her that it was against  company policy\r\n\nfor her to work  part-time.  D'Aprile then called  Henry Korsiak,\r\n\nSullivan's  superior.  Korsiak endorsed Sullivan's description of\r\n\ncompany  policy.    D'Aprile  then asked  Korsiak  about  another\r\n\nemployee, Mary Gendreau, who  had been permitted to return  part-\r\n\ntime  after  a  maternity  leave.   Korsiak  told  D'Aprile  that\r\n\nGendreau had negotiated a \"special deal\" with her supervisor.\r\n\n          Notwithstanding Fleet's refusal  to approve  D'Aprile's\r\n\nproposed  part-time  work  schedule,  she  returned  to  work  on\r\n\nFebruary 1,  1993.  After her  return, she called  Jan Wyant, who\r\n\nworked in Human  Resources, and asked her  if she could  take off\r\n\nFriday, February 5th  and Monday, February  8th.  Wyant  approved\r\n\nthe absence, and told D'Aprile to take two personal days.  \r\n\n          When  D'Aprile   did  not  come  to   work  on  Friday,\r\n\nFebruary 5th, she called Korsiak.  According to D'Aprile, Korsiak\r\n\n\"screamed\" at her, telling her  that she had no right to  go over\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nhis  head to get permission to take  personal days.  He told her,\r\n\n\"You said  that you  were coming  back for  February 1st and  you\r\n\nshould be here,  and I don't  know why you're  not here.  And  if\r\n\nyou're  not  here,  maybe  you  shouldn't  bother  coming  back.\"\r\n\nD'Aprile  states that she  was very upset  by Korsiak's response,\r\n\nand interpreted it  as an  ultimatum that she  work full-time  or\r\n\nlose her job.\r\n\n          Despite  Korsiak's  harsh  response, however,  D'Aprile\r\n\nreturned to work on the  following Tuesday, and continued working\r\n\na  three day-a-week  schedule during the  months of  February and\r\n\nMarch, 1993.  As D'Aprile describes it, however, she only managed\r\n\nto achieve this result  \"not without a  fight.\"  She states  that\r\n\nevery time  during the  February-March period that  she requested\r\n\ntime  off,  the  request  would  initially  be denied  by  Debbie\r\n\nSullivan, who  took the position that accrued vacation time could\r\n\nonly be  used with  a supervisor's  approval.   On each  of these\r\n\noccasions,  D'Aprile  was forced  to  appeal  to  Jan Wyant,  who\r\n\napproved each request. \r\n\n          This weekly  pattern of requests for  time off, denials\r\n\nby Sullivan and reluctant approvals by Wyant continued during the\r\n\nmonth of  February and  through most  of March.    At some  point\r\n\nduring this time, Korsiak and Sullivan indicated to D'Aprile that\r\n\nshe  had no more vacation time.  D'Aprile eventually decided that\r\n\nshe could no  longer work  under such conditions.   Her  physical\r\n\ncondition  had  deteriorated, causing  her  to  feel \"very,  very\r\n\nfatigued.\"   After  discussing the  matter  with her  doctor, she\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nconcluded that her symptoms  had worsened due to the  \"stress and\r\n\nstrain\"  produced by Fleet's refusal to approve her request for a\r\n\npart-time  work schedule.   On  March 24,  1993, she  returned to\r\n\ndisability status.\r\n\n          On  March  25, 1993,  the  day  after D'Aprile  stopped\r\n\nworking,  she submitted a letter from her doctor stating that she\r\n\nwas  \"unable  to  work  at this  time  and  should  be placed  on\r\n\ndisability.\"  As a  result, D'Aprile received disability benefits\r\n\nunder  Fleet's   short  and  long-term  disability   plans  until\r\n\nJanuary 21,  1995,  when those  benefits were  terminated because\r\n\nFleet's insurance  carrier found that  she was no  longer totally\r\n\ndisabled.  \r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.  Mesnick\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  General  Electric Co.,  950 F.2d  816,  822 (1st  Cir. 1991).\r                                   \r\n\nAccordingly,  we view the entire record in a light most favorable\r\n\nto the  non-moving party, indulging all  reasonable inferences in\r\n\nthat  party's favor.  Id.  The  entry of summary judgment will be\r                                   \r\n\nupheld  only   if  \"the   pleadings,   depositions,  answers   to\r\n\ninterrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file,  together  with  the\r\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\r\n\nas a matter of law.\"  Id.\r                                   \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The  district court  entered judgment  in favor  of the\r\n\ndefendant solely on the authority of August v. Offices Unlimited,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc.,  supra.  In essence, the  district court interpreted August\r                                                                           \r\n\nto  stand for  the proposition  that a  plaintiff is  barred from\r\n\nclaiming   handicap   discrimination   if,   after   leaving  her\r\n\nemployment, she  contends that  she is \"totally  disabled\" within\r\n\nthe meaning of  her employer's disability  insurance policy.   We\r\n\nthink that August stands for a much narrower proposition.\r                           \r\n\n          The plaintiff  in August  was a furniture  salesman who\r                                            \r\n\nbegan  to suffer from symptoms of severe clinical depression.  As\r\n\na result of this depression, August asked  for and received a six\r\n\nweek paid leave of absence from his employer.  At  the end of the\r\n\nsix week period, August  advised his employer that he was not yet\r\n\nable to return to work.  His doctor submitted a letter estimating\r\n\nthat  August would  require an  additional two  to four  weeks to\r\n\nrecuperate.   The employer told August that he would be permitted\r\n\nto take an additional two weeks as vacation, but that he would be\r\n\nexpected to  return to work at  the end of that  period.  August,\r                                                                          \r\n\n981 F.2d at 578.\r\n\n          Shortly before his scheduled return,  August's employer\r\n\nasked him if he was feeling \"100 percent better.\"  He replied, \"I\r\n\ndon't  know  if I'm  100  percent until  I start  working.\"   His\r\n\nemployer then  advised  him that  the company  would expect  \"110\r\n\npercent\" from him when he returned,  and that he was \"going to be\r\n\nunder a lot more pressure than he was prior to  leaving.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n579.   August then  requested that he  be allowed to  return on a\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\npart-time  schedule, but this was  refused.  He  was told instead\r\n\nthat  if  he was  unable to  work  full-time, he  should consider\r\n\napplying for disability  benefits under the employer's  insurance\r\n\nplan.  Id.\r                    \r\n\n          The day  after being refused a  part-time schedule, and\r\n\nbefore  his scheduled  return to  work, August submitted  a claim\r\n\nunder  the  company's  disability  plan.    He  asserted  in  his\r\n\napplication   for  benefits   that  he   had  been   totally  and\r\n\ncontinuously disabled starting on a date forty-nine days earlier.\r\n\nId. at 579.  Thus, by August's own admission, he had been totally\r             \r\n\ndisabled as of  the date he requested  and was refused the  part-\r\n\ntime schedule.  \r\n\n          August  brought suit  under Massachusetts  General Laws\r\n\nch. 151B, a statute which, like the Rhode Island statute at issue\r\n\nhere,  prohibits employment  discrimination  against people  with\r\n\ndisabilities.2  August  claimed that his  employer had failed  to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2     One  difference  between  the  two  statutes  is  that  the\r\nMassachusetts  statute  prohibits  discrimination   against  \"any\r\nperson alleging to be a qualified handicapped  person,\" while the\r\nRhode  Island   law  simply  bars   discrimination  \"because  of\"\r\nhandicap, and  requires the employer to  \"reasonably accommodate\"\r\nsuch handicap.   Compare Mass. Gen.  Laws ch. 151B    4(16)  with\r                                                                           \r\nR.I.  Gen. Laws    28-5-7.   Moreover,  the Rhode  Island statute\r\nspecifically  provides   that  discrimination  on  the  basis  of\r\nhandicap is  unlawful, even  if other, lawful,  factors motivated\r\nthe discriminatory practice.  R.I. Gen. Laws   28-5-7.3.\r\n\n   Amici  Rhode Island  Commission  for Human  Rights, the  Rhode\r                  \r\nIsland Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union and  Rhode\r\nIsland Protection and Advocacy  System, Inc. urge that the  Rhode\r\nIsland statute creates broader protections than the Massachusetts\r\nlaw, protecting even  those who  are not qualified  to work  from\r\nadverse  actions   motivated  even  in  part   by  an  employer's\r\ndiscriminatory animus.   We  need not decide  this question  here\r\nsince,  as we  explain below,  summary judgment  is inappropriate\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nreasonably accommodate his handicap by refusing to permit a part-\r\n\ntime work schedule.  The  district court granted summary judgment\r\n\nfor the employer, and we affirmed.  We concluded that \"the record\r\n\n[was]  fatally bereft  of  indication that  August possessed  the\r\n\nability to perform his job.\"  Id. at 581. \r                                           \r\n\n          Crucial to our conclusion  in August was the fact  that\r                                                        \r\n\nAugust  had  declared himself  to be  totally disabled  under his\r\n\nemployer's  disability plan  as  of the  time  he applied  for  a\r\n\nreasonable  accommodation  from  his   employer.    Although  the\r\n\ndisability plan's definition of \"totally disabled\" was not in the\r\n\nrecord, we  concluded that \"[u]nder  any definition of  the term,\r\n\nAugust's declaration that he was 'totally disabled' means that he\r\n\nwas not able to  perform the essential functions of his job . . .\r\n\nwith or without reasonable  accommodations.\"  Id. at 581.   Since\r                                                           \r\n\nAugust admitted  that  he  was unable  to  work at  the  time  he\r\n\nrequested  his part-time schedule, we concluded that he was not a\r\n\n\"qualified  handicapped person\" and thus had failed to make out a\r\n\nprima facie case under the Massachusetts statute.  Id. at 584.\r                                                                \r\n\n          Two  facts  distinguish D'Aprile's  case  and therefore\r\n\nrequire a  different outcome.   First, D'Aprile never  claimed to\r\n\nhave  been  totally  disabled  at  the  time  she   requested  an\r\n\naccommodation  from Fleet.  It  was not until  after her requests\r\n\nfor a  formal  part-time schedule  had  been refused,  and  after\r\n\nexperiencing  the  stress resulting  from  her  ad hoc  part-time\r                                                                \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\neven  on the issue of whether D'Aprile was otherwise qualified to\r\nwork.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nstatus, that she  claims to  have become totally  disabled.   The\r\n\nissue  which concerned us in August, that a plaintiff would claim\r                                             \r\n\nthat  he was entitled to  a reasonable accommodation  at the same\r                                                                           \r\n\ntime he claimed to be unable to work at all, is absent here.\r\n\n          In addition,  we note that  D'Aprile's application  for\r\n\ndisability  benefits in  this case  may not have  constituted the\r\n\nbroad  admission   of  incapacity  that  we   construed  such  an\r\n\napplication  to  be in  August.    Fleet's short-term  disability\r                                        \r\n\npolicy  defines a  \"totally  disabled\" employee  as  one \"who  is\r\n\nunable  to perform  the material  duties of  his/her job  for the\r\n\nentire  regularly scheduled work week as the result of an illness\r\n\nor  injury and  requires  the ongoing  care of  a physician. . .\"\r\n\nSuch  a disabled employee who \"is unable  to work\" is entitled to\r\n\nbenefits.   D'Aprile's contention,  that she  was unable  to work\r\n\nbecause  her employer  refused  to permit  a temporary  part-time\r\n\nschedule,  is  entirely consistent  with her  claim to  have been\r\n\n\"totally disabled\" within the meaning of the policy.  It does not\r\n\nconstitute an admission that she had been unable to work with the\r\n\naccommodation of a part-time schedule prior to that point. \r\n\n          August simply  stands  for  the  proposition  that  the\r                          \r\n\nplaintiff's ability  to work with reasonable  accommodation is an\r\n\nelement  of  a  handicap  employment  discrimination  case  under\r\n\nMassachusetts law.  Under  the particular facts of that  case, we\r\n\nfound  that   August's  application  for   disability  insurance,\r\n\ncombined  with his  demonstrated  inability to  perform any  work\r\n\n(before  or after  the  requested accommodation)  eliminated  any\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ngenuine  issue  as  to  his  ability  to  work  with   reasonable\r\n\naccommodation.  Since D'Aprile never claimed to have been totally\r\n\ndisabled  during the  time she  requested her  accommodation, and\r\n\ndemonstrated  her  ability to  work  with  the accommodation  she\r\n\nrequested, the reasoning of August does not apply.  \r                                            \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          D'Aprile contends that the  accommodation Fleet made --\r\n\npermitting her to  take vacation and  personal days on an  ad hoc\r                                                                           \r\n\nbasis  --  was not  a  reasonable  one given  the  nature of  her\r\n\ncondition and  its sensitivity  to stress  factors.   She further\r\n\nasserts  that she was capable of working part-time in the absence\r\n\nof additional stressors, and would have been able to continue her\r\n\nemployment  were  it  not  for the  hostile  and  non-cooperative\r\n\nresponse  of her  supervisors  to  her  request  for  a  modified\r\n\nschedule.  \r\n\n          Given  that D'Aprile  did  in fact  work part-time  for\r\n\nalmost two months  after her  initial request, she  has raised  a\r\n\ngenuine  issue  of material  fact as  to  whether she  could have\r\n\ncontinued even longer if Fleet had accommodated her as requested.\r\n\nD'Aprile's subsequent  application for disability  benefits after\r\n\nFleet  refused to  accommodate her  does not  resolve  this issue\r\n\nbecause it sheds no  light on how  D'Aprile would have fared  had\r\n\nthe accommodation been made.   \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt  is  reversed   and  the  case  is   remanded  for  further\r                                                             \r\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  Costs to appellant.\r\n\n          SO ORDERED.\r                    SO ORDERED.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n",
