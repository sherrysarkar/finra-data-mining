After  eliminating\r                                                    \r\n\nirrelevancies,   unsupported   statements   and,   unhappily,\r\n\nmisstatements, a  core remains  that requires us  to consider\r\n\nwhether  there was  error  in the  district court's  granting\r\n\nsummary judgment  for the  defendant.   On this  appeal,1 the\r\n\nbasic facts are these.\r\n\n          Plaintiff    Carolina   Casualty    Insurance   Co.\r\n\n(\"Carolina\"), a transportation specialist, wrote  a liability\r\n\npolicy  on Geary  and Judith  Bonville, d/b/a  Bonville Farms\r\n\n(\"Bonville  Farms\").   Subsequently,  while a  Bonville Farms\r\n\ntruck was carrying crushed (scrap) cars the load shifted, and\r\n\nfor  the  resulting  accident  Carolina was  obliged  to  pay\r\n\n$750,000  in  damages.   It  sues The  Cummings  Agency, Inc.\r\n\n(\"Cummings\")  for having  \"produced\" the  policy, negligently\r\n\nfailing to identify that Bonville Farms carried scrap cars --\r\n\na higher risk and an undertaking that Carolina would not have\r\n\naccepted.  The application,  on Carolina's form, as submitted\r\n\nto its general agency for Maine, Surplex Underwriters, Inc. -\r\n\n-  who  investigated Bonville  Farm and  approved --  read as\r\n\nfollows:   \"Type of  Cargo Carried:   (Be specific)  Produce,\r\n\nPotatoes, Potash  (bagged) and  Lumber.\"   It could  be found\r\n\nthat  Cummings  had completed  the  application  for Bonville\r\n\nFarms' signature.   Even in  this court Carolina  claims that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  There is  no merit in  defendant's claim that  the appeal\r\nwas  filed too late.   See Lopez v.  Corporacion Azucarera de\r                                                                         \r\nPuerto Rico, 938 F.2d 1510, 1514 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                       \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nCummings signed, too.   Very conspicuously,  it did not;  nor\r\n\nwas its signature requested.   Cummings' name simply appeared\r\n\nas the \"Non-Licensed Producer.\"  Carolina maintains, however,\r\n\nthat Cummings \"knew or should have known\" of Bonville  Farms'\r\n\nscrap car operation  and should have reported  it.  Obviously\r\n\nthis assumes a  duty to inform.   The  court ruled there  was\r\n\nnone.  We affirm.\r\n\n          In order to  defeat summary judgment, Carolina  was\r\n\nrequired to  come forward with  an affirmative showing.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry., 100  F.3d 228, 230 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1996); Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(c).   It  showed none  with\r\n\nrespect to a producer's duty.  The court stated it knew of no\r\n\nspecial meaning  for the term producer.   Nor do we.   In the\r\n\nabsence of evidence,  we equate  it with broker.   A  broker,\r\n\nunder the Maine  statute, is  \"any person who,  not being  an\r\n\nagent of the insurer,  as an independent contractor solicits,\r\n\nnegotiates, or procures insurance or annuity contracts or the\r\n\nrenewal  or continuation  thereof  on behalf  of insureds  or\r\n\nprospective  insureds other  than himself.\"   Me.  Rev. Stat.\r\n\nAnn.  tit. 24-A,    1506.   This  means  no duty  toward  the\r\n\ninsurer,  see Giberson v. York County Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 142\r                                                                    \r\n\nA. 481 (Me. 1928), 127 Me. 182, 185 (1928); cf. 3 Lee R. Russ\r                                                           \r\n\n&amp; Thomas  F. Segalla,  Couch on  Insurance 3d    45:4 (1995),\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nwitha heavy burden on Carolinato make a special showing here.\r\n\n          As  there  was  no  independent  writing   on  this\r\n\nsubject,  nor evidence of a  trade practice,2 we  turn to the\r\n\napplication.   Over  the \"Applicant's  Signature\" line  it is\r\n\nstated that  the applicant  \"represents that the  information\r\n\nabove is true.\"  As noted ante, the  \"Non-Licensed Producer,\"\r                                          \r\n\nelsewhere identified as  the applicant's \"agent,\"  represents\r\n\nnothing.\r\n\n          We ask a simple question.  If the producer is to be\r\n\ntaken as making a  representation, why is not this  the place\r\n\nto ask him to make it?  The implication speaks loudly.\r\n\n          Viewed independently, what  are the  practicalities\r\n\nof Carolina's  contention?  How can a broker afford to make a\r\n\nstudy in depth of every customer, to the extent that, in case\r\n\nof loss, he is  accountable for what he \"should  have known,\"\r\n\nnot   only  about   the  customer,   but  of   the  insurer's\r\n\nunderwriting  standards?     Correspondingly,  no   insurance\r\n\ncompany is going to depend upon the ability (and industry) of\r\n\nevery, non-licensed by it,  broker.  Plaintiff here  did not;\r\n\nit followed its usual  custom and commissioned an independent\r\n\ninvestigation.  This makes business sense, both ways.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  It  does appear  that Cummings  received from  Carolina a\r\nshare  of   the  premium,   manifestly  payment  for   having\r\n\"produced\"  the insured, but it assumes the point to say that\r\nthis activity implied any specific obligations.  See 3 Lee R.\r                                                                \r\nRuss  &amp;  Thomas F.  Segalla,  Couch  on  Insurance 3d    45:4\r                                                                 \r\n(1995).\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          At   the  same   time,  might   there  not   be  an\r\n\nintermediate ground?   Suppose a broker  actually knows facts\r\n\nabout his customer that he knows would make him unacceptable,\r\n\nand  knows  that  the  would-be  insured  is  filing  a false\r\n\napplication.  Should not  the insurer have a right  to expect\r\n\ngood  faith?  If some  of the hearsay  proffers Carolina made\r\n\nhere could be broadly accepted, it might have made out a case\r\n\nof fraud.   See   Giberson, ante.   We need  not reach  this,\r                                            \r\n\nhowever.  Carolina's brief  expressly disclaims making such a\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n          Carolina  has  failed  to  produce   evidence  that\r\n\nCummings' status gave  rise to any duty.   Therefore Cummings\r\n\nis  entitled  to  summary  judgment.    The  decision  of the\r\n\ndistrict court is Affirmed.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

Ann. tit.  24-A, &#167; 1506.  This means no duty toward the insurer, see Giberson v. York County Mut. Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Me.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span> (1928), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Me.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></span>, 185, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span> (1928);  cf.   3 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance 3d &#167; 45:4 (1995), with a heavy burden on Carolina to make a special showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there was no independent writing on this subject, nor evidence of a trade practice,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we turn to the application.  Over the \"Applicant's Signature\" line it is stated that the applicant \"represents that the information above is true.\"   As noted ante, the \"Non-Licensed Producer,\" elsewhere identified as the applicant's \"agent,\" represents nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We ask a simple question.  If the producer is to be taken as making a representation, why is not this the place to ask him to make it?   The implication speaks loudly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed independently, what are the practicalities of Carolina's contention?   How can a broker afford to make a study in depth of every customer, to the extent that, in case of loss, he is accountable for what he \"should have known,\" not only about the customer, but of the insurer's underwriting standards?   Correspondingly, no insurance company is going to depend upon the ability (and industry) of every, non-licensed by it, broker.  Plaintiff here did not;  it followed its usual custom and commissioned an independent investigation.  This makes business sense, both ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, might there not be an intermediate ground?   Suppose a broker actually knows facts about his customer that he knows would make him unacceptable, and knows that the would-be insured is filing a false application.  Should not the insurer have a right to expect good faith?   If some of the hearsay proffers Carolina made here could be broadly accepted, it might have made out a case of fraud.  See Giberson, ante.   We need not reach this, however.  Carolina's brief expressly disclaims making such a claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carolina has failed to produce evidence that Cummings' status gave rise to any duty.  Therefore Cummings is entitled to summary judgment.  The decision of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is no merit in defendant's claim that the appeal was filed too late.  See Lopez v. Corporacion Azucarera de Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564961\"><a href=\"/opinion/564961/victor-lopez-v-corporacion-azucarera-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1514 (1st Cir.1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> It does appear that Cummings received from Carolina a share of the premium, manifestly payment for having \"produced\" the insured, but it assumes the point to say that this activity implied any specific obligations.
