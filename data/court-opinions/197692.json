We have carefully reviewed  the record on\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\nappeal and fully considered the points advanced by  the plaintiff\r\n\n(both  in his briefs and at oral argument).   In the end, we find\r\n\nthese  appeals to  be so  utterly lacking  in merit  that further\r\n\ncomment  would  be gratuitous.    It  suffices  to say  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court was amply  justified in granting  the defendants'\r\n\nmotion for  summary judgment  for the reasons  expressed in  that\r\n\ncourt's thoughtful  rescript.  See  Torres v. Eli Lilly  and Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nCiv. No. 95-1042 (DRD) (D.P.R. March 20, 1997) (unpublished).  We\r\n\nadd  only that  the  plaintiff's counsel  is  fortunate that  the\r\n\ndistrict court did not choose to invoke the provisions of Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 11 and/or 28 U.S.C.   1927.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  The judgment is summarily\r\n\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r          Affirmed.\r                        \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n",
