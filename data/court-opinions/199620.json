In    these       consolidated        appeals,\n\nappellants, who are state inmates serving life sentences for\n\nsecond-degree murder, appeal from the dismissal of their\n\nsuit for declaratory relief.            Appellants asked the district\n\ncourt   to     find    their     statutes          of    conviction     to    be\n\nunconstitutional.         Although          this    is    a   habeas    claim,\n\nappellants have not stated that they have exhausted their\n\nstate remedies.        Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of\n\ntheir   suit,      essentially    for       the    reasons    given     by   the\n\ndistrict judge in her Memorandum of Decision dated January\n\n8, 2001 and by the appellee in his appellate brief.\n\n             Affirmed.   See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f",
