Following a jury trial, defendant-\n\nappellant John Baltas, Sr.1 (hereinafter “Baltas”) was convicted of\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute\n\nheroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. The district court sentenced\n\nhim to 188 months in prison, followed by 5 years of supervised release.\n\nBaltas now challenges his conviction and sentence alleging a potpourri\n\nof pretrial, trial, and sentencing issues. Because we conclude that\n\nnone of Baltas’s arguments have merit, we affirm.\n\n                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n             A federal grand jury indicted Baltas and twelve other\n\nindividuals for various crimes arising out of their involvement in the\n\nConnecticut and Massachusetts chapters of the Diablos Motorcycle Club\n\n(hereinafter the “Diablos,” or the “Club”). Particularly, Baltas was\n\ncharged, either alone or in combination with other defendants, with\n\nconspiracy to conduct and actually conducting the affairs of an\n\nenterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, respectively, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1962(d) (count 1, “RICO conspiracy”) and 1962(c) (count 2,\n\n\n     1\n      Baltas was tried and convicted with a number of other defendants.\nTheir appeals were heard at the same time, and subsequent decisions\nwill address their appeals. United States v. Houle, No. 99-1310 (1st\nCir. filed February 10, 1999); United States v. Lafreniere, No. 99-1318\n(1st Cir. filed February 17, 1999).\n\n                                  -2-\n\f“substantive RICO”); conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\n\nand to distribute heroin, 21 U.S.C. § 846 (count 32); and possession\n\nand interstate transportation of firearms as a convicted felon, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (counts 40 and 41). The indictment also sought\n\nforfeiture of certain property belonging to Baltas.\n\n             Before trial, Baltas unsuccessfully moved to sever and to\n\nsuppress certain evidence relevant to his count of conviction. At the\n\nend of the government’s case, he moved for judgment of acquittal and to\n\nstrike certain evidence relating to the RICO counts. The district\n\ncourt granted his motion for acquittal as to these counts, denying it\n\nas to the remaining portions of the indictment.2 In light of this\n\nruling, the court then granted Baltas’s motion to strike.\n\n             Baltas also requested an instruction on the defense of\n\nentrapment, which the district court denied. During the jury charge,\n\nBaltas did not object to the omission of an entrapment instruction.\n\nFinally, Baltas leveled various challenges to his presentence report,\n\nand moved for downward departure without success.\n\n             On appeal, Baltas assigns error to the district court’s\n\ndenials of his pretrial, trial and sentencing requests. We sketch the\n\nfacts contained in the record in the light most favorable to the jury’s\n\nverdict. See United States v. González-Vázquez, 219 F.3d 37, 40 (1st\n\n\n     2\n     Baltas renewed his motion at the end of his case, but to no\navail.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fCir. 2000). We supplement our account as it becomes necessary to the\n\ndiscussion of Baltas’s particular claims of error.\n\n             The Diablos originated in San Bernardino, California in\n\nthe 1960's, and then expanded to other areas of the country. At the\n\ntimes relevant to this appeal, the Diablos were a national organization\n\nwith chapters in California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana,\n\nMassachusetts, and New Hampshire. They were governed by a written\n\nconstitution, which conditioned membership, inter alia, upon being at\n\nleast 21 years of age, Caucasian, and owning a firearm and a Harley-\n\nDavidson of a particular size. Membership was by invitation only, and\n\nneither women nor African-Americans were allowed. Members first had to\n\nserve some time as “prospects,” a role similar to that of a pledge in\n\na fraternity, before being eligible for full membership. The Diablos\n\nalso had a governing structure which included both national and chapter\n\nofficers. Baltas was one of the Club’s founders and its national\n\npresident.\n\n             One of the prosecution’s primary witnesses at trial was\n\nWilliam Alvis (hereinafter “Alvis”). Before becoming a Diablo, Alvis\n\nhad been a member of another motorcycle club, the Barbarians, where he\n\nbecame familiarized with the biker culture and language.         While\n\naffiliated with the Barbarians, Alvis was charged with the commission\n\nof several crimes not related to the instant indictment, and eventually\n\nbegan cooperating with government authorities. He infiltrated the\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fDiablos at the behest of the FBI. One law enforcement concern with the\n\nDiablos was three unsolved motorcycle-club related murders, in which it\n\nwas suspected that members of the Diablos had been involved.\n\n             At trial, Alvis stated that one important characteristic\n\nof the Club was the sense of brotherhood among its members. Alvis’s\n\ntrust and confidence within the Diablos, together with his familiarity\n\nwith the biker culture, allowed him to become a prospect and later a\n\nfull-fledged member. He developed close relationships with several\n\nmembers of the Club, and ultimately became its vice president. Alvis\n\nwas thus the FBI’s “eyes and ears inside of the Diablos organization.”\n\n             Because of his status within the Diablos, Alvis was able\n\nto gather for the FBI valuable information about the Club’s structure\n\nand day-to-day operations. He was also able to introduce several\n\nundercover agents into the Club, and, with their help, orchestrate a\n\nnumber of criminal schemes involving the Diablos. One of these schemes\n\nconcerned a reverse-sting heroin deal. The government’s evidence of\n\nthe circumstances surrounding this scheme consisted mainly of Alvis’s\n\ntrial testimony, aided by evidence derived from the interception of\n\ncertain communications made pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime\n\nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. § 2510 et seq.\n\n(hereinafter “Title III”). What follows is a summary of this evidence.\n\n             By the end of July of 1995, the Club was facing financial\n\ndifficulties.    Alvis, who at that time was treasurer of the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fMassachusetts chapter, held a meeting where he informed chapter members\n\nof the situation and told them that they would probably be evicted from\n\nthe clubhouse because the rent was in arrears. As a way of generating\n\nmoney for the chapter, Alvis suggested that some members assist him in\n\na drug deal. Alvis specifically told the Diablos that he needed them\n\nto “[r]un security for [a] transportation of heroin.”         The plan\n\nconsisted in picking up the drugs at one point and delivering them at\n\nanother. He also explained that each participant would be paid $500,\n\nwhich money would be contributed to the chapter’s treasury.\n\n             Baltas, who happened to be present at the meeting, agreed\n\nto the idea.   He voiced his support by reminding members of their\n\ncommitment to the Club, and even proposed a few ideas for carrying out\n\nthe plan without attracting attention upon the Diablos. Moreover,\n\nBaltas directed Alvis to “[t]ake the guys . . . best suited for the\n\njob.”\n\n             The following day, Alvis traveled to Connecticut for a\n\nchapter meeting, where he met Baltas at the chapter’s clubhouse.\n\nBaltas asked Alvis how many members had volunteered to participate in\n\nthe deal, and offered to recruit additional help upon learning that\n\nonly two had come forward. As promised, Baltas talked to two other\n\nmembers who later got in contact with Alvis and eventually participated\n\nin the transaction.\n\n             The deal finally took place on August 7, 1995, and Baltas\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fand Alvis met in Connecticut the following day. Alvis gave Baltas\n\n$250.00 for his recruiting efforts.            Baltas did not directly\n\nparticipate in the transaction.\n\n                           II. DISCUSSION\n\n                           A. Suppression\n\n              Baltas contends that the district court erred in denying\n\nhis motion to suppress the evidence obtained through electronic\n\nsurveillance. Below, Baltas sought suppression of the intercepted\n\ncommunications alleging: (1) that the issuance of the warrant was not\n\ngrounded on probable cause; (2) that the accompanying affidavit failed\n\nto show the unlikely success of alternative investigative procedures;\n\n(3) that in executing the warrant, the government failed to minimize\n\nthe interceptions; (4) that the interceptions went beyond the scope of\n\nthe warrant; and (5) that the warrant failed to specify the types of\n\ncommunications to be intercepted. Upon referral by the district court,\n\nthe magistrate judge, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, issued\n\na report and recommendation that the motion be denied. Adopting the\n\nmagistrate judge’s report and recommendation, the district court denied\n\nthe motion.\n\n              Here, Baltas renews his attack on the government’s\n\nminimization procedures. Specifically, Baltas challenges that the\n\nintercepting    agents   failed   to     minimize   the   interception   of\n\ncommunications from approximately 9:04 p.m. until 10:09 p.m., on April\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f21, 1995. He further alleges that “during the spot checks after 10:09\n\np.m., the agents obviously listened to more of the conversations than\n\nwas necessary to have been able to know that they should have stopped\n\nlistening.” Focusing on these alleged violations, Baltas protests that\n\nall the evidence obtained through electronic surveillance should have\n\nbeen suppressed.\n\n            We affirm the district court’s denial of Baltas’s motion\n\nfor substantially the reasons cogently set forth in the magistrate\n\njudge’s report and recommendation adopted by the district court.\n\n“[W]hen a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision\n\nan appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other\n\nend than to hear its own words resonate.” United States v. Vélez\n\nCarrero, 140 F.3d 327, 329 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Lawton v. State\n\nMutual Life Assurance Co. of America, 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)).   We only hesitate to add two comments.\n\n            First, the evidence obtained by the April 21 interception\n\nwas not introduced at trial in relation to Baltas’s count of\n\nconviction, to wit: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\n\nheroin. In fact, none of the communications intercepted on April 21\n\nwere introduced at trial. Thus, any possible error in adequately\n\nminimizing such interception was harmless.\n\n            Second, total suppression of electronic surveillance\n\nevidence is not appropriate unless the moving party shows that there\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fwas a “taint upon the investigation as a whole sufficient to warrant\n\n[such] sweeping relief . . . .” United States v. Charles, 213 F.3d 10,\n\n23 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299,\n\n1307 (1st Cir. 1987)). That is, errors in minimizing one particular\n\ninterception within the context of a lengthy and complex investigation,\n\nsuch as the one involved in this case, do not automatically warrant the\n\nsuppression of all the evidence obtained through electronic\n\nsurveillance. Even assuming that the government failed to minimize the\n\nApril 21 interception, total suppression would not follow, because\n\nBaltas has not demonstrated that the entire surveillance was tainted.\n\n                            B. Severance\n\n             Baltas next argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion for severance.       He also assigns fault to the\n\ndistrict court’s refusal to hold a pretrial hearing on the\n\nadmissibility of coconspirator statements.\n\n             Baltas was originally charged in a superseding indictment\n\nwith a controlled substances law violation. Although the indictment\n\nalso included various RICO charges, Baltas was not targeted in any of\n\nthem.   Accordingly, he moved to sever the RICO from the non-RICO\n\ncounts, and his trial from those of his co-defendants. The magistrate\n\njudge denied the motion without prejudice. Following the filing of the\n\nsecond superseding indictment, which charged Baltas with RICO\n\nconspiracy and substantive RICO, he renewed his motion before the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fdistrict court, but to no avail.\n\n            In this case, joinder of counts and defendants in the\n\nsecond superseding indictment was proper. Of the 28 racketeering acts\n\npertinent to the RICO conspiracy alleged in count 1, two implicated\n\nBaltas, predicate acts 3 (kidnapping) and 23 (conspiracy to possess\n\nwith intent to distribute heroin). These acts were also charged as\n\nsubstantive RICO violations.    Furthermore, act 23 was separately\n\ncharged as an offense in count 32, Baltas’s count of conviction. Thus,\n\nthe counts were properly joined under Rule 8(a) as charging “two or\n\nmore acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of\n\na common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). See United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (“offenses committed pursuant\n\nto the same (charged) racketeering enterprise and conspiracy may be\n\njoined in a single indictment”). The defendants were also properly\n\njoined. See United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 245 (1st Cir.) (“So\n\nlong as there is a responsible basis for the averments, charging an\n\nomnibus RICO conspiracy normally supplies the glue necessary to bond\n\nmultiple defendants together in a single proceeding where all are\n\naccused of participating in the conspiracy.”).\n\n            Baltas insists nonetheless that he was unduly prejudiced\n\nby the district court’s denial of his motion for severance. Under Rule\n\n14, a district court may order separate trials of counts or defendants\n\n“[i]f it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fjoinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment. . . or by such\n\njoinder for trial together . . . .” Fed. R. Crim. P. 14. In making\n\nthis determination, the district court enjoys wide latitude. See\n\nUnited States v. Rogers, 121 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997). We review a\n\ndistrict court’s refusal to sever for “manifest abuse of discretion,”\n\nUnited States v. DeLeón, 187 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1999), reversing\n\nonly upon a “strong showing of evident prejudice,” United States v.\n\nO’Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1993), that joinder “deprived\n\ndefendant of a fair trial, resulting in a miscarriage of justice,”\n\nUnited States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 219 (1st Cir. 1992) (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted). Because Baltas has failed to\n\nshoulder this burden, we affirm the district court’s ruling.\n\n            Baltas maintains that he was prejudiced because the jury\n\nwas allowed to hear evidence that would have been irrelevant or\n\ninadmissible against him in a separate trial on the drug and firearms\n\ncounts. In trying to prove his point, Baltas cursorily refers to the\n\nevidence relating to the predicate acts upon which the RICO charges\n\nrested, arguing that such evidence would not have been admissible in a\n\ntrial without the RICO charges. He further contends that a separate\n\ntrial would have inoculated the jury’s verdict from being tainted by\n\nspillover prejudice.    None of these arguments have merit.\n\n            First, “[t]his court’s rule is that those ‘who are\n\nindicted together should be tried together,’ and the district court’s\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fjoinder in this case appropriately followed that presumption.” DeLeón,\n\n187 F.3d at 63 (quoting O’Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25).\n\n             Second, Baltas’s allegations of prejudice are rather\n\nconclusory, and thus do not suffice to overcome the presumption in\n\nfavor of joinder. See United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1204 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (conclusory allegations held insufficient to show requisite\n\nprejudice). “There is always some prejudice in any trial where more\n\nthan one offense or offender are tried together — but such ‘garden\n\nvariety’ prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice.” Boylan, 898\n\nF.2d at 246. Moreover, we have consistently reiterated our reluctance\n\nto second-guess a lower court’s refusal to sever “[e]ven where large\n\namounts of testimony are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one\n\ndefendant’s involvement in an overall agreement is far less than the\n\ninvolvement of others . . . .” Id. at 246; see also United States v.\n\nLevy-Cordero, 67 F.3d 1002, 1007 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.\n\nDeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1313 (1st Cir. 1994); O’Bryant, 998 F.2d at 26.\n\n             Third, the district court took appropriate measures to\n\nprevent potential spillover prejudice by instructing the jury, both\n\nduring the preliminary and closing charges, to consider the evidence\n\nseparately as to each count of the indictment, and to determine guilt\n\non an individual basis. Moreover, as it is more particularly discussed\n\ninfra, the court also gave limiting instructions during trial as to the\n\nadmissibility of certain potentially prejudicial evidence pertaining to\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fBaltas. Baltas’s acquittal on the firearms charges (counts 40 and 41)\n\ndemonstrates that the jury was able to follow these instructions. See\n\nDeLeón, 187 F.3d at 64 (considering a discriminating verdict as\n\nevidence that the jury was capable of following the district judge’s\n\ninstructions); United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d 499, 504 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(same); Neal, 36 F.3d at 1205 (same); Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (same);\n\nsee also United States v. Tracy, 989 F.2d 1279, 1284 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(“The jury’s selectivity in its verdict affords ‘reasonably good\n\nassurance’ that spillover prejudice did not result from joinder of\n\noffenses.”) (quoting United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 308 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n              Baltas alternatively argues that even if severance was not\n\nwarranted, the district court should have mitigated spillover prejudice\n\nby holding a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of coconspirator\n\nhearsay statements pursuant to United States v. James, 590 F.2d 575\n\n(5th Cir.) (en banc). During the proceeding below, Baltas made various\n\nrequests for a ruling on the admissibility of coconspirator statements\n\nrelating to the RICO charges under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). The\n\ncourt denied the requests and provisionally allowed the evidence,\n\ndeclining to make a final admissibility determination, in accordance\n\nwith United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).\n\n              As a consequence of its ruling on Baltas’s Rule 29 motion,\n\nthe district court struck the evidence at issue either in its entirety,\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\for for all but credibility purposes. Baltas argues that because the\n\ntrial    court   had   ultimately   to     instruct   the   jury   to   either\n\ncompartmentalize or totally disregard this evidence, he was unfairly\n\nprejudiced by the court’s refusal to conduct a pretrial James hearing.\n\nAccording to him, if the trial court had made its evidentiary ruling\n\nbefore trial, thereby preventing the evidence from reaching the jury,\n\nhis trial “would not have been contaminated by such a large amount of\n\nharmful inadmissible evidence.”\n\n             The Fifth Circuit in James held that “[t]he district court\n\nshould, whenever reasonably practicable, require the showing of a\n\nconspiracy and of the connection of the defendant with it before\n\nadmitting declarations of a coconspirator.” 590 F.2d at 582. The\n\ncircuit court recognized, however, that if the district court\n\n“determines it is not reasonably practical to require a showing to be\n\nmade before admitting the evidence, [it] may admit the statement\n\nsubject to being connected up.”3 Id. All in all, “[t]his is a matter\n\ncommitted to the broad discretion of the trial court.” United States\n\nv. Fragoso, 978 F.2d 896, 900 (5th Cir. 1992) (approving deferral of\n\ndetermination to admit the statement until the close of the\n\ngovernment’s case); see also United States v. González-Balderas, 11\n\n     3\n      “In that event,” similar to the procedure followed in this\ncircuit under United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.\n1977), “the court may conditionally admit the statement subject to a\nsubsequent final determination,” United States v. González-Balderas, 11\nF.3d 1218, 1224 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fF.3d 1218, 1224 (5th Cir. 1994) (same).\n\n             The usual course of action in this circuit, however, is to\n\nadmit the hearsay evidence provisionally, “subject to [a] final\n\nPetrozziello determination, which should be made ‘at the close of all\n\nthe evidence’ and ‘out of the hearing of the jury.’” United States v.\n\nPortela, 167 F.3d 687, 702 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v.\n\nCiampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir. 1980)). In this case, the\n\ndistrict court appropriately determined to admit the statements\n\nprovisionally, even though it had to subsequently strike some of them,\n\nin whole or in part, due to its ruling on Baltas’s Rule 29 motion. In\n\nso doing, the court took the necessary precautions to minimize\n\nspillover prejudice by giving appropriate cautionary instructions to\n\nthe jury. Because Baltas has not shown that the district court’s\n\ndetermination to admit the evidence provisionally was clearly\n\nerroneous, and since we have already determined that the selective\n\nverdict demonstrates that the jury was able to follow the court’s\n\ninstructions, we sustain the trial court’s determination. See Portela,\n\n167 F.3d at 703 (“We will sustain the trial court’s determination\n\n[regarding admission of coconspirator statements unless it is clearly\n\nerroneous.”).\n\n                  C. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n             Baltas further presses the claim that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to convict him on count 32, insisting that the trial court\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fshould have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. We review\n\nthese claims de novo, see United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d\n\n163, 193 (1st Cir. 2000), unitarily applying the familiar sufficiency-\n\nof-the-evidence standard, see United States v. Hernández, 218 F.3d 58,\n\n64 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000) (“‘[C]hallenges to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence and to the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nraise a single issue’” and thus we apply the traditional sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence standard to these claims.”) (quoting United States v.\n\nMorillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n             Under this standard, we review all the evidence, direct\n\nand circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and\n\navoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury\n\ncould have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 772 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nIt is immaterial that a possible rendition of the record could support\n\na not guilty verdict; it is enough that a rational trier of fact could\n\nhave construed the evidence to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSee Hernández, 218 F.3d at 64; Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d at 26-27.\n\n             “The insufficiency of the evidence in this case,” Baltas\n\nasserts, “turns on one specific point,” to wit: that there was no\n\nevidence that he conspired to possess heroin with intent to distribute\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fand to distribute it. He protests that “[t]he government’s evidence,\n\nat best, proved that [he] joined a conspiracy to aid and abet a drug\n\ndeal, but not to actually deal in drugs.” According to Baltas, the\n\nevidence failed to show that he was involved in the selling or buying\n\nof the drugs.\n\n             “‘To prove a drug conspiracy charge under 21 U.S.C. § 846,\n\nthe government is obliged to show that a conspiracy existed and that a\n\nparticular defendant agreed to participate in it, intending to commit\n\nthe underlying substantive offense.’” Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 191\n\n(quoting United States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)). Thus, “the government must show two kinds of intent: ‘intent\n\nto agree and intent to commit the substantive offense.’” Hernández,\n\n218 F.3d at 65 (quoting United States v. Gómez-Pabón, 911 F.2d 847, 852\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)). It need not show, however, “that a given defendant\n\ntook part in all aspects of the conspiracy.” Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d at\n\n1173. As the Supreme Court in Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52,\n\n65 (1997) explained:\n\n            A conspirator must intend to further an\n          endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all\n          of the elements of a substantive criminal\n          offense, but it suffices that he adopt the goal\n          of furthering or facilitating the criminal\n          endeavor. He may do so in any number of ways\n          short of agreeing to undertake all of the acts\n          necessary for the crime's completion. One can be\n          a conspirator by agreeing to facilitate only some\n          of the acts leading to the substantive offense.\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f             The evidence established that Baltas actively participated\n\nin the preliminary discussions of the plan for the heroin transaction\n\nby encouraging Club member participation and suggesting ways in which\n\nto minimize the risk of exposure. He was well aware that the plan\n\nentailed the transportation of the heroin from one location to another.\n\nFurthermore, he played an active role in arranging for the provision of\n\narmed security for the deal.\n\n             Based on this evidence a reasonable jury was entitled to\n\nfind, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Baltas agreed to participate in\n\na conspiracy with the intent to distribute heroin. The fact that he\n\nmay not have been personally involved in selling or buying the drugs is\n\nof no importance, for it is well settled that “‘proof of direct\n\nparticipation in the sale of drugs is not required to convict in a drug\n\nconspiracy case.’” Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 193 (quoting Marrero-\n\nOrtiz, 160 F.3d at 773). What is important is that he was cognizant\n\nthat the heroin would be delivered from one place to another in the\n\ncourse of the distribution; such delivery alone constitutes\n\ndistribution for purposes of the drug statute. 21 U.S.C. § 802(11)\n\n(defining “distribute” to mean “deliver.”); see also United States v.\n\nOcampo-Guarin, 968 F.2d 1406, 1410 (1st Cir. 1992). Therefore, his\n\nconviction must be affirmed.\n\n                       D. Instructional Claim\n\n             Baltas also assigns error to the district court’s denial\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fof his request for an instruction on entrapment. Because Baltas did\n\nnot register a post-charge objection to the omission of an entrapment\n\ncharge, as mandated by Fed. R. Crim. P. 30,4 we review the district\n\ncourt’s decision for plain error. See United States v. Arthurs, 73\n\nF.3d 444, 448 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n              To be entitled to a defense on entrapment, a defendant\n\nmust produce “some evidence” of both improper government inducement and\n\nlack of criminal predisposition. See United States v. Gamache, 156\n\nF.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998). The defense is not available unless both\n\nelements exist. See United States v. Vega, 102 F.3d 1301, 1304 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n              Baltas challenges that Alvis improperly induced him to\n\njoin the conspiracy by exploiting his Diablo “pride and joy,” and by\n\n“playing up the financial troubles of the club, and the need for\n\nrevenue.” This is a far stretch. Improper inducement “goes beyond\n\nproviding an ordinary opportunity to commit a crime.” United States v.\n\nGendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). “An inducement consists of an ‘opportunity’\n\nplus something else—typically, excessive pressure by the government\n\n\n     4\n      Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure establishes\nthat “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or\nomission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury\nretires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which\nthat party objects and the grounds of the objection.” Fed. R. Crim. P.\n30.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fupon the defendant or the government’s taking advantage of an\n\nalternative, non-criminal type of motive.”        Id.\n\n             In this case, the evidence at trial established that\n\nBaltas joined the conspiracy on his own accord. Alvis merely presented\n\nthe Massachusetts Diablos with a plan to alleviate their strangling\n\nfinancial situation. Alvis may have been well regarded by his fellow\n\nDiablos and loyalty to the Club may have been strong among its members.\n\nYet, the existence of these circumstances, without a plea predicated\n\nupon them, is legally not enough to constitute improper inducement.\n\nSee United States v. Young, 78 F.3d 758, 761 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting\n\n“the proposition that friendship, without a plea predicated upon\n\nfriendship, suffices legally as inducement”). Contrary to his claim,\n\nthe record shows that it was Baltas — who quickly seized on Alvis’s\n\nidea — and who played upon the Diablos’s commitment to the Club to\n\npromote participation in the plan, by stating: “Well, you know what?\n\nThis is an outlaw motorcycle club. It’s not a 50/50 club, it’s not a\n\n70/70 club. . . . [Y]ou got to take your shot.”         Absent improper\n\ninducement, the district court was not obliged to instruct the jury on\n\nentrapment, and thus our inquiry should end here. Nevertheless, we\n\nnote that Baltas also failed to show at trial that he lacked the\n\nrequisite predisposition. Therefore, because we conclude that Baltas\n\nwas not entitled to have the jury consider his defense of entrapment,\n\nwe affirm the district court’s decision.\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f                            E. Sentencing\n\n                   1. Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n             Baltas claims that the district court erroneously declined\n\nto reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a). A defendant qualifies for this adjustment when he\n\n“clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.”\n\nId.   It is incumbent upon the defendant to prove entitlement to a\n\ndecrease in the offense level. See United States v. Rosario-Peralta,\n\n199 F.3d 552, 570 (1st Cir. 1999). We will not reverse a district\n\ncourt’s decision to withhold a reduction in the offense level unless\n\nclearly erroneous.     See id.\n\n             Although a defendant does not necessarily forfeit the\n\npossibility of obtaining a reduction for acceptance of responsibility\n\nby going to trial, doing so “greatly diminishe[s] his chances of\n\nreceiving [such an] adjustment.” Id. Only in “rare situations” a\n\ndefendant who elects to exercise his constitutional right to a trial\n\nwill qualify for a decrease in his offense level for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.5    As explained in Note 2 of the Comment to § 3E1.1:\n\n             This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant\n             who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial\n             by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is\n\n      5\n     We note that although “[t]he guideline admittedly imposes a tough\nchoice on a defendant . . ., it is not unconstitutional . . . .” See\nUnited States v. DeLeón Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 456 (1st Cir. 1995)\n(citations omitted); see also United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 199\nF.3d 552, 570-71 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                 -21-\n\f             convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses\n             remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not\n             automatically preclude a defendant from consideration\n             for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant\n             may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility\n             for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his\n             constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for\n             example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and\n             preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt\n             (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute\n             or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his\n             conduct).     In each such instance, however, a\n             determination that a defendant has accepted\n             responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial\n             statements and conduct.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt. note 2.\n\n             In the case at bar, the district court correctly\n\ndetermined that Baltas was not entitled to an offense level reduction\n\npursuant to § 3E1.1.   First, the record is barren of any pretrial\n\nstatements or conduct indicating that Baltas accepted responsibility.\n\nSecond, his situation does not fit any of the examples presented in the\n\nguideline commentary, and it is by no means “rare.”        He asserts\n\nnonetheless that he did not proceed to trial to contest factual guilt,\n\nbut to “to test the strength of the government’s case . . . .”6 In this\n\n     6\n      Baltas also contends that “[t]o the extent that he also wanted to\nargue entrapment, he was not thereby failing to take responsibility for\nhis actions.” Some circuits have held that a defendant’s going to\ntrial to allege entrapment does not preclude a reduction for acceptance\nof responsibility, see, e.g., United States v. Fleener, 900 F.2d 914,\n918 (6th Cir. 1990), while others have held that the defense of\nentrapment and U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 are incompatible, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Kirkland, 104 F.3d 1403, 1405 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Today, we\nhave no need to decide the issue because the record belies any claim\nthat Baltas “clearly demonstrate[d] acceptance of responsibility for\n                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                 -22-\n\fview, he suggests that the trial court’s dismissal of the RICO counts,\n\nand the jury’s not-guilty verdicts as to the firearms counts tilt the\n\nbalance in his favor. This argument is unavailing; Baltas could have\n\npleaded to the drug count and still gone to trial on the remaining\n\nones. See United States v. DeLeón Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 455 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (“[A]bsent unusual facts, we will . . . generally sustain a\n\ndistrict court that denies acceptance of responsibility to a defendant\n\nwho declined to plead guilty on the count or counts of which he was\n\nconvicted.”).   Moreover, from the beginning of the case, Baltas\n\ncontested his guilt.7    As his counsel stated in opening:\n\n             Now, I told you, before Mr. Baltas comes into this\n             courtroom he’s presumed innocent. As soon as the first\n             time that he was brought before a court and said you’ve\n             been indicted, how do you plead, and he pleaded not\n             guilty, he join[ed] that issue for trial.\n\n             At the sentencing hearing, the district court, in refusing\n\nto adjust Baltas’s offense level for acceptance of responsibility,\n\nexpressed:\n\n                As I understand it, I think Mr. Baltas takes the\n             position, which I don’t blame him for if that’s his\n             position, that he never participated in any kind of a\n             heroin conspiracy; that he never assisted the group of\n             people to carry out that conspiracy; that he never had\n\n     6\n     (...continued)\nhis offense.” U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.\n     7\n     Even his statements before this court confirms this. For\nexample, in his supplemental brief, Baltas asserts that he has\n“consistently maintained that he is innocent[, and] that [h]e never\nconceded that he was part of any conspiracy to possess heroin.”\n\n                                 -23-\n\f             any intent to associate with them, and so on, and that\n             just strikes me as not acceptance of responsibility.\n             I’m not saying he ought to, but what I am saying is\n             given his position, I have a very hard time\n             understanding how that equals acceptance of\n             responsibility.\n\n             Baltas also makes reference to his allocution, where he\n\ntold the trial judge: “[l]ike I said, I can accept my responsibility\n\nfor what I did.” When viewed in proper context, this statement loses\n\nalmost all significance. In berating the government for conducting the\n\nheroin sting operation, Baltas declared:\n\n                I made up my mind several years ago that I was done\n             with being a wiseguy. It didn’t work out apparently\n             because this guy [Alvis] got me tied up. I purposefully\n             — I want to do this with a little respect. I want to\n             thank you for what you did with my son, Shane. I want\n             to thank you for what you did with me with the bail\n             hearings, for my family, my kids. But it’s tough for me\n             to want to say I’m sorry because I’m not.\n\n                What I’ve done all my life I’ve paid for, I was man\n             enough to stand up and say, okay, I did it. Let me go\n             do my time. This I didn’t do, and I’m going to jail for\n             it.8\n\nThese are hardly words of contrition. Therefore, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court’s determination not to reduce Baltas’s offense level for\n\nacceptance of responsibility was not clearly erroneous, and thus affirm\n\nit.\n\n                       2. Role in the Offense\n\n      8\n      Moreover, in his objections to the presentence report, Baltas\nmaintained “that he never agreed to participate in the Government sham\ntransaction plan nor did he need to approve of it or assist in\nrecruiting persons to carry it out.”\n\n                                 -24-\n\f             Baltas further assigns error to the district court’s\n\nrefusal to decrease his offense level as a minor participant under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b). Like a denial of a reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, a district court’s refusal to adjust a defendant’s\n\noffense level due to his minor participation is reviewed for clear\n\nerror. See Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d at 571. However, because Baltas\n\nnever raised the issue below, “he must show that the district court’s\n\nfailure to adjust his sentence downward was ‘plain error.’” See United\n\nStates v. Daniel, 962 F.2d 100, 102-03 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             “[A]ny participant who is less culpable than most other\n\nparticipants, but whose role could not be described as minimal,” is\n\nconsidered a minor participant under the Guidelines.       U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.2(b) cmt. note 3. To be entitled to a sentence adjustment for\n\nminor participation, a defendant must shoulder the burden of proving\n\n“both that he is less culpable than most others involved in the offense\n\nof conviction and less culpable than most other miscreants convicted of\n\nsimilar crimes.” United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 149\n\n(1st Cir. 2000). This determination “is heavily dependent upon the\n\nfacts of a particular case.” U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b) (backg’d); see also\n\nUnited States v. Mangos, 134 F.3d 460, 466 (1st Cir. 1998) (“role-in-\n\nthe-offense determinations are fact-bound”). Moreover, “[w]e have\n\ndeclared, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that barring a\n\nmistake of law . . ., ‘battles over a defendant’s status . . . will\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\falmost always be won or lost in the district court.’” United States v.\n\nConley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998). Baltas did not fight his\n\nbattle in the district court, and he stands no better chance of victory\n\nin this one.\n\n             The record sufficiently demonstrates that Baltas was “a\n\nplayer rather than a . . . dabbler,” Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 149;\n\nhe (1) participated in the initial planning of the heroin-trafficking\n\nconspiracy, (2) knew the scope of the activity, and (3) took the\n\ninitiative of recruiting two Club members to provide security for the\n\ntransaction. Under these circumstances, the district court’s failure\n\nto adjust Baltas’s offense level for minor participation was no error,\n\nplain or otherwise.\n\n                       C. Downward Departure\n\n             Baltas argues that the district court erred in refusing to\n\ndepart downward on two grounds. First, he contends that the district\n\ncourt should have departed downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3,\n\nbecause his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness\n\nof his criminal history. Specifically, Baltas complains that three of\n\nthe five points which led to his criminal history III category resulted\n\nfrom a prior sentence which barely qualified as a such under §§\n\n4A1.1(a) and 4A1.2(e).\n\n             Guideline § 4A1.1(a) mandates a 3-point addition to a\n\ndefendant’s criminal history computation “for each prior sentence of\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fimprisonment exceeding one year and one month.” U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(a).\n\nUnder this section, “[a] sentence imposed more than fifteen years prior\n\nto the defendant’s commencement of the instant offense is not counted\n\nunless the defendant’s incarceration extended into this fifteen-year\n\nperiod.”   Id. cmt. note 1; see also id. § 4A1.2(e).\n\n             In the case at bar, Baltas objected to the 3-point\n\ncomputation under § 4A1.1(a) because the prior sentence in question was\n\nimposed more than 15 years before his offense of conviction. However,\n\nthe district court overruled this objection because it found that\n\nBaltas was in prison within the guideline’s 15-year period. Because\n\nBaltas does not claim that the district court committed legal error in\n\nmaking this determination — and indeed he could not — we lack\n\njurisdiction to review his claim. See Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 204\n\n(“the defendant may not appeal from a sentence within the guideline\n\nrange if there was no legal error and the only claim is that the\n\ndistrict court acted unreasonably in declining to depart”) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Saldaña, 109 F.3d 100, 102 (1st Cir. 1997)); see also\n\nUnited States v. Tucker, 892 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n             Second, Baltas alleges that the district court should have\n\ndeparted downward under U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0.       In essence, Baltas’s\n\ncontention is that the fact that his conviction stemmed from the\n\ngovernment’s reverse sting operation takes his case outside the\n\n“heartland” of typical cases contemplated by the Guidelines. The\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fdistrict court did not deny Baltas’s request because it thought it\n\nlacked the authority to depart, but because it declined to exercise its\n\ndiscretion to do so. Its decision, therefore, is not subject to review\n\nby this court.      See Portela, 167 F.3d at 708.\n\n                                    D. Apprendi\n\n              After    oral     argument         was     held,   a     letter    was\n\ntransmitted to the court under Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) calling our\n\nattention to the recent Supreme Court decision in Apprendi v.\n\nNew Jersey, — U.S. — (2000), 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000).                    We granted\n\nboth Baltas and the government time to submit supplementary\n\nmemoranda addressing the possible relevance of Apprendi and,\n\nassuming     that    Apprendi       applies,      addressing     the     issue    of\n\nprejudice.     Such memoranda having been filed, the matter is\n\nproperly submitted for disposition.\n\n              Invoking the rule set forth in Apprendi, where the\n\nSupreme    Court    held   as   a    matter      of    constitutional    law    that\n\n“[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\n\nincreases    the    penalty     for    a       crime    beyond   the    prescribed\n\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt,”       120 S. Ct. at 2362-63, Baltas now seeks to\n\nhave his sentence vacated.            Because Baltas did not raise this\n\nissue below, we review for plain error.                   See United States v.\n\nMojica-Báez, 229 F.3d 292, 307 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\f              The issue presented is whether the district court’s\n\nfinding of drug quantity under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1), which was\n\nmade at the sentencing under a preponderance-of-the-evidence\n\nstandard, was error under Apprendi.              In support of his claim of\n\nerror,   Baltas    argues:   (1)    that    we    should     read   Apprendi    as\n\napplying   where    any   fact     (other   than      the    fact   of   a   prior\n\nconviction)    exposes    the    defendant       to   an    increased    penalty,\n\ninstead of as applying only in situations where the prescribed\n\nsentence exceeds the statutory maximum, and that (2) assuming\n\nApprendi is applicable, the district court’s finding constitutes\n\nplain error.\n\n              Baltas was convicted of conspiracy to possess with\n\nintention to distribute and to distribute heroin, in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 846.       The amount of heroin attributed to him was\n\nneither submitted to the jury, nor found by the jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.      Instead, it was determined by the district\n\ncourt at the sentencing hearing under a preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard.        Under this standard, the district court\n\ndetermined that the transaction involved at least one kilogram\n\nof heroin.     This finding mandated a base offense level of 34.\n\nWith a criminal history category of III, Baltas’s Guideline\n\nrange was of 188 to 235 months’ imprisonment, which as we\n\nexplain below is within the statutory maximum.\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f             Under the pertinent statutory scheme, Section 846\n\nprovides that the penalty for an attempt or conspiracy to commit\n\na drug trafficking offense shall be the same as the penalty for\n\nthe offense that was the object of the attempt or conspiracy. 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846.          The underlying offense is set out in section\n\n841(a)(1), which makes it unlawful to “manufacture, distribute,\n\nor dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute,\n\nor dispense, a controlled substance.”                21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).\n\nSection 841(b), in turn, establishes the penalties applicable to\n\na    violation    of     section      841(a)(1).      Section    841(b)(1)(C)\n\nauthorizes a term of imprisonment for a schedule I narcotic,\n\nsuch as heroin, without reference to drug quantity, of “not more\n\nthan 20 years.”        21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). Using this framework,\n\nthe district court sentenced Baltas to a term of 188 months of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n             Notwithstanding his sentence at the low end of the\n\npenalty range, Baltas argues that Apprendi must not be construed\n\nso narrowly; and should apply in situations where any fact\n\n(other   than    the     fact    of   a    prior   conviction)   exposes   the\n\ndefendant to an increased penalty, instead of as applying only\n\nin   situations        where    the   prescribed     sentence    exceeds   the\n\nstatutory maximum. However, as held by the Eighth Circuit,\n\n“[t]his argument goes too far, and is not supported by the\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fSupreme Court’s opinion in Apprendi.”               United States v. Aguayo-\n\nDelgado, 220 F.3d 926, 933 (8th Cir. 2000).                         The rule in\n\nApprendi only applies in situations where the judge-made factual\n\ndetermination       increases     the      maximum       sentence   beyond    the\n\nstatutory maximum, and not in situations where the Defendant’s\n\npotential exposure is increased within the statutory range.                   Id.\n\n Therefore,     if    the    judge-made        factual    determination    merely\n\nnarrows   the      judge’s     discretion        within    the   range    already\n\nauthorized    by     the    offense   of   conviction,       then   no   Apprendi\n\nviolation occurs.          Id. at 934-35.\n\n              Based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Apprendi,\n\nwe hold that no constitutional error occurs when the district\n\ncourt sentences the defendant within the statutory maximum,\n\nregardless that drug quantity was never determined by the jury\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.            Therefore, Baltas’s sentence of 188\n\nmonths, below the twenty year maximum provided by 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(C), does not constitute an error under Apprendi.                   This\n\ndecision is consistent with those of our sister circuits which\n\nhave had the opportunity to address challenges similar to the\n\none presented by Baltas.          See, e.g., United States v. Meshack,\n\n225 F.3d 556, 576 (5th Cir. 2000); Aguayo-Delgado, 220 F.3d at\n\n933; United States v. Gerrow, 2000 WL 1675594, at *2 (11th Cir.\n\nNov. 8, 2000); United States v. Angle, 230 F.3d 113, 123 (4th\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fCir. 2000); United States v. Chavez, 230 F.3d 1089, 1091 (8th\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n              Baltas goes on to explain in his brief, that assuming\n\nan Apprendi violation occurred below, the error was plain.\n\nHowever,    since   we   find   no   error   in   the   district   court’s\n\nsentencing, plain or otherwise, we need not go any further.\n\n                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction and\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\f",

The district court sentenced him to 188 months in prison, followed by 5 years of supervised release. Baltas now challenges his conviction and sentence alleging a potpourri of pretrial, trial, and sentencing issues. Because we conclude that none of Baltas's arguments have merit, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted Baltas and twelve other individuals for various crimes arising out of their involvement in the Connecticut and Massachusetts chapters of the Diablos Motorcycle Club (hereinafter the \"Diablos,\" or the \"Club\"). Particularly, Baltas was charged, either alone or in combination with other defendants, with conspiracy to conduct and actually conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, respectively, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(d) (count 1, \"RICO conspiracy\") and 1962(c) (count 2, \"substantive RICO\"); conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute heroin, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (count 32); and possession and interstate transportation of firearms as a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (counts 40 and 41). The indictment also sought forfeiture of certain property belonging to Baltas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Baltas unsuccessfully moved to sever and to suppress certain evidence relevant to his count of conviction. At the end of the government's case, he moved for judgment of acquittal and to strike certain evidence relating to the RICO counts. The district court granted his motion for acquittal as to these counts, denying it as to the remaining portions of the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In light of this ruling, the court then granted Baltas's motion to strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas also requested an instruction on the defense of entrapment, which the district court denied. During the jury charge, Baltas did not object to the omission of an entrapment instruction. Finally, Baltas leveled various challenges to his presentence report, and moved for downward departure without success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Baltas assigns error to the district court's denials of his pretrial, trial and sentencing requests. We sketch the facts contained in the record in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. See United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 219 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 2000). We supplement our account as it becomes necessary to the discussion of Baltas's particular claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Diablos originated in San Bernardino, California in the 1960's, and then expanded to other areas of the country. At the times relevant to this appeal, the Diablos were a national organization with chapters in California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. They were governed by a written constitution, which conditioned membership, inter alia, upon being at least 21 years of age, Caucasian, and owning a firearm and a Harley-Davidson of a particular size. Membership was by invitation only, and neither women nor African-Americans were allowed. Members first had to serve some time as \"prospects,\" a role similar to that of a pledge in a fraternity, before being eligible for full membership. The Diablos also had a governing structure which included both national and chapter officers. Baltas was one of the Club's founders and its national president.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the prosecution's primary witnesses at trial was William Alvis (hereinafter \"Alvis\"). Before becoming a Diablo, Alvis had been a member of another motorcycle club, the Barbarians, where he became familiarized with the biker culture and language. While affiliated with the Barbarians, Alvis was charged with the commission of several crimes not related to the instant indictment, and eventually began cooperating with government authorities. He infiltrated the Diablos at the behest of the FBI. One law enforcement concern with the Diablos was three unsolved motorcycle-club related murders, in which it was suspected that members of the Diablos had been involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Alvis stated that one important characteristic of the Club was the sense of brotherhood among its members. Alvis's trust and confidence within the Diablos, together with his familiarity with the biker culture, allowed him to become a prospect and later a full-fledged member. He developed close relationships with several members of the Club, and ultimately became its vice president. Alvis was thus the FBI's \"eyes and ears inside of the Diablos organization.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of his status within the Diablos, Alvis was able to gather for the FBI valuable information about the Club's structure and day-to-day operations. He was also able to introduce several undercover agents into the Club, and, with their help, orchestrate a number of criminal schemes involving the Diablos. One of these schemes concerned a reverse-sting heroin deal. The government's evidence of the circumstances surrounding this scheme consisted mainly of Alvis's trial testimony, aided by evidence derived from the interception of certain communications made pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510 et seq. (hereinafter \"Title III\"). What follows is a summary of this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of July of 1995, the Club was facing financial difficulties. Alvis, who at that time was treasurer of the Massachusetts chapter, held a meeting where he informed chapter members of the situation and told them that they would probably be evicted from the clubhouse because the rent was in arrears. As a way of generating money for the chapter, Alvis suggested that some members assist him in a drug deal. Alvis specifically told the Diablos that he needed them to \"[r]un security for [a] transportation of heroin.\" The plan consisted in picking up the drugs at one point and delivering them at another. He also explained that each participant would be paid $500, which money would be contributed to the chapter's treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas, who happened to be present at the meeting, agreed to the idea. He voiced his support by reminding members of their commitment to the Club, and even proposed a few ideas for carrying out the plan without attracting attention upon the Diablos. Moreover, Baltas directed Alvis to \"[t]ake the guys . . . best suited for the job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Alvis traveled to Connecticut for a chapter meeting, where he met Baltas at the chapter's clubhouse. Baltas asked Alvis how many members had volunteered to participate in the deal, and offered to recruit additional help upon learning that only two had come forward. As promised, Baltas talked to two other members who later got in contact with Alvis and eventually participated in the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deal finally took place on August 7, 1995, and Baltas and Alvis met in Connecticut the following day. Alvis gave Baltas $250.00 for his recruiting efforts. Baltas did not directly participate in the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Suppression</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained through electronic surveillance. Below, Baltas sought suppression of the intercepted communications alleging: (1) that the issuance of the warrant was not grounded on probable cause; (2) that the accompanying affidavit failed to show the unlikely success of alternative investigative procedures; (3) that in executing the warrant, the government failed to minimize the interceptions; (4) that the interceptions went beyond the scope of the warrant; and (5) that the warrant failed to specify the types of communications to be intercepted. Upon referral by the district court, the magistrate judge, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, issued a report and recommendation that the motion be denied. Adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, the district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Baltas renews his attack on the government's minimization procedures. Specifically, Baltas challenges that the intercepting agents failed to minimize the interception of communications from approximately 9:04 p.m. until 10:09 p.m., on April 21, 1995. He further alleges that \"during the spot checks after 10:09 p.m., the agents obviously listened to more of the conversations than was necessary to have been able to know that they should have stopped listening.\" Focusing on these alleged violations, Baltas protests that all the evidence obtained through electronic surveillance should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's denial of Baltas's motion for substantially the reasons cogently set forth in the magistrate judge's report and recommendation adopted by the district court. \"[W]hen a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\" United States v. Velez Carrero, 140 F.3d 327, 329 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Lawton v. State Mutual Life Assurance Co. of America, 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996)). We only hesitate to add two comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the evidence obtained by the April 21 interception was not introduced at trial in relation to Baltas's count of conviction, to wit: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin. In fact, none of the communications intercepted on April 21 were introduced at trial. Thus, any possible error in adequately minimizing such interception was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, total suppression of electronic surveillance evidence is not appropriate unless the moving party shows that there was a \"taint upon the investigation as a whole sufficient to warrant [such] sweeping relief . . . .\" United States v. Charles, 213 F.3d 10, 23 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1307 (1st Cir. 1987)). That is, errors in minimizing one particular interception within the context of a lengthy and complex investigation, such as the one involved in this case, do not automatically warrant the suppression of all the evidence obtained through electronic surveillance. Even assuming that the government failed to minimize the April 21 interception, total suppression would not follow, because Baltas has not demonstrated that the entire surveillance was tainted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas next argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for severance. He also assigns fault to the district court's refusal to hold a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of coconspirator statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas was originally charged in a superseding indictment with a controlled substances law violation. Although the indictment also included various RICO charges, Baltas was not targeted in any of them. Accordingly, he moved to sever the RICO from the non-RICO counts, and his trial from those of his co-defendants. The magistrate judge denied the motion without prejudice. Following the filing of the second superseding indictment, which charged Baltas with RICO conspiracy and substantive RICO, he renewed his motion before the district court, but to no avail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, joinder of counts and defendants in the second superseding indictment was proper. Of the 28 racketeering acts pertinent to the RICO conspiracy alleged in count 1, two implicated Baltas, predicate acts 3 (kidnapping) and 23 (conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin). These acts were also charged as substantive RICO violations. Furthermore, act 23 was separately charged as an offense in count 32, Baltas's count of conviction. Thus, the counts were properly joined under Rule 8(a) as charging \"two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"offenses committed pursuant to the same (charged) racketeering enterprise and conspiracy may be joined in a single indictment\"). The defendants were also properly joined. See United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 245 (1st Cir.) (\"So long as there is a responsible basis for the averments, charging an omnibus RICO conspiracy normally supplies the glue necessary to bond multiple defendants together in a single proceeding where all are accused of participating in the conspiracy.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas insists nonetheless that he was unduly prejudiced by the district court's denial of his motion for severance. Under Rule 14, a district court may order separate trials of counts or defendants \"[i]f it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment. . . or by such joinder for trial together . . . .\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 14. In making this determination, the district court enjoys wide latitude. SeeUnited States v. Rogers, 121 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997). We review a district court's refusal to sever for \"manifest abuse of discretion,\" United States v. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1999), reversing only upon a \"strong showing of evident prejudice,\" United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1993), that joinder \"deprived defendant of a fair trial, resulting in a miscarriage of justice,\" United States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 219 (1st Cir. 1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Because Baltas has failed to shoulder this burden, we affirm the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas maintains that he was prejudiced because the jury was allowed to hear evidence that would have been irrelevant or inadmissible against him in a separate trial on the drug and firearms counts. In trying to prove his point, Baltas cursorily refers to the evidence relating to the predicate acts upon which the RICO charges rested, arguing that such evidence would not have been admissible in a trial without the RICO charges. He further contends that a separate trial would have inoculated the jury's verdict from being tainted by spillover prejudice. None of these arguments have merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, \"[t]his court's rule is that those 'who are indicted together should be tried together,' and the district court's joinder in this case appropriately followed that presumption.\" DeLeon, 187 F.3d at 63 (quoting O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Baltas's allegations of prejudice are rather conclusory, and thus do not suffice to overcome the presumption in favor of joinder. See United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1204 (1st Cir. 1994) (conclusory allegations held insufficient to show requisite prejudice). \"There is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together -- but such 'garden variety' prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice.\" Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246. Moreover, we have consistently reiterated our reluctance to second-guess a lower court's refusal to sever \"[e]ven where large amounts of testimony are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement in an overall agreement is far less than the involvement of others . . . .\" Id. at 246; see also United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67 F.3d 1002, 1007 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1313 (1st Cir. 1994); O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the district court took appropriate measures to prevent potential spillover prejudice by instructing the jury, both during the preliminary and closing charges, to consider the evidence separately as to each count of the indictment, and to determine guilt on an individual basis. Moreover, as it is more particularly discussed infra, the court also gave limiting instructions during trial as to the admissibility of certain potentially prejudicial evidence pertaining to Baltas. Baltas's acquittal on the firearms charges (counts 40 and 41) demonstrates that the jury was able to follow these instructions. SeeDeLeon, 187 F.3d at 64 (considering a discriminating verdict as evidence that the jury was capable of following the district judge's instructions); United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d 499, 504 (1st Cir. 1996) (same); Neal, 36 F.3d at 1205 (same); Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (same); see also United States v. Tracy, 989 F.2d 1279, 1284 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The jury's selectivity in its verdict affords 'reasonably good assurance' that spillover prejudice did not result from joinder of offenses.\") (quoting United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas alternatively argues that even if severance was not warranted, the district court should have mitigated spillover prejudice by holding a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of coconspirator hearsay statements pursuant to United States v. James, 590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir.) (en banc). During the proceeding below, Baltas made various requests for a ruling on the admissibility of coconspirator statements relating to the RICO charges under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). The court denied the requests and provisionally allowed the evidence, declining to make a final admissibility determination, in accordance with United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a consequence of its ruling on Baltas's Rule 29 motion, the district court struck the evidence at issue either in its entirety, or for all but credibility purposes. Baltas argues that because the trial court had ultimately to instruct the jury to either compartmentalize or totally disregard this evidence, he was unfairly prejudiced by the court's refusal to conduct a pretrial James hearing. According to him, if the trial court had made its evidentiary ruling before trial, thereby preventing the evidence from reaching the jury, his trial \"would not have been contaminated by such a large amount of harmful inadmissible evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit in James held that \"[t]he district court should, whenever reasonably practicable, require the showing of a conspiracy and of the connection of the defendant with it before admitting declarations of a coconspirator.\" 590 F.2d at 582. The circuit court recognized, however, that if the district court \"determines it is not reasonably practical to require a showing to be made before admitting the evidence, [it] may admit the statement subject to being connected up.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Id. All in all, \"[t]his is a matter committed to the broad discretion of the trial court.\" United States v. Fragoso, 978 F.2d 896, 900 (5th Cir. 1992) (approving deferral of determination to admit the statement until the close of the government's case); see also United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, 11 F.3d 1218, 1224 (5th Cir. 1994) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The usual course of action in this circuit, however, is to admit the hearsay evidence provisionally, \"subject to [a] final Petrozziello determination, which should be made 'at the close of all the evidence' and 'out of the hearing of the jury.'\" United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 702 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir. 1980)). In this case, the district court appropriately determined to admit the statements provisionally, even though it had to subsequently strike some of them, in whole or in part, due to its ruling on Baltas's Rule 29 motion. In so doing, the court took the necessary precautions to minimize spillover prejudice by giving appropriate cautionary instructions to the jury. Because Baltas has not shown that the district court's determination to admit the evidence provisionally was clearly erroneous, and since we have already determined that the selective verdict demonstrates that the jury was able to follow the court's instructions, we sustain the trial court's determination. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 703 (\"We will sustain the trial court's determination [regarding admission of coconspirator statements unless it is clearly erroneous.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas further presses the claim that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on count 32, insisting that the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. We review these claims de novo, see United States v. Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d 163, 193 (1st Cir. 2000), unitarily applying the familiar sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard, see United States v. Hernandez, 218 F.3d 58, 64 n.4 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"'[C]hallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and to the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal raise a single issue'\" and thus we apply the traditional sufficiency of the evidence standard to these claims.\") (quoting United States v. Morillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this standard, we review all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 772 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1996). It is immaterial that a possible rendition of the record could support a not guilty verdict; it is enough that a rational trier of fact could have construed the evidence to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Hernandez, 218 F.3d at 64; Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d at 26-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The insufficiency of the evidence in this case,\" Baltas asserts, \"turns on one specific point,\" to wit: that there was no evidence that he conspired to possess heroin with intent to distribute and to distribute it. He protests that \"[t]he government's evidence, at best, proved that [he] joined a conspiracy to aid and abet a drug deal, but not to actually deal in drugs.\" According to Baltas, the evidence failed to show that he was involved in the selling or buying of the drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"'To prove a drug conspiracy charge under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, the government is obliged to show that a conspiracy existed and that a particular defendant agreed to participate in it, intending to commit the underlying substantive offense.'\" Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 191 (quoting United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993)). Thus, \"the government must show two kinds of intent: 'intent to agree and intent to commit the substantive offense.'\" Hernandez, 218 F.3d at 65 (quoting United States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st Cir. 1990)). It need not show, however, \"that a given defendant took part in all aspects of the conspiracy.\" Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1173. As the Supreme Court in Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (1997) explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of a substantive criminal offense, but it suffices that he adopt the goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor. He may do so in any number of ways short of agreeing to undertake all of the acts necessary for the crime's completion. One can be a conspirator by agreeing to facilitate only some of the acts leading to the substantive offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence established that Baltas actively participated in the preliminary discussions of the plan for the heroin transaction by encouraging Club member participation and suggesting ways in which to minimize the risk of exposure. He was well aware that the plan entailed the transportation of the heroin from one location to another. Furthermore, he played an active role in arranging for the provision of armed security for the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence a reasonable jury was entitled to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Baltas agreed to participate in a conspiracy with the intent to distribute heroin. The fact that he may not have been personally involved in selling or buying the drugs is of no importance, for it is well settled that \"'proof of direct participation in the sale of drugs is not required to convict in a drug conspiracy case.'\" Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 193 (quoting Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d at 773). What is important is that he was cognizant that the heroin would be delivered from one place to another in the course of the distribution; such delivery alone constitutes distribution for purposes of the drug statute. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(11) (defining \"distribute\" to mean \"deliver.\"); see also United States v. Ocampo-Guarin, 968 F.2d 1406, 1410 (1st Cir. 1992). Therefore, his conviction must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Instructional Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas also assigns error to the district court's denial of his request for an instruction on entrapment. Because Baltas did not register a post-charge objection to the omission of an entrapment charge, as mandated by Fed. R. Crim. P. 30,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we review the district court's decision for plain error. See United States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d 444, 448 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be entitled to a defense on entrapment, a defendant must produce \"some evidence\" of both improper government inducement and lack of criminal predisposition. See United States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1998). The defense is not available unless both elements exist. See United States v. Vega, 102 F.3d 1301, 1304 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas challenges that Alvis improperly induced him to join the conspiracy by exploiting his Diablo \"pride and joy,\" and by \"playing up the financial troubles of the club, and the need for revenue.\" This is a far stretch. Improper inducement \"goes beyond providing an ordinary opportunity to commit a crime.\" United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \"An inducement consists of an 'opportunity' plus something else--typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the evidence at trial established that Baltas joined the conspiracy on his own accord. Alvis merely presented the Massachusetts Diablos with a plan to alleviate their strangling financial situation. Alvis may have been well regarded by his fellow Diablos and loyalty to the Club may have been strong among its members. Yet, the existence of these circumstances, without a plea predicated upon them, is legally not enough to constitute improper inducement. See United States v. Young, 78 F.3d 758, 761 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting \"the proposition that friendship, without a plea predicated upon friendship, suffices legally as inducement\"). Contrary to his claim, the record shows that it was Baltas -- who quickly seized on Alvis's idea -- and who played upon the Diablos's commitment to the Club to promote participation in the plan, by stating: \"Well, you know what? This is an outlaw motorcycle club. It's not a 50/50 club, it's not a 70/70 club. . . . [Y]ou got to take your shot.\" Absent improper inducement, the district court was not obliged to instruct the jury on entrapment, and thus our inquiry should end here. Nevertheless, we note that Baltas also failed to show at trial that he lacked the requisite predisposition. Therefore, because we conclude that Baltas was not entitled to have the jury consider his defense of entrapment, we affirm the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Sentencing</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas claims that the district court erroneously declined to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a). A defendant qualifies for this adjustment when he \"clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" Id. It is incumbent upon the defendant to prove entitlement to a decrease in the offense level. See United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d 552, 570 (1st Cir. 1999). We will not reverse a district court's decision to withhold a reduction in the offense level unless clearly erroneous. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a defendant does not necessarily forfeit the possibility of obtaining a reduction for acceptance of responsibility by going to trial, doing so \"greatly diminishe[s] his chances of receiving [such an] adjustment.\" Id. Only in \"rare situations\" a defendant who elects to exercise his constitutional right to a trial will qualify for a decrease in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As explained in Note 2 of the Comment to &#167; 3E1.1:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmt. note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the district court correctly determined that Baltas was not entitled to an offense level reduction pursuant to &#167; 3E1.1. First, the record is barren of any pretrial statements or conduct indicating that Baltas accepted responsibility. Second, his situation does not fit any of the examples presented in the guideline commentary, and it is by no means \"rare.\" He asserts nonetheless that he did not proceed to trial to contest factual guilt, but to \"to test the strength of the government's case . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In this view, he suggests that the trial court's dismissal of the RICO counts, and the jury's not-guilty verdicts as to the firearms counts tilt the balance in his favor. This argument is unavailing; Baltas could have pleaded to the drug count and still gone to trial on the remaining ones. See United States v. DeLeon Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 455 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[A]bsent unusual facts, we will . . . generally sustain a district court that denies acceptance of responsibility to a defendant who declined to plead guilty on the count or counts of which he was convicted.\"). Moreover, from the beginning of the case, Baltas contested his guilt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As his counsel stated in opening:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, I told you, before Mr. Baltas comes into this courtroom he's presumed innocent. As soon as the first time that he was brought before a court and said you've been indicted, how do you plead, and he pleaded not guilty, he join[ed] that issue for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court, in refusing to adjust Baltas's offense level for acceptance of responsibility, expressed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I understand it, I think Mr. Baltas takes the position, which I don't blame him for if that's his position, that he never participated in any kind of a heroin conspiracy; that he never assisted the group of people to carry out that conspiracy; that he never had any intent to associate with them, and so on, and that just strikes me as not acceptance of responsibility. I'm not saying he ought to, but what I am saying is given his position, I have a very hard time understanding how that equals acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas also makes reference to his allocution, where he told the trial judge: \"[l]ike I said, I can accept my responsibility for what I did.\" When viewed in proper context, this statement loses almost all significance. In berating the government for conducting the heroin sting operation, Baltas declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I made up my mind several years ago that I was done with being a wiseguy. It didn't work out apparently because this guy [Alvis] got me tied up. I purposefully -- I want to do this with a little respect. I want to thank you for what you did with my son, Shane. I want to thank you for what you did with me with the bail hearings, for my family, my kids. But it's tough for me to want to say I'm sorry because I'm not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What I've done all my life I've paid for, I was man enough to stand up and say, okay, I did it. Let me go do my time. This I didn't do, and I'm going to jail for it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are hardly words of contrition. Therefore, we conclude that the district court's determination not to reduce Baltas's offense level for acceptance of responsibility was not clearly erroneous, and thus affirm it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas further assigns error to the district court's refusal to decrease his offense level as a minor participant under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b). Like a denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, a district court's refusal to adjust a defendant's offense level due to his minor participation is reviewed for clear error. See Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d at 571. However, because Baltas never raised the issue below, \"he must show that the district court's failure to adjust his sentence downward was 'plain error.'\" See United States v. Daniel, 962 F.2d 100, 102-03 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A]ny participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal,\" is considered a minor participant under the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b) cmt. note 3. To be entitled to a sentence adjustment for minor participation, a defendant must shoulder the burden of proving \"both that he is less culpable than most others involved in the offense of conviction and less culpable than most other miscreants convicted of similar crimes.\" United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 149 (1st Cir. 2000). This determination \"is heavily dependent upon the facts of a particular case.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b) (backg'd); see alsoUnited States v. Mangos, 134 F.3d 460, 466 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"role-in-the-offense determinations are fact-bound\"). Moreover, \"[w]e have declared, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that barring a mistake of law . . ., 'battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the district court.'\" United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998). Baltas did not fight his battle in the district court, and he stands no better chance of victory in this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record sufficiently demonstrates that Baltas was \"a player rather than a . . . dabbler,\" Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 149; he (1) participated in the initial planning of the heroin-trafficking conspiracy, (2) knew the scope of the activity, and (3) took the initiative of recruiting two Club members to provide security for the transaction. Under these circumstances, the district court's failure to adjust Baltas's offense level for minor participation was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Downward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas argues that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward on two grounds. First, he contends that the district court should have departed downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, because his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Specifically, Baltas complains that three of the five points which led to his criminal history III category resulted from a prior sentence which barely qualified as a such under &#167;&#167; 4A1.1(a) and 4A1.2(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guideline &#167; 4A1.1(a) mandates a 3-point addition to a defendant's criminal history computation \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(a). Under this section, \"[a] sentence imposed more than fifteen years prior to the defendant's commencement of the instant offense is not counted unless the defendant's incarceration extended into this fifteen-year period.\" Id. cmt. note 1; see also id. &#167; 4A1.2(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, Baltas objected to the 3-point computation under &#167; 4A1.1(a) because the prior sentence in question was imposed more than 15 years before his offense of conviction. However, the district court overruled this objection because it found that Baltas was in prison within the guideline's 15-year period. Because Baltas does not claim that the district court committed legal error in making this determination -- and indeed he could not -- we lack jurisdiction to review his claim. See Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 204 (\"the defendant may not appeal from a sentence within the guideline range if there was no legal error and the only claim is that the district court acted unreasonably in declining to depart\") (quoting United States v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100, 102 (1st Cir. 1997)); see also United States v. Tucker, 892 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Baltas alleges that the district court should have departed downward under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.0. In essence, Baltas's contention is that the fact that his conviction stemmed from the government's reverse sting operation takes his case outside the \"heartland\" of typical cases contemplated by the Guidelines. The district court did not deny Baltas's request because it thought it lacked the authority to depart, but because it declined to exercise its discretion to do so. Its decision, therefore, is not subject to review by this court. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Apprendi</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After oral argument was held, a letter was transmitted to the court under Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) calling our attention to the recent Supreme Court decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, -- U.S. -- (2000), 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000). We granted both Baltas and the government time to submit supplementary memoranda addressing the possible relevance of Apprendi and, assuming that Apprendi applies, addressing the issue of prejudice. Such memoranda having been filed, the matter is properly submitted for disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking the rule set forth in Apprendi, where the Supreme Court held as a matter of constitutional law that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\" 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63, Baltas now seeks to have his sentence vacated. Because Baltas did not raise this issue below, we review for plain error. See United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229 F.3d 292, 307 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue presented is whether the district court's finding of drug quantity under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1), which was made at the sentencing under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, was error under Apprendi. In support of his claim of error, Baltas argues: (1) that we should read Apprendi as applying where any fact (other than the fact of a prior conviction) exposes the defendant to an increased penalty, instead of as applying only in situations where the prescribed sentence exceeds the statutory maximum, and that (2) assuming Apprendi is applicable, the district court's finding constitutes plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intention to distribute and to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. The amount of heroin attributed to him was neither submitted to the jury, nor found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, it was determined by the district court at the sentencing hearing under a preponderance of the evidence standard. Under this standard, the district court determined that the transaction involved at least one kilogram of heroin. This finding mandated a base offense level of 34. With a criminal history category of III, Baltas's Guideline range was of 188 to 235 months' imprisonment, which as we explain below is within the statutory maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the pertinent statutory scheme, Section 846 provides that the penalty for an attempt or conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking offense shall be the same as the penalty for the offense that was the object of the attempt or conspiracy. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. The underlying offense is set out in section 841(a)(1), which makes it unlawful to \"manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Section 841(b), in turn, establishes the penalties applicable to a violation of section 841(a)(1). Section 841(b)(1)(C) authorizes a term of imprisonment for a schedule I narcotic, such as heroin, without reference to drug quantity, of \"not more than 20 years.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). Using this framework, the district court sentenced Baltas to a term of 188 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding his sentence at the low end of the penalty range, Baltas argues that Apprendi must not be construed so narrowly; and should apply in situations where any fact (other than the fact of a prior conviction) exposes the defendant to an increased penalty, instead of as applying only in situations where the prescribed sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. However, as held by the Eighth Circuit, \"[t]his argument goes too far, and is not supported by the Supreme Court's opinion in Apprendi.\" United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, 220 F.3d 926, 933 (8th Cir. 2000). The rule in Apprendi only applies in situations where the judge-made factual determination increases the maximum sentence beyond the statutory maximum, and not in situations where the Defendant's potential exposure is increased within the statutory range. Id. Therefore, if the judge-made factual determination merely narrows the judge's discretion within the range already authorized by the offense of conviction, then no Apprendi violation occurs. Id. at 934-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi, we hold that no constitutional error occurs when the district court sentences the defendant within the statutory maximum, regardless that drug quantity was never determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, Baltas's sentence of 188 months, below the twenty year maximum provided by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), does not constitute an error under Apprendi. This decision is consistent with those of our sister circuits which have had the opportunity to address challenges similar to the one presented by Baltas. See, e.g., United States v. Meshack, 225 F.3d 556, 576 (5th Cir. 2000); Aguayo-Delgado, 220 F.3d at 933; United States v. Gerrow, 232 F.3d 831, 834-35 (11th Cir. 2000); United States v. Angle, 230 F.3d 113, 123 (4th Cir. 2000); United States v. Chavez, 230 F.3d 1089, 1091 (8th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas goes on to explain in his brief, that assuming an Apprendi violation occurred below, the error was plain. However, since we find no error in the district court's sentencing, plain or otherwise, we need not go any further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

Fleener, 900 F.2d 914, 918 (6th Cir. 1990), while others have held that the defense of entrapment and U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 are incompatible, see, e.g., United States v. Kirkland, 104 F.3d 1403, 1405 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Today, we have no need to decide the issue because the record belies any claim that Baltas \"clearly demonstrate[d] acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Even his statements before this court confirms this.

The district court sentenced him to 188 months in prison, followed by 5 years of supervised release. Baltas now challenges his conviction and sentence alleging a potpourri of pretrial, trial, and sentencing issues. Because we conclude that none of Baltas's arguments have merit, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted Baltas and twelve other individuals for various crimes arising out of their involvement in the Connecticut and Massachusetts chapters of the Diablos Motorcycle Club (hereinafter the \"Diablos,\" or the \"Club\"). Particularly, Baltas was charged, either alone or in combination with other defendants, with conspiracy to conduct and actually conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, respectively, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(d) (count 1, \"RICO conspiracy\") and 1962(c) (count 2, \"substantive RICO\"); conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute heroin, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 (count 32); and possession and interstate transportation of firearms as a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (counts 40 and 41). The indictment also sought forfeiture of certain property belonging to Baltas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, Baltas unsuccessfully moved to sever and to suppress certain evidence relevant to his count of conviction. At the end of the government's case, he moved for judgment of acquittal and to strike certain evidence relating to the RICO counts. The district court granted his motion for acquittal as to these counts, denying it as to the remaining portions of the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In light of this ruling, the court then granted Baltas's motion to strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas also requested an instruction on the defense of entrapment, which the district court denied. During the jury charge, Baltas did not object to the omission of an entrapment instruction. Finally, Baltas leveled various challenges to his presentence report, and moved for downward departure without success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Baltas assigns error to the district court's denials of his pretrial, trial and sentencing requests. We sketch the facts contained in the record in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. See United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199008\"><a href=\"/opinion/199008/united-states-v-gonzales-vasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir. 2000). We supplement our account as it becomes necessary to the discussion of Baltas's particular claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Diablos originated in San Bernardino, California in the 1960's, and then expanded to other areas of the country. At the times relevant to this appeal, the Diablos were a national organization with chapters in California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. They were governed by a written constitution, which conditioned membership, inter alia, upon being at least 21 years of age, Caucasian, and owning a firearm and a Harley-Davidson of a particular size. Membership was by invitation only, and neither women nor African-Americans were allowed. Members first had to serve some time as \"prospects,\" a role similar to that of a pledge in a fraternity, before being eligible for full membership. The Diablos also had a governing structure which included both national and chapter officers. Baltas was one of the Club's founders and its national president.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the prosecution's primary witnesses at trial was William Alvis (hereinafter \"Alvis\"). Before becoming a Diablo, Alvis had been a member of another motorcycle club, the Barbarians, where he became familiarized with the biker culture and language. While affiliated with the Barbarians, Alvis was charged with the commission of several crimes not related to the instant indictment, and eventually began cooperating with government authorities. He infiltrated the Diablos at the behest of the FBI. One law enforcement concern with the Diablos was three unsolved motorcycle-club related murders, in which it was suspected that members of the Diablos had been involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Alvis stated that one important characteristic of the Club was the sense of brotherhood among its members. Alvis's trust and confidence within the Diablos, together with his familiarity with the biker culture, allowed him to become a prospect and later a full-fledged member. He developed close relationships with several members of the Club, and ultimately became its vice president. Alvis was thus the FBI's \"eyes and ears inside of the Diablos organization.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of his status within the Diablos, Alvis was able to gather for the FBI valuable information about the Club's structure and day-to-day operations. He was also able to introduce several undercover agents into the Club, and, with their help, orchestrate a number of criminal schemes involving the Diablos. One of these schemes concerned a reverse-sting heroin deal. The government's evidence of the circumstances surrounding this scheme consisted mainly of Alvis's trial testimony, aided by evidence derived from the interception of certain communications made pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510 et seq. (hereinafter \"Title III\"). What follows is a summary of this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of July of 1995, the Club was facing financial difficulties. Alvis, who at that time was treasurer of the Massachusetts chapter, held a meeting where he informed chapter members of the situation and told them that they would probably be evicted from the clubhouse because the rent was in arrears. As a way of generating money for the chapter, Alvis suggested that some members assist him in a drug deal. Alvis specifically told the Diablos that he needed them to \"[r]un security for [a] transportation of heroin.\" The plan consisted in picking up the drugs at one point and delivering them at another. He also explained that each participant would be paid $500, which money would be contributed to the chapter's treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas, who happened to be present at the meeting, agreed to the idea. He voiced his support by reminding members of their commitment to the Club, and even proposed a few ideas for carrying out the plan without attracting attention upon the Diablos. Moreover, Baltas directed Alvis to \"[t]ake the guys . . . best suited for the job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Alvis traveled to Connecticut for a chapter meeting, where he met Baltas at the chapter's clubhouse. Baltas asked Alvis how many members had volunteered to participate in the deal, and offered to recruit additional help upon learning that only two had come forward. As promised, Baltas talked to two other members who later got in contact with Alvis and eventually participated in the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deal finally took place on August 7, 1995, and Baltas and Alvis met in Connecticut the following day. Alvis gave Baltas $250.00 for his recruiting efforts. Baltas did not directly participate in the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Suppression</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained through electronic surveillance. Below, Baltas sought suppression of the intercepted communications alleging: (1) that the issuance of the warrant was not grounded on probable cause; (2) that the accompanying affidavit failed to show the unlikely success of alternative investigative procedures; (3) that in executing the warrant, the government failed to minimize the interceptions; (4) that the interceptions went beyond the scope of the warrant; and (5) that the warrant failed to specify the types of communications to be intercepted. Upon referral by the district court, the magistrate judge, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, issued a report and recommendation that the motion be denied. Adopting the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, the district court denied the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Baltas renews his attack on the government's minimization procedures. Specifically, Baltas challenges that the intercepting agents failed to minimize the interception of communications from approximately 9:04 p.m. until 10:09 p.m., on April 21, 1995. He further alleges that \"during the spot checks after 10:09 p.m., the agents obviously listened to more of the conversations than was necessary to have been able to know that they should have stopped listening.\" Focusing on these alleged violations, Baltas protests that all the evidence obtained through electronic surveillance should have been suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's denial of Baltas's motion for substantially the reasons cogently set forth in the magistrate judge's report and recommendation adopted by the district court. \"[W]hen a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\" United States v.

We only hesitate to add two comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the evidence obtained by the April 21 interception was not introduced at trial in relation to Baltas's count of conviction, to wit: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin. In fact, none of the communications intercepted on April 21 were introduced at trial. Thus, any possible error in adequately minimizing such interception was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, total suppression of electronic surveillance evidence is not appropriate unless the moving party shows that there was a \"taint upon the investigation as a whole sufficient to warrant [such] sweeping relief . . . .\" United States v. Charles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198941\"><a href=\"/opinion/198941/united-states-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v.

That is, errors in minimizing one particular interception within the context of a lengthy and complex investigation, such as the one involved in this case, do not automatically warrant the suppression of all the evidence obtained through electronic surveillance. Even assuming that the government failed to minimize the April 21 interception, total suppression would not follow, because Baltas has not demonstrated that the entire surveillance was tainted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Severance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas next argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for severance. He also assigns fault to the district court's refusal to hold a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of coconspirator statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas was originally charged in a superseding indictment with a controlled substances law violation. Although the indictment also included various RICO charges, Baltas was not targeted in any of them. Accordingly, he moved to sever the RICO from the non-RICO counts, and his trial from those of his co-defendants. The magistrate judge denied the motion without prejudice. Following the filing of the second superseding indictment, which charged Baltas with RICO conspiracy and substantive RICO, he renewed his motion before the district court, but to no avail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, joinder of counts and defendants in the second superseding indictment was proper. Of the 28 racketeering acts pertinent to the RICO conspiracy alleged in count 1, two implicated Baltas, predicate acts 3 (kidnapping) and 23 (conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin). These acts were also charged as substantive RICO violations. Furthermore, act 23 was separately charged as an offense in count 32, Baltas's count of conviction. Thus, the counts were properly joined under Rule 8(a) as charging \"two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"offenses committed pursuant to the same (charged) racketeering enterprise and conspiracy may be joined in a single indictment\"). The defendants were also properly joined. See United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 245 (1st Cir.) (\"So long as there is a responsible basis for the averments, charging an omnibus RICO conspiracy normally supplies the glue necessary to bond multiple defendants together in a single proceeding where all are accused of participating in the conspiracy.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas insists nonetheless that he was unduly prejudiced by the district court's denial of his motion for severance. Under Rule 14, a district court may order separate trials of counts or defendants \"[i]f it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment. . . or by such joinder for trial together . . . .\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 14. In making this determination, the district court enjoys wide latitude. SeeUnited States v.

Because Baltas has failed to shoulder this burden, we affirm the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas maintains that he was prejudiced because the jury was allowed to hear evidence that would have been irrelevant or inadmissible against him in a separate trial on the drug and firearms counts. In trying to prove his point, Baltas cursorily refers to the evidence relating to the predicate acts upon which the RICO charges rested, arguing that such evidence would not have been admissible in a trial without the RICO charges. He further contends that a separate trial would have inoculated the jury's verdict from being tainted by spillover prejudice. None of these arguments have merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, \"[t]his court's rule is that those 'who are indicted together should be tried together,' and the district court's joinder in this case appropriately followed that presumption.\" DeLeon, 187 F.3d at 63 (quoting O'Bryant, 998 F.2d at 25).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Baltas's allegations of prejudice are rather conclusory, and thus do not suffice to overcome the presumption in favor of joinder. See United States v. Neal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679500\"><a href=\"/opinion/679500/united-states-v-gary-p-neal-united-states-v-william-f-kenney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1204 (1st Cir. 1994) (conclusory allegations held insufficient to show requisite prejudice). \"There is always some prejudice in any trial where more than one offense or offender are tried together -- but such 'garden variety' prejudice, in and of itself, will not suffice.\" Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246. Moreover, we have consistently reiterated our reluctance to second-guess a lower court's refusal to sever \"[e]ven where large amounts of testimony are irrelevant to one defendant, or where one defendant's involvement in an overall agreement is far less than the involvement of others . . . .\" Id. at 246; see also United States v.

Moreover, as it is more particularly discussed infra, the court also gave limiting instructions during trial as to the admissibility of certain potentially prejudicial evidence pertaining to Baltas. Baltas's acquittal on the firearms charges (counts 40 and 41) demonstrates that the jury was able to follow these instructions. SeeDeLeon, 187 F.3d at 64 (considering a discriminating verdict as evidence that the jury was capable of following the district judge's instructions); United States v. Edgar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196711\"><a href=\"/opinion/196711/united-states-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 504 (1st Cir. 1996) (same); Neal, 36 F.3d at 1205 (same); Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (same); see also United States v.

James, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362801\"><a href=\"/opinion/362801/united-states-v-donald-james-and-david-anthony-butler-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span> (5th Cir.) (en banc). During the proceeding below, Baltas made various requests for a ruling on the admissibility of coconspirator statements relating to the RICO charges under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). The court denied the requests and provisionally allowed the evidence, declining to make a final admissibility determination, in accordance with United States v. Petrozziello, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342283\"><a href=\"/opinion/342283/united-states-v-ralph-petrozziello/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a consequence of its ruling on Baltas's Rule 29 motion, the district court struck the evidence at issue either in its entirety, or for all but credibility purposes. Baltas argues that because the trial court had ultimately to instruct the jury to either compartmentalize or totally disregard this evidence, he was unfairly prejudiced by the court's refusal to conduct a pretrial James hearing. According to him, if the trial court had made its evidentiary ruling before trial, thereby preventing the evidence from reaching the jury, his trial \"would not have been contaminated by such a large amount of harmful inadmissible evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit in James held that \"[t]he district court should, whenever reasonably practicable, require the showing of a conspiracy and of the connection of the defendant with it before admitting declarations of a coconspirator.\" 590 F.2d at 582.

In this case, the district court appropriately determined to admit the statements provisionally, even though it had to subsequently strike some of them, in whole or in part, due to its ruling on Baltas's Rule 29 motion. In so doing, the court took the necessary precautions to minimize spillover prejudice by giving appropriate cautionary instructions to the jury. Because Baltas has not shown that the district court's determination to admit the evidence provisionally was clearly erroneous, and since we have already determined that the selective verdict demonstrates that the jury was able to follow the court's instructions, we sustain the trial court's determination. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 703 (\"We will sustain the trial court's determination [regarding admission of coconspirator statements unless it is clearly erroneous.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Improper inducement \"goes beyond providing an ordinary opportunity to commit a crime.\" United States v. Gendron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195225\"><a href=\"/opinion/195225/united-states-v-gendron/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 961 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \"An inducement consists of an 'opportunity' plus something else--typically, excessive pressure by the government upon the defendant or the government's taking advantage of an alternative, non-criminal type of motive.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the evidence at trial established that Baltas joined the conspiracy on his own accord. Alvis merely presented the Massachusetts Diablos with a plan to alleviate their strangling financial situation. Alvis may have been well regarded by his fellow Diablos and loyalty to the Club may have been strong among its members. Yet, the existence of these circumstances, without a plea predicated upon them, is legally not enough to constitute improper inducement. See United States v. Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196643\"><a href=\"/opinion/196643/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 761 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting \"the proposition that friendship, without a plea predicated upon friendship, suffices legally as inducement\"). Contrary to his claim, the record shows that it was Baltas -- who quickly seized on Alvis's idea -- and who played upon the Diablos's commitment to the Club to promote participation in the plan, by stating: \"Well, you know what? This is an outlaw motorcycle club. It's not a 50/50 club, it's not a 70/70 club. . . . [Y]ou got to take your shot.\" Absent improper inducement, the district court was not obliged to instruct the jury on entrapment, and thus our inquiry should end here. Nevertheless, we note that Baltas also failed to show at trial that he lacked the requisite predisposition. Therefore, because we conclude that Baltas was not entitled to have the jury consider his defense of entrapment, we affirm the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Sentencing</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas claims that the district court erroneously declined to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a). A defendant qualifies for this adjustment when he \"clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" Id. It is incumbent upon the defendant to prove entitlement to a decrease in the offense level. See United States v. Rosario-Peralta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198440\"><a href=\"/opinion/198440/united-states-v-rosario-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 570 (1st Cir. 1999). We will not reverse a district court's decision to withhold a reduction in the offense level unless clearly erroneous. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although a defendant does not necessarily forfeit the possibility of obtaining a reduction for acceptance of responsibility by going to trial, doing so \"greatly diminishe[s] his chances of receiving [such an] adjustment.\" Id. Only in \"rare situations\" a defendant who elects to exercise his constitutional right to a trial will qualify for a decrease in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As explained in Note 2 of the Comment to &#167; 3E1.1:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmt. note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the district court correctly determined that Baltas was not entitled to an offense level reduction pursuant to &#167; 3E1.1. First, the record is barren of any pretrial statements or conduct indicating that Baltas accepted responsibility. Second, his situation does not fit any of the examples presented in the guideline commentary, and it is by no means \"rare.\" He asserts nonetheless that he did not proceed to trial to contest factual guilt, but to \"to test the strength of the government's case . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In this view, he suggests that the trial court's dismissal of the RICO counts, and the jury's not-guilty verdicts as to the firearms counts tilt the balance in his favor. This argument is unavailing; Baltas could have pleaded to the drug count and still gone to trial on the remaining ones. See United States v. DeLeon Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195881\"><a href=\"/opinion/195881/united-states-v-de-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 455 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[A]bsent unusual facts, we will . . . generally sustain a district court that denies acceptance of responsibility to a defendant who declined to plead guilty on the count or counts of which he was convicted.\"). Moreover, from the beginning of the case, Baltas contested his guilt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As his counsel stated in opening:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, I told you, before Mr. Baltas comes into this courtroom he's presumed innocent. As soon as the first time that he was brought before a court and said you've been indicted, how do you plead, and he pleaded not guilty, he join[ed] that issue for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court, in refusing to adjust Baltas's offense level for acceptance of responsibility, expressed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As I understand it, I think Mr. Baltas takes the position, which I don't blame him for if that's his position, that he never participated in any kind of a heroin conspiracy; that he never assisted the group of people to carry out that conspiracy; that he never had any intent to associate with them, and so on, and that just strikes me as not acceptance of responsibility. I'm not saying he ought to, but what I am saying is given his position, I have a very hard time understanding how that equals acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas also makes reference to his allocution, where he told the trial judge: \"[l]ike I said, I can accept my responsibility for what I did.\" When viewed in proper context, this statement loses almost all significance. In berating the government for conducting the heroin sting operation, Baltas declared:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I made up my mind several years ago that I was done with being a wiseguy. It didn't work out apparently because this guy [Alvis] got me tied up. I purposefully -- I want to do this with a little respect. I want to thank you for what you did with my son, Shane. I want to thank you for what you did with me with the bail hearings, for my family, my kids. But it's tough for me to want to say I'm sorry because I'm not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What I've done all my life I've paid for, I was man enough to stand up and say, okay, I did it. Let me go do my time. This I didn't do, and I'm going to jail for it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are hardly words of contrition. Therefore, we conclude that the district court's determination not to reduce Baltas's offense level for acceptance of responsibility was not clearly erroneous, and thus affirm it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas further assigns error to the district court's refusal to decrease his offense level as a minor participant under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b). Like a denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, a district court's refusal to adjust a defendant's offense level due to his minor participation is reviewed for clear error. See Rosario-Peralta, 199 F.3d at 571. However, because Baltas never raised the issue below, \"he must show that the district court's failure to adjust his sentence downward was 'plain error.'\" See United States v. Daniel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582532\"><a href=\"/opinion/582532/united-states-v-jose-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 102-03 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A]ny participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal,\" is considered a minor participant under the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b) cmt. note 3. To be entitled to a sentence adjustment for minor participation, a defendant must shoulder the burden of proving \"both that he is less culpable than most others involved in the offense of conviction and less culpable than most other miscreants convicted of similar crimes.\" United States v.

This determination \"is heavily dependent upon the facts of a particular case.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b) (backg'd); see alsoUnited States v. Mangos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197749\"><a href=\"/opinion/197749/united-states-v-mangos/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span>, 466 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"role-in-the-offense determinations are fact-bound\"). Moreover, \"[w]e have declared, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that barring a mistake of law . . ., 'battles over a defendant's status . . . will almost always be won or lost in the district court.'\" United States v. Conley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198112\"><a href=\"/opinion/198112/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir. 1998). Baltas did not fight his battle in the district court, and he stands no better chance of victory in this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record sufficiently demonstrates that Baltas was \"a player rather than a . . . dabbler,\" Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d at 149; he (1) participated in the initial planning of the heroin-trafficking conspiracy, (2) knew the scope of the activity, and (3) took the initiative of recruiting two Club members to provide security for the transaction. Under these circumstances, the district court's failure to adjust Baltas's offense level for minor participation was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Downward Departure</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas argues that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward on two grounds. First, he contends that the district court should have departed downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, because his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Specifically, Baltas complains that three of the five points which led to his criminal history III category resulted from a prior sentence which barely qualified as a such under &#167;&#167; 4A1.1(a) and 4A1.2(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guideline &#167; 4A1.1(a) mandates a 3-point addition to a defendant's criminal history computation \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(a). Under this section, \"[a] sentence imposed more than fifteen years prior to the defendant's commencement of the instant offense is not counted unless the defendant's incarceration extended into this fifteen-year period.\" Id. cmt. note 1; see also id. &#167; 4A1.2(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, Baltas objected to the 3-point computation under &#167; 4A1.1(a) because the prior sentence in question was imposed more than 15 years before his offense of conviction. However, the district court overruled this objection because it found that Baltas was in prison within the guideline's 15-year period. Because Baltas does not claim that the district court committed legal error in making this determination -- and indeed he could not -- we lack jurisdiction to review his claim. See Collazo-Aponte, 216 F.3d at 204 (\"the defendant may not appeal from a sentence within the guideline range if there was no legal error and the only claim is that the district court acted unreasonably in declining to depart\") (quoting United States v. Saldana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197274\"><a href=\"/opinion/197274/united-states-v-saldana/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir. 1997)); see also United States v.

In essence, Baltas's contention is that the fact that his conviction stemmed from the government's reverse sting operation takes his case outside the \"heartland\" of typical cases contemplated by the Guidelines. The district court did not deny Baltas's request because it thought it lacked the authority to depart, but because it declined to exercise its discretion to do so. Its decision, therefore, is not subject to review by this court. See Portela, 167 F.3d at 708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Apprendi</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After oral argument was held, a letter was transmitted to the court under Fed. R.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span> (2000). We granted both Baltas and the government time to submit supplementary memoranda addressing the possible relevance of Apprendi and, assuming that Apprendi applies, addressing the issue of prejudice. Such memoranda having been filed, the matter is properly submitted for disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking the rule set forth in Apprendi, where the Supreme Court held as a matter of constitutional law that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\" 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63, Baltas now seeks to have his sentence vacated. Because Baltas did not raise this issue below, we review for plain error. See United States v. Mojica-Baez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770724\"><a href=\"/opinion/770724/united-states-v-john-alexis-mojica-baez-united-states-of-america-v-josue/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue presented is whether the district court's finding of drug quantity under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1), which was made at the sentencing under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, was error under Apprendi. In support of his claim of error, Baltas argues: (1) that we should read Apprendi as applying where any fact (other than the fact of a prior conviction) exposes the defendant to an increased penalty, instead of as applying only in situations where the prescribed sentence exceeds the statutory maximum, and that (2) assuming Apprendi is applicable, the district court's finding constitutes plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baltas was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intention to distribute and to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. The amount of heroin attributed to him was neither submitted to the jury, nor found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, it was determined by the district court at the sentencing hearing under a preponderance of the evidence standard. Under this standard, the district court determined that the transaction involved at least one kilogram of heroin. This finding mandated a base offense level of 34. With a criminal history category of III, Baltas's Guideline range was of 188 to 235 months' imprisonment, which as we explain below is within the statutory maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the pertinent statutory scheme, Section 846 provides that the penalty for an attempt or conspiracy to commit a drug trafficking offense shall be the same as the penalty for the offense that was the object of the attempt or conspiracy. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. The underlying offense is set out in section 841(a)(1), which makes it unlawful to \"manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). Section 841(b), in turn, establishes the penalties applicable to a violation of section 841(a)(1). Section 841(b)(1)(C) authorizes a term of imprisonment for a schedule I narcotic, such as heroin, without reference to drug quantity, of \"not more than 20 years.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). Using this framework, the district court sentenced Baltas to a term of 188 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding his sentence at the low end of the penalty range, Baltas argues that Apprendi must not be construed so narrowly; and should apply in situations where any fact (other than the fact of a prior conviction) exposes the defendant to an increased penalty, instead of as applying only in situations where the prescribed sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. However, as held by the Eighth Circuit, \"[t]his argument goes too far, and is not supported by the Supreme Court's opinion in Apprendi.\" United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769692\"><a href=\"/opinion/769692/united-states-v-fabian-aguayo-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 933 (8th Cir. 2000). The rule in Apprendi only applies in situations where the judge-made factual determination increases the maximum sentence beyond the statutory maximum, and not in situations where the Defendant's potential exposure is increased within the statutory range. Id. Therefore, if the judge-made factual determination merely narrows the judge's discretion within the range already authorized by the offense of conviction, then no Apprendi violation occurs. Id. at 934-35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi, we hold that no constitutional error occurs when the district court sentences the defendant within the statutory maximum, regardless that drug quantity was never determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, Baltas's sentence of 188 months, below the twenty year maximum provided by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), does not constitute an error under Apprendi. This decision is consistent with those of our sister circuits which have had the opportunity to address challenges similar to the one presented by Baltas. See, e.g., United States v.

Fleener, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539859\"><a href=\"/opinion/539859/united-states-v-james-edgar-fleener/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 918 (6th Cir. 1990), while others have held that the defense of entrapment and U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 are incompatible, see, e.g., United States v. Kirkland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733371\"><a href=\"/opinion/733371/united-states-v-keith-kirkland/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></a></span>, 1405 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Today, we have no need to decide the issue because the record belies any claim that Baltas \"clearly demonstrate[d] acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Even his statements before this court confirms this. For example, in his supplemental brief, Baltas asserts that he has \"consistently maintained that he is innocent[, and] that [h]e never conceded that he was part of any conspiracy to possess heroin.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Moreover, in his objections to the presentence report, Baltas maintained \"that he never agreed to participate in the Government sham transaction plan nor did he need to approve of it or assist in recruiting persons to carry it out.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
