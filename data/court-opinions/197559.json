The plaintiffs  in this case, most of whom\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\nare   former  employees  of   the  Puerto  Rico   Public  Housing\r\n\nAdministration  (PRPHA), have been struggling since 1992 first to\r\n\nblock, and now to secure  money damages for, the privatization of\r\n\ncertain aspects  of the public  housing program in  Puerto Rico.1\r\n\nTheir current initiative  represents an effort to  obtain damages\r\n\nunder the Federal  Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28  U.S.C.    1346(b),\r\n\n2671-2680 (1994).   When the United States  Department of Housing\r\n\nand Urban  Development (HUD)  denied their  timely administrative\r\n\nclaim,  28  U.S.C.    2675,  the  plaintiffs  filed suit  in  the\r\n\ndistrict court and later amended their complaint.  The government\r\n\nresponded  by filing  a motion  for dismissal.   On  February 25,\r\n\n1997,  the  district  court  dismissed  the  plaintiffs'  amended\r\n\ncomplaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction.  See Gonzalez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFigueroa v.

This appeal ensued.\r\n\n          We have  carefully read the parties'  briefs, evaluated\r\n\ntheir legal arguments, and  studied the papers in  the case.   We\r\n\nconclude, on whole-record review, that this is a suitable case in\r\n\nwhich to act upon  our long-held belief that \"when  a lower court\r\n\nproduces a  comprehensive, well-reasoned  decision, an  appellate\r\n\ncourt should refrain from writing at length to no  other end than\r\n\nto  hear its  own words  resonate.\"   Lawton  v. State  Mut. Life\r                                                                           \r\n\nAssur. Co. of Am.,  101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.  1996); accord In\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The underlying facts  are limned in  an earlier opinion  of\r\nthis court.   See Acevedo-Villalobos  v. Hernandez, 22  F.3d 384,\r                                                            \r\n385 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nre San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d 36,  38 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1993).  Hence, we  affirm the judgment for substantially the\r\n\nreasons  set  forth  in  the  lower  court's  discussion  of  the\r\n\ndiscretionary  function exception  to the  FTCA.   See  Gonzalez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFigueroa, 1997 WL 117750, at *5-7.  We add only a small coda.\r                  \r\n\n          It is not our role to pass judgment upon the wisdom (or\r\n\nlack of wisdom) of  the housing policies which PRPHA and HUD have\r\n\ndecided  to follow.   Rather, our  role, in  the context  of this\r\n\nappeal, is  to determine  only  whether HUD  (the federal  agency\r\n\ninvolved)  had  the   statutory  authority  to  enter   into  the\r\n\nchallenged  agreement with PRPHA and whether  it acted within the\r\n\nrealm of  its discretion when  it exercised that authority.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMagee v. United  States, No. 96-2357, 1997 WL 419551,  at *3 (1st\r                                 \r\n\nCir. July 31, 1997).  Because these questions must be answered in\r\n\nthe affirmative,2 for the reasons already elucidated by the court\r\n\nbelow, the FTCA's  discretionary function exception, 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2680(a), bars  the maintenance  of the  plaintiffs' action.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMagee, 1997 WL 419551,  at *3.  After all, a  complaint under the\r               \r\n\nFTCA  cannot survive a  motion to dismiss if  it alleges only the\r\n\nsort of statutory conduct that  is plainly grounded in the policy\r\n\nimperatives  of  an  applicable regulatory  regime.    See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Gaubert,  499 U.S.  315, 324-25  (1991); Berkovitz  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2We have considered and  rejected, as a matter  of statutory\r\ninterpretation,  the plaintiffs' argument that, under 42 U.S.C.  \r\n1437d(j)(3)(A),  the Secretary  of HUD  was  required to  declare\r\nPRPHA  in \"substantial default\" before entering into an agreement\r\nthat permits privatization.  The  text of the statute simply will\r\nnot bear the weight that the plaintiffs load upon it.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nUnited States,  486 U.S.  531, 536-37,  (1988); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nVarig Airlines, 467 U.S. 797, 814 (1984).\r                        \r\n\n          In  any event, as  the district court  also recognized,\r\n\nGonzalez-Figueroa,  1997  WL  117750,  at *4,  the  absence  of a\r                           \r\n\ncomparable cause of action against a private individual precludes\r\n\nFTCA liability here.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  The judgment below is summarily\r\n\naffirmed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r                        \r\n\n          Affirmed.  No Costs.\r                    Affirmed.

Hence, we  affirm the judgment for substantially the\r\n\nreasons  set  forth  in  the  lower  court's  discussion  of  the\r\n\ndiscretionary  function exception  to the  FTCA.   See  Gonzalez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFigueroa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">117750</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5-7.  We add only a small coda.\r                  \r\n\n          It is not our role to pass judgment upon the wisdom (or\r\n\nlack of wisdom) of  the housing policies which PRPHA and HUD have\r\n\ndecided  to follow.   Rather, our  role, in  the context  of this\r\n\nappeal, is  to determine  only  whether HUD  (the federal  agency\r\n\ninvolved)  had  the   statutory  authority  to  enter   into  the\r\n\nchallenged  agreement with PRPHA and whether  it acted within the\r\n\nrealm of  its discretion when  it exercised that authority.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMagee v.

Because these questions must be answered in\r\n\nthe affirmative,2 for the reasons already elucidated by the court\r\n\nbelow, the FTCA's  discretionary function exception, 28  U.S.C.  \r\n\n2680(a), bars  the maintenance  of the  plaintiffs' action.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMagee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">419551</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  at *3.  After all, a  complaint under the\r               \r\n\nFTCA  cannot survive a  motion to dismiss if  it alleges only the\r\n\nsort of statutory conduct that  is plainly grounded in the policy\r\n\nimperatives  of  an  applicable regulatory  regime.
