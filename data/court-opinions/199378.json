Appellant Asociacion Farmacias de Comunidad de\n\nPuerto    Rico    (Asociacion),        an    organization        representing      500\n\nindependent Puerto Rico pharmacies, sought to intervene in a\n\nsuit brought by Walgreen Company, a large pharmaceutical chain,\n\nseeking to invalidate a Puerto Rico licensing system for new and\n\nrelocating pharmacies.             The Asociacion wants to support the\n\ndefendant,    Puerto      Rico's    Secretary       of     Health,   in    rebuffing\n\nWalgreen's claim that the system violates the Commerce Clause of\n\nthe Constitution.      The district court denied motions under Fed.\n\nR.   Civ.    P.   24(a)    and     (b)       for   mandatory      and     permissive\n\nintervention, and the Asociacion then brought this interlocutory\n\nappeal.     We affirm, primarily for the reasons expressed by the\n\ndistrict court, adding only the following thoughts.\n\n     To begin, our review is constrained by a considerable\n\nmeasure of deference to the district court's discretion, as\n\nthere is no claim that improper standards were applied.                            See\n\nPub. Serv. Co. of New Hampshire v. Patch, 136 F.3d 197, 204 (lst\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n     Appellant identifies the interest it seeks to protect as its\n\nmembers'     \"procedural         and        participation        rights     in     the\n\nadministrative      determination           of   whether    to   issue    or     not   a\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fCertificate of Necessity and Convenience.\"                It also asserts that\n\nsome members' appeals from adverse administrative determinations\n\nare pending in the courts of Puerto Rico and that invalidation\n\nof the statutory scheme would in effect adjudicate those appeals\n\nand violate their due process rights.\n\n      Appellant misconceives the nature of the rights at stake.\n\nNo   member's   right     to   establish       or     relocate   a   pharmacy    is\n\naffected.       Rather,    the    administrative          proceedings       reflect\n\nmembers'     attempts     to     defeat       the     applications     of    other\n\npharmacies.     Such an interest in foreclosing competition falls\n\nshort of the \"interest relating to the property or transaction\"\n\nrequired by Rule 24(a)(2).          As we held in Patch, 136 F.3d at\n\n205, 207 n.8, neither prior nor anticipated participation in\n\nadministrative proceedings constitutes an \"independent basis for\n\nintervention.\"      To the extent that potential economic harm\n\nresulting from the proceedings could so qualify, it must be more\n\nthan \"overly contingent.\"         Id.     at 205.       The ongoing litigation\n\nmust \"directly threaten[] an economic right or benefit presently\n\nenjoyed . . . . \"       Id.      Here, economic harm threatened by the\n\nentrance of a competitor on the scene is subject to the actions\n\nand capacities of competitors, the nature of the markets, the\n\nstate   of    the   economy,       and        other    factors.        In    these\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fcircumstances, appellant's members have no protectable right to\n\nthe continuation of the regulatory process.\n\n    Appellant       asserts   that   the    Secretary    will    not   provide\n\nadequate representation of its members' interests, basing its\n\nargument     on    the   complaint's       allegation    that    the    Health\n\nDepartment fails to maintain adequate records of proceedings and\n\ndecisions.        Appellant contends that the Department would be\n\nunlikely to admit the existence of record-keeping flaws, while\n\nthe Asociacion would point out such flaws and demonstrate that\n\nthey impact both local and out- of-state pharmacies and thus\n\nreflect    administrative      inefficiency,       not    unconstitutional\n\ndiscrimination against out-of-state businesses.\n\n    The possibility that different legal arguments will be used\n\ndoes not constitute inadequate representation, Daggett v. Comm'n\n\non Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, 172 F.3d 104, 112\n\n(lst Cir. 1999), and, indeed, appellants were granted permission\n\nto submit an amicus brief in which any such variations could be\n\npresented,    see    Massachusetts     Food     Ass'n    v.     Massachusetts\n\nAlcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n, 197 F.3d 560, 567 (lst Cir.\n\n1999).     Bearing in mind the considerable burden borne by a\n\nwould-be intervenor to show that a government agency is not\n\nfairly representing its interests, Daggett, 172 F.3d at 112;\n\nPatch, 136 F.3d at 207, we conclude that appellants' \"offer [of]\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fa different angle\" on legal questions, Patch, 136 F.3d at 210,\n\nis   insufficient   to   warrant   reversing   the   district   court's\n\njudgment.\n\n      As for denial of permissive intervention, what we have said\n\nclearly supports the district court's exercise of discretion.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
