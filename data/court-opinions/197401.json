The plaintiff Maine Right to Life\r\n\nCommittee  (\"Maine Committee\")  brought  this action  in  the\r\n\ndistrict \r                    court to challenge the validity of new regulations of\r\n\nthe \r               Federal \r                       Election Commission (\"FEC\").   The Maine Committee\r\n\nis  a nonprofit  membership  corporation,  exempt  under  the\r\n\nInternal Revenue Code, which engages in various activities in\r\n\nopposition to  abortion.   It  accepts donations  from  other\r\n\ncorporations for its general fund.\r\n\n     Among its activities thus  funded is the publication  of\r\n\nvoter  guides  describing   the  position  of   congressional\r\n\ncandidates  on  \"pro-life\"  issues  and  the  publication  of\r\n\ncongressional voting  records on the  same issues.   Its  co-\r\n\nplaintiff Robin Clifton  is a recipient  and reader of  these\r\n\npublications.  The FEC regulations, effective March 13, 1996,\r\n\npurport \r                   to \r                      regulate voter guides and voting records in several\r\n\ndifferent respects pertinent here.\r\n\n     Voting \r                       records.  The new FEC regulation on voting records\r\n\nnot  only prohibits  corporations and  unions from  expressly\r\n\nadvocating the election  or defeat  of particular  identified\r\n\ncandidates--a \r                         restriction\r                                    not challenged by the plaintiffs--but\r\n\nalso provides that even without such advocacy \"[t]he decision\r\n\non \r              content \r                      and the distribution of voting records shall not be\r\n\ncoordinated  with  any  candidate,  group  of  candidates  or\r\n\npolitical \r                     party.\"  11 C.F.R.

Along  with the  restriction on  express\r\n\nadvocacy, the regulation on voter guides provides that either\r\n\na \r             corporation or union publishing a guide must have no contact\r\n\nat \r              all \r                  with \r                       any candidate or political committee regarding the\r\n\npreparation, contents and distribution of the voter guide or,\r\n\nif there is such contact, (1) it must be only through written\r\n\nquestions and written responses,  (2) each candidate must  be\r\n\ngiven \r                 the \r                    same \r                         prominence and space in the guide, and (3) there\r\n\nmust \r                be \r                   no \r                      \"electioneering message\" conveyed by any scoring or\r\n\nrating system used, or otherwise.  11 C.F.R. S 114.4(c)(5).\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court granted a declaratory judgment holding\r\n\nthe regulations just described, apart from the ban on express\r\n\nadvocacy, \"invalid as not authorized\" by the Federal Election\r\n\nCampaign Act  of 1971, 2  U.S.C. S 431  et seq. (\"the  Act\"),\r\n\n\"because  they restrict  issue  advocacy in  connection  with\r\n\nexpenditures.\"  Clifton v. FEC, 927 F. Supp. 493, 500 (D. Me.\r\n\n1996).  Some of the district court's reasoning is directed to\r\n\nthe \r               statute, \r                        and some to a right of corporate \"issue advocacy\"\r\n\nset \r               forth \r                     in \r                        FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479\r\n\nU.S. 238 (1986).\r\n\n     We \r                   begin \r                         with the statute, partly because of the district\r\n\ncourt's  reliance on  it and  partly because  of the  general\r\n\nprecept  against   deciding  constitutional   issues   unless\r\n\nnecessary.  The provision of the Act on which the FEC  relies\r\n\nfor  authority is  2 U.S.C.  S 441b.   In  pertinent part  it\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nprohibits \r                     any corporation or union from making \"a contribution\r\n\nor \r              expenditure in connection with any\" federal presidential or\r\n\ncongressional \r                         election \r                                 or primary.  The Act does permit limited\r\n\nactivities of  this  kind from  \"segregated\" funds  that  are\r\n\nheavily regulated and are typically known as political action\r\n\ncommittees (PACs).  See  Massachusetts Citizens, 479 U.S.  at\r\n\n253-54.\r\n\n     In Massachusetts Citizens,  the Supreme Court held  that\r\n\nsection 441b prohibits corporate and union contributions but,\r\n\nas \r              to \r                 expenditures \r                             other \r                                   than contributions, the Court narrowly\r\n\nconstrued \r                     the \r                        statutory \r                                  ban as limited to \"express advocacy\" of\r\n\nthe election or defeat of a candidate.  Id. at 249.  Thus, as\r\n\nglossed by the  Supreme Court to avoid \"overbreadth,\" id.  at\r\n\n248, \r                the \r                    statute does not prevent corporations and unions from\r\n\nengaging \r                    in \r                      issue \r                            advocacy including publication of the records\r\n\nand positions of federal election candidates.\r\n\n     Previously, the FEC adopted a regulation under the  same\r\n\nsection that required voter guides to be \"nonpartisan\":  they\r\n\ncould \r                 describe the candidates' positions but could not express\r\n\nthe \r               organization's \r                             opinion on the issues presented.  This court\r\n\nheld \r                the \r                    new \r                        limitation to be a straightforward restriction on\r\n\nissue \r                 advocacy \r                         and \r                             therefore beyond the scope of the statute as\r\n\nconstrued \r                     by \r                        the Supreme Court.  Faucher v. FEC, 928 F.2d 468,\r\n\n471 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 820 (1991).\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     In \r                   response \r                            to \r                              Faucher\r                                     , \r                                       the FEC has issued the voter guide\r\n\nregulation at  issue in  the present  case and  has chosen  a\r\n\ndifferent tack.  Instead of claiming any direct authority  to\r\n\nregulate issue  advocacy--a claim  rejected by  Massachusetts\r\n\nCitizens and Faucher--the FEC defends its new regulations  as\r\n\ndefining, \r                     or \r                        at least enforcing, section 441b's prohibition on\r\n\ncontributions\r                        .  It reasons that a voting record or voter guide\r\n\npublication \r                       that fails to comply with its regulation is either\r\n\na \r             contribution or can be banned in the interests of preventing\r\n\nprohibited contributions.\r\n\n     The claim that  noncomplying publications are  therefore\r\n\ncontributions is untenable.   The Supreme Court has said,  in\r\n\ndiscussing related  statutory provisions,  that  expenditures\r\n\ndirected by  or  \"coordinated\" with  the candidate  could  be\r\n\ntreated \r                   as \r                      contributions, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 46\r\n\n(1976); \r                   but \r                      \"coordination\" in this context implied some measure\r\n\nof \r              collaboration \r                           beyond \r                                  a mere inquiry as to the position taken\r\n\nby a  candidate on an issue.   Id. at 46-47 &amp; n.53; see  also\r\n\nColorado Republican Fed.  Campaign Comm. v.  FEC, 116 S.  Ct.\r\n\n2309, 2319 (1996) (opinion of Breyer, J.).\r\n\n     On its face, the FEC's voter guide regulation bars  non-\r\n\nwritten  contact not  merely  regarding the  preparation  and\r\n\ndistribution  of  voter  guides,  but  also  regarding  their\r\n\ncontents.  11  C.F.R. S 114.4(c)(5)(i),  (ii)(A).  Thus,  the\r\n\nregulation expressly prohibits a  simple oral inquiry by  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nMaine \r                 Committee as to a candidate's position; and the district\r\n\ncourt \r                 tells \r                       us \r                         that \r                              the \r                                  FEC's counsel admitted at oral argument\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    FEC \r                        similarly interprets its ban on \"coordination\" of\r\n\nvoting \r                  record publications.  927 F. Supp. at 498.  The FEC can\r\n\nconstrue terms  but  it  cannot rewrite  the  dictionary  and\r\n\nclassify \r                    a \r                     simple \r                            inquiry as a contribution.  See Ernst &amp; Ernst\r\n\nv. Hochfelder,  425  U.S. 185,  198-99 (1976);  cf.  Colorado\r\n\nRepublican, 116 S. Ct. at 2319, 2321-22 (opinions of  Breyer,\r\n\nJ., and Kennedy, J.).\r\n\n     But \r                    if \r                      ordinary \r                               standards of agency power are applied, the\r\n\nFEC has a stronger claim--constitutional limitations  aside--\r\n\nthat it  can on prophylactic  grounds ban  oral contacts  for\r\n\nvoting records and voter guides, and perhaps require  similar\r\n\namounts of coverage of candidates in voter guides.  True, not\r\n\nall oral  contacts  or different  allocations of  space  will\r\n\ninvolve collaboration with the candidate.  But some will, and\r\n\nthe \r               FEC's \r                     restrictions may reduce the risk of collaboration by\r\n\nmaking \r                  it \r                     easier to detect and less effective where it occurs.\r\n\n     Normally \r                         an \r                            agency with rulemaking power has a measure of\r\n\nlatitude where it is dealing with the regulated entity (here,\r\n\ncorporations and  unions) and  where the  rule is  reasonably\r\n\ndesigned to  achieve the  statute's goal  (here, to  prohibit\r\n\ncertain types of contributions).  The FEC has such rulemaking\r\n\npower.   2 U.S.C.  S 437d(a)(8);  Buckley, 424  U.S. at  110.\r\n\nAgencies  often are  allowed through  rulemaking to  regulate\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nbeyond the express substantive directives of the statute,  so\r\n\nlong as  the statute  is not contradicted.   See Mourning  v.\r\n\nFamily \r                  Publications Serv., 411 U.S. 356, 369-71 (1973); United\r\n\nStates\r                  \r                  v. \r                     Sou\r                        thwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 177-78 (1968);\r\n\nAlexander v. Trustees  of Boston Univ., 766 F.2d 630,  636-38\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1985).\r\n\n     We  think  it  is thus  not  altogether  easy  to  avoid\r\n\napproaching the  question whether what  the FEC  is doing  is\r\n\nconstitutional.  True,  one could say  that it is  regulating\r\n\nissue advocacy while claiming to regulate contributions.  But\r\n\nin a  sense the FEC is doing  both at the same time; and  the\r\n\nstatute, \r                    it \r                       should be noted, does not itself forbid reasonable\r\n\nregulation of contributions that happens also to burden issue\r\n\nadvocacy. \r                      \r                      As \r                        a \r                          statutory matter, the Act simply stops short of\r\n\nprohibiting issue advocacy.  Massachusetts Citizens, 479 U.S.\r\n\nat 249; Faucher, 928 F.2d at 471.\r\n\n     Turning then  to constitutional issues,  we face at  the\r\n\noutset  the  claim of  the  Maine  Committee that  it  has  a\r\n\nconstitutional right of  issue advocacy that is  unreasonably\r\n\nburdened by the regulations here at issue.  In  Massachusetts\r\n\nCitizens, the Supreme Court not only narrowed section 441b by\r\n\nconstruction but also recognized  a First Amendment right  to\r\n\nissue advocacy, on behalf  of a nonprofit corporation  fairly\r\n\nsimilar \r                   to \r                      the \r                         Maine \r                               Committee, that extends to the publication\r\n\nof voter guides.  479 U.S. at 263. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     The difficulty is  that in that  same case, the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt stressed as \"essential\" the fact that the anti-abortion\r\n\n                       not accept contributions from business\r\n\n orporations \r                        or \r                           unions. \r                                   \r                                   Id. at 264.

As we will see, the limit on oral contact\r\n\nand the  obligation to  provide equal  space are  significant\r\n\nburdens and, as merely prophylactic rules that go beyond  the\r\n\nthreat \r                  (unauthorized \r                               corporate contributions), the rules likely\r\n\nwould  not meet  the narrow  tailoring requirement.   FEC  v.\r\n\nNational Conservative Political  Action Comm., 470 U.S.  480,\r\n\n496, 498-500 (1985).  But  the Court may hold that the  Maine\r\n\nCommittee's \r                       acceptance \r                                 of corporate contributions brings Austin\r\n\ninto play.\r\n\n     We think that the present case can be decided on grounds\r\n\nthat \r                do \r                   not \r                       require us to decide whether Austin applies to the\r\n\nMaine Committee, an issue only the Supreme Court can  resolve\r\n\ndefinitively.   For  even apart  from their  impact on  issue\r\n\nadvocacy,  the   two  main   FEC  rules   at  issue   curtail\r\n\nconstitutional  rights that  corporations  unquestionably  do\r\n\npossess.    Whether  the  curtailment  goes  too  far  as   a\r\n\nconstitutional matter need not be decided:  it is enough that\r\n\nit undermines the FEC's claim of authority for its rules.\r\n\n     Starting with the FEC rule requiring substantially equal\r\n\nspace \r                 and \r                     prominence, we begin with the proposition that where\r\n\npublic  issues are  involved,  government  agencies  are  not\r\n\ndecisions.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nnormally \r                    empowered \r                             to \r                                impose and police requirements as to what\r\n\np\r\n\n                                                            s\r\n\nabhorrent to the First  Amendment, whether the compulsion  is\r\n\ndirected against individuals or corporations.2  And while  no\r\n\ncase \r                is \r                   an \r                      exact match for this one, Miami Herald comes pretty\r\n\nclose.\r\n\n     There, the Supreme Court struck down Florida's \"right of\r\n\nreply\" statute that  guaranteed a  political candidate  equal\r\n\nspace \r                 to \r                    reply to newspaper attacks or criticism.  418 U.S. at\r\n\n256.  The  Court said that even  if no additional costs  were\r\n\nimposed by \"compulsory access,\" nevertheless\r\n\n     [t]he \r                      choice \r                             of material to go into a newspaper, and\r\n                  made as to limitations on the size and\r             rivate \r                   citizens may say or write.

We assume  a\r\n\nlegitimate \r                      FEC interest in preventing disguised contributions;\r\n\nbut Florida's  interest in  fair coverage  that prompted  its\r\n\n\"right \r                  of \r                     reply\" \r                           statute \r                                   was hardly trivial.  The point is that\r\n\nthe \r               interest \r                       cannot \r                              normally be secured by compelling a private\r\n\nentity  to express  particular views  or by  requiring it  to\r\n\nprovide \"balance\" or equal space or an opportunity to appear.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Hurley, 115 S. Ct. at 2347; Miami Herald, 418 U.S.\r\n\nat 256.\r\n\n     First \r                      Amendment concerns may be less where the government\r\n\nrequires balance or access than where it dictates the precise\r\n\nviewpoint \r                     to \r                       be \r                          expressed. But, unlike \"time, place and manner\"\r\n\nlimitations, the FEC's equal space or prominence requirement,\r\n\neven if mechanically applied, does affect the content of  the\r\n\nMaine Committee's  voting guide.   Thus, the Maine  Committee\r\n\ncould be compelled to devote substantial space to  describing\r\n\nthe \r               position \r                        of a candidate with whom it deeply disagrees.  As\r\n\nthe Supreme Court said  unanimously in Hurley, 115 S.

Indeed, even for broadcasters and cable  monopolies,\r\n\nthe Supreme Court has upheld equal coverage and \"must  carry\"\r\n\nprovisions \r                      only \r                          because \r                                  of the unique control that broadcasters\r\n\nand cable operators have  over public access to  programming.\r\n\nTurner Broadcasting Sys.,  Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622,  655-57\r\n\n(1994); \r                   Red \r                       Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 392-94\r\n\n(1969).  That rationale has no conceivable application to the\r\n\nMaine Committee.\r\n\n     The other rule principally at issue is the limitation on\r\n\noral contact with candidates.  We think that this is patently\r\n\noffensive to the First  Amendment in a different aspect:   it\r\n\ntreads heavily  upon  the right  of citizens,  individual  or\r\n\ncorporate, to  confer and discuss  public matters with  their\r\n\nlegislative \r                       representatives or candidates for such office.  As\r\n\nwe have explained,  the regulations  bar non-written  contact\r\n\nregarding  the  contents,  not  merely  the  preparation  and\r\n\ndistribution,  of voter  guides  and  voting  records;  thus,\r\n\ninquiries \r                     to \r                       candidates \r                                  and incumbents about their positions on\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r\n\nissues \r                  like \r                       abortion \r                               are \r                                   a precise target of the FEC's rules as\r\n\napplied here.3  \r\n\n     It is hard to find direct precedent only because efforts\r\n\nto \r              restrict \r                       this right to communicate freely are so rare.  But\r\n\nwe think that it is beyond reasonable belief that, to prevent\r\n\ncorruption or  illicit  coordination,  the  government  could\r\n\nprohibit voluntary  discussions  between citizens  and  their\r\n\nlegislators  and  candidates on  public  issues.    The  only\r\n\ndifference between such an  outright ban and the FEC rule  is\r\n\nthat the FEC permits  discussion so long as both sides  limit\r\n\nthemselves to writing.  Both principle and practicality  make\r\n\nthis an inadequate distinction.\r\n\n     It \r                   is \r                      no \r                         business of executive branch agencies to dictate\r\n\nthe  form  in  which free  citizens  can  confer  with  their\r\n\nlegislative representatives.   Further, the restriction is  a\r\n\nreal handicap on  intercourse:  the nuances of positions  and\r\n\nvotes can often be discerned only through oral discussion; as\r\n\nany \r               courtroom \r                        lawyer \r                               knows, stilted written interrogatories and\r\n\nanswers \r                   are \r                      no \r                         substitute for cross-examination.  A ban on oral\r\n\ncommunication\r                        , solely for prophylactic reasons, is not readily\r\n\ndefensible.\r\n\n     3Indeed, the chilling effect of such a restriction would\r\nextend well beyond any discussion directed to a particular\r\nvoter guide; any inquiry by the Maine Committee to a local\r\nrepresentative or candidate regarding his or her position on\r\nsuch issues would be vulnerable even if no mention whatever\r\nwere made of any voter guide.

Riley, 487 U.S. at 794. \r\n\n                            -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r\n\n     The Supreme Court has echoed this view, albeit in dicta.\r\n\nIn  upholding  the Attorney  General's  refusal  to  grant  a\r\n\ntemporary visa to a foreign journalist invited to participate\r\n\nin academic conferences in the United States, the Court said,\r\n\n     The  Government  also   suggests  that  the   First\r\n     Amendment is  inapplicable because  appellees  have\r\n     free access to Mandel's ideas through his books and\r\n     speeches, and because \"technological developments,\"\r\n     such  as  tapes  or  telephone  hook-ups,   readily\r\n     supplant his  physical  presence.    This  argument\r\n     overlooks what may be particular qualities inherent\r\n     in sustained,  face-to-face debate, discussion  and\r\n     questioning.  . . .

Here, a surrender of such rights is\r\n\nbeing required in order to do something--to publish political\r\n\ninformation about voting guides or records--that Congress has\r\n\nnot made  unlawful.  We are  not certain that Congress  could\r\n\nrequire this sacrifice based on its own judgment of need, but\r\n\nthe law in  this realm is  far from clear.

If the FEC\r\n\ndoes read  its regulation in this  fashion, it would to  this\r\n\nextent \r                  raise \r                        the same constitutional concern about access, and\r\n\nreflect the same  unauthorized use  of rulemaking  authority.\r\n\nThis  declaration ought  to  satisfy  the  Maine  Committee's\r\n\nlegitimate concern about misuse of the regulation.\r\n\n     Finally, \r                         in \r                            two paragraphs at the close of its brief, the\r\n\nMaine \r                 Committee \r                          also \r                               asserts that the voter guide regulation is\r\n\nunconstitutionally vague  in its  dual ban  on including  \"an\r\n\nelectioneering message\" in  a voter guide  and on seeking  to\r\n\n\"score or rate the candidates' responses in such a way as  to\r\n\nconvey   an    electioneering    message.\"       11    C.F.R.\r\n\nSS 114.4(c)(5)(ii)(D), (E).

It then points to its \"advisory\r\n\nopinion \r                   process\" as a method for obtaining clarification.  The\r\n\nFEC  also  says  that  the  Maine  Committee's  argument   is\r\n\nperfunctory.   It  is, but  so is  the FEC's  reply, and  the\r\n\nsubstance  of the  Maine  Committee's  concern--vagueness--is\r\n\nreadily apparent.\r\n\n     The \r                    FEC \r                        might \r                             have \r                                  argued that \"electioneering message\" is\r\n\nsimply \r                  another \r                         version \r                                 of the ban on express advocacy upheld by\r\n\nthe Supreme Court.  But the FEC has conspicuously declined to\r\n\nmake \r                that \r                     argument.  Nor is it clear why, if the FEC meant the\r\n\nphrase \r                  to \r                     be \r                       limited \r                               to \r                                  express advocacy, it did not simply use\r\n\nthose words, which are  used in a different provision of  the\r\n\nsame regulation, 11 C.F.R. S 114.4(c)(5)(i), and also in  the\r\n\nvoting \r                  records \r                         regulation.  We are thus entitled to assume that\r\n\n\"electioneering message\" has a different, broader meaning.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court expressly declined to reach the issue,\r\n\n927 F.  Supp.  at 500  n.7,  apparently believing  that  this\r\n\nrestriction \r                       could not be severed from other parts of the voter\r\n\nguide \r                 regulation that the district court had struck down.  But\r\n\nthe \r               district \r                        court opinion did not explain why and, if the FEC\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                        -18-\r\r\n\nwants \r                 to \r                   assert \r                          severability (its position is not revealed), an\r\n\nargument can be made that the electioneering message ban,  if\r\n\nvalid,  can stand on its own two  feet.  See K Mart Corp.  v.\r\n\nCartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 294 (1988).\r\n\n     We have  no intention  of trying to  resolve any of  the\r\n\nissues thus implicated, based  on inadequate briefing and  in\r\n\ndarkness as to the FEC's own position as to content,  purpose\r\n\nand severability.  The  Supreme Court's treatment of  related\r\n\nvagueness  issues  in  Buckley,   424  U.S.  at  40-44,   and\r\n\nMassachusetts Citizens, 479 U.S. at 248-49, suggests that the\r\n\nvagueness attack is not frivolous, but those cases differ  in\r\n\nvarious respects from  this one on the  merits.  And, at  the\r\n\nthreshold, are issues of severability and ripeness.\r\n\n     We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs' attack on the\r\n\n\"electioneering \r                           message\" \r                                   provisions of the regulation should be\r\n\nremanded for further proceedings in the district court.   For\r\n\nthe same reason, we leave it to the district court to  decide\r\n\nwhether, \r                    in \r                       the first instance, temporary relief against these\r\n\nprovisions is warranted  pendente lite.  Indeed, the FEC  may\r\n\nprefer to defer enforcement of these provisions for the  time\r\n\nbeing, if  it seeks certiorari  on the  other issues  decided\r\n\ntoday.\r\n\n     Our discussion leads us  to modify the district  court's\r\n\njudgment \r                    as \r                       follows: the voting record regulation, 11 C.F.R. S\r\n\n114.4(c)(4), is declared invalid only insofar as the FEC  may\r\n\n                            -19-\r                                        -19-\r\r\n\npurport \r                   to \r                      prohibit \r                              mere \r                                   inquiries to candidates, and the voter\r\n\nguide regulation, id. S 114.4(c)(5), is declared invalid only\r\n\ninsofar as it  limits any contact with candidates to  written\r\n\ninquiries \r                     and \r                        replies \r                                and imposes an equal space and prominence\r\n\nrestriction.  The  validity of  the \"electioneering  message\"\r\n\nprovisions of the latter  regulation is remanded for  further\r\n\nproceedings in accordance with this opinion.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r\n\n                                Dissent follows.\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                        -20-\r\r\n\n          BOWNES,   Senior   Circuit    Judge,   dissenting. \r\n\n          I dissent because  I disagree  with the  majority's\r\n\nholding  that   the  FEC's  written-contact-only   regulation\r\n\ninfringes the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.\r\n\nEven where governmental  regulations have \"the potential  for\r\n\nsubstantially infringing  the  exercise  of  First  Amendment\r\n\nrights,\" the Supreme Court  has \"acknowledged that there  are\r\n\ngovernmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the\r\n\npossibility  of  infringement,  particularly  when  the  free\r\n\nfunctioning \r                       of \r                         our \r                             national institutions is involved.\"  Buckley\r\n\nv.

I believe\r\n\nthe FEC has successfully navigated a safe path between  these\r\n\ncompeting \r                     concerns, and has achieved a reasonable prophylactic\r\n\nmeasure \r                   while complying with the Court's teachings.  The Court\r\n\nitself \r                  has, \r                       over the years, grown more and more concerned with\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                        -21-\r\r\n\n\"domination of the  political process\"  by corporate  wealth.\r\n\nAustin v.  Michigan Chamber of  Commerce, 494  U.S. 652,  659\r\n\n(1990). \r                    \r                    I \r                      believe the written-contact-only requirement in the\r\n\nFEC's  voter guide  regulation  fits comfortably  within  the\r\n\nCourt's guidelines   because its  burdens on First  Amendment\r\n\nfreedoms are  among those the Court  is willing to permit  in\r\n\norder to achieve compelling governmental interests like those\r\n\nat issue here,  and the requirement  is narrowly tailored  to\r\n\nachieve that interest.\r\n\n          The \r                         majority \r                                  strikes down the FEC's written-contact-\r\n\nonly rule, citing virtually no authority for its position.  I\r\n\nrecognize that the plaintiff, Maine Right to Life  Committee,\r\n\nInc. (MRTLC), has articulated a First Amendment interest, but\r\n\nin my  view  that interest  is outweighed  by the  compelling\r\n\ngovernmental interest in preventing corruption and  corporate\r\n\ndomination of  the political  process.   The majority,  after\r\n\nfinding  a First  Amendment  interest,  fails  altogether  in\r\n\npursuing this  next step in  the appropriate First  Amendment\r\n\nanalysis.  \r\n\n          I \r                       believe \r                               that \r                                   the \r                                       prophylactic measures contained in\r\n\nthe FEC's  regulation are  narrowly tailored  to achieve  the\r\n\npermissible \r                       end:  they do not preclude all oral discussions of\r\n\nissues between groups like MRTLC and electoral candidates, as\r\n\nthe majority states, see ante at 12-13 &amp; n.3.  The regulation\r\n\ndeals only with oral  discussions relating to preparation  of\r\n\n                            -22-\r                                        -22-\r\r\n\nvoter guides.  Generally speaking, MRTLC is free to have  all\r\n\nthe oral discussions that it wishes with candidates,  whether\r\n\nmotivated by a desire to lobby, to persuade, to debate, or to\r\n\nclarify.  The only  limitation is that MRTLC not combine  its\r\n\noral \"issue advocacy\" with a discussion of its plans to spend\r\n\nsignificant amounts of money to prepare and disseminate voter\r\n\nguides.  \"[T]here  is a vast difference between lobbying  and\r\n\ndebating \r                    public \r                          issues \r                                 on the one hand, and political campaigns\r\n\nfor \r               election \r                        to public office on the other.\"  Austin, 494 U.S.\r\n\nat 678 (Stevens, J., concurring).  \r\n\n          The \r                         majority \r                                  has set up a straw man and then shot it\r\n\ndown, without  reliance on any  relevant authority.

Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27.  Although the  Court\r\n\ndecided \r                   a \r                     number of cases governing campaign finance law prior\r\n\nto Buckley,5 and although Buckley dealt only with individuals\r\n\nand unincorporated associations and not with corporations  as\r\n\nplaintiff MRTLC  is here, Buckley  is usually  viewed as  the\r\n\nstarting point in any analysis of election law.  Buckley  was\r\n\nalso the first case to interpret the statute applicable here,\r\n\nthe Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended in 1974,  which\r\n\nsignificantly\r                         tightened federal election campaign financing in\r\n\nthe wake of the Watergate scandals.\r\n\n          The Court began its  analysis by noting that  money\r\n\nspent on communication was the equivalent of speech  itself.6\r\n\n5.  The Court has recounted some of the long prior history of\r\nlegislation regulating campaign financing in FEC v. National\r\nRight to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197, 208-09 (1982); Pipefitters\r\nv. United States, 407 U.S. 385, 402-12 (1972); United States\r\nv. Automobile Workers, 352 U.S. 567, 570-87 (1957).\r\n\n6.  Experience has demonstrated that Buckley may have been\r\ntoo hasty in equating money with speech.  Buckley began with\r\nthe premise that \"[d]iscussion of public issues and debate on\r\nthe qualifications of candidates are integral to the\r\n\n                            -26-\r                                        -26-\r\r\n\nTherefore  the   Court   recognized   that   limitations   on\r\n\ncontributions\r\n\noperation of [our] system of government.\"  424 U.S. at 14. \r\n\noffice is essential.\"      at 14-15.  \"The First Amendment\r            This is because, in a republic such as ours, \"the ability of\r                           impinged upon  First Amendment  values in  the\r            the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for\r                                   Id.\r\naffords the broadest protection to such political expression\r\nin order to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for\r\nthe bringing about of political and social changes desired by\r\nthe people.\"  Id. at 14.  Because \"virtually every means of\r\ncommunicating ideas in today's mass society requires the\r\nexpenditure of money,\" the Court in Buckley concluded that\r\n\"[a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group can\r\nspend on political communication during a campaign\r\nnecessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting\r\nthe number of issues discussed, the depth of their\r\nexploration, and the size of the audience reached.\"  Id. at\r\n19.  \r\n\n          In reality, however, Buckley's equation of money\r\nand speech does not serve the goal of ensuring that the best\r\nideas emerge from a true (and fair) competition among\r\ndiffering viewpoints.  Rather than rewarding people or\r\ncandidates who put forward good ideas, this system rewards\r\npeople who happen to control vast amounts of money.  In light\r\nof the uneven playing field created by the unequal\r\ndistribution of income and wealth in our society, some people\r\ncan afford to purchase more of the high-cost means of speech\r\nthan can other people.  The Court has recognized that\r\nfinancial considerations \"may make the difference between\r\nparticipating and not participating in some public debate.\" \r\nSee City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 57 (1994).  Thus,\r\n\"however neutral the government's intentions in enacting a\r\nlaw, the operation of that law may have a vastly uneven\r\nimpact.  There is no equality in a law prohibiting both rich\r\nand poor from sleeping under the bridges of Paris.\"  NAACP,\r\nWestern Region v. City of Richmond, 743 F.2d 1346, 1356 (9th\r\nCir. 1984) (alluding to the famous aphorism of Anatole\r\nFrance); see also Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 23 (1956)\r\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring) (same).  Therefore, we must\r\ncarefully scrutinize even facially neutral laws if their\r\neffects on speech \"fall unevenly on different viewpoints and\r\ngroups in society.\"  City of Richmond, 743 F.2d at 1356.

Id. at 659.   It\r\n\nrecognized that the government  has a compelling interest  in\r\n\neliminating from the political  process a \"different type  of\r\n\ncorruption\" \r                       as well:  \"the corrosive and distorting effects of\r\n\nimmense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with  the\r\n\nhelp  of  the corporate  form  and  that have  little  or  no\r\n\ncorrelation  to the  public's support  for the  corporation's\r\n\npolitical ideas.\"  Id. at 660; see id. at 666.  It is because\r\n\nthe state confers  on corporations legal advantages  enabling\r\n\nthem  to  amass   abundant  \"war  chests\"  that  it  is   not\r\n\nunconstitutional for  the  government  to  limit  independent\r\n\nexpenditures by corporations.

The regulation itself was substantially\r\n\ndifferent from the current regulation, containing  provisions\r\n\n11.  The Court held that the plaintiff Chamber of Commerce in\r\nAustin did not fall within the narrow class of corporations\r\nthat Mass. Citizens exempted from this general rule.  The\r\nCourt emphasized the fact that the Chamber \"accepts money\r\nfrom for-profit corporations\" which \"therefore could\r\ncircumvent the Act's restriction [on their campaign\r\nexpenditures] by funneling money through the Chamber's\r\ngeneral treasury\" if the statutory limitations were not\r\napplied to the Chamber.

The three-Justice\r\n\nplurality \r                     stated that the determination of coordination with a\r\n\ncandidate is  a factual matter, and  cannot be presumed as  a\r\n\nmatter of law.  Two dissenting Justices would have upheld the\r\n\nFEC's presumption and found it constitutional.\r\n\n          On the  other hand, four  Justices agreed with  the\r\n\nColorado Republican Party  that, due to  the special role  of\r\n\npolitical \r                     parties in our electoral system, the First Amendment\r\n\nforbids congressional efforts to limit a party's  coordinated\r\n\nexpenditures  as well  as  independent expenditures.    Those\r\n\nJustices would have stricken such limitations on their face. \r\n\n          This position was rejected  by the majority of  the\r\n\nCourt.  The three-Justice plurality reached its conclusion on\r\n\nan  as-applied basis,  explicitly refusing  to entertain  the\r\n\nfacial  challenge.

The regulation covers both corporations and labor\r\nunions.  Because MRTLC is a corporation, I will refer only to\r\ncorporations in the ensuing discussion.\r\n\n16.

Since this is true for  individuals\r\n\nand unincorporated organizations  like political parties,  it\r\n\nshould be  at  least as  true  for corporations  whose  \"vast\r\n\nreservoirs of capital,\" Austin, 494 U.S. at 661, pose more of\r\n\na \r             threat \r                    to \r                       \"the integrity of our electoral process,\" National\r\n\nRight to Work Comm., 459 U.S. at 208 (quotation omitted), and\r\n\ntherefore \"require[] particularly careful regulation,\" id. at\r\n\n209-10.\r\n\n                            -44-\r                                        -44-\r\r\n\n          The  expenditure in  this  case occupies  a  middle\r\n\nground:  MRTLC's spending on voter guides is not  contributed\r\n\ndirectly to candidates but is not totally independent either.\r\n\nIt \r              is \r                 coordinated \r                            with \r                                 the candidate to some degree.  MRTLC may\r\n\nbe  correct  that  this  is  not  exactly  identical  to  the\r\n\ncoordination that exists  when an  organization buys  $20,000\r\n\nworth of food for a  campaign rally, but it does entail  some\r\n\naspects \r                   of \r                      what is ordinarily thought of as coordination.  See\r\n\nRandom House Dictionary  of the English Language 447 (2d  ed.\r\n\n1987) (\"act[ing] in harmonious combination\").  And, as I will\r\n\ndiscuss shortly, it poses some of the same kinds of danger of\r\n\ncorruption and distortion of the election process.  With this\r\n\nin-between \r                      level of coordination, the question here is whether\r\n\nthe \r               degree \r                      of coordination between MRTLC and the candidates in\r\n\npreparing the voter  guides is sufficient to treat the  money\r\n\nspent to produce and distribute the guides as a  contribution\r\n\nand therefore regulable,  taking into account  constitutional\r\n\nrequirements.  See Colorado Republican, 116 S. Ct. at 2320.\r\n\n          I agree with  the majority that the  constitutional\r\n\nissue \r                 cannot \r                        be avoided by resort to statutory interpretation.\r\n\nThe \r               district \r                        court \r                             was \r                                 mistaken to conclude that the FEC has no\r\n\nauthority to interpret S  441b as it has, simply because  the\r\n\nstatute does not contain a provision specifically authorizing\r\n\nthis particular interpretation.   The Act generally  empowers\r\n\n(indeed, \r                    requires) the FEC to promulgate rules and regulations\r\n\n                            -45-\r                                        -45-\r\r\n\n\"to carry out  the provisions of [the]  Act,\" 2 U.S.C.

See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844.   I turn\r\n\nnow \r               to \r                  the \r                     question \r                              whether the statute is constitutional as so\r\n\ninterpreted.  \r\n\n          As already  noted, plaintiff  MRTLC challenges  the\r\n\nFEC's interpretation on  its face, not  as-applied.

Rust,  500 U.S. at  183.\r\n\nThis the plaintiff  cannot do:   MRTLC itself exemplifies  an\r\n\norganization to which the written-contact-only regulation, 11\r\n\nC.F.R. S 114.4(c)(5)(ii)(A), may constitutionally be applied.\r\n\nMRTLC's \r                   expenditure on voter guides is not totally independent\r\n\nof the candidates, which would be necessary to be entitled to\r\n\nthe full  protection of  Buckley and its  progeny.   It is  a\r\n\ncoordinated expenditure that is legitimately treated as if it\r\n\nwere a contribution and, as such, may be regulated by the FEC\r\n\nunder FECA, at  least by means  of this limited  prophylactic\r\n\nmeasure \r                   requiring \r                            that \r                                 MRTLC's contacts with candidates be only\r\n\nin writing.\r\n\n          \"When deciding  whether  a[n] .  . .  election  law\r\n\nviolates First and Fourteenth Amendment associational rights,\r\n\nwe weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the . .  .\r\n\n18.  An alternative way for the plaintiff to prevail on a\r\nfacial attack would be to demonstrate that, even though the\r\nchallenged law \"may be validly applied to the plaintiff and\r\nothers, it nevertheless is so broad that it may inhibit the\r\nconstitutionally protected speech of third parties.\"  New\r\nYork State Club Ass'n, Inc. v.

A facial overbreadth challenge\r\nis \"an exception to ordinary standing requirements\" and \"will\r\nnot succeed unless the statute is substantially overbroad,\r\nwhich requires the court to find a realistic danger that the\r\nstatute itself will significantly compromise recognized First\r\nAmendment protections of parties not before the Court.\"  Id.\r\n(quotation omitted).  In the instant case, MRTLC's brief does\r\nnot begin to meet its burden in this respect.\r\n\n                            -48-\r                                        -48-\r\r\n\nrule  imposes  on those  rights  against  the  interests  the\r\n\n[government] contends justify  that burden, and consider  the\r\n\nextent to which the  [government's] concerns make the  burden\r\n\nnecessary.\" \r                        \r                        Timmons v.

Buckley found  contribution\r\n\nlimits  to   be  \"only  a   marginal  restriction  upon   the\r\n\ncontributor's \r                         ability \r                                to \r                                   engage in free communication,\" because\r\n\n\"the transformation  of contributions  into political  debate\r\n\ninvolves speech by someone other than the contributor.\"   424\r\n\nU.S. at 20 (emphasis added). \r\n\n          Similarly \r                               in \r                                  the case at bar, to the extent MRTLC is\r\n\nseeking \r                   merely to distribute a purportedly accurate reflection\r\n\nof \r              the \r                  candid\r                        ates' views on the issues, distributing the voter\r\n\nguides \r                  is \r                     more \r                         like \r                              helping certain candidates to express their\r\n\nviews  through a  contribution,  as  distinguished  from  the\r\n\norganization's expressing its views.   The burden on  MRTLC's\r\n\nFirst Amendment rights is therefore less than it would be  if\r\n\nthe \r               voter \r                    guides \r                           purported to represent MRTLC's own views.

Austin,  494 U.S. at 669  n.1, 671 n.2.   He\r\n\nlisted \"many  avenues  of communication\"  still open  to  the\r\n\nplaintiff there (the Chamber of Commerce), which showed  that\r\n\n\"the segregated fund requirement in practice has not burdened\r\n\nsignificantly the  Chamber's speech.\"   Id. at  676 n.7;  see\r\n\nTimmons, 117 S.

The regulation's requirement that  any\r\n\ncontact with candidates be in writing is itself a  relatively\r\n\nminor  restriction,   more   analogous  to   the   disclosure\r\n\nrequirements upheld in Buckley than to Austin's limitation on\r\n\nindependent expenditures which the Court nevertheless upheld,\r\n\nalthough acknowledging that it would impose a heavy burden on\r\n\nFirst \r                 Amendment \r                           rights. \r                                   \r                                   The written-contact-only rule does not\r\n\nimpose even as much  burden on First Amendment rights as  the\r\n\nlimitations on contributions upheld in Buckley.   In contrast\r\n\n                            -50-\r                                        -50-\r\r\n\nto \r              the \r                 limitations \r                             upheld in Buckley and Austin on the absolute\r\n\namount  of  money spent,  in  the case  at  bar the  type  of\r\n\nrestriction  imposed   by  the   FEC's   written-contact-only\r\n\nregulation \r                      does \r                          not \r                              limit the quantity of speech in any way; it\r\n\nsimply specifies the manner in which the corporation consults\r\n\nwith candidates  in preparing its  voter guides.   Thus,  the\r\n\nregulation is significantly  less intrusive on MRTLC's  First\r\n\nAmendment \r                     rights than those absolute limits on the quantity of\r\n\nspeech.19  \r\n\n          The writing requirement is also content-neutral (in\r\n\nboth purpose and effect):  it does not prefer any one message\r\n\nover another in MRTLC's  voter guides, as long as the  guides\r\n\nwere prepared without any  oral contact with the  candidates.\r\n\nThe  rule  is  completely  indifferent  to  the  issues   the\r\n\ncorporation wishes to address in its voter guides and to  the\r\n\npositions the corporation  itself takes on those issues.   In\r\n\naddition, MRTLC may say anything it wants to a candidate  (or\r\n\nask any  questions it wants)  during the  preparation of  the\r\n\n19.  The Court recently rejected a claim based upon what\r\nappears to me to be a much more intrusive burden.  Timmons,\r\n117 S. Ct. at 1372.  Because the \"independent expression of a\r\npolitical party's views is core First Amendment activity,\"\r\nid. at 1369 (internal quotation marks omitted), a political\r\nparty had claimed that the state's ban on fusion candidates\r\nunconstitutionally burdened the party's right to communicate,\r\nin that the ban prevented the party from \"using the ballot to\r\ncommunicate to the public that it supports a particular\r\ncandidate\" and the ban \"shut[] off one possible avenue a\r\nparty might use to send a message to its preferred\r\ncandidate.\"  Id. at 1372.  The Court rejected the claim and\r\nupheld the ban.

The regulation does\r\n\nnot limit the content of the communication between MRTLC  and\r\n\nthe candidates, only the  manner (written or non-written)  in\r\n\nwhich such communication is effectuated.20  \r\n\n          Moreover, as  in Austin,  the  written-contact-only\r\n\nregulation applies only to the organization's use of  general\r\n\ntreasury funds; it does not apply at all to PAC money from  a\r\n\nseparate \r                    segregated \r                              fund.  If MRTLC were willing to comply with\r\n\nthe \r               reporting and other requirements by which the FEC monitors\r\n\nordinary \r                    corporate PACs, then it would not have to comply with\r\n\nthe  challenged restriction.21    In addition,  the  written-\r\n\ncontact-only \r                        rule does not apply at all to totally independent\r\n\nissue advocacy  to the  public, upon  which Austin  permitted\r\n\nrestrictions.  If  MRTLC engaged in no consultation with  the\r\n\ncandidates \r                      at all, it could publish voter guides, even pay for\r\n\nthem \r                out \r                    of \r                      its \r                          general \r                                  corporate treasury, advocating whatever\r\n\nposition it wanted to,  on any issue, as  long as it did  not\r\n\nexpressly  advocate  the election  or  defeat  of  a  clearly\r\n\n20.  Other portions of the voter guide regulation, S\r\n114.4(c)(5)(ii)(B)-(E), do contain restrictions on contents -\r\n- forbidding guides that devote more prominence to one\r\ncandidate than another or that contain an electioneering\r\nmessage.  The written-contact-only rule, S\r\n114.4(c)(5)(ii)(A), however, does not contain content-based\r\nrequirements.\r\n\n21.  Corporations may use general treasury funds (as well as\r\nPAC funds) to finance communications with their members,\r\nstockholders, and executive and administrative personnel, on\r\nany subject.  2 U.S.C.

Id. at 659.  \r\n\n          Surely, then,  the same  concerns are  sufficiently\r\n\ncompelling where, as here, corporate wealth is deployed in an\r\n\nin-between \r                      form, \r                           i.e., \r                                 spending that is not totally independent\r\n\nbut rather  entails  some  degree of  coordination  with  the\r\n\ncandidates. \r                        \r                        The majority protects the freedom of corporations\r\n\nto meet face-to-face  with a candidate, in order to  secretly\r\n\nplan the content  and presentation of  voter guides that  the\r\n\ncorporation will distribute  to the public.   I believe  this\r\n\nconcern \r                   should be secondary to protecting the integrity of our\r\n\nelectoral  process.   See  Buckley,  424  U.S. at  66.    The\r\n\ngovernment has a  compelling interest in taking  prophylactic\r\n\nmeasures to  prevent the coercion  and corruption that  would\r\n\narise if a corporation like MRTLC offered to provide valuable\r\n\nin-kind \r                   assistance \r                             (providing expensive advertising for free)23\r\n\nto a candidate on  the condition that the candidate take  the\r\n\n23.  The candidate does not have to pay for publishing the\r\n\"voter guide,\" which can nevertheless greatly benefit his or\r\nher campaign:  the guide will highlight the candidate's pro-\r\nlife position (or the pro-choice position of his or her\r\nopponent) and will be mailed to voters who presumably share\r\nMRTLC's views on this issue.  This could save the candidate a\r\nconsiderable sum to publicize his or her positions in a\r\nfavorable light to a targeted group of voters to whom this\r\nissue is particularly important. \r\n\n                            -55-\r                                        -55-\r\r\n\nposition \r                    the \r                       corporation \r                                   demands, and to prevent the appearance\r\n\n     FEC  regulation   prohibiting  unwritten  contact   wit\r\n\n                                                            d\r            of such coercion or corruption.  \r                      The FEC is legitimately concerned about the danger.\r            The                                                         h\r            candidates was  designed to  foreclose the  abuse that  coul\r\n\npotentially arise from a corporation like MRTLC pressuring  a\r\n\ncandidate \r                     to \r                        amend his or her position on an issue, on pain of\r\n\nlosing  this  kind  of  substantial  in-kind  contribution.24\r\n\nAccording  to the  FEC,  a  prophylactic rule  is  needed  so\r\n\ncorporations  do not  induce candidates  to change  positions\r\n\nmerely \r                  because they need the money to finance their campaigns,\r\n\neven if they do not actually  agree with the change.  If  the\r\n\nquestion were the FEC's authority to regulate an organization\r\n\noffering a $20,000  cash contribution to  a candidate if  she\r\n\nwould agree to change her position to one of support for  the\r\n\norganization's position on a particular piece of legislation,\r\n\nthere would be no question of the FEC's authority to regulate\r\n\nthe \r               organization. \r                              \r                             I \r                               see \r                                   no reason why the result should not be\r\n\n24.  Prior to Buckley, when contributors could give money to\r\na campaign either through direct contributions or independent\r\nexpenditures, they usually chose the direct route.  But since\r\nthe Buckley decision, which foreclosed that route (for\r\nexpenditures beyond certain limits), they have had to find\r\nother ways to financially benefit the candidate's campaign by\r\ngiving independently.  \"It would naively underestimate the\r\ningenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring\r\nto buy influence to believe that they would have much\r\ndifficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction\r\non express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless\r\nbenefited the candidate's campaign.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 45.\r\n\n                            -56-\r                                        -56-\r\r\n\nthe same if the organization offers instead $20,000 worth  of\r\n\npamphlets presenting the candidate's view on this issue in  a\r\n\nfavorable, rather than an unfavorable, light.  \r\n\n          Consider the following  scenario.  An  organization\r\n\nconsults with a candidate regarding his or her plans or needs\r\n\nin the campaign, and then  says to the candidate:  \"You  have\r\n\nstated \r                  the \r                      position you believe in, but we disagree with it in\r\n\ncertain respects.

(quotation omitted).  The  written-contact-\r\n\nonly regulation is likewise sufficiently narrowly tailored.\r\n\n          I \r                       conclude \r                                that the FEC may construe a corporation's\r\n\ncontact \r                   with \r                        candidates in the preparation of a voter guide as\r\n\n\"coordination\" with  the candidates.   Therefore the FEC  may\r\n\ntreat \r                 the \r                     expenditure of money on those voter guides as an in-\r\n\nkind \r                contribution \r                             to \r                               the \r                                   candidates.  In this context, the need\r\n\nfor a prophylactic rule is sufficient to justify the  limited\r\n\nrestriction imposed by the written-contact-only regulation.\r\n\n          I am mindful that MRTLC's challenge here is facial,\r\n\nnot \r               as-applied. \r                            \r                           MRTLC \r                                 is not asking us to consider whether the\r\n\nwritten-contact-only \r                                rule\r                                    is unconstitutional as applied to it.\r\n\nTherefore, \r                      I \r                        do not consider whether, if a full factual record\r\n\nwere before us, MRTLC might be able to show that it is not in\r\n\nfact a  conduit for  corporate  wealth.   Thus, even  if  the\r\n\nregulation would be unconstitutional as applied to someone, a\r\n\nfacial \r                  challenge like the present one must fail where even the\r\n\nplaintiff appears to exemplify a situation where the written-\r\n\ncontact-only regulation may constitutionally be applied.  Cf.\r\n\nAustin, 494 U.S. at 674 n.4 (Brennan, J., concurring).\r\n\n                         Conclusion\r\n\n          I \r                       believe \r                               that the majority has misstated the thrust\r\n\nof \r              the \r                 FEC's \r                       written-contact-only regulation.

True,  one could say  that it is  regulating\r\n\nissue advocacy while claiming to regulate contributions.  But\r\n\nin a  sense the FEC is doing  both at the same time; and  the\r\n\nstatute, \r                    it \r                       should be noted, does not itself forbid reasonable\r\n\nregulation of contributions that happens also to burden issue\r\n\nadvocacy. \r                      \r                      As \r                        a \r                          statutory matter, the Act simply stops short of\r\n\nprohibiting issue advocacy.

In  Massachusetts\r\n\nCitizens, the Supreme Court not only narrowed section 441b by\r\n\nconstruction but also recognized  a First Amendment right  to\r\n\nissue advocacy, on behalf  of a nonprofit corporation  fairly\r\n\nsimilar \r                   to \r                      the \r                         Maine \r                               Committee, that extends to the publication\r\n\nof voter guides.  479 U.S. at 263. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     The difficulty is  that in that  same case, the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt stressed as \"essential\" the fact that the anti-abortion\r\n\n                       not accept contributions from business\r\n\n orporations \r                        or \r                           unions. \r                                   \r                                   Id. at 264.

Whether  the  curtailment  goes  too  far  as   a\r\n\nconstitutional matter need not be decided:  it is enough that\r\n\nit undermines the FEC's claim of authority for its rules.\r\n\n     Starting with the FEC rule requiring substantially equal\r\n\nspace \r                 and \r                     prominence, we begin with the proposition that where\r\n\npublic  issues are  involved,  government  agencies  are  not\r\n\ndecisions.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nnormally \r                    empowered \r                             to \r                                impose and police requirements as to what\r\n\np\r\n\n                                                            s\r\n\nabhorrent to the First  Amendment, whether the compulsion  is\r\n\ndirected against individuals or corporations.2  And while  no\r\n\ncase \r                is \r                   an \r                      exact match for this one, Miami Herald comes pretty\r\n\nclose.\r\n\n     There, the Supreme Court struck down Florida's \"right of\r\n\nreply\" statute that  guaranteed a  political candidate  equal\r\n\nspace \r                 to \r                    reply to newspaper attacks or criticism.  418 U.S. at\r\n\n256.  The  Court said that even  if no additional costs  were\r\n\nimposed by \"compulsory access,\" nevertheless\r\n\n     [t]he \r                      choice \r                             of material to go into a newspaper, and\r\n                  made as to limitations on the size and\r             rivate \r                   citizens may say or write.

We assume  a\r\n\nlegitimate \r                      FEC interest in preventing disguised contributions;\r\n\nbut Florida's  interest in  fair coverage  that prompted  its\r\n\n\"right \r                  of \r                     reply\" \r                           statute \r                                   was hardly trivial.  The point is that\r\n\nthe \r               interest \r                       cannot \r                              normally be secured by compelling a private\r\n\nentity  to express  particular views  or by  requiring it  to\r\n\nprovide \"balance\" or equal space or an opportunity to appear.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Hurley, 115 S. Ct. at 2347; Miami Herald, 418 U.S.\r\n\nat 256.\r\n\n     First \r                      Amendment concerns may be less where the government\r\n\nrequires balance or access than where it dictates the precise\r\n\nviewpoint \r                     to \r                       be \r                          expressed. But, unlike \"time, place and manner\"\r\n\nlimitations, the FEC's equal space or prominence requirement,\r\n\neven if mechanically applied, does affect the content of  the\r\n\nMaine Committee's  voting guide.   Thus, the Maine  Committee\r\n\ncould be compelled to devote substantial space to  describing\r\n\nthe \r               position \r                        of a candidate with whom it deeply disagrees.  As\r\n\nthe Supreme Court said  unanimously in Hurley, 115 S. Ct.  at\r\n\n2347:\r\n\n     this \r                     general \r                             rule, that the speaker has the right to\r\n     tailor the speech, applies not only to  expressions\r\n     of value, opinion,  or endorsement, but equally  to\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r\n\n     statements of fact  that the  speaker would  rather\r\n     avoid, McIntyre, . . . Riley . . . .\r\n\n     Few, if any, rights are absolute, but there is a  strong\r\n\nFirst   Amendment   presumption   against   content-affecting\r\n\ngovernment \r                      regulation \r                                of \r                                   private citizen speech, even where the\r\n\ngovernment \r                      does \r                          not \r                              dictate the viewpoint.

Indeed, even for broadcasters and cable  monopolies,\r\n\nthe Supreme Court has upheld equal coverage and \"must  carry\"\r\n\nprovisions \r                      only \r                          because \r                                  of the unique control that broadcasters\r\n\nand cable operators have  over public access to  programming.\r\n\nTurner Broadcasting Sys.,  Inc. v.

That rationale has no conceivable application to the\r\n\nMaine Committee.\r\n\n     The other rule principally at issue is the limitation on\r\n\noral contact with candidates.  We think that this is patently\r\n\noffensive to the First  Amendment in a different aspect:   it\r\n\ntreads heavily  upon  the right  of citizens,  individual  or\r\n\ncorporate, to  confer and discuss  public matters with  their\r\n\nlegislative \r                       representatives or candidates for such office.  As\r\n\nwe have explained,  the regulations  bar non-written  contact\r\n\nregarding  the  contents,  not  merely  the  preparation  and\r\n\ndistribution,  of voter  guides  and  voting  records;  thus,\r\n\ninquiries \r                     to \r                       candidates \r                                  and incumbents about their positions on\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                        -12-\r\r\n\nissues \r                  like \r                       abortion \r                               are \r                                   a precise target of the FEC's rules as\r\n\napplied here.3  \r\n\n     It is hard to find direct precedent only because efforts\r\n\nto \r              restrict \r                       this right to communicate freely are so rare.  But\r\n\nwe think that it is beyond reasonable belief that, to prevent\r\n\ncorruption or  illicit  coordination,  the  government  could\r\n\nprohibit voluntary  discussions  between citizens  and  their\r\n\nlegislators  and  candidates on  public  issues.    The  only\r\n\ndifference between such an  outright ban and the FEC rule  is\r\n\nthat the FEC permits  discussion so long as both sides  limit\r\n\nthemselves to writing.  Both principle and practicality  make\r\n\nthis an inadequate distinction.\r\n\n     It \r                   is \r                      no \r                         business of executive branch agencies to dictate\r\n\nthe  form  in  which free  citizens  can  confer  with  their\r\n\nlegislative representatives.   Further, the restriction is  a\r\n\nreal handicap on  intercourse:  the nuances of positions  and\r\n\nvotes can often be discerned only through oral discussion; as\r\n\nany \r               courtroom \r                        lawyer \r                               knows, stilted written interrogatories and\r\n\nanswers \r                   are \r                      no \r                         substitute for cross-examination.  A ban on oral\r\n\ncommunication\r                        , solely for prophylactic reasons, is not readily\r\n\ndefensible.\r\n\n     3Indeed, the chilling effect of such a restriction would\r\nextend well beyond any discussion directed to a particular\r\nvoter guide; any inquiry by the Maine Committee to a local\r\nrepresentative or candidate regarding his or her position on\r\nsuch issues would be vulnerable even if no mention whatever\r\nwere made of any voter guide.  Cf. Riley, 487 U.S. at 794. \r\n\n                            -13-\r                                        -13-\r\r\n\n     The Supreme Court has echoed this view, albeit in dicta.\r\n\nIn  upholding  the Attorney  General's  refusal  to  grant  a\r\n\ntemporary visa to a foreign journalist invited to participate\r\n\nin academic conferences in the United States, the Court said,\r\n\n     The  Government  also   suggests  that  the   First\r\n     Amendment is  inapplicable because  appellees  have\r\n     free access to Mandel's ideas through his books and\r\n     speeches, and because \"technological developments,\"\r\n     such  as  tapes  or  telephone  hook-ups,   readily\r\n     supplant his  physical  presence.    This  argument\r\n     overlooks what may be particular qualities inherent\r\n     in sustained,  face-to-face debate, discussion  and\r\n     questioning.  . . .

If the FEC\r\n\ndoes read  its regulation in this  fashion, it would to  this\r\n\nextent \r                  raise \r                        the same constitutional concern about access, and\r\n\nreflect the same  unauthorized use  of rulemaking  authority.\r\n\nThis  declaration ought  to  satisfy  the  Maine  Committee's\r\n\nlegitimate concern about misuse of the regulation.\r\n\n     Finally, \r                         in \r                            two paragraphs at the close of its brief, the\r\n\nMaine \r                 Committee \r                          also \r                               asserts that the voter guide regulation is\r\n\nunconstitutionally vague  in its  dual ban  on including  \"an\r\n\nelectioneering message\" in  a voter guide  and on seeking  to\r\n\n\"score or rate the candidates' responses in such a way as  to\r\n\nconvey   an    electioneering    message.\"       11    C.F.R.\r\n\nSS 114.4(c)(5)(ii)(D), (E).

It then points to its \"advisory\r\n\nopinion \r                   process\" as a method for obtaining clarification.  The\r\n\nFEC  also  says  that  the  Maine  Committee's  argument   is\r\n\nperfunctory.   It  is, but  so is  the FEC's  reply, and  the\r\n\nsubstance  of the  Maine  Committee's  concern--vagueness--is\r\n\nreadily apparent.\r\n\n     The \r                    FEC \r                        might \r                             have \r                                  argued that \"electioneering message\" is\r\n\nsimply \r                  another \r                         version \r                                 of the ban on express advocacy upheld by\r\n\nthe Supreme Court.  But the FEC has conspicuously declined to\r\n\nmake \r                that \r                     argument.  Nor is it clear why, if the FEC meant the\r\n\nphrase \r                  to \r                     be \r                       limited \r                               to \r                                  express advocacy, it did not simply use\r\n\nthose words, which are  used in a different provision of  the\r\n\nsame regulation, 11 C.F.R. S 114.4(c)(5)(i), and also in  the\r\n\nvoting \r                  records \r                         regulation.  We are thus entitled to assume that\r\n\n\"electioneering message\" has a different, broader meaning.\r\n\n     The \r                    district \r                             court expressly declined to reach the issue,\r\n\n927 F.

But\r\n\nthe \r               district \r                        court opinion did not explain why and, if the FEC\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                        -18-\r\r\n\nwants \r                 to \r                   assert \r                          severability (its position is not revealed), an\r\n\nargument can be made that the electioneering message ban,  if\r\n\nvalid,  can stand on its own two  feet.

The  Supreme Court's treatment of  related\r\n\nvagueness  issues  in  Buckley,   424  U.S.  at  40-44,   and\r\n\nMassachusetts Citizens, 479 U.S. at 248-49, suggests that the\r\n\nvagueness attack is not frivolous, but those cases differ  in\r\n\nvarious respects from  this one on the  merits.  And, at  the\r\n\nthreshold, are issues of severability and ripeness.\r\n\n     We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs' attack on the\r\n\n\"electioneering \r                           message\" \r                                   provisions of the regulation should be\r\n\nremanded for further proceedings in the district court.   For\r\n\nthe same reason, we leave it to the district court to  decide\r\n\nwhether, \r                    in \r                       the first instance, temporary relief against these\r\n\nprovisions is warranted  pendente lite.

I\r\n\nrecognize that the plaintiff, Maine Right to Life  Committee,\r\n\nInc. (MRTLC), has articulated a First Amendment interest, but\r\n\nin my  view  that interest  is outweighed  by the  compelling\r\n\ngovernmental interest in preventing corruption and  corporate\r\n\ndomination of  the political  process.   The majority,  after\r\n\nfinding  a First  Amendment  interest,  fails  altogether  in\r\n\npursuing this  next step in  the appropriate First  Amendment\r\n\nanalysis.  \r\n\n          I \r                       believe \r                               that \r                                   the \r                                       prophylactic measures contained in\r\n\nthe FEC's  regulation are  narrowly tailored  to achieve  the\r\n\npermissible \r                       end:  they do not preclude all oral discussions of\r\n\nissues between groups like MRTLC and electoral candidates, as\r\n\nthe majority states, see ante at 12-13 &amp; n.3.

Generally speaking, MRTLC is free to have  all\r\n\nthe oral discussions that it wishes with candidates,  whether\r\n\nmotivated by a desire to lobby, to persuade, to debate, or to\r\n\nclarify.  The only  limitation is that MRTLC not combine  its\r\n\noral \"issue advocacy\" with a discussion of its plans to spend\r\n\nsignificant amounts of money to prepare and disseminate voter\r\n\nguides.  \"[T]here  is a vast difference between lobbying  and\r\n\ndebating \r                    public \r                          issues \r                                 on the one hand, and political campaigns\r\n\nfor \r               election \r                        to public office on the other.\"  Austin, 494 U.S.\r\n\nat 678 (Stevens, J., concurring).  \r\n\n          The \r                         majority \r                                  has set up a straw man and then shot it\r\n\ndown, without  reliance on any  relevant authority.

Experience has demonstrated that Buckley may have been\r\ntoo hasty in equating money with speech.  Buckley began with\r\nthe premise that \"[d]iscussion of public issues and debate on\r\nthe qualifications of candidates are integral to the\r\n\n                            -26-\r                                        -26-\r\r\n\nTherefore  the   Court   recognized   that   limitations   on\r\n\ncontributions\r\n\noperation of [our] system of government.\"  424 U.S. at 14. \r\n\noffice is essential.\"      at 14-15.  \"The First Amendment\r            This is because, in a republic such as ours, \"the ability of\r                           impinged upon  First Amendment  values in  the\r            the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for\r                                   Id.\r\naffords the broadest protection to such political expression\r\nin order to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas for\r\nthe bringing about of political and social changes desired by\r\nthe people.\"  Id. at 14.  Because \"virtually every means of\r\ncommunicating ideas in today's mass society requires the\r\nexpenditure of money,\" the Court in Buckley concluded that\r\n\"[a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group can\r\nspend on political communication during a campaign\r\nnecessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting\r\nthe number of issues discussed, the depth of their\r\nexploration, and the size of the audience reached.\"  Id. at\r\n19.  \r\n\n          In reality, however, Buckley's equation of money\r\nand speech does not serve the goal of ensuring that the best\r\nideas emerge from a true (and fair) competition among\r\ndiffering viewpoints.  Rather than rewarding people or\r\ncandidates who put forward good ideas, this system rewards\r\npeople who happen to control vast amounts of money.

Nevertheless, in order\r\n\nto  avoid  vagueness  problems,  the  Court  limited   FECA's\r\n\nprohibition  on  independent   expenditures  to  only   those\r\n\nexpenditures which involved express advocacy.

Id. at 51.  In analyzing the\r\n\nFirst  Amendment  considerations,   the  Court  stated   that\r\n\nexpenditure  limitations  impose  greater  burdens  on  basic\r\n\nfreedoms \r                    than do contribution limits, and do not accomplish as\r\n\nmuch to further  the goals of  eliminating the potential  for\r\n\nabuse and quid pro quo corruption.

Expenditures that  are \"coordinated\" with  a\r\n\ncandidate or  his/her campaign  -- which  are the  functional\r\n\nequivalent of an in-kind contribution to the candidate -- are\r\n\ntreated as direct contributions to the candidate, rather than\r\n\nas independent expenditures, in order to \"prevent attempts to\r\n\ncircumvent  the  Act   through  prearranged  or   coordinated\r\n\nexpenditures \r                        amounting \r                                 to disguised contributions.\"  Id. at 46-\r\n\n47.  This is true regardless of whether the expenditure  pays\r\n\nfor speech containing express advocacy of a candidate.

The Court  \"acknowledge[d]\r\n\nthe legitimacy of  Congress' concern that organizations  that\r\n\namass \r                 great \r                       wealth in the economic marketplace not gain unfair\r\n\nadvantage in the political  marketplace.\"  Id. at 263.   This\r\n\nconcern \r                   is \r                      reflected in S 441b's \"require[ment] that corporate\r\n\nindependent expenditures  be  financed  through  a  political\r\n\ncommittee  expressly  established   to  engage  in   campaign\r\n\nspending,\" in order to \"prevent this threat to the  political\r\n\nmarketplace.\"\r                          Id. at 258.  In order to avoid overbreadth, the\r\n\nCourt defined independent  expenditures governed by S441b  to\r\n\ninclude only express advocacy of the election or defeat of  a\r\n\ncandidate.  Id. at 249.\r\n\n          The Court left open the question whether the  First\r\n\nAmendment \r                     permits it to uphold S 441b's general rule -- that a\r\n\ncorporation must  utilize  a voluntary  PAC rather  than  its\r\n\ngeneral \r                   treasury \r                           funds \r                                 for independent campaign expenditures as\r\n\nwell as for direct contributions to candidates.  Instead, the\r\n\nCourt carved  a narrow exception  out of  this general  rule,\r\n\nholding its  prohibition  on use  of general  treasury  funds\r\n\n                            -34-\r                                        -34-\r\r\n\nunconstitutional \r                           as \r                              applied to the narrow class of corporations\r\n\nexemplified by  the  plaintiff in  MCFL,9 even  though  those\r\n\ncorporations  remained free  to  speak in  unlimited  amounts\r\n\nthrough a separate segregated fund (as opposed to using funds\r\n\nfrom the corporate treasury).  \r\n\n          To \r                        fall \r                             within \r                                   the \r                                       exception, a corporation must have\r\n\nthree \r                 characteristics, each of which is \"essential,\" MCFL, 479\r\n\nU.S. \r                at \r                   263: \r                         First, it must be formed for the express purpose\r\n\nof promoting political ideas,  and cannot engage in  business\r\n\nactivities.  Second,  it must have  no shareholders or  other\r\n\npersons affiliated  who would have a  claim on its assets  or\r\n\nearnings.   Third, it must not  be established by a  business\r\n\ncorporation \r                       or labor union, nor accept contributions from such\r\n\nentities.   Id. at  264.  The  last requirement  -- that  the\r\n\ncorporation  does  not  accept  contributions  from  business\r\n\ncorporations or  labor unions --  is \"essential,\" because  it\r\n\n\"prevents  such  [nonprofit  ideological]  corporations  from\r\n\nserving  as conduits  for the  type of  direct spending  that\r\n\ncreates \r                   a \r                     threat \r                           to \r                              the \r                                  political marketplace.\"  Id. at 263-64.\r\n\n          In \r                        Austin\r                              , \r                                494 U.S. at 659, the Court elaborated its\r\n\n\"concern about corporate domination of the political process\"\r\n\nand decided  the question left open  in Mass. Citizens.   The\r\n\nplaintiff \r                     in \r                        Austin, the Chamber of Commerce, had challenged a\r\n\n9.  \"It may be that the class of organizations affected by\r\n[the Mass.

S 441b)  prohibiting\r\n\ncorporations  from  using  treasury  funds  for   independent\r\n\nexpenditures in support of a candidate.  The Court found that\r\n\nthe \r               statute \r                       burdened political speech at the core, even though\r\n\nthe corporation  still had the  opportunity to speak  through\r\n\nPACs.10  Despite  this burden on First Amendment rights,  the\r\n\nCourt  held that  the burden  was justified  by a  compelling\r\n\ngovernmental interest  in  counteracting the  \"corrosive  and\r\n\ndistorting  effects\" of  corporate  wealth on  the  political\r\n\nelection process.  Id. at 660. \r\n\n          State \r                           law \r                              grants \r                                     corporations special privileges that\r\n\nenhance their ability to attract capital and deploy resources\r\n\nadvantageousl\r                        y.  These privileges include:  limited liability,\r\n\nperpetual \r                     life, \r                          and \r                              favorable treatment of the accumulation and\r\n\ndistribution of assets.  Id. at 658-59.  These  state-created\r\n\nadvantages enable corporations \"to use 'resources amassed  in\r\n\nthe \r               economic \r                       marketplace' to obtain 'an unfair advantage in the\r\n\npolitical marketplace.'\"  Id. at 659 (quoting Mass. Citizens,\r\n\n479 U.S. at 257).   The Court therefore has \"recognized  that\r\n\n10.  To require a corporation to use a PAC rather than\r\ngeneral corporate treasury funds would require it to comply\r\nwith a number of obligations it might find burdensome.  For\r\nexample:  PACs must designate a treasurer, keep detailed\r\naccounts of contributions, and file a statement of\r\norganization; PACs cannot use corporate funds at all; and\r\nPACs may not solicit contributions except from members,\r\nstockholders or officers.

This  interest reflects  a \"concern  about\r\n\ncorporate domination of the political process.\" Id.\r\n\n          The Court made clear that it was not talking merely\r\n\nabout \"financial quid pro quo\"  corruption.  Id. at 659.   It\r\n\nrecognized that the government  has a compelling interest  in\r\n\neliminating from the political  process a \"different type  of\r\n\ncorruption\" \r                       as well:  \"the corrosive and distorting effects of\r\n\nimmense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with  the\r\n\nhelp  of  the corporate  form  and  that have  little  or  no\r\n\ncorrelation  to the  public's support  for the  corporation's\r\n\npolitical ideas.\"  Id. at 660; see id. at 666.  It is because\r\n\nthe state confers  on corporations legal advantages  enabling\r\n\nthem  to  amass   abundant  \"war  chests\"  that  it  is   not\r\n\nunconstitutional for  the  government  to  limit  independent\r\n\nexpenditures by corporations.  Id. at 666.\r\n\n          The \r                         Court's \r                                 holding was not limited merely to direct\r\n\ncontributions to candidates.  \"Corporate wealth can  unfairly\r\n\ninfluence  elections when  it  is  deployed in  the  form  of\r\n\nindependent expenditures, just as it can when it assumes  the\r\n\nguise of political contributions.\"   Id. at 660.  The  Austin\r\n\nCourt therefore  held  \"that the  State ha[d]  articulated  a\r\n\n                            -37-\r                                        -37-\r\r\n\nsufficiently \r                        compelling \r                                  rationale to support its restriction on\r\n\n           or \r                         was \r                             this \r                                  \r            independent expenditures by corporations.\"11  Id.\r                      N           rule specifically limited to for-profit\r\n\ncorporations engaged in a commercial business enterprise.

The\r\nCourt emphasized the fact that the Chamber \"accepts money\r\nfrom for-profit corporations\" which \"therefore could\r\ncircumvent the Act's restriction [on their campaign\r\nexpenditures] by funneling money through the Chamber's\r\ngeneral treasury\" if the statutory limitations were not\r\napplied to the Chamber.

Id. at 2317-18.  The three-Justice\r\n\nplurality \r                     stated that the determination of coordination with a\r\n\ncandidate is  a factual matter, and  cannot be presumed as  a\r\n\nmatter of law.  Two dissenting Justices would have upheld the\r\n\nFEC's presumption and found it constitutional.\r\n\n          On the  other hand, four  Justices agreed with  the\r\n\nColorado Republican Party  that, due to  the special role  of\r\n\npolitical \r                     parties in our electoral system, the First Amendment\r\n\nforbids congressional efforts to limit a party's  coordinated\r\n\nexpenditures  as well  as  independent expenditures.    Those\r\n\nJustices would have stricken such limitations on their face. \r\n\n          This position was rejected  by the majority of  the\r\n\nCourt.  The three-Justice plurality reached its conclusion on\r\n\nan  as-applied basis,  explicitly refusing  to entertain  the\r\n\nfacial  challenge.   While recognizing  that restrictions  on\r\n\ncoordinated expenditures might  in some circumstances  unduly\r\n\ninfringe \r                    on \r                      constitutional rights, the plurality indicated that\r\n\nit  would uphold  such restrictions  in other  circumstances,\r\n\ndepending \r                     on \r                        the facts of the case at hand.

See David Cole, First Amendment Antitrust:  The End of\r\nLaissez-Faire in Campaign Finance, 9 Yale L. &amp; Pol'y Rev.\r\n236, 278 (1991) (arguing that courts cannot return to a\r\nlaissez-faire approach in the political field any more than\r\nthey would return to pre-Lochner laissez-faire in the\r\neconomic field, and therefore that courts should treat\r\ncampaign finance regulation as a legitimate exercise of the\r\ngovernment's First Amendment antitrust role to preserve the\r\nmarketplace of ideas). \r\n\n15.  The regulation covers both corporations and labor\r\nunions.  Because MRTLC is a corporation, I will refer only to\r\ncorporations in the ensuing discussion.\r\n\n16.

Austin, 494 U.S. at 674 n.4 (Brennan, J.,\r\nconcurring) (The \"central lesson of MCFL [is] that the First\r\nAmendment may require exemptions, on an as-applied basis,\r\nfrom expenditure restrictions\" if the organization exhibits\r\nall three of the required characteristics.) (emphasis added).\r\n\n                            -43-\r                                        -43-\r\r\n\nthe FEC's characterization of MRTLC's contact with candidates\r\n\nas \r              a \r                coordinated expenditure which, under the FECA, is treated\r\n\nas a contribution and therefore may be regulated.  Even  with\r\n\nrespect  to individuals,  Buckley created  two categories  of\r\n\ncampaign \r                    spending \r                            which \r                                  are to be treated differently.  For the\r\n\nmost \r                part, \r                      limits on contributions made to candidates or their\r\n\ncampaigns are constitutional;  limits on totally  independent\r\n\nexpenditures \r                        are not (i.e., expenditures \"not coordinated with\r\n\nthe \r               candidate or candidate's campaign\").  Colorado Republican,\r\n\n116 S.

Since this is true for  individuals\r\n\nand unincorporated organizations  like political parties,  it\r\n\nshould be  at  least as  true  for corporations  whose  \"vast\r\n\nreservoirs of capital,\" Austin, 494 U.S. at 661, pose more of\r\n\na \r             threat \r                    to \r                       \"the integrity of our electoral process,\" National\r\n\nRight to Work Comm., 459 U.S. at 208 (quotation omitted), and\r\n\ntherefore \"require[] particularly careful regulation,\" id. at\r\n\n209-10.\r\n\n                            -44-\r                                        -44-\r\r\n\n          The  expenditure in  this  case occupies  a  middle\r\n\nground:  MRTLC's spending on voter guides is not  contributed\r\n\ndirectly to candidates but is not totally independent either.\r\n\nIt \r              is \r                 coordinated \r                            with \r                                 the candidate to some degree.  MRTLC may\r\n\nbe  correct  that  this  is  not  exactly  identical  to  the\r\n\ncoordination that exists  when an  organization buys  $20,000\r\n\nworth of food for a  campaign rally, but it does entail  some\r\n\naspects \r                   of \r                      what is ordinarily thought of as coordination.  See\r\n\nRandom House Dictionary  of the English Language 447 (2d  ed.\r\n\n1987) (\"act[ing] in harmonious combination\").  And, as I will\r\n\ndiscuss shortly, it poses some of the same kinds of danger of\r\n\ncorruption and distortion of the election process.  With this\r\n\nin-between \r                      level of coordination, the question here is whether\r\n\nthe \r               degree \r                      of coordination between MRTLC and the candidates in\r\n\npreparing the voter  guides is sufficient to treat the  money\r\n\nspent to produce and distribute the guides as a  contribution\r\n\nand therefore regulable,  taking into account  constitutional\r\n\nrequirements.  See Colorado Republican, 116 S. Ct. at 2320.\r\n\n          I agree with  the majority that the  constitutional\r\n\nissue \r                 cannot \r                        be avoided by resort to statutory interpretation.\r\n\nThe \r               district \r                        court \r                             was \r                                 mistaken to conclude that the FEC has no\r\n\nauthority to interpret S  441b as it has, simply because  the\r\n\nstatute does not contain a provision specifically authorizing\r\n\nthis particular interpretation.   The Act generally  empowers\r\n\n(indeed, \r                    requires) the FEC to promulgate rules and regulations\r\n\n                            -45-\r                                        -45-\r\r\n\n\"to carry out  the provisions of [the]  Act,\" 2 U.S.C.

It is  a\r\n\ncoordinated expenditure that is legitimately treated as if it\r\n\nwere a contribution and, as such, may be regulated by the FEC\r\n\nunder FECA, at  least by means  of this limited  prophylactic\r\n\nmeasure \r                   requiring \r                            that \r                                 MRTLC's contacts with candidates be only\r\n\nin writing.\r\n\n          \"When deciding  whether  a[n] .  . .  election  law\r\n\nviolates First and Fourteenth Amendment associational rights,\r\n\nwe weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the . .  .\r\n\n18.

Buckley found  contribution\r\n\nlimits  to   be  \"only  a   marginal  restriction  upon   the\r\n\ncontributor's \r                         ability \r                                to \r                                   engage in free communication,\" because\r\n\n\"the transformation  of contributions  into political  debate\r\n\ninvolves speech by someone other than the contributor.\"   424\r\n\nU.S. at 20 (emphasis added). \r\n\n          Similarly \r                               in \r                                  the case at bar, to the extent MRTLC is\r\n\nseeking \r                   merely to distribute a purportedly accurate reflection\r\n\nof \r              the \r                  candid\r                        ates' views on the issues, distributing the voter\r\n\nguides \r                  is \r                     more \r                         like \r                              helping certain candidates to express their\r\n\nviews  through a  contribution,  as  distinguished  from  the\r\n\norganization's expressing its views.   The burden on  MRTLC's\r\n\nFirst Amendment rights is therefore less than it would be  if\r\n\nthe \r               voter \r                    guides \r                           purported to represent MRTLC's own views.

Austin,  494 U.S. at 669  n.1, 671 n.2.   He\r\n\nlisted \"many  avenues  of communication\"  still open  to  the\r\n\nplaintiff there (the Chamber of Commerce), which showed  that\r\n\n\"the segregated fund requirement in practice has not burdened\r\n\nsignificantly the  Chamber's speech.\"   Id. at  676 n.7;  see\r\n\nTimmons, 117 S. Ct. at  1371.  \"[T]here is a vast  difference\r\n\nbetween lobbying and debating public issues on the one  hand,\r\n\nand political campaigns for election to public office on  the\r\n\nother.\"  Austin, 494 U.S. at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring).\r\n\n          The burden on MRTLC's constitutional rights here is\r\n\neven less intrusive.   The regulation's requirement that  any\r\n\ncontact with candidates be in writing is itself a  relatively\r\n\nminor  restriction,   more   analogous  to   the   disclosure\r\n\nrequirements upheld in Buckley than to Austin's limitation on\r\n\nindependent expenditures which the Court nevertheless upheld,\r\n\nalthough acknowledging that it would impose a heavy burden on\r\n\nFirst \r                 Amendment \r                           rights. \r                                   \r                                   The written-contact-only rule does not\r\n\nimpose even as much  burden on First Amendment rights as  the\r\n\nlimitations on contributions upheld in Buckley.

Thus,  the\r\n\nregulation is significantly  less intrusive on MRTLC's  First\r\n\nAmendment \r                     rights than those absolute limits on the quantity of\r\n\nspeech.19  \r\n\n          The writing requirement is also content-neutral (in\r\n\nboth purpose and effect):  it does not prefer any one message\r\n\nover another in MRTLC's  voter guides, as long as the  guides\r\n\nwere prepared without any  oral contact with the  candidates.\r\n\nThe  rule  is  completely  indifferent  to  the  issues   the\r\n\ncorporation wishes to address in its voter guides and to  the\r\n\npositions the corporation  itself takes on those issues.   In\r\n\naddition, MRTLC may say anything it wants to a candidate  (or\r\n\nask any  questions it wants)  during the  preparation of  the\r\n\n19.  The Court recently rejected a claim based upon what\r\nappears to me to be a much more intrusive burden.  Timmons,\r\n117 S. Ct. at 1372.  Because the \"independent expression of a\r\npolitical party's views is core First Amendment activity,\"\r\nid. at 1369 (internal quotation marks omitted), a political\r\nparty had claimed that the state's ban on fusion candidates\r\nunconstitutionally burdened the party's right to communicate,\r\nin that the ban prevented the party from \"using the ballot to\r\ncommunicate to the public that it supports a particular\r\ncandidate\" and the ban \"shut[] off one possible avenue a\r\nparty might use to send a message to its preferred\r\ncandidate.\"  Id. at 1372.  The Court rejected the claim and\r\nupheld the ban.  Id.\r\n\n                            -51-\r                                        -51-\r\r\n\nguides, \r                   as \r                      long as it does so in writing.  The regulation does\r\n\nnot limit the content of the communication between MRTLC  and\r\n\nthe candidates, only the  manner (written or non-written)  in\r\n\nwhich such communication is effectuated.20  \r\n\n          Moreover, as  in Austin,  the  written-contact-only\r\n\nregulation applies only to the organization's use of  general\r\n\ntreasury funds; it does not apply at all to PAC money from  a\r\n\nseparate \r                    segregated \r                              fund.  If MRTLC were willing to comply with\r\n\nthe \r               reporting and other requirements by which the FEC monitors\r\n\nordinary \r                    corporate PACs, then it would not have to comply with\r\n\nthe  challenged restriction.21    In addition,  the  written-\r\n\ncontact-only \r                        rule does not apply at all to totally independent\r\n\nissue advocacy  to the  public, upon  which Austin  permitted\r\n\nrestrictions.  If  MRTLC engaged in no consultation with  the\r\n\ncandidates \r                      at all, it could publish voter guides, even pay for\r\n\nthem \r                out \r                    of \r                      its \r                          general \r                                  corporate treasury, advocating whatever\r\n\nposition it wanted to,  on any issue, as  long as it did  not\r\n\nexpressly  advocate  the election  or  defeat  of  a  clearly\r\n\n20.  Other portions of the voter guide regulation, S\r\n114.4(c)(5)(ii)(B)-(E), do contain restrictions on contents -\r\n- forbidding guides that devote more prominence to one\r\ncandidate than another or that contain an electioneering\r\nmessage.  The written-contact-only rule, S\r\n114.4(c)(5)(ii)(A), however, does not contain content-based\r\nrequirements.\r\n\n21.  Corporations may use general treasury funds (as well as\r\nPAC funds) to finance communications with their members,\r\nstockholders, and executive and administrative personnel, on\r\nany subject.  2 U.S.C.

Thus, the  burden on First  Amendment\r\n\nrights \r                  posed \r                        by the challenged regulation is relatively small.\r\n\n          Even  where  governmental  regulations  have   \"the\r\n\npotential for substantially infringing the exercise of  First\r\n\nAmendment rights,\" the Court has \"acknowledged that there are\r\n\ngovernmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the\r\n\npossibility  of  infringement,  particularly  when  the  free\r\n\nfunctioning  of  our  national  institutions  is   involved.\"\r\n\nBuckley\r                  , \r                    424 \r                       U.S. \r                            at \r                               66 \r                                  (internal quotation marks omitted); see\r\n\nTimmons, 117 S.

Id. at 659.  \r\n\n          Surely, then,  the same  concerns are  sufficiently\r\n\ncompelling where, as here, corporate wealth is deployed in an\r\n\nin-between \r                      form, \r                           i.e., \r                                 spending that is not totally independent\r\n\nbut rather  entails  some  degree of  coordination  with  the\r\n\ncandidates. \r                        \r                        The majority protects the freedom of corporations\r\n\nto meet face-to-face  with a candidate, in order to  secretly\r\n\nplan the content  and presentation of  voter guides that  the\r\n\ncorporation will distribute  to the public.   I believe  this\r\n\nconcern \r                   should be secondary to protecting the integrity of our\r\n\nelectoral  process.   See  Buckley,  424  U.S. at  66.    The\r\n\ngovernment has a  compelling interest in taking  prophylactic\r\n\nmeasures to  prevent the coercion  and corruption that  would\r\n\narise if a corporation like MRTLC offered to provide valuable\r\n\nin-kind \r                   assistance \r                             (providing expensive advertising for free)23\r\n\nto a candidate on  the condition that the candidate take  the\r\n\n23.  The candidate does not have to pay for publishing the\r\n\"voter guide,\" which can nevertheless greatly benefit his or\r\nher campaign:  the guide will highlight the candidate's pro-\r\nlife position (or the pro-choice position of his or her\r\nopponent) and will be mailed to voters who presumably share\r\nMRTLC's views on this issue.  This could save the candidate a\r\nconsiderable sum to publicize his or her positions in a\r\nfavorable light to a targeted group of voters to whom this\r\nissue is particularly important. \r\n\n                            -55-\r                                        -55-\r\r\n\nposition \r                    the \r                       corporation \r                                   demands, and to prevent the appearance\r\n\n     FEC  regulation   prohibiting  unwritten  contact   wit\r\n\n                                                            d\r            of such coercion or corruption.  \r                      The FEC is legitimately concerned about the danger.\r            The                                                         h\r            candidates was  designed to  foreclose the  abuse that  coul\r\n\npotentially arise from a corporation like MRTLC pressuring  a\r\n\ncandidate \r                     to \r                        amend his or her position on an issue, on pain of\r\n\nlosing  this  kind  of  substantial  in-kind  contribution.24\r\n\nAccording  to the  FEC,  a  prophylactic rule  is  needed  so\r\n\ncorporations  do not  induce candidates  to change  positions\r\n\nmerely \r                  because they need the money to finance their campaigns,\r\n\neven if they do not actually  agree with the change.  If  the\r\n\nquestion were the FEC's authority to regulate an organization\r\n\noffering a $20,000  cash contribution to  a candidate if  she\r\n\nwould agree to change her position to one of support for  the\r\n\norganization's position on a particular piece of legislation,\r\n\nthere would be no question of the FEC's authority to regulate\r\n\nthe \r               organization. \r                              \r                             I \r                               see \r                                   no reason why the result should not be\r\n\n24.  Prior to Buckley, when contributors could give money to\r\na campaign either through direct contributions or independent\r\nexpenditures, they usually chose the direct route.  But since\r\nthe Buckley decision, which foreclosed that route (for\r\nexpenditures beyond certain limits), they have had to find\r\nother ways to financially benefit the candidate's campaign by\r\ngiving independently.  \"It would naively underestimate the\r\ningenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring\r\nto buy influence to believe that they would have much\r\ndifficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction\r\non express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless\r\nbenefited the candidate's campaign.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 45.\r\n\n                            -56-\r                                        -56-\r\r\n\nthe same if the organization offers instead $20,000 worth  of\r\n\npamphlets presenting the candidate's view on this issue in  a\r\n\nfavorable, rather than an unfavorable, light.  \r\n\n          Consider the following  scenario.  An  organization\r\n\nconsults with a candidate regarding his or her plans or needs\r\n\nin the campaign, and then  says to the candidate:  \"You  have\r\n\nstated \r                  the \r                      position you believe in, but we disagree with it in\r\n\ncertain respects.

Non-written\r\n\ncommunications with candidates about voter guides present  an\r\n\nopportunity \r                       for \r                           the \r                              kind \r                                   of dangerous quid pro quo at the heart\r\n\nof the  compelling justification that  the Supreme Court  has\r\n\nrepeatedly relied upon in upholding the Act's restrictions on\r\n\ncontributions  and coordinated  expenditures.    \"[I]n-person\r\n\nsolicitation \r                        may exert pressure and often demands an immediate\r\n\nresponse, without providing an opportunity for comparison  or\r\n\nreflection.\"  Ohralik v.

In this context, the need\r\n\nfor a prophylactic rule is sufficient to justify the  limited\r\n\nrestriction imposed by the written-contact-only regulation.\r\n\n          I am mindful that MRTLC's challenge here is facial,\r\n\nnot \r               as-applied. \r                            \r                           MRTLC \r                                 is not asking us to consider whether the\r\n\nwritten-contact-only \r                                rule\r                                    is unconstitutional as applied to it.\r\n\nTherefore, \r                      I \r                        do not consider whether, if a full factual record\r\n\nwere before us, MRTLC might be able to show that it is not in\r\n\nfact a  conduit for  corporate  wealth.   Thus, even  if  the\r\n\nregulation would be unconstitutional as applied to someone, a\r\n\nfacial \r                  challenge like the present one must fail where even the\r\n\nplaintiff appears to exemplify a situation where the written-\r\n\ncontact-only regulation may constitutionally be applied.  Cf.\r\n\nAustin, 494 U.S. at 674 n.4 (Brennan, J., concurring).\r\n\n                         Conclusion\r\n\n          I \r                       believe \r                               that the majority has misstated the thrust\r\n\nof \r              the \r                 FEC's \r                       written-contact-only regulation.  The issue is not\r\n\nas simple nor  as amenable to  broad-brushed analysis as  the\r\n\n                            -62-\r                                        -62-\r\r\n\nmajority thinks.  It cannot be resolved without examining the\r\n\nevolution of Supreme  Court case law, which the majority  has\r\n\nignored.  Because, as I  read the case law, we should  uphold\r\n\nthis prophylactic regulation, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\n                            -63-\r                                        -63-\r\n</pre>",
