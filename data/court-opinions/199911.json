Ali   Ruckbi,   a   Syrian\n\nnational,    appeals   from    the    district   court   judgment     which\n\ndismissed his habeas corpus petition for relief from a final\n\ndeportation order.     We affirm.\n\n                                      I\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n            Ruckbi failed to depart the United States after his\n\nvisa expired in October 1992.         While residing in Massachusetts,\n\nRuckbi   admittedly    committed      thirty-six   criminal      offenses,\n\nincluding larceny by check and forgery, under several aliases.\n\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") issued an\n\norder to show cause why Ruckbi ought not be deported.                During\n\nthe course of a consent search of the Ruckbi residence, INS\n\nagents seized documentary evidence relating to various crimes,\n\nincluding altered passports as well as identification cards\n\nissued under various aliases.\n\n            After Ruckbi conceded deportability, he applied for an\n\nadjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States\n\ncitizen, see Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") § 245, 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(a), and, in the alternative, for leave to depart\n\nthe United States voluntarily, see INA § 244(e), 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1254(e) (repealed 1996).      In these applications, however, Ruckbi\n\ncategorically denied having committed the crimes charged.\n\n\n                                      3\n\f            Following a series of evidentiary hearings during which\n\nRuckbi admitted the charged offenses, the immigration judge\n\n(\"IJ\") rejected his section 245 and 244(e) applications.                  The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed.               Thereafter, we\n\ndismissed    Ruckbi's    direct   appeal   due   to   lack    of   appellate\n\njurisdiction.        See Ruckbi v. INS, 159 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   In due course, the district court dismissed the petition\n\nfor habeas corpus, see 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and Ruckbi initiated\n\nthis appeal.\n\n                                    II\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n            Ruckbi    asserts   three    principal    challenges     to   the\n\nfundamental fairness of the deportation proceedings.1\n\nA.   The Unannounced Discontinuance of the Final Hearing\n\n            First, Ruckbi contends that the IJ violated due process\n\nby abruptly issuing an opinion on February 22, 1995, dismissing\n\n\n     1In view of the fact that Ruckbi's challenges must fail\nunder even the most favorable standard of review, see Goncalves\nv. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 124-25 (1st Cir. 1998) (declining to\nimport the more deferential standards applicable under amended\n§§ 2254 and 2255 for use in § 2241 habeas petitions brought in\nimmigration cases, since in § 2241 habeas cases the district\ncourt is the first court, federal or state, to resolve disputed\nissues of law), we shall simply assume, without deciding, that\nRuckbi's constitutional claims are to be reviewed de novo, see,\ne.g., Requena-Rodriguez v. Pasquarell, 190 F.3d 299, 302 (5th\nCir. 1999), but that the IJ's subsidiary factual findings may\nnot be set aside unless clearly erroneous, see, e.g., Selgeka v.\nCarroll, 184 F.3d 337, 342 (4th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                    4\n\fhis section 245 and section 244(e) applications, notwithstanding\n\nthe   IJ's    earlier   announcement   continuing    the   hearing   until\n\nFebruary     27.    More   particularly,    Ruckbi    argues   that    the\n\ncancellation of the February 27th hearing preempted (i) his\n\nfiling of (and any IJ ruling upon) a crucial application for\n\nwaiver of excludability under INA § 212(h), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h),\n\nand (ii) any cross-examination of the government's forensic\n\nexpert.      These claims are without merit.\n\n             INA § 245 plainly provides that eligibility for an\n\nadjustment of status is restricted to otherwise \"admissible\"\n\naliens,2 whereas Ruckbi conceded inadmissibility, during earlier\n\n\n      2\n      \"Section 245 of the Act authorizes the Attorney General, in\nher discretion and under such regulations as she may prescribe,\nto adjust an alien's status to that of an alien lawfully\nadmitted for permanent residence, provided that the alien meets\ncertain statutory requirements. To be statutorily eligible for\nadjustment of status, the alien must show:       (1) that he was\ninspected and admitted or paroled into the United States; (2)\nthat he has made an application for such adjustment; (3) that he\nis eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to\nthe United States for permanent residence; and, (4) that an\nimmigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his\napplication is filed. Once the alien has established threshold\nstatutory eligibility, he must additionally demonstrate to the\nAttorney General's satisfaction that he merits relief in the\nexercise of discretion.\" Ruckbi, 159 F.3d at 19 (citing Henry\nv. INS, 74 F.3d 1, 4, 7 (1st Cir. 1996)) (emphasis added).\n     In the event that his application for adjustment of status\nwere to be denied, Ruckbi further sought a discretionary grant\nof voluntary departure.      \"Under § 244(e) of the INA, the\nAttorney General may, in her discretion, permit an alien in\ndeportation proceedings to depart voluntarily from the United\nStates at his own expense in lieu of deportation.          To be\nstatutorily eligible for voluntary departure, an alien must\n\n                                   5\n\fhearings, by testifying that he had committed the crimes of\n\n\"moral turpitude\" with which he was charged, thereby rendering\n\nhimself presumptively ineligible for any adjustment under § 245.3\n\nConsequently, Ruckbi could obtain an adjustment of status only\n\nafter requesting and securing a separate § 212(h) waiver of\n\nexcludability from the IJ.4   See Ruckbi, 159 F.3d at 20 n.4 (\"A\n\n\ndemonstrate to the Attorney General's satisfaction that he is\nand has been a person of good moral character for at least five\nyears immediately preceding the date of his voluntary departure\napplication. As with adjustment [of status], once an alien has\nestablished statutory eligibility for voluntary departure, he\nadditionally must persuade the Attorney General that he merits\na grant of relief in the exercise of discretion.\"     Id. at 20\n(citing Molina v. INS, 981 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1992))\n(emphasis added).\n     3INA § 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),\nstates:    \"[A]ny alien convicted of, or who admits having\ncommitted, or who admits committing acts which constitute the\nessential elements of . . . a crime involving moral turpitude\n(other than a purely political offense) or an attempt or\nconspiracy to commit such a crime . . . is inadmissible.\"\n(Emphasis added.) Similarly, the IJ noted that Ruckbi's use of\naltered passports likely rendered him independently excludable\nunder INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), which\nprovides: \"Any alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting\na material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or\nhas procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the\nUnited States or other benefit provided under this chapter is\ninadmissible.\" (Emphasis added.)\n     4\n     INA § 212(h), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), provides, in pertinent\npart: \"The Attorney General may, in his discretion, waive the\napplication of subparagraph[] (A)(i)(I) of . . . subsection\n(a)(2) of this section . . . in the case of an immigrant who is\nthe spouse . . . of a citizen of the United States or an alien\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established\nto the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien's\ndenial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the\n\n                                6\n\fshowing of admissibility to the United States is a statutory\n\nprerequisite to adjustment-of-status relief under § 245 of the\n\nINA.\") (emphasis added); see also Griffiths v. INS, 243 F.3d 45,\n\n55 (1st Cir. 2001) (same).            Ruckbi has not done so.\n\n             Moreover, even assuming Ruckbi intended to submit a §\n\n212(h) application for waiver of excludability on February 27,\n\n1995, the unannounced discontinuance by the IJ was harmless. 5\n\nRegardless of the merits vel non of any § 212(h) application by\n\nRuckbi, the IJ — after balancing all relevant factors — was\n\nempowered to deny Ruckbi's § 245 application on the alternative\n\nand independent ground that Ruckbi had not established that he\n\nwas    entitled    to   a   discretionary      adjustment.      See,    e.g.,\n\nRashtabadi v. INS, 23 F.3d 1562, 1570 (9th Cir. 1994) (\"The BIA\n\nor    the   IJ   decides    whether    an   applicant   is   entitled   to   a\n\nfavorable exercise of agency discretion [under § 245] on a case\n\nby case basis by 'taking into account the social and humane\n\n\nUnited States citizen or lawfully resident spouse . . . of such\nalien . . . and . . . the Attorney General, in his discretion,\nand pursuant to such terms, conditions and procedures as he may\nby regulations prescribe, has consented to the alien's applying\nor reapplying for a visa, for admission to the United States, or\nadjustment of status.\"\n       5\n      Since Ruckbi's claim cannot survive the more rigorous\n\"harmless error\" standard applicable on direct appellate review,\ncf. Griffiths, 243 F.3d at 55; White v. INS, 17 F.3d 475, 479-80\n(1st Cir. 1994), we need not determine to what extent, if any,\nthe normally less advantageous habeas corpus standard further\nundermines the present claim.\n\n                                        7\n\fconsiderations presented in an applicant's favor and balancing\n\nthem against the adverse factors that evidence the applicant's\n\nundesirability as a permanent resident.'          Where an alien has\n\ncommitted a particularly grave criminal offense, he may be\n\nrequired to make a heightened showing that his case presents\n\nunusual or outstanding equities.\")(citations omitted); see also\n\nsupra note 2.\n\n         The IJ's decision clearly reflects that the § 245\n\napplication   submitted   by   Ruckbi   was   rejected   on   just   such\n\nalternative and independent grounds:\n\n         First, this court must deny the respondent's\n         request for adjustment of status pursuant to\n         section 245(a) . . . because he has not\n         established that he merits an exercise of\n         discretion   in   his   favor   .  .   .   .\n         Furthermore, the respondent is excludible\n         under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) . . .\n         [b]ecause he has not filed for a waiver of\n         excludibility    pursuant     to     section\n         212(h)(1)(B) . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\f(Emphasis added.)6   Thus, there can be no doubt whatsoever that\n\nthe IJ would have reached the identical decision even assuming\n\nthat Ruckbi applied for a § 212(h) waiver on February 27.\n\n          Second, the contention that the discontinuance of the\n\nFebruary 27 hearing prevented Ruckbi from \"cross-examining\" the\n\ngovernment's   forensic   expert       is   meritless   as   well.   The\n\ngovernment previously introduced a forensic laboratory report\n\nwhich concluded that the two passports seized during the search\n\nof the Ruckbi apartment had been altered.         Neither on appeal nor\n\nbefore either the IJ or the BIA has Ruckbi identified the\n\nproposed scope or subject matter of the \"cross-examination\"\n\nsought.   Furthermore, the government offered the laboratory\n\nreport for the sole purpose of establishing that the passports\n\nhad been altered (a fact readily conceded by Ruckbi's counsel),\n\n\n\n    6 In light of the clear evidence and explicit finding that\nRuckbi gave false testimony before the IJ, he has not argued on\nappeal that the IJ abused his discretion in declining to grant\nrelief under §§ 245 and 244(c). Hence, we need not reach the\nquestion whether the district court would have subject matter\njurisdiction over such a habeas claim. See Goncalves, 144 F.3d\nat 125 (noting that following enactment of the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996,\ncourts of appeals retain jurisdiction to hear appeals relating\nto certain types of habeas claims, such as those involving pure\nquestions of law, but reserving the question as to whether this\njurisdictional grant extends to \"'the manner in which [agency]\ndiscretion was exercised'\") (citation omitted).         But cf.\nCalcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U.S. 348, 121 S. Ct. 2268, 2270 n.2\n(2001) (noting that \"[t]he scope of [the IIRIRA jurisdictional]\npreclusion is not entirely clear\").\n\n                                   9\n\frather   than   to   prove   that   Ruckbi      himself   had    made    the\n\nalterations.    Nor did the IJ predicate his decision on any such\n\nfinding.7\n\nB.   Notice of the Right to Apply for the\n     Section 212(h) Waiver of Excludability\n\n            Ruckbi next contends that the IJ's failure to advise\n\nhim of the right to submit a § 212(h) waiver application, as\n\nrequired by INS regulations, see 8 C.F.R. § 242.17(a), warrants\n\nreversal of the IJ's decision. This argument must be rejected as\n\nwell, since the failure to submit a § 212(h) waiver was utterly\n\nharmless.    See supra.   Consequently, Ruckbi could not have been\n\nprejudiced by the IJ's failure to advise him of the right to\n\nsubmit a waiver application.8\n\nC.   Admissibility of the Fruits of the October 1993 Search\n\n            Finally, Ruckbi contends that since he testified that\n\nhe did not sign the consent-to-search form until after the INS\n\nagents   completed   their   search      and,   even   then,    only    as   a\n\n\n\n     7Similarly, Ruckbi is mistaken to the extent he contends\nthat the government was required to call the forensic expert,\nwho prepared the report, as a trial witness.       See, e.g.,\nEspinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir. 1995).\n     8We note, nonetheless, that Ruckbi had actual notice of this\nright under § 242.17(a). At the May 12, 1994, hearing, Ruckbi's\ncounsel acquiesced when the IJ observed that, in light of the\nadmissions Ruckbi made regarding his past criminal conduct,\nRuckbi would need to obtain a § 212(h) waiver before any § 245\nadjustment of status could be considered.\n\n                                    10\n\fcondition precedent to his release from government custody, the\n\nIJ    violated      his    Fourth   Amendment     right     to    be   free    from\n\nunreasonable search and seizure by rejecting his section 245 and\n\nsection 244(c) applications.            He argues that the IJ failed to\n\nundertake     the    requisite      inquiries     into    the    timeliness     and\n\nvoluntariness of his consent notwithstanding this undisputed\n\nevidence.         See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 223\n\n(1973).      Once again we must disagree.\n\n             First,       the   exclusionary    rule     based    in   the   Fourth\n\nAmendment normally does not apply in deportation proceedings.\n\nSee   INS    v.    Lopez-Mendoza,      468     U.S.    1032,     1042-43     (1984).\n\nNevertheless, INS regulations do contemplate the suppression of\n\nillegally      seized       evidence   in    cases      involving      \"egregious\n\nviolations of the Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might\n\ntransgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the\n\nprobative value of the evidence obtained.\"                Id. at 1050-51 & n.5\n\n(citing Matter of Toro, 17 I. & N. Dec. 340, 343 (BIA 1980));\n\nsee also Velasquez-Tabir v. INS, 127 F.3d 456, 459-60 (5th Cir.\n\n1997).      However, Ruckbi neither moved to suppress the evidence\n\nseized in the search, nor lodged a contemporaneous objection at\n\nthe   time    the    government      proposed     to    introduce      the    seized\n\nevidence at the hearing before the IJ.                   Cf., e.g., Gonzalez-\n\nRivera v. INS, 22 F.3d 1441, 1443 (9th Cir. 1994) (noting that\n\n\n                                        11\n\fappellant may submit pre-deportation-hearing motion to suppress\n\nevidence seized in search); cf. also United States v. Santos\n\nBatista,      239   F.3d     16,     19-20   (1st    Cir.   2001)    (criminal\n\ndefendant's failure to file pretrial suppression motion normally\n\nconstitutes         waiver     of      Fourth       Amendment       challenge).\n\nConsequently, neither the validity of Ruckbi's overt consent to\n\nthe search, nor the alleged egregiousness of the search itself\n\nwas ever placed squarely at issue.\n\n           Further, assuming arguendo that the consent issue was\n\nadequately presented simply through Ruckbi's testimony that his\n\nconsent had been untimely and the result of coercion, the record\n\ndoes not support the contention that Ruckbi's testimony was\n\nundisputed.     Instead, the IJ specifically found that Ruckbi was\n\nnot a credible witness in any respect, particularly in light of\n\nthe many instances in which he abruptly and unconvincingly\n\naltered his testimony in mid-course.                See Selgeka v. Carroll,\n\n184 F.3d 337, 343 (4th Cir. 1999) (findings of fact reviewed\n\nonly for clear error).               For instance, Ruckbi initially and\n\nrepeatedly denied that he had ever consented to the search.                 Yet\n\nwhen government counsel confronted him with Exhibit 23, the\n\nconsent form, Ruckbi acknowledged that he had indeed signed it.\n\nGiven   the    numerous      other    testimonial    misrepresentations      by\n\nRuckbi, the IJ reasonably could conclude that the belated Fourth\n\n\n                                        12\n\fAmendment challenge was not only groundless, but fabricated.\n\nSee    Lopez-Mendoza,   468   U.S.    at   1039   (\"A   decision    of\n\ndeportability need be based only on 'reasonable, substantial and\n\nprobative evidence.'\") (citation omitted).9\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n     The remaining arguments made by Ruckbi on appeal              are\nutterly meritless, hence warrant no separate discussion.\n\n                                 13\n\f",

During the course of a consent search of the Ruckbi residence, INS agents seized documentary evidence relating to various crimes, including altered passports as well as identification cards issued under various aliases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Ruckbi conceded deportability, he applied for an adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen, <i>see</i> Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") &#167; 245, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a), and, in the alternative, for leave to depart the United States voluntarily, <i>see</i> INA &#167; 244(e), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1254(e) (repealed 1996).

The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed. Thereafter, we dismissed Ruckbi's direct appeal due to lack of appellate jurisdiction. <i>See Ruckbi v. INS,</i> 159 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1998). In due course, the district court dismissed the petition for habeas corpus, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241, and Ruckbi initiated this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruckbi asserts three principal challenges to the fundamental fairness of the deportation proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Unannounced Discontinuance of the Final Hearing</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ruckbi contends that the IJ violated due process by abruptly issuing an opinion on February 22, 1995, dismissing his section 245 and section 244(e) applications, notwithstanding the IJ's earlier announcement continuing the hearing until February 27. More particularly, Ruckbi argues that the cancellation of the February 27th hearing preempted (i) his filing of (and any IJ ruling upon) a crucial application for waiver of excludability under INA &#167; 212(h), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(h), and (ii) any cross-examination of the government's forensic expert. These claims are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 245 plainly provides that eligibility for an adjustment of status is restricted to otherwise \"admissible\" aliens,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> whereas Ruckbi conceded inadmissibility, during earlier hearings, by testifying that he had committed the crimes of \"moral turpitude\" with which he was charged, thereby rendering himself presumptively ineligible for any adjustment under &#167; 245.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Consequently, Ruckbi could obtain an adjustment of status only after requesting and securing a separate &#167; 212(h) waiver of excludability from the IJ.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Ruckbi,</i> 159 F.3d at 20 n. 4 (\"A showing of admissibility to the United States is a statutory <i>prerequisite</i> to adjustment-of-status relief under &#167; 245 of the INA.\") (emphasis added); <i>see also Griffiths v. INS,</i> 243 F.3d 45, 55 (1st Cir.2001) (same). Ruckbi has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even assuming Ruckbi intended to submit a &#167; 212(h) application for waiver of excludability on February 27, 1995, the unannounced discontinuance by the IJ was harmless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Regardless of the merits <i>vel non</i> of any &#167; 212(h) application by Ruckbi, the IJ &#8212; after balancing all relevant factors &#8212; was empowered to deny Ruckbi's &#167; 245 application on the alternative and independent ground that Ruckbi had not established that he was entitled to a discretionary adjustment. <i>See, e.g., Rashtabadi v. INS,</i> 23 F.3d 1562, 1570 (9th Cir.1994) (\"The BIA or the IJ decides whether an applicant is entitled to a favorable exercise of agency discretion [under &#167; 245] on a case by case basis by `taking into account the social and humane considerations presented in an applicant's favor and balancing them against the adverse factors that evidence the applicant's undesirability as a permanent resident.' Where an alien has committed a particularly grave criminal offense, he may be required to make a heightened showing that his case presents unusual or outstanding equities.\") (citations omitted); <i>see also supra</i> note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's decision clearly reflects that the &#167; 245 application submitted by Ruckbi was rejected on just such alternative and independent grounds:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, this court must deny the respondent's request for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) ... because he has not established that he merits an exercise of discretion in his favor.... <i>Furthermore,</i> the respondent is excludible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) ... [b]ecause he has not filed for a waiver of excludibility pursuant to section 212(h)(1)(B)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, there can be no doubt whatsoever that the IJ would have reached the identical decision even assuming that Ruckbi applied for a &#167; 212(h) waiver on February 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the contention that the discontinuance of the February 27 hearing prevented Ruckbi from \"cross-examining\" the government's forensic expert is meritless as well. The government previously introduced a forensic laboratory report which concluded that the two passports seized during the search of the Ruckbi apartment had been altered. Neither on appeal nor before either the IJ or the BIA has Ruckbi identified the proposed scope or subject matter of the \"cross-examination\" sought. Furthermore, the government offered the laboratory report for the sole purpose of establishing that the passports had been altered (a fact readily conceded by Ruckbi's counsel), rather than to prove that Ruckbi himself had made the alterations. Nor did the IJ predicate his decision on any such finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Notice of the Right to Apply for the Section 212(h) Waiver of Excludability</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruckbi next contends that the IJ's failure to advise him of the right to submit a &#167; 212(h) waiver application, as required by INS regulations, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.17(a), warrants reversal of the IJ's decision. This argument must be rejected as well, since the failure to submit a &#167; 212(h) waiver was utterly harmless. <i>See supra.</i> Consequently, Ruckbi could not have been prejudiced by the IJ's failure to advise him of the right to submit a waiver application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Admissibility of the Fruits of the October 1993 Search</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ruckbi contends that since he testified that he did not sign the consent-to-search form until after the INS agents completed their search and, even then, only as a condition precedent to his release from government custody, the IJ violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure by rejecting his section 245 and section 244(c) applications. He argues that the IJ failed to undertake the requisite inquiries into the timeliness and voluntariness of his consent notwithstanding this undisputed evidence. <i>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. 218, 223, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Once again we must disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the exclusionary rule based in the Fourth Amendment normally does not apply in deportation proceedings. <i>See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza,</i> 468 U.S. 1032, 1042-43, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). Nevertheless, INS regulations do contemplate the suppression of illegally seized evidence in cases involving \"egregious violations of the Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1050-51 &amp; n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3479 (citing <i>Matter of Toro,</i> 17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 340, 343 (BIA 1980)); <i>see also Velasquez-Tabir v. INS,</i> 127 F.3d 456, 459-60 (5th Cir.1997). However, Ruckbi neither moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search, nor lodged a contemporaneous objection at the time the government proposed to introduce the seized evidence at the hearing before the IJ. <i>Cf., e.g., Gonzalez-Rivera v. INS,</i> 22 F.3d 1441, 1443 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that appellant may submit pre-deportation-hearing motion to suppress evidence seized in search); <i>cf. also United States v. Santos Batista,</i> 239 F.3d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir.2001) (criminal defendant's failure to file pretrial suppression motion normally constitutes waiver of Fourth Amendment challenge). Consequently, neither the validity of Ruckbi's overt consent to the search, nor the alleged egregiousness of the search itself was ever placed squarely at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the consent issue was adequately presented simply through Ruckbi's <i>testimony</i> that his consent had been untimely and the result of coercion, the record does not support the contention that Ruckbi's testimony was undisputed. Instead, the IJ specifically found that Ruckbi was not a credible witness in any respect, particularly in light of the many instances in which he abruptly and unconvincingly altered his testimony in mid-course. <i>See Selgeka v. Carroll,</i> 184 F.3d 337, 343 (4th Cir.1999) (findings of fact reviewed only for clear error). For instance, Ruckbi initially and repeatedly denied that he had ever consented to the search. Yet when government counsel confronted him with Exhibit 23, the consent form, Ruckbi acknowledged that he had indeed signed it. Given the numerous other testimonial misrepresentations by Ruckbi, the IJ reasonably could conclude that the belated Fourth Amendment challenge was not only groundless, but fabricated. <i>See Lopez-Mendoza,</i> 468 U.S. at 1039, 104 S.Ct. 3479 (\"A decision of deportability need be based only on `reasonable, substantial and probative evidence.'\") (citation omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In view of the fact that Ruckbi's challenges must fail under even the most favorable standard of review,<i>see Goncalves v.

Pasquarell,</i> 190 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1999), but that the IJ's subsidiary factual findings may not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, <i>see, e.g., Selgeka v.

The government previously introduced a forensic laboratory report which concluded that the two passports seized during the search of the Ruckbi apartment had been altered. Neither on appeal nor before either the IJ or the BIA has Ruckbi identified the proposed scope or subject matter of the \"cross-examination\" sought. Furthermore, the government offered the laboratory report for the sole purpose of establishing that the passports had been altered (a fact readily conceded by Ruckbi's counsel), rather than to prove that Ruckbi himself had made the alterations. Nor did the IJ predicate his decision on any such finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Notice of the Right to Apply for the Section 212(h) Waiver of Excludability</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruckbi next contends that the IJ's failure to advise him of the right to submit a &#167; 212(h) waiver application, as required by INS regulations, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.17(a), warrants reversal of the IJ's decision. This argument must be rejected as well, since the failure to submit a &#167; 212(h) waiver was utterly harmless. <i>See supra.</i> Consequently, Ruckbi could not have been prejudiced by the IJ's failure to advise him of the right to submit a waiver application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Admissibility of the Fruits of the October 1993 Search</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ruckbi contends that since he testified that he did not sign the consent-to-search form until after the INS agents completed their search and, even then, only as a condition precedent to his release from government custody, the IJ violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure by rejecting his section 245 and section 244(c) applications. He argues that the IJ failed to undertake the requisite inquiries into the timeliness and voluntariness of his consent notwithstanding this undisputed evidence. <i>See Schneckloth v.

Nevertheless, INS regulations do contemplate the suppression of illegally seized evidence in cases involving \"egregious violations of the Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1050-51 &amp; n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111265\"><a href=\"/opinion/111265/ins-v-lopez-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, Ruckbi neither moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search, nor lodged a contemporaneous objection at the time the government proposed to introduce the seized evidence at the hearing before the IJ. <i>Cf., e.g., Gonzalez-Rivera v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669088\"><a href=\"/opinion/669088/mario-gonzalez-rivera-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1441</span></a></span>, 1443 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that appellant may submit pre-deportation-hearing motion to suppress evidence seized in search); <i>cf. also United States v.

Consequently, neither the validity of Ruckbi's overt consent to the search, nor the alleged egregiousness of the search itself was ever placed squarely at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the consent issue was adequately presented simply through Ruckbi's <i>testimony</i> that his consent had been untimely and the result of coercion, the record does not support the contention that Ruckbi's testimony was undisputed. Instead, the IJ specifically found that Ruckbi was not a credible witness in any respect, particularly in light of the many instances in which he abruptly and unconvincingly altered his testimony in mid-course. <i>See Selgeka v. Carroll,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765248\"><a href=\"/opinion/765248/besnik-selgeka-v-william-carroll-district-director-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 343 (4th Cir.1999) (findings of fact reviewed only for clear error). For instance, Ruckbi initially and repeatedly denied that he had ever consented to the search. Yet when government counsel confronted him with Exhibit 23, the consent form, Ruckbi acknowledged that he had indeed signed it. Given the numerous other testimonial misrepresentations by Ruckbi, the IJ reasonably could conclude that the belated Fourth Amendment challenge was not only groundless, but fabricated. <i>See Lopez-Mendoza,</i> 468 U.S. at 1039, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111265\"><a href=\"/opinion/111265/ins-v-lopez-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
