As  part of  a  severance\r                                             \r\n\nagreement, plaintiffs signed releases  waiving all claims against\r\n\ntheir  former  employer.    Three  and  one  half   years  later,\r\n\ncontending that the  releases had been coerced, they brought this\r\n\nERISA  suit.  The  district court dismissed,  applying the common\r\n\nlaw rule  that a party may  not avoid a contract  based on duress\r\n\nwithout first  returning the consideration received.   We express\r\n\nno view  on whether  ERISA plaintiffs must  satisfy this  \"tender\r\n\nback\" requirement.   Instead, we affirm the  court's dismissal on\r\n\nthe  ground that, by waiting  so long before  attempting to avoid\r\n\nthe releases,  plaintiffs have ratified them,  thus waiving their\r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n                          I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n     We  take the  facts  as alleged  in  the complaint.    E.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nWaterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).  Plaintiffs were\r                          \r\n\nemployees   of  a   Digital   Equipment   facility  in   Enfield,\r\n\nConnecticut.   In May or June 1990, Digital offered all employees\r\n\nat the Enfield  plant a severance package,  called a Transitional\r\n\nFinancial Support Option  (TFSO), which consisted  of a lump  sum\r\n\ncash payment of  at least 40  weeks' pay.   Plaintiffs agreed  to\r\n\naccept the TFSO in a timely manner.  Digital, however, apparently\r\n\nunderestimating  the number  of  employees who  would accept  its\r\n\noffer, refused to give plaintiffs the TFSO benefits.  Instead, it\r\n\ngave  the TFSO package to  ten other employees.   Plaintiffs then\r\n\nrequested information  from  Digital concerning  the criteria  by\r\n\nwhich the  ten employees  were selected.   Digital, in  response,\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\noffered  plaintiffs an  alternate  severance  package, with  less\r\n\ngenerous benefits than  the TFSO.   In November  and December  of\r\n\n1990, plaintiffs  accepted the alternate severance  plan, and, in\r\n\nexchange, signed  releases  waiving all  claims against  Digital,\r\n\nincluding claims arising out of its refusal to give them the TFSO\r\n\nbenefits.\r\n\n     Plaintiffs filed this suit on June 17, 1994, more than three\r\n\nand one half  years later,  claiming that they  had been  coerced\r\n\ninto accepting the lesser  package and signing the releases.   In\r\n\nparticular, they  alleged that  Digital had isolated  them, given\r\n\nthem only four days  to accept or reject the alternate  plan, and\r\n\ntold  them that they  would likely suffer  a pay reduction  or be\r\n\ntransferred  or laid  off without  any benefits  if they  did not\r\n\naccept.   Digital  moved to  dismiss  the  suit on  a  number  of\r\n\ngrounds.  The district court held that ERISA left undisturbed the\r\n\ncommon law rule that, as a  precondition to attempting to avoid a\r\n\ncontract or release, the consideration supporting the contract or\r\n\nrelease  must  be tendered  back to  the  released party.   Since\r\n\nplaintiffs concededly have retained the benefits of the alternate\r\n\nseverance package, the district  court concluded that their suits\r\n\nwere not viable.\r\n\n                          II.  Analysis\r                                                 \r\n\n     The parties have extensively briefed whether ERISA displaces\r\n\nthe common  law tender back requirement, a question apparently of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfirst  impression in  any federal  court of  appeals.1   We leave\r\n\nthis interesting question for another day.\r\n\n     In  In  re Boston  Shipyard Corp.,  886  F.2d 451  (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1989), we said:\r\n\n     It  is  well  settled  that \"[a]  contract  or  release, the\r\n     execution of which  is induced by  duress, is voidable,  not\r\n     void, and  the person claiming  duress must act  promptly to\r\n     repudiate  the contract or release  or he will  be deemed to\r\n     have waived his right to do so.\" \r\n\nId. at  455 (quoting Di Rose v. PK Management Corp. 691 F.2d 628,\r                                                             \r\n\n633-34 (2d Cir. 1982)).  Applying this principle, we found that a\r\n\nparty had  ratified a release agreement by  accepting payment and\r\n\nwaiting for  over a year and one half before claiming that it was\r\n\nduress-induced.

Several courts\r\nof appeals have addressed the applicability of the Hogue decision\r                                                                  \r\nto a  variety of remedial statutes, such as 42 U.S.C.   1983, the\r\nADEA,  Title VII, and the Jones Act, with mixed results.

Other\r\n\ncourts  agree.    E.g.,  Sutter  Home  Winery,  Inc.  v.

Sears, Roebuck  &amp; Co.,  927  F.2d 217,  220  (5th Cir.  1991)\r                                   \r\n\n(retaining   benefits  of  release   for  two  years  constitutes\r\n\nratification).\r\n\n     We  think the instant case  falls squarely within this rule.\r\n\nThe  undisputed facts  show that,  for three  and one  half years\r\n\nafter any claimed duress  had passed, the plaintiffs enjoyed  the\r\n\nbenefits of  the bargain  they now  wish to  avoid.   During this\r\n\ntime,  they never sought  to repudiate their  agreements based on\r\n\nduress.2    Thus, whether  or  not  the releases  initially  were\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2 We think the district court was overly generous in stating\r\nthat plaintiffs claimed they  orally had repudiated the releases.\r\nThe  court  cited only  to a  footnote in  plaintiffs' memorandum\r\nopposing  the  motion  to   dismiss,  which  asserted  that  they\r\n\"notified  Digital of  their claims  promptly.\"   To  repudiate a\r\ncontract, however, \"a party must unequivocally declare his intent\r\nnot to perform  his obligation.\"   Taylor v.  Gordon Flesch  Co.,\r                                                                           \r\nInc., 793  F.2d 858, 864 (7th Cir. 1986).  Plaintiffs point to no\r              \r\nsuch unambiguous  statement of intent to  disavow their agreement\r\nto  forego legal  claims against  Digital before they  filed this\r\nlawsuit.  The language relied on by the district court is far too\r\nvague  to be  read  as a  claimed  repudiation of  the  releases.\r\nIndeed, we  suspect it might  refer to  what plaintiffs'  counsel\r\ndescribed   at  oral  argument   as  plaintiffs'  post-settlement\r\nrequests  for  information concerning  the  TFSO.

Instead, we affirm the  court's dismissal on\r\n\nthe  ground that, by waiting  so long before  attempting to avoid\r\n\nthe releases,  plaintiffs have ratified them,  thus waiving their\r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n                          I.

E.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nWaterson v. Page, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601477\"><a href=\"/opinion/601477/valerie-watterson-v-eileen-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).  Plaintiffs were\r                          \r\n\nemployees   of  a   Digital   Equipment   facility  in   Enfield,\r\n\nConnecticut.   In May or June 1990, Digital offered all employees\r\n\nat the Enfield  plant a severance package,  called a Transitional\r\n\nFinancial Support Option  (TFSO), which consisted  of a lump  sum\r\n\ncash payment of  at least 40  weeks' pay.   Plaintiffs agreed  to\r\n\naccept the TFSO in a timely manner.  Digital, however, apparently\r\n\nunderestimating  the number  of  employees who  would accept  its\r\n\noffer, refused to give plaintiffs the TFSO benefits.  Instead, it\r\n\ngave  the TFSO package to  ten other employees.   Plaintiffs then\r\n\nrequested information  from  Digital concerning  the criteria  by\r\n\nwhich the  ten employees  were selected.   Digital, in  response,\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\noffered  plaintiffs an  alternate  severance  package, with  less\r\n\ngenerous benefits than  the TFSO.   In November  and December  of\r\n\n1990, plaintiffs  accepted the alternate severance  plan, and, in\r\n\nexchange, signed  releases  waiving all  claims against  Digital,\r\n\nincluding claims arising out of its refusal to give them the TFSO\r\n\nbenefits.\r\n\n     Plaintiffs filed this suit on June 17, 1994, more than three\r\n\nand one half  years later,  claiming that they  had been  coerced\r\n\ninto accepting the lesser  package and signing the releases.   In\r\n\nparticular, they  alleged that  Digital had isolated  them, given\r\n\nthem only four days  to accept or reject the alternate  plan, and\r\n\ntold  them that they  would likely suffer  a pay reduction  or be\r\n\ntransferred  or laid  off without  any benefits  if they  did not\r\n\naccept.   Digital  moved to  dismiss  the  suit on  a  number  of\r\n\ngrounds.  The district court held that ERISA left undisturbed the\r\n\ncommon law rule that, as a  precondition to attempting to avoid a\r\n\ncontract or release, the consideration supporting the contract or\r\n\nrelease  must  be tendered  back to  the  released party.   Since\r\n\nplaintiffs concededly have retained the benefits of the alternate\r\n\nseverance package, the district  court concluded that their suits\r\n\nwere not viable.\r\n\n                          II.

The language relied on by the district court is far too\r\nvague  to be  read  as a  claimed  repudiation of  the  releases.\r\nIndeed, we  suspect it might  refer to  what plaintiffs'  counsel\r\ndescribed   at  oral  argument   as  plaintiffs'  post-settlement\r\nrequests  for  information concerning  the  TFSO.
