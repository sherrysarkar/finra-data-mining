He  now appeals,  claiming errors  in the  jury selection\r\n\nprocess, the jury instructions,  and in the actions of  the trial\r\n\njudge,  including sentencing.   Finding  no reversible  error, we\r\n\naffirm.   We  deal with  each claim  in turn,  discussing factual\r\n\ndetails as they become relevant.\r\n\n                        I.  Jury Selection\r                                  I.  Jury Selection\r\n\n          Appellant makes  three claims with respect  to the jury\r\n\nselection.   First, he argues  that the district  court committed\r\n\nreversible  error when  it removed  juror number  9.   Second, he\r\n\nsubmits that the failure to remove juror number 45 for failure to\r\n\nadequately  speak  and  understand  English  was also  reversible\r\n\nerror.  Finally, he contends that the district court's failure to\r\n\nremove juror number 1 for cause was reversible error.\r\n\n          A.  Juror Number 9\r                    A.  Juror Number 9\r\n\n          Federal  Rule of  Criminal  Procedure  23(b) permits  a\r\n\ntrial judge to excuse a  juror for just cause if the  judge finds\r\n\nit necessary to do  so.  Fed. R. Crim.  Proc. 23(b).  \"The  trial\r\n\njudge   has   substantial    discretion   in   exercising    this\r\n\nresponsibility  and may remove the juror when 'convinced that the\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\njuror's abilities to perform his duties [have] become impaired.'\"\r\n\nUnited States v.  Walsh, 75  F.3d 1, 5  (1st Cir. 1996)  (quoting\r                                 \r\n\nUnited States v. Huntress, 956 F.2d 1309, 1312 (5th Cir. 1992)).\r                                   \r\n\n          The  circumstances  under  which  juror  number  9  was\r\n\nremoved  are  as follows.   While  the  judge was  delivering the\r\n\ncharge,  there was  a  disruption in  the  jury box.   The  judge\r\n\nsummarized the incident as follows:\r\n\n               I remember  juror  number 9  from  her\r\n            impaneling   questions,   she's  a   very\r\n            intelligent  woman,  she's an  economist.\r\n            Her  husband works  at the  Department of\r\n            Treasury.    She's --  she's  --  she's a\r\n            person  with a  lot of  education, formal\r\n            education.   But I  do think that  what I\r\n            saw here in court  today was not a normal\r\n            reaction.  That is not a normal reaction.\r\n\n               It's  entirely   possible  that  she's\r\n            having  some sort  of problem  that she's\r\n            not even aware of.  But what she did, she\r\n            interrupted the jury charge, and as if we\r\n            were not here, as if she was alone with -\r\n            - with  a juror  that is sitting  next to\r\n            her,  she started a conversation with him\r\n            in a loud tone of voice.  She  started to\r\n            touch this juror, tried to  take his name\r\n            tag   off  of  his  clothing,  asked  him\r\n            questions  about the  problems, something\r\n            around his neck or I don't know what.\r\n\n               I stopped, listened, watched,  did not\r\n            make an issue.   And when I  asked her up\r\n            here, when  I asked  her up here  she did\r\n            not remember what had happened, actually.\r\n            She  could not  remember the  reasons why\r\n            she  interrupted  the   jury  charge   or\r\n            started to touch her  neighbor.  And I --\r\n            I honestly think that  she has a problem.\r\n            I don't  know what  the problem is.   She\r\n            has some  sort of problem with  her.  Not\r\n            only that, but some of the jurors have --\r\n            some of the  jurors have expressed  their\r\n            concern about  her ability to  be sitting\r\n            in this jury.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nTr. II at 449-50.\r\n\n          Based  on  his  observation  of the  incident  and  his\r\n\nsubsequent  investigation,  the  judge  decided to  excuse  juror\r\n\nnumber 9  and to  substitute one  of  the alternate  jurors.   He\r\n\noffered defense counsel the opportunity to choose between the two\r\n\nalternate jurors, and counsel chose alternate number 1.\r\n\n          The judge then  asked juror  number 9  to approach  the\r\n\nbench and  explained to  her his  intention to  excuse her.   She\r\n\nstated that she  had found the  case very difficult and  that she\r\n\nfelt  compassion  for  those  involved.   Upon  questioning,  she\r\n\nresponded  that she had not  slept well the  night before because\r\n\nshe had  been thinking about the  case.  She also  told the court\r\n\nthat  she took medication to control her epilepsy.  The following\r\n\ncolloquy ensued:\r\n\n            The  Court:     Have  you  had  problems,\r\n            seizures  and  things  like  that  in the\r\n            past?\r\n\n            Juror:  The people says.\r\n\n            The Court:  People say that?\r\n\n            Juror:   But I say that I have -- I don't\r\n            have anything.\r\n\n            The Court:  I see.\r\n\n            Juror:  Because my reactions are normal.\r\n\nTr. II at 455-56.  And a few moments later:\r\n\n            The Court:  Do you remember what prompted\r\n            you to talk to your neighbor?\r\n\n            Juror:  What you say?\r\n\n            The Court:   When I  was instructing  the\r\n            jury --\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            Juror:  Uh-huh.\r\n\n            The  Court:   -- You  decided to  talk to\r\n            your next door neighbor.  Do you remember\r\n            that?\r\n\n            Juror:  No.\r\n\n            The Court:  You don't remember that?\r\n\n            Juror:  No.\r\n\n            The Court:  I see.  And you tried to take\r\n            his  name tag  away,  this one.   Do  you\r\n            remember that?\r\n\n            Juror:  No.\r\n\nTr. II at 456-57.\r\n\n          Finally, in  explaining his  decision to the  jury, the\r\n\njudge made the following remarks:\r\n\n               I  noticed that when I was instructing\r\n            you,  all  of a  sudden she  like blanked\r\n            out, that  I was  watching.  She  was not\r\n            here anymore and she turned to  the right\r\n            to her neighbor, started  to talk to him.\r\n            I  could  not  understand  what  she  was\r\n            saying.   It  didn't  seem  to have  much\r\n            logic  to what she was saying, the words,\r\n            and  then  she grabbed  his name  tag and\r\n            said  something  about,  \"what's on  your\r\n            neck,\"  or  something along  those words.\r\n            She doesn't remember that.\r\n\n               She   is   --   she's    taking   some\r\n            medication.  I think she has some sort of\r\n            problem,  physical  problem.   She  takes\r\n            medication, anticonvulsive medication.  I\r\n            honestly hope that she's  okay.  But I do\r\n            think  that  under  the circumstances,  I\r\n            think it would be unfair -- I don't think\r\n            it would be right for me to  leave her in\r\n            the  -- in the jury panel, because that's\r\n            not right.\r\n\nTr. II at 459-60.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          In light of all of the above, we do not find reversible\r\n\nerror in the decision to excuse the juror.  There was significant\r\n\nevidence  that juror number  9 was no longer  able to perform her\r\n\nduties.   Considering the deference that we must accord the trial\r\n\njudge in  matters such  as this  one, we  affirm the  decision to\r\n\nremove the  juror.   We add  that there is  no evidence  that the\r\n\njudge's  decision was influenced by the juror's view of the case.\r\n\nAlthough the juror stated that she found the case to be difficult\r\n\nand that she  had \"compassion for these people,\"   Tr. II at 453,\r\n\nthese  statements were made after the judge had decided to remove\r\n\nher  from the  jury.   Furthermore,  they  do not,  as  appellant\r\n\ncontends,  demonstrate  that \"she  had  reasonable  doubts as  to\r\n\nwhether or not  appellant should be  found guilty.\"   Appellant's\r\n\nBrief  at  15.   A juror  might find  a  case difficult  for many\r\n\nreasons,  and   to  conclude   that  she  favored   acquittal  is\r\n\nspeculative.\r\n\n          Our decision is  consistent with this court's  decision\r\n\nin United  States v.  Molinares Charris,  822 F.2d  1213, 1222-23\r                                                 \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1987) in which we upheld the decision to excuse a juror\r\n\nwhose health appeared  to be at  risk.  The  juror was  obviously\r\n\ndistressed by  the proceedings and  had taken  a tranquilizer  in\r\n\norder to calm her nerves.\r\n\n          Similarly, in the instant case, the judge was concerned\r\n\nwith  the juror's  health.    After  an  investigation  into  the\r\n\nsituation,  the judge felt  that the stress of  the trial posed a\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nrisk to the juror's  health and that  her ability to perform  her\r\n\nduties had been compromised.\r\n\n          As we stated in Molinares Charris, \"[w]e should  not be\r                                                     \r\n\nquick to second guess a trial judge, who was in a better position\r\n\nthan  we are  to assess  the severity  of the  situation.   After\r\n\nmaking  careful inquiries, and recognizing her responsibility for\r\n\nthe well-being of those called upon to serve the court, the judge\r\n\ndecided that  the risk to the juror's health was too great.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 1223.\r\n\n          B. Juror Number 45\r                    B. Juror Number 45\r\n\n          Appellant next claims that the district court committed\r\n\nreversible  error by failing to  remove juror number  45.  During\r\n\nthe investigation of  juror number 9, the judge interviewed juror\r\n\nnumber 45.  The exchange went as follows:\r\n\n            The Court:  Your name and number, please.\r\n\n            Juror:   My  name  is Byron  Chique.   My\r\n            number on the list is 45.\r\n\n            The  Court:   You  have  noticed anything\r\n            wrong  with  the  lady  that  started  to\r\n            talking in a loud tone of voice?\r\n\n            Juror:  Yes.  Yes.\r\n\n            The Court:  What have you noticed?\r\n\n            Juror:   Talking  in English,  it's  very\r\n            difficult  to  explain to  you,  but this\r\n            morning not too much important but she --\r\n            she say  -- I  can't explain  in English.\r\n            It's very difficult.\r\n\n            The Court:   Which  word are you  looking\r\n            for?\r\n\n            Juror:  Let me say --\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n            The Court:   Which  word are  you missing\r\n            that  you cannot  --  I'll give  you  the\r\n            word.\r\n\n            Juror:  I can say it in Spanish.\r\n\n            The Court:  What is the word?\r\n\n            Juror:  (In Spanish)\r\n\n            The Court:   Jaime, there is  a word that\r\n            he  is  having a  problem  with  he can't\r\n            explain.\r\n\n            Juror:  (Conferring withthe interpreter.)\r\n\n            Interpreter:   I told  the lady --  I was\r\n            talking  to the  lady this morning  and I\r\n            told  her and  she  was --  she was  like\r\n            expectant, she was hesitant in her -- her\r\n            actions.\r\n\n            Juror:  Yes.\r\n\n            The  Court:   It struck you  as something\r\n            abnormal?\r\n\n            Juror:  Not normal, not exactly normal.\r\n\n            The Court:  Not normal?\r\n\n            Juror:  No.\r\n\n            The Court:  Okay.

The  district  court  disagreed.    Shortly\r\n\nthereafter,  counsel again  raised the  question of  juror number\r\n\n45's proficiency in English.  The judge responded:\r\n\n            Number  one, Mr.  Chique was  examined in\r\n            English by me.  There is a piece of paper\r\n            that I gave these people for them to talk\r\n            to me in English when I'm selecting them,\r\n            and   he  was  able  to  express  himself\r\n            clearly in  English.  I have  no doubt in\r\n            my mind.\r\n\n               I  can  tell  you  something,  .  .  .\r\n            whenever I have the slightest doubt about\r\n            somebody's  English, not only do I excuse\r\n            that person  from the panel,  I eliminate\r\n            the person  from the list,  from the jury\r\n            pool   completely.    I  don't  take  any\r\n            chances with that.\r\n\n               He   was   looking    for   a    word,\r\n            \"sleepwalking,\" and that is not a concept\r\n            that you deal with every day.  And he was\r\n            pretty   nervous.    He  was,  you  know,\r\n            nervous up  here trying to explain  to me\r\n            something,  and that's  why he  could not\r\n            find the word.\r\n\n               He's     perfectly      capable     of\r\n            understanding the evidence in  this case.\r\n            I don't have a  problem with that at all.\r\n            And  if I  had, believe  me, he  wouldn't\r\n            even  be  on  the  jury  to  begin  with,\r\n            because I don't take chances with that.\r\n\nTr.

We are hesitant  to\r\n\nreverse  the  reasoned  conclusion  of  the  trial  judge on  the\r\n\nquestion  of a juror's ability  to understand English because the\r\n\ntrial judge is  in a much better position to  assess the language\r\n\ncompetency  of a  particular juror.   See Molinares  Charris, 822\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 1222-23; Walsh, 75 F.3d at 5.\r                                \r\n\n          In  the instant case, the juror in question had met the\r\n\nstatutory linguistic competency standard under the Jury Selection\r\n\nand Service Act, 28 U.S.C.   1865, and had undergone voir dire --\r\n\nduring which defense counsel had  the opportunity to question the\r\n\njuror.\r\n\n          Although   those  portions  of  the  transcript  quoted\r\n\nsuggest that the juror's command of the English language was less\r\n\nthan that of a native speaker, they do not warrant the conclusion\r\n\nthat the juror was unable to follow the proceedings or understand\r\n\nthe evidence  and therefore do  not merit reversal.   In light of\r\n\nour deferential  standard of  review and the  limited information\r\n\navailable  from the  transcript, we  cannot overturn  the judge's\r\n\ndecision  to retain  juror  number  45.   We  find  no  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n          C.  Juror No. 1\r                    C.  Juror No. 1\r\n\n          During voir dire, juror number 1 stated that his father\r\n\nhad  been  killed by  a drug  dealer  during a  holdup.   Defense\r\n\ncounsel sought to have the juror excused for cause.  The district\r\n\ncourt, having  interviewed the  juror, determined that  he should\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nnot be excused  for cause.  Defendant eventually  used one of his\r\n\nperemptory challenges to strike the  juror.  Appellant now argues\r\n\nthat  the  juror should  have been  removed  for cause,  that the\r\n\nfailure  to  remove  the juror  forced  the  defendant  to use  a\r\n\nperemptory challenge, and that this constitutes grounds for a new\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\n          It  is  well  established  that  the  trial  court  has\r\n\nconsiderable discretion in  ruling on challenges for cause.

Following an exchange  with counsel,  the judge\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ndecided to leave the  juror on the  panel, citing as reasons  the\r\n\nfact that the  juror, when  asked if he  could be impartial,  had\r\n\nbeen  extremely  assertive  in  his  answer,  and  that   he  was\r\n\nintelligent. \r\n\n          Nothing in either the record or the  parties' briefs on\r\n\nappeal suggests that the  trial court's decision to retain  juror\r\n\nnumber  1 was  grossly  in  error.   The  judge appears  to  have\r\n\nconcluded, after considering  the suitably of the juror,  that he\r\n\ncould remain  on the panel.   Neither a  lack of judgment  on the\r\n\npart of the  judge nor  prejudice toward the  defendant has  been\r\n\ndemonstrated.  We find no \"clear abuse.\"\r\n\n          Because  we find no clear abuse  in the judge's refusal\r\n\nto remove the juror,  we need not address the question of whether\r\n\nforcing  the appellant to  use a peremptory  challenge is grounds\r\n\nfor a new trial.\r\n\n                      II.

A conviction is a factor\r\n            you  may consider in  deciding whether to\r\n            believe  that  witness, but  it  does not\r\n            necessarily    destroy   the    witness's\r\n            credibility.  It has been brought to your\r\n            attention  only because  you may  wish to\r\n            consider it  when you decide  whether you\r\n            believe the witness's testimony.\r\n\nAppellant's Proposed Jury Instruction #1.12.\r\n\n          The jury instructions delivered by the  court, although\r\n\nthey did  not contain this  precise instruction, did  include the\r\n\nfollowing language:\r\n\n               You  have  heard  testimony   from  an\r\n            unindicted  co-conspirator,  Mr.  William\r\n            Negr n  Zapata, and  from a  defendant in\r\n            this  same case  who,  as you  know,  was\r\n            tried  earlier,  Willy  Maya Acosta,  who\r\n            have   --   who  both   have  cooperation\r\n            agreements  with  the  government.    The\r\n            testimony by Mr. Negr n Zapata  was given\r\n            in   exchange  for   a  promise   by  the\r\n            government that he will not be prosecuted\r\n            for some crimes he  admittedly committed,\r\n            including  the ones  in this  case.   The\r\n            testimony  by Willy Maya Acosta was given\r\n            in order to hopefully receive a reduction\r\n            of sentence on account of cooperation.\r\n\n               In  evaluating   this  testimony,  you\r\n            should  consider  whether that  testimony\r\n            has been influenced  by the  government's\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n            promise,  and  you  should consider  that\r\n            testimony with greater caution  than that\r\n            of ordinary witnesses.   Such  agreements\r\n            are  legal.   The law only  requires that\r\n            you consider testimony given  under those\r\n            circumstances  with greater  caution than\r\n            that of ordinary witnesses.\r\n\nTr. II at 406-07.\r\n\n          Although the  instructions given  by the judge  did not\r\n\ncontain  the specific  instruction  sought  by  Gonz lez-Soberal,\r\n\n\"there is  not reversible  error if  the jury  charge taken  as a\r\n\nwhole substantially covered the issues contained in the requested\r\n\ninstruction.\"  Angiulo, 897 F.2d at 1207.\r                                \r\n\n          Having reviewed the instructions  given to the jury, we\r\n\nconclude that  they substantially covered  issues of  credibility\r\n\nwith  respect to the witnesses  in question.   The judge reminded\r\n\nthe jury that the two witnesses had been  convicted and that they\r\n\nhad  cooperation  agreements  with   the  government.    He  gave\r\n\ninstructions concerning the credibility of witnesses, telling the\r\n\njury  that they should view the testimony of these witnesses with\r\n\ngreater caution than the testimony of an ordinary witness.  There\r\n\nis no  reason to  believe that  the jurors  were misled  by these\r\n\ninstructions, or that they believed it impermissible to view with\r\n\nadditional skepticism  the testimony  of witnesses who  had prior\r\n\nconvictions.    Accordingly, we  find  no  error  in  these  jury\r\n\ninstructions.\r\n\n          B. Reasonable Doubt\r                    B. Reasonable Doubt\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          Gonz lez-Soberal  also  claims that  the  trial court's\r\n\njury  instructions  regarding   reasonable  doubt   impermissibly\r\n\nreduced the government's burden of proof.\r\n\n          In his initial instructions to the jury, the judge made\r\n\nthe following remarks:\r\n\n               Second.  The burden of proof is on the\r\n            government  until  the  very  end  of the\r\n            case.   The  defendant has  no  burden to\r\n            prove  his innocence  or  to present  any\r\n            evidence  or  to  testify.     Since  the\r\n            defendant has the right to remain silent,\r\n            the law prohibits you in arriving at your\r\n            verdict  from   considering  whether  the\r\n            defendant may or may not have testified.\r\n\n               Third.   The  government must  prove a\r\n            case  against  the  defendant   beyond  a\r\n            reasonable  doubt.     I  will  give  you\r\n            further  instructions at  the end  of the\r\n            case, but in this sense be mindful, those\r\n            of you  who participated in  civil cases,\r\n            that the standard is  different.  In  the\r\n            civil case we say a plaintiff prevails if\r\n            he proves  a case  by a  preponderance of\r\n            the evidence.   In the  criminal case the\r\n            situation we say the  government prevails\r\n            if it proves  a case beyond  a reasonable\r\n            doubt.\r\n\n               If  I  were to  graphically illustrate\r\n            for  purposes  of  an  initial  charge or\r\n            instruction so you have an idea what  I'm\r\n            talking about, I would  say this.  In the\r\n            civil case if  we bring a  balance, scale\r\n            of   the  type  used  in  old  drugstores\r\n            before,  not  any   more,  you  will  put\r\n            evidence - in the civil  case plaintiff's\r\n            evidence  on  one   of  the  plates   and\r\n            defendant's  evidence  on the  other, you\r\n            will see  how well  the reaction is.   If\r\n            the scale just starts moving a little bit\r\n            to  the  plaintiff's side,  the plaintiff\r\n            has prevailed.  That is  preponderance of\r\n            the evidence.\r\n\n               When  we  say  \"beyond   a  reasonable\r\n            doubt,\" proving a defendant guilty beyond\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n            a  reasonable  doubt, by  the  very words\r\n            we're implying that  the government has a\r\n            heavier burden  than the one that  I just\r\n            described.      Because   liberties   are\r\n            involved, it's a  different kind of case,\r\n            therefore  the   government's  burden  is\r\n            heavier than that and I will explain that\r\n            at the end of the case.\r\n\nTr. I at 11-13.\r\n\n          At  the  end of  the case,  the  judge returned  to the\r\n\nreasonable doubt issue:\r\n\n               The presumption of innocence  alone is\r\n            sufficient to find him not guilty and can\r\n            only be overcome if the government proves\r\n            beyond  a reasonable doubt each and every\r\n            essential element of the crimes charged.\r\n\n               And  what  is  reasonable  doubt?    A\r\n            reasonable  doubt is  a doubt  based upon\r\n            reason and  common  sense and  may  arise\r\n            from    a     careful    and    impartial\r\n            consideration of all the evidence or from\r\n            lack   of  evidence.     Proof  beyond  a\r\n            reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you\r\n            firmly  convinced  that the  defendant is\r\n            guilty.\r\n\n               If,  after  a  careful  and  impartial\r\n            consideration with your fellow  jurors of\r\n            all the evidence,  you are not  convinced\r\n            beyond  a  reasonable   doubt  that   the\r\n            defendant is  guilty, it is your  duty to\r\n            find the defendant not guilty.\r\n\nTr. II at 418-19.\r\n\n          This  court has  cautioned against  the risks  that can\r\n\naccompany attempts to define reasonable doubt.  See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Nevertheless,\r                  \r\n\nattempts to define reasonable doubt do  not necessarily result in\r\n\nreversible error.  And jar, 49 F.3d at 23.  We have said that, in\r                                    \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nour  experience, even  imperfect formulations,  usually meet  the\r\n\nconstitutional  requirements when  viewed in  the context  of the\r\n\nentire charge to the jury.\r\n\n          When we review a trial court's definition of reasonable\r\n\ndoubt, our concern is whether the instructions have a tendency to\r\n\nreduce the government's  burden of proof at trial.

We will\r                                                                  \r\n\nfind instructions erroneous when,  taken as a whole, they  have a\r\n\nreasonable  likelihood of leading the jury to believe that it can\r\n\nconvict on some lesser standard of proof than that required under\r\n\nthe reasonable doubt standard.   See United States v.  Romero, 32\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 641, 651 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Having  reviewed  the  instructions  in  this  case, we\r\n\nbelieve that there  is no reasonable likelihood of misleading the\r\n\njury.  The judge explained  that the burden of proof is  entirely\r\n\non  the government, and that  the government must  prove its case\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.   The judge contrasted  the reasonable\r\n\ndoubt standard with the preponderance of the evidence standard in\r\n\norder to avoid any confusion in  the minds of jurors who may have\r\n\nserved on civil  juries in the past.  At the end of the trial, in\r\n\nhis  final instructions,  the judge  repeated that  the defendant\r\n\nmust  be presumed  innocent  and that  the government  must prove\r\n\nguilt  beyond a reasonable doubt.  Nothing in the judge's attempt\r\n\nto  define reasonable  doubt was  likely to  mislead the  jury or\r\n\nsuggest  that the government's burden  of proof is  less than the\r\n\nreasonable doubt standard.\r\n\n                         III. Fair Trial\r                                   III. Fair Trial\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          Appellant   next   claims  that   the   district  court\r\n\n\"repeatedly questioned witnesses on his own in a manner that made\r\n\nhim  a  partisan  of  the  government's  case  thereby  depriving\r\n\nappellant  of   his  constitutional  right  to   a  fair  trial.\"\r\n\nAppellant's Brief  at  33.   Appellant alleges  that the  judge's\r\n\nquestions   served  to  bolster  the  credibility  of  government\r\n\nwitnesses  and undermine  that of  defense witnesses.   Appellant\r\n\nalso  argues  that  the  judge improperly  raised  objections  to\r\n\nappellant's attorney's questioning and  that he elicited improper\r\n\nhearsay from a witness.\r\n\n          It  is well settled that the trial judge has \"a perfect\r\n\nright -- albeit a right that  should be exercised with care -- to\r\n\nparticipate  actively in the trial  proper.\"  Logue  v. Dore, 103\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1040  (1st Cir. 1997).  A trial judge retains the common law\r\n\npower to question witnesses and to comment on the evidence.  Id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\nsee  also  Fed.  R.  Evid.  614(b) (\"The  court  may  interrogate\r                   \r\n\nwitnesses, whether called by itself or by a party.\").  There are,\r\n\nhowever, limits to the behavior that is permitted judges.  \"[F]or\r\n\nexample, the  judge's participation  must be balanced;  he cannot\r\n\nbecome  an  advocate or  otherwise  use  his judicial  powers  to\r\n\nadvantage  or disadvantage a party  unfairly.\"  Id.   \"An inquiry\r                                                             \r\n\ninto  the judge's conduct of  the trial necessarily  turns on the\r\n\nquestion  of  whether  the  complaining party  can  show  serious\r\n\nprejudice.\"  Id.\r                          \r\n\n          In his  brief,  appellant cites  several  instances  of\r\n\nalleged  bias on behalf of  the judge.   After careful review, we\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nconclude that these instances  were no more than attempts  by the\r\n\njudge to clarify questions, speed the proceedings, or ensure that\r\n\nall information is before the jury.  We see no need  to recite at\r\n\nlength  from  appellant's  brief,  choosing  instead  to  comment\r\n\nbriefly on his allegations.\r\n\n          Appellant   asserts  that   the  judge   bolstered  the\r\n\ncredibility of government  witnesses on two  occasions.  We  have\r\n\nreviewed  the   relevant  testimony  and  consider   the  judge's\r\n\nquestioning to be  no more than an effort to  make clear that the\r\n\nwitnesses  were  testifying under  cooperation agreements  and to\r\n\nimpress on the witnesses the fact that they were required to tell\r\n\nthe truth.\r\n\n          Another instance  cited by appellant was  a decision by\r\n\nthe judge to overrule  an objection by appellant's counsel.   The\r\n\ngovernment  was introducing  a photograph  that included  certain\r\n\nmarkings.    Defense counsel  objected  on the  grounds  that the\r\n\nmarkings  contaminated  the  photo.     At  a  bench  conference,\r\n\nappellant's counsel  stated that he understood  that the markings\r\n\nwere  made during  the  trial  of  co-conspirators and  that  the\r\n\nwitness  could easily make the same markings on an unmarked photo\r\n\nif one  were  available.    The judge  overruled  the  objection,\r\n\nstating to the jury that he knew what the marks were and that the\r\n\nmarks  were  explained to  counsel.    Appellant claims,  without\r\n\nelaboration,  that  these  comments  amount   to  bolstering  the\r\n\ngovernment's evidence.  We disagree.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n          As for the  claims that the  judge sought to  undermine\r\n\ndefense  witnesses  and  defense  counsel, we  find  them  to  be\r\n\nmeritless.  In both instances identified by appellant,  the judge\r\n\nwas merely attempting to move the trial along without unnecessary\r\n\ndelay  and the judge's  comments cannot  be taken  to demonstrate\r\n\nbias.  See  Logue, 103 F.3d at 1045; Deary  v. Gloucester, 9 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n\n191, 194-95 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          Finally,  appellant  argues  that  the  judge  elicited\r\n\nhearsay  evidence during  testimony.   Following an  objection on\r\n\nhearsay grounds, the judge asked the witness, Negr n-Zapata, \"Who\r\n\ntold you that Chanci had said or that Chanci would -- If we would\r\n\nfind kilos he  would -- he would keep  them?\"  When Negr n-Zapata\r\n\nreplied  that Mr. Arroyo had  told him this,  the judge sustained\r\n\nthe  objection.   Even  if  it  were  determined  that  this  was\r\n\nimproperly admitted hearsay, it would be harmless error.  Nothing\r\n\nin the judge's remarks or the witness's brief response was in any\r\n\nway prejudicial to  the defendant.   The comments  simply do  not\r\n\nrelate  to the  defendant,  implying that,  if  error, they  were\r\n\nharmless error.\r\n\n                         IV.  Sentencing\r                                   IV.  Sentencing\r\n\n          Gonz lez-Soberal argues that  the trial court committed\r\n\nerror when it  refused to grant  a two-point \"minor  participant\"\r\n\nreduction in  his offense level  on the  basis of his  role as  a\r\n\ncourier.1  \"We will  reverse the district court's finding  that a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines states:\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\ndefendant  is not a  minimal or minor  participant only if  it is\r\n\nclearly  erroneous.\"  United States  v. Paz Uribe,  891 F.2d 396,\r                                                           \r\n\n399 (1st Cir. 1989); see  also United States v. Garc a, 954  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n12, 18 (1st Cir.  1992) (\"[W]e review a sentencing  court's role-\r\n\nin-the-offense  determination  only  for  clear  error.\").    The\r\n\ndefendant bears  the burden of  proving that he is  entitled to a\r\n\ndownward  adjustment for  his role  in the  offense.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717 (1992).\r                         \r\n\n          Appellant's  claim fails  on  two independent  grounds.\r\n\nFirst,  he  argues  that  \"[t]he trial  evidence  indicates  that\r\n\nappellant was a mere courier of money and narcotics,\" Appellant's\r\n\nBrief at 42, yet he points to no testimony or evidence to support\r\n\nthe assertion  that his role was  limited to one of  courier.  He\r\n\nrefers  to  only  one statement  made  by  the  trial judge,  who\r\n\ncommented  that \"the evidence has shown so far that the defendant\r\n\nwas a  money courier.\"  Tr. II  at 481.  This  is insufficient to\r\n\nmeet  the defendant's burden  in this case,  and is unconvincing.\r\n\nDuring sentencing, the judge's comments, taken in their entirety,\r\n\ndo not  suggest that  the judge  viewed the  defendant as  a mere\r\n\ncourier.  For example, the  judge stated \"I do not think  that he\r\n\nwas  other than  a regular  drug dealer  that was  arranging drug\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            Based  on  the  defendant's role  in  the\r\n            offense,  decrease  the offense  level as\r\n            follows:\r\n            . . .\r\n            (b)   If  the   defendant  was   a  minor\r\n            participant  in  any  criminal  activity,\r\n            decrease by two levels.\r\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines   3B1.2.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\ntransactions like  everybody  else was.\"    Tr. II  at  481.   In\r\n\naddition,  the court  made it  clear that  it had  considered the\r\n\ndefendant's  role in  the  offense, stating  that \"the  court has\r\n\nconsidered  his  role  . .  .  in  the  context of  the  relative\r\n\nculpability of the different defendants that participated in this\r\n\nparticular  conspiracy.   And I  will not  make an  adjustment on\r\n\naccount of role.\"  Tr. II at 488.\r\n\n          Second, even if it  was shown that Gonz lez-Soberal had\r\n\nbeen  no more  than  a courier,  he  would not  automatically  be\r\n\nentitled to a  reduction.   See United States  v. L pez-Gil,  965\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 1124, 1131 (1st Cir. 1992); Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d at 399.   \"A\r                                                    \r\n\ndefendant  has  the  burden  of  proving  entitlement  to such  a\r\n\ndownward  adjustment,   and  can   only  prevail  on   appeal  by\r\n\ndemonstrating that  the district court's determination  as to his\r\n\nrole  in the offense was clearly erroneous.\"  L pez-Gil, 965 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  1131  (citations omitted).   Appellant  fails to  present any\r\n\nreasons why, on the facts of this case, he should be granted such\r\n\na reduction.  Therefore,  even assuming, arguendo, that appellant\r\n\nwas able to establish that he was merely a courier, he has failed\r\n\nto carry  his burden of showing that he is entitled to a downward\r\n\nadjustment.\r\n\n          In  light of  the above  analysis, and  the deferential\r\n\nposture we  take  toward role-in-the-offense  determinations,  we\r\n\nfind no clear error in the district court's sentencing.\r\n\n                          V.

Jury Selection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes three claims with respect to the jury selection.  First, he argues that the district court committed reversible error when it removed juror number 9.

While the judge was delivering the charge, there was a disruption in the jury box.  The judge summarized the incident as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I remember juror number 9 from her impaneling questions, she's a very intelligent woman, she's an economist.

She has some sort of problem with her.

Do you remember that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>Juror:  No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>The Court:  You don't remember that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Juror:  No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>The Court:  I see.  And you tried to take his name tag away, this one.  Do you remember that?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Juror:  No.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr.

She was not here anymore and she turned to the right to her neighbor, started to talk to him.  I could not understand what she was saying.  It didn't seem to have much logic to what she was saying, the words, and then she grabbed his name tag and said something about, \"what's on your neck,\" or something along those words.  She doesn't remember that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She is--she's taking some medication.  I think she has some sort of problem, physical problem.  She takes medication, anticonvulsive medication.  I honestly hope that she's okay.  But I do think that under the circumstances, I think it would be unfair--I don't think it would be right for me to leave her in the--in the jury panel, because that's not right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. II at 459-60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of all of the above, we do not find reversible error in the decision to excuse the juror.  There was significant evidence that juror number 9 was no longer able to perform her duties.  Considering the deference that we must accord the trial judge in matters such as this one, we affirm the decision to remove the juror.  We add that there is no evidence that the judge's decision was influenced by the juror's view of the case.  Although the juror stated that she found the case to be difficult and that she had \"compassion for these people,\" Tr. II at 453, these statements were made after the judge had decided to remove her from the jury.  Furthermore, they do not, as appellant contends, demonstrate that \"she had reasonable doubts as to whether or not appellant should be found guilty.\"   Appellant's Brief at 15.  A juror might find a case difficult for many reasons, and to conclude that she favored acquittal is speculative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision is consistent with this court's decision in United States v. Molinares Charris, 822 F.2d 1213, 1222-23 (1st Cir.1987) in which we upheld the decision to excuse a juror whose health appeared to be at risk.  The juror was obviously distressed by the proceedings and had taken a tranquilizer in order to calm her nerves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in the instant case, the judge was concerned with the juror's health.  After an investigation into the situation, the judge felt that the stress of the trial posed a risk to the juror's health and that her ability to perform her duties had been compromised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in Molinares Charris, \"[w]e should not be quick to second guess a trial judge, who was in a better position than we are to assess the severity of the situation.  After making careful inquiries, and recognizing her responsibility for the well-being of those called upon to serve the court, the judge decided that the risk to the juror's health was too great.\"  Id. at 1223.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Juror Number 45</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next claims that the district court committed reversible error by failing to remove juror number 45.  During the investigation of juror number 9, the judge interviewed juror number 45.  The exchange went as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>The Court:  Your name and number, please.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>Juror:  My name is Byron Chique.

Okay.  Thank you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. II at 443-46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's counsel then stated that he had concerns about juror number 45's knowledge and understanding of the English language.  The district court disagreed.  Shortly thereafter, counsel again raised the question of juror number 45's proficiency in English.  The judge responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>Number one, Mr. Chique was examined in English by me.  There is a piece of paper that I gave these people for them to talk to me in English when I'm selecting them, and he was able to express himself clearly in English.  I have no doubt in my mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I can tell you something, ... whenever I have the slightest doubt about somebody's English, not only do I excuse that person from the panel, I eliminate the person from the list, from the jury pool completely.  I don't take any chances with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He was looking for a word, \"sleepwalking,\" and that is not a concept that you deal with every day.  And he was pretty nervous.  He was, you know, nervous up here trying to explain to me something, and that's why he could not find the word.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He's perfectly capable of understanding the evidence in this case.  I don't have a problem with that at all.  And if I had, believe me, he wouldn't even be on the jury to begin with, because I don't take chances with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. II at 449.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial judge has substantial discretion to determine when jurors should be removed for cause.  We are hesitant to reverse the reasoned conclusion of the trial judge on the question of a juror's ability to understand English because the trial judge is in a much better position to assess the language competency of a particular juror.  See Molinares Charris, 822 F.2d at 1222-23;  Walsh, 75 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the juror in question had met the statutory linguistic competency standard under the Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1865, and had undergone voir dire--during which defense counsel had the opportunity to question the juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although those portions of the transcript quoted suggest that the juror's command of the English language was less than that of a native speaker, they do not warrant the conclusion that the juror was unable to follow the proceedings or understand the evidence and therefore do not merit reversal.  In light of our deferential standard of review and the limited information available from the transcript, we cannot overturn the judge's decision to retain juror number 45.  We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Juror No. 1</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During voir dire, juror number 1 stated that his father had been killed by a drug dealer during a holdup.  Defense counsel sought to have the juror excused for cause.  The district court, having interviewed the juror, determined that he should not be excused for cause.  Defendant eventually used one of his peremptory challenges to strike the juror.  Appellant now argues that the juror should have been removed for cause, that the failure to remove the juror forced the defendant to use a peremptory challenge, and that this constitutes grounds for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that the trial court has considerable discretion in ruling on challenges for cause.  See Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162, 168, 70 S.Ct. 519, 521-22, 94 L.Ed. 734 (1950).  \"Substantial deference is due the trial court's exercise of its discretion in handling situations involving potential juror bias or misconduct.\"  United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1185 (1st Cir.1990).  \"There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined to disturb a trial judge's exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for cause in the empaneling of a jury.\"  United States v. McCarthy, 961 F.2d 972, 976 (1st Cir.1992) (internal quotations omitted).  \"We review a trial judge's exercise of discretion in empaneling a jury for 'clear abuse.' \"  United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 443 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, after the juror stated that his father had been killed by a drug dealer, the judge asked:  \"Do you believe that even though this happened within your family you could still be a judge of the facts in a drug case and be fair and impartial?\"   Tr. I at 11A.  The juror responded \"yes, I can.\"   Tr. I at 11A.  Following an exchange with counsel, the judge decided to leave the juror on the panel, citing as reasons the fact that the juror, when asked if he could be impartial, had been extremely assertive in his answer, and that he was intelligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in either the record or the parties' briefs on appeal suggests that the trial court's decision to retain juror number 1 was grossly in error.  The judge appears to have concluded, after considering the suitably of the juror, that he could remain on the panel.  Neither a lack of judgment on the part of the judge nor prejudice toward the defendant has been demonstrated.  We find no \"clear abuse.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find no clear abuse in the judge's refusal to remove the juror, we need not address the question of whether forcing the appellant to use a peremptory challenge is grounds for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Appellant's Requested Jury Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next claims that the district court committed reversible error when it failed to give appellant's requested instruction concerning the impeachment of witnesses by prior conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering challenges to jury instructions, the refusal to give a requested instruction is reversible error only if \"the instruction (1) is substantively correct;  (2) was not substantially covered in the charge actually delivered to the jury;  and (3) concerns an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant's ability to effectively present a given defense.\"  United States v. Gibson, 726 F.2d 869 (1st Cir.1984) (internal quotations omitted).  The charge \"need not follow the exact form and wording of the defendant's proposed instructions.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, Gonzalez-Soberal sought the following instruction:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>You have been told that the witness _______ was convicted in 19__ of [e.g.:  armed robbery].  A conviction is a factor you may consider in deciding whether to believe that witness, but it does not necessarily destroy the witness's credibility.  It has been brought to your attention only because you may wish to consider it when you decide whether you believe the witness's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's Proposed Jury Instruction # 1.12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions delivered by the court, although they did not contain this precise instruction, did include the following language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have heard testimony from an unindicted co-conspirator, Mr. William Negrn Zapata, and from a defendant in this same case who, as you know, was tried earlier, Willy Maya Acosta, who have--who both have cooperation agreements with the government.  The testimony by Mr. Negrn Zapata was given in exchange for a promise by the government that he will not be prosecuted for some crimes he admittedly committed, including the ones in this case.  The testimony by Willy Maya Acosta was given in order to hopefully receive a reduction of sentence on account of cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating this testimony, you should consider whether that testimony has been influenced by the government's promise, and you should consider that testimony with greater caution than that of ordinary witnesses.  Such agreements are legal.  The law only requires that you consider testimony given under those circumstances with greater caution than that of ordinary witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. II at 406-07.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the instructions given by the judge did not contain the specific instruction sought by Gonzalez-Soberal, \"there is not reversible error if the jury charge taken as a whole substantially covered the issues contained in the requested instruction.\"  Angiulo, 897 F.2d at 1207.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the instructions given to the jury, we conclude that they substantially covered issues of credibility with respect to the witnesses in question.  The judge reminded the jury that the two witnesses had been convicted and that they had cooperation agreements with the government.  He gave instructions concerning the credibility of witnesses, telling the jury that they should view the testimony of these witnesses with greater caution than the testimony of an ordinary witness.  There is no reason to believe that the jurors were misled by these instructions, or that they believed it impermissible to view with additional skepticism the testimony of witnesses who had prior convictions.  Accordingly, we find no error in these jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Reasonable Doubt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Soberal also claims that the trial court's jury instructions regarding reasonable doubt impermissibly reduced the government's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his initial instructions to the jury, the judge made the following remarks:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second.  The burden of proof is on the government until the very end of the case.  The defendant has no burden to prove his innocence or to present any evidence or to testify.  Since the defendant has the right to remain silent, the law prohibits you in arriving at your verdict from considering whether the defendant may or may not have testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third.  The government must prove a case against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.  I will give you further instructions at the end of the case, but in this sense be mindful, those of you who participated in civil cases, that the standard is different.  In the civil case we say a plaintiff prevails if he proves a case by a preponderance of the evidence.  In the criminal case the situation we say the government prevails if it proves a case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If I were to graphically illustrate for purposes of an initial charge or instruction so you have an idea what I'm talking about, I would say this.  In the civil case if we bring a balance, scale of the type used in old drugstores before, not any more, you will put evidence--in the civil case plaintiff's evidence on one of the plates and defendant's evidence on the other, you will see how well the reaction is.  If the scale just starts moving a little bit to the plaintiff's side, the plaintiff has prevailed.  That is preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we say \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" proving a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, by the very words we're implying that the government has a heavier burden than the one that I just described.  Because liberties are involved, it's a different kind of case, therefore the government's burden is heavier than that and I will explain that at the end of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. I at 11-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the case, the judge returned to the reasonable doubt issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presumption of innocence alone is sufficient to find him not guilty and can only be overcome if the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt each and every essential element of the crimes charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And what is reasonable doubt?   A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense and may arise from a careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence or from lack of evidence.  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, after a careful and impartial consideration with your fellow jurors of all the evidence, you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, it is your duty to find the defendant not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. II at 418-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has cautioned against the risks that can accompany attempts to define reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Campbell, 874 F.2d 838, 843 (1st Cir.1989).  Nevertheless, attempts to define reasonable doubt do not necessarily result in reversible error.  Andujar, 49 F.3d at 23.   We have said that, in our experience, even imperfect formulations, usually meet the constitutional requirements when viewed in the context of the entire charge to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we review a trial court's definition of reasonable doubt, our concern is whether the instructions have a tendency to reduce the government's burden of proof at trial.  Id.  We will find instructions erroneous when, taken as a whole, they have a reasonable likelihood of leading the jury to believe that it can convict on some lesser standard of proof than that required under the reasonable doubt standard.  See United States v. Romero, 32 F.3d 641, 651 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the instructions in this case, we believe that there is no reasonable likelihood of misleading the jury.  The judge explained that the burden of proof is entirely on the government, and that the government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  The judge contrasted the reasonable doubt standard with the preponderance of the evidence standard in order to avoid any confusion in the minds of jurors who may have served on civil juries in the past.  At the end of the trial, in his final instructions, the judge repeated that the defendant must be presumed innocent and that the government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Nothing in the judge's attempt to define reasonable doubt was likely to mislead the jury or suggest that the government's burden of proof is less than the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Fair Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next claims that the district court \"repeatedly questioned witnesses on his own in a manner that made him a partisan of the government's case thereby depriving appellant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.\"   Appellant's Brief at 33.  Appellant alleges that the judge's questions served to bolster the credibility of government witnesses and undermine that of defense witnesses.  Appellant also argues that the judge improperly raised objections to appellant's attorney's questioning and that he elicited improper hearsay from a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that the trial judge has \"a perfect right--albeit a right that should be exercised with care--to participate actively in the trial proper.\"  Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040 (1st Cir.1997).  A trial judge retains the common law power to question witnesses and to comment on the evidence.  Id.;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 614(b) (\"The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or by a party.\").  There are, however, limits to the behavior that is permitted judges.  \"[F]or example, the judge's participation must be balanced;  he cannot become an advocate or otherwise use his judicial powers to advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.\"  Id.  \"An inquiry into the judge's conduct of the trial necessarily turns on the question of whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, appellant cites several instances of alleged bias on behalf of the judge.  After careful review, we conclude that these instances were no more than attempts by the judge to clarify questions, speed the proceedings, or ensure that all information is before the jury.  We see no need to recite at length from appellant's brief, choosing instead to comment briefly on his allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that the judge bolstered the credibility of government witnesses on two occasions.  We have reviewed the relevant testimony and consider the judge's questioning to be no more than an effort to make clear that the witnesses were testifying under cooperation agreements and to impress on the witnesses the fact that they were required to tell the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another instance cited by appellant was a decision by the judge to overrule an objection by appellant's counsel.  The government was introducing a photograph that included certain markings.  Defense counsel objected on the grounds that the markings contaminated the photo.  At a bench conference, appellant's counsel stated that he understood that the markings were made during the trial of co-conspirators and that the witness could easily make the same markings on an unmarked photo if one were available.  The judge overruled the objection, stating to the jury that he knew what the marks were and that the marks were explained to counsel.  Appellant claims, without elaboration, that these comments amount to bolstering the government's evidence.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the claims that the judge sought to undermine defense witnesses and defense counsel, we find them to be meritless.  In both instances identified by appellant, the judge was merely attempting to move the trial along without unnecessary delay and the judge's comments cannot be taken to demonstrate bias.  See Logue, 103 F.3d at 1045;  Deary v. Gloucester, 9 F.3d 191, 194-95 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant argues that the judge elicited hearsay evidence during testimony.  Following an objection on hearsay grounds, the judge asked the witness, Negrn-Zapata, \"Who told you that Chanci had said or that Chanci would--If we would find kilos he would--he would keep them?\"   When Negrn-Zapata replied that Mr. Arroyo had told him this, the judge sustained the objection.  Even if it were determined that this was improperly admitted hearsay, it would be harmless error.  Nothing in the judge's remarks or the witness's brief response was in any way prejudicial to the defendant.  The comments simply do not relate to the defendant, implying that, if error, they were harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Soberal argues that the trial court committed error when it refused to grant a two-point \"minor participant\" reduction in his offense level on the basis of his role as a courier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  \"We will reverse the district court's finding that a defendant is not a minimal or minor participant only if it is clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d 396, 399 (1st Cir.1989);  see also United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[W]e review a sentencing court's role-in-the-offense determination only for clear error.\").  The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a downward adjustment for his role in the offense.  See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 717 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's claim fails on two independent grounds.  First, he argues that \"[t]he trial evidence indicates that appellant was a mere courier of money and narcotics,\" Appellant's Brief at 42, yet he points to no testimony or evidence to support the assertion that his role was limited to one of courier.  He refers to only one statement made by the trial judge, who commented that \"the evidence has shown so far that the defendant was a money courier.\"   Tr. II at 481.  This is insufficient to meet the defendant's burden in this case, and is unconvincing.  During sentencing, the judge's comments, taken in their entirety, do not suggest that the judge viewed the defendant as a mere courier.  For example, the judge stated \"I do not think that he was other than a regular drug dealer that was arranging drug transactions like everybody else was.\"   Tr. II at 481.  In addition, the court made it clear that it had considered the defendant's role in the offense, stating that \"the court has considered his role ... in the context of the relative culpability of the different defendants that participated in this particular conspiracy.  And I will not make an adjustment on account of role.\"   Tr. II at 488.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if it was shown that Gonzalez-Soberal had been no more than a courier, he would not automatically be entitled to a reduction.  See United States v. Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d 1124, 1131 (1st Cir.1992);  Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d at 399.  \"A defendant has the burden of proving entitlement to such a downward adjustment, and can only prevail on appeal by demonstrating that the district court's determination as to his role in the offense was clearly erroneous.\"  Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d at 1131 (citations omitted).  Appellant fails to present any reasons why, on the facts of this case, he should be granted such a reduction.  Therefore, even assuming, arguendo, that appellant was able to establish that he was merely a courier, he has failed to carry his burden of showing that he is entitled to a downward adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the above analysis, and the deferential posture we take toward role-in-the-offense determinations, we find no clear error in the district court's sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines states:</p>\n        <p>Based on the defendant's role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows:</p>\n        <p>...</p>\n        <p>(b) If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by two levels.</p>\n        <p>United States Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 3B1.2.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

He now appeals, claiming errors in the jury selection process, the jury instructions, and in the actions of the trial judge, including sentencing.  Finding no reversible error, we affirm.

Jury Selection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant makes three claims with respect to the jury selection.  First, he argues that the district court committed reversible error when it removed juror number 9.  Second, he submits that the failure to remove juror number 45 for failure to adequately speak and understand English was also reversible error.

While the judge was delivering the charge, there was a disruption in the jury box.  The judge summarized the incident as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I remember juror number 9 from her impaneling questions, she's a very intelligent woman, she's an economist.  Her husband works at the Department of Treasury.  She's--she's--she's a person with a lot of education, formal education.  But I do think that what I saw here in court today was not a normal reaction.  That is not a normal reaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It's entirely possible that she's having some sort of problem that she's not even aware of.  But what she did, she interrupted the jury charge, and as if we were not here, as if she was alone with--with a juror that is sitting next to her, she started a conversation with him in a loud tone of voice.  She started to touch this juror, tried to take his name tag off of his clothing, asked him questions about the problems, something around his neck or I don't know what.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I stopped, listened, watched, did not make an issue.  And when I asked her up here, when I asked her up here she did not remember what had happened, actually.  She could not remember the reasons why she interrupted the jury charge or started to touch her neighbor.  And I--I honestly think that she has a problem.  I don't know what the problem is.  She has some sort of problem with her.  Not only that, but some of the jurors have--some of the jurors have expressed their concern about her ability to be sitting in this jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr.

He offered defense counsel the opportunity to choose between the two alternate jurors, and counsel chose alternate number 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge then asked juror number 9 to approach the bench and explained to her his intention to excuse her.  She stated that she had found the case very difficult and that she felt compassion for those involved.  Upon questioning, she responded that she had not slept well the night before because she had been thinking about the case.  She also told the court that she took medication to control her epilepsy.

There was significant evidence that juror number 9 was no longer able to perform her duties.  Considering the deference that we must accord the trial judge in matters such as this one, we affirm the decision to remove the juror.  We add that there is no evidence that the judge's decision was influenced by the juror's view of the case.  Although the juror stated that she found the case to be difficult and that she had \"compassion for these people,\" Tr. II at 453, these statements were made after the judge had decided to remove her from the jury.  Furthermore, they do not, as appellant contends, demonstrate that \"she had reasonable doubts as to whether or not appellant should be found guilty.\"   Appellant's Brief at 15.

The district court disagreed.  Shortly thereafter, counsel again raised the question of juror number 45's proficiency in English.  The judge responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>Number one, Mr. Chique was examined in English by me.

We are hesitant to reverse the reasoned conclusion of the trial judge on the question of a juror's ability to understand English because the trial judge is in a much better position to assess the language competency of a particular juror.  See Molinares Charris, 822 F.2d at 1222-23;  Walsh, 75 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the juror in question had met the statutory linguistic competency standard under the Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1865, and had undergone voir dire--during which defense counsel had the opportunity to question the juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although those portions of the transcript quoted suggest that the juror's command of the English language was less than that of a native speaker, they do not warrant the conclusion that the juror was unable to follow the proceedings or understand the evidence and therefore do not merit reversal.  In light of our deferential standard of review and the limited information available from the transcript, we cannot overturn the judge's decision to retain juror number 45.  We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Defense counsel sought to have the juror excused for cause.  The district court, having interviewed the juror, determined that he should not be excused for cause.  Defendant eventually used one of his peremptory challenges to strike the juror.  Appellant now argues that the juror should have been removed for cause, that the failure to remove the juror forced the defendant to use a peremptory challenge, and that this constitutes grounds for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that the trial court has considerable discretion in ruling on challenges for cause.

Following an exchange with counsel, the judge decided to leave the juror on the panel, citing as reasons the fact that the juror, when asked if he could be impartial, had been extremely assertive in his answer, and that he was intelligent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in either the record or the parties' briefs on appeal suggests that the trial court's decision to retain juror number 1 was grossly in error.

A conviction is a factor you may consider in deciding whether to believe that witness, but it does not necessarily destroy the witness's credibility.  It has been brought to your attention only because you may wish to consider it when you decide whether you believe the witness's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's Proposed Jury Instruction # 1.12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions delivered by the court, although they did not contain this precise instruction, did include the following language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have heard testimony from an unindicted co-conspirator, Mr. William Negrn Zapata, and from a defendant in this same case who, as you know, was tried earlier, Willy Maya Acosta, who have--who both have cooperation agreements with the government.  The testimony by Mr. Negrn Zapata was given in exchange for a promise by the government that he will not be prosecuted for some crimes he admittedly committed, including the ones in this case.  The testimony by Willy Maya Acosta was given in order to hopefully receive a reduction of sentence on account of cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating this testimony, you should consider whether that testimony has been influenced by the government's promise, and you should consider that testimony with greater caution than that of ordinary witnesses.  Such agreements are legal.  The law only requires that you consider testimony given under those circumstances with greater caution than that of ordinary witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr.

The judge reminded the jury that the two witnesses had been convicted and that they had cooperation agreements with the government.  He gave instructions concerning the credibility of witnesses, telling the jury that they should view the testimony of these witnesses with greater caution than the testimony of an ordinary witness.  There is no reason to believe that the jurors were misled by these instructions, or that they believed it impermissible to view with additional skepticism the testimony of witnesses who had prior convictions.  Accordingly, we find no error in these jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Reasonable Doubt</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Soberal also claims that the trial court's jury instructions regarding reasonable doubt impermissibly reduced the government's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his initial instructions to the jury, the judge made the following remarks:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second.  The burden of proof is on the government until the very end of the case.  The defendant has no burden to prove his innocence or to present any evidence or to testify.  Since the defendant has the right to remain silent, the law prohibits you in arriving at your verdict from considering whether the defendant may or may not have testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third.  The government must prove a case against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.  I will give you further instructions at the end of the case, but in this sense be mindful, those of you who participated in civil cases, that the standard is different.  In the civil case we say a plaintiff prevails if he proves a case by a preponderance of the evidence.  In the criminal case the situation we say the government prevails if it proves a case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If I were to graphically illustrate for purposes of an initial charge or instruction so you have an idea what I'm talking about, I would say this.  In the civil case if we bring a balance, scale of the type used in old drugstores before, not any more, you will put evidence--in the civil case plaintiff's evidence on one of the plates and defendant's evidence on the other, you will see how well the reaction is.  If the scale just starts moving a little bit to the plaintiff's side, the plaintiff has prevailed.  That is preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we say \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" proving a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, by the very words we're implying that the government has a heavier burden than the one that I just described.  Because liberties are involved, it's a different kind of case, therefore the government's burden is heavier than that and I will explain that at the end of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. I at 11-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of the case, the judge returned to the reasonable doubt issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presumption of innocence alone is sufficient to find him not guilty and can only be overcome if the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt each and every essential element of the crimes charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And what is reasonable doubt?   A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense and may arise from a careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence or from lack of evidence.  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, after a careful and impartial consideration with your fellow jurors of all the evidence, you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty, it is your duty to find the defendant not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr.

See United States v. Andujar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195947\"><a href=\"/opinion/195947/united-states-v-andujar/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Nevertheless, attempts to define reasonable doubt do not necessarily result in reversible error.  Andujar, 49 F.3d at 23.   We have said that, in our experience, even imperfect formulations, usually meet the constitutional requirements when viewed in the context of the entire charge to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we review a trial court's definition of reasonable doubt, our concern is whether the instructions have a tendency to reduce the government's burden of proof at trial.  Id.  We will find instructions erroneous when, taken as a whole, they have a reasonable likelihood of leading the jury to believe that it can convict on some lesser standard of proof than that required under the reasonable doubt standard.  See United States v. Romero, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195567\"><a href=\"/opinion/195567/united-states-v-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 651 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reviewed the instructions in this case, we believe that there is no reasonable likelihood of misleading the jury.  The judge explained that the burden of proof is entirely on the government, and that the government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  The judge contrasted the reasonable doubt standard with the preponderance of the evidence standard in order to avoid any confusion in the minds of jurors who may have served on civil juries in the past.  At the end of the trial, in his final instructions, the judge repeated that the defendant must be presumed innocent and that the government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Nothing in the judge's attempt to define reasonable doubt was likely to mislead the jury or suggest that the government's burden of proof is less than the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Fair Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next claims that the district court \"repeatedly questioned witnesses on his own in a manner that made him a partisan of the government's case thereby depriving appellant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.\"   Appellant's Brief at 33.  Appellant alleges that the judge's questions served to bolster the credibility of government witnesses and undermine that of defense witnesses.  Appellant also argues that the judge improperly raised objections to appellant's attorney's questioning and that he elicited improper hearsay from a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well settled that the trial judge has \"a perfect right--albeit a right that should be exercised with care--to participate actively in the trial proper.\"  Logue v. Dore, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197149\"><a href=\"/opinion/197149/logue-v-dore/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997).  A trial judge retains the common law power to question witnesses and to comment on the evidence.  Id.;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 614(b) (\"The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or by a party.\").  There are, however, limits to the behavior that is permitted judges.  \"[F]or example, the judge's participation must be balanced;  he cannot become an advocate or otherwise use his judicial powers to advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.\"  Id.  \"An inquiry into the judge's conduct of the trial necessarily turns on the question of whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, appellant cites several instances of alleged bias on behalf of the judge.  After careful review, we conclude that these instances were no more than attempts by the judge to clarify questions, speed the proceedings, or ensure that all information is before the jury.  We see no need to recite at length from appellant's brief, choosing instead to comment briefly on his allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that the judge bolstered the credibility of government witnesses on two occasions.  We have reviewed the relevant testimony and consider the judge's questioning to be no more than an effort to make clear that the witnesses were testifying under cooperation agreements and to impress on the witnesses the fact that they were required to tell the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another instance cited by appellant was a decision by the judge to overrule an objection by appellant's counsel.  The government was introducing a photograph that included certain markings.  Defense counsel objected on the grounds that the markings contaminated the photo.  At a bench conference, appellant's counsel stated that he understood that the markings were made during the trial of co-conspirators and that the witness could easily make the same markings on an unmarked photo if one were available.  The judge overruled the objection, stating to the jury that he knew what the marks were and that the marks were explained to counsel.  Appellant claims, without elaboration, that these comments amount to bolstering the government's evidence.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the claims that the judge sought to undermine defense witnesses and defense counsel, we find them to be meritless.  In both instances identified by appellant, the judge was merely attempting to move the trial along without unnecessary delay and the judge's comments cannot be taken to demonstrate bias.  See Logue, 103 F.3d at 1045;  Deary v. Gloucester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195029\"><a href=\"/opinion/195029/deary-v-city-of-gloucester/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 194-95 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant argues that the judge elicited hearsay evidence during testimony.  Following an objection on hearsay grounds, the judge asked the witness, Negrn-Zapata, \"Who told you that Chanci had said or that Chanci would--If we would find kilos he would--he would keep them?\"   When Negrn-Zapata replied that Mr. Arroyo had told him this, the judge sustained the objection.  Even if it were determined that this was improperly admitted hearsay, it would be harmless error.  Nothing in the judge's remarks or the witness's brief response was in any way prejudicial to the defendant.  The comments simply do not relate to the defendant, implying that, if error, they were harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Soberal argues that the trial court committed error when it refused to grant a two-point \"minor participant\" reduction in his offense level on the basis of his role as a courier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  \"We will reverse the district court's finding that a defendant is not a minimal or minor participant only if it is clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Paz Uribe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533568\"><a href=\"/opinion/533568/united-states-v-mario-nelson-paz-uribe/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span>, 399 (1st Cir.1989);  see also United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[W]e review a sentencing court's role-in-the-offense determination only for clear error.\").  The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a downward adjustment for his role in the offense.  See United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 717 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's claim fails on two independent grounds.  First, he argues that \"[t]he trial evidence indicates that appellant was a mere courier of money and narcotics,\" Appellant's Brief at 42, yet he points to no testimony or evidence to support the assertion that his role was limited to one of courier.  He refers to only one statement made by the trial judge, who commented that \"the evidence has shown so far that the defendant was a money courier.\"   Tr. II at 481.  This is insufficient to meet the defendant's burden in this case, and is unconvincing.  During sentencing, the judge's comments, taken in their entirety, do not suggest that the judge viewed the defendant as a mere courier.  For example, the judge stated \"I do not think that he was other than a regular drug dealer that was arranging drug transactions like everybody else was.\"   Tr. II at 481.  In addition, the court made it clear that it had considered the defendant's role in the offense, stating that \"the court has considered his role ... in the context of the relative culpability of the different defendants that participated in this particular conspiracy.  And I will not make an adjustment on account of role.\"   Tr. II at 488.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if it was shown that Gonzalez-Soberal had been no more than a courier, he would not automatically be entitled to a reduction.  See United States v. Lopez-Gil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584140\"><a href=\"/opinion/584140/united-states-v-jesus-m-lopez-gil/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>, 1131 (1st Cir.1992);  Paz Uribe, 891 F.2d at 399.  \"A defendant has the burden of proving entitlement to such a downward adjustment, and can only prevail on appeal by demonstrating that the district court's determination as to his role in the offense was clearly erroneous.\"  Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d at 1131 (citations omitted).  Appellant fails to present any reasons why, on the facts of this case, he should be granted such a reduction.  Therefore, even assuming, arguendo, that appellant was able to establish that he was merely a courier, he has failed to carry his burden of showing that he is entitled to a downward adjustment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the above analysis, and the deferential posture we take toward role-in-the-offense determinations, we find no clear error in the district court's sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines states:</p>\n        <p>Based on the defendant's role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows:</p>\n        <p>...</p>\n        <p>(b) If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by two levels.</p>\n        <p>United States Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 3B1.2.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
