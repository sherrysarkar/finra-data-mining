  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the First Circuit\n\nNo. 98-1125\n\nCUMBERLAND FARMS, INC., ET AL.,\n\nPlaintiffs, Appellees,\n\n          v.\n\n  STANLEY R. COHEN,\n\nDefendant, Appellant.\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n[Hon. Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n        Before\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\nStahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\nStanley R. Cohen for appellant.\nAlan P. Jurista for appellees.\n\nMay 18, 1999\n\nPer curiam.  This is an interlocutory appeal of a \"Second\nOrder of Contempt\" issued against defendant-appellant Stanley R.\nCohen on December 15, 1997.  By order dated March 24, 1998, we\nsuggested that Cohen bring to the district court's attention the\nfact that he had filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition so that the\ncourt might consider whether the automatic stay prescribed in 11\nU.S.C.  362 precluded enforcement of either the December 15, 1997\ncontempt order or a subsequent order commanding that Cohen be\nincarcerated until he purge himself of his contempt.  In our March\n24, 1998 order, we also directed the district court to notify us\n\"[i]f either the contempt order or the incarceration order is\nvacated . . . .\"\nOn March 28, 1998, Cohen moved the district court to\nvacate the order of contempt and to order his immediate release\nfrom incarceration.  On June 11, 1998, the court allowed the motion\nand ordered that Cohen be immediately released from prison. \nSubsequently, the court denied plaintiff Cumberland Farms, Inc.'s\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60 motion for limited relief from its June 11, 1998\norder.  Yet the court never notified us that it had vacated the\ncontempt order that is the subject of this appeal.  We noticed said\nvacatur only after examining the district court record following\noral argument.\nThe vacatur of the contempt order Cohen appeals from\nhaving now come to our attention, we dismiss this appeal as moot.\nAppeal dismissed.  No costs.\n",
