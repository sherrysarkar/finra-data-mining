Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n                                         \r\n                            Before\r\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n          Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n                                         \r\n\nLouis F. Robbio with whom Robbio &amp; Nottie Ltd. was on brief for\r\nappellant Wally Bamdele.\r\nJames M. Fox, by appointment of the court, for appellant Eghosa\r\nOgbemudia.\r\nEdwin J. Gale, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Sheldon\r\nWhitehouse, United States Attorney, was on consolidated brief for the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        March 9, 1998\r\n                                               Per Curiam.  Eghosa Ogbemudia and Wally Bamdele were\r\nconvicted on June 20, 1996, of six counts of bank fraud, 18\r\nU.S.C.  2, 1344, and one count of conspiracy to commit bank\r\nfraud, 18 U.S.C.  371.  The evidence showed that Ogbemudia,\r\nwith the assistance of Bamdele, gave fraudulent checks to\r\nothers, instructing the recruits to deposit the checks into\r\ntheir own bank accounts and then to withdraw the money in\r\ncash a few days later and give most of the money to the\r\nappellants.  The scheme was made possible because the banks\r\nallowed the money to be withdrawn before the validity of the\r\nchecks could be determined.\r\n    Ogbemudia was sentenced to 51 months in prison, and Bamdele\r\nto 46 months.  Both were also sentenced to five years of\r\nsupervised release (or, if deported after completing their\r\nterms, five years of exile from the United States). \r\nAppellants were also ordered to make restitution of\r\n$55,650.00 to the defrauded bank.\r\n    On appeal, two points are worthy of brief discussion.\r\n    1.   Bamdele argues that his sentence was wrongly increased for\r\nobstruction of justice  .  In part due to information from a\r\nrecruit who agreed to cooperate with the Secret Service,\r\nBamdele was arrested in November 1995.  In December 1995,\r\nBamdele, who had been released from jail, came to the\r\nwitness's home while she was at work.  That evening, he came\r\nto her home again, pounded on her door and yelled for her to\r\ncome downstairs.  The witness, fearing retribution for her\r\ncooperation, called the police.\r\n    When the police arrived, the witness went outside to tell the\r\nstory of the check scheme to the police in order to explain\r\nto them why Bamdele was at her home.  Bamdele said that she\r\nwas lying.  As Bamdele was being arrested, his companion, who\r\nhad been waiting in the car, told Bamdele--\"within earshot of\r\n[the witness]\"--that he would tell Bamdele's \"people\" about\r\nthe witness.  Bamdele said nothing in response.\r\n    Based on this episode, the district court imposed on Bamdele\r\na two-level increase for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. \r\n3C1.1, raising the maximum sentence from 37 months to 46\r\nmonths.  In explaining this enhancement, the district judge\r\nreferred to the companion's statement as \"an additional\r\nthreat, which is tacitly accepted by this defendant . . . .\" \r\nBamdele argues that he cannot be held responsible for a\r\nthreat uttered by his companion, and that his own silence did\r\nnot constitute an adoptive admission of the threat.  \r\n    We agree that Bamdele would not have been responsible for\r\nsilence alone, but do not think that this is a fair reading\r\nof the evidence, which virtually compelled the enhancement. \r\nBamdele twice visited the home of a cooperating witness,\r\npounded on her door, screamed at her, and accused her of\r\nlying; this is ample to sustain the district court's finding,\r\non a preponderance standard, that Bamdele was trying to\r\nintimidate the witness.  The companion's remark simply\r\nconfirmed what was implicit in these events.\r\n    We also reject Bamdele's argument that the obstruction did\r\nnot occur \"during the investigation . . . of the instant\r\noffense,\" which is a requirement of U.S.S.G.  3C1.1.  The\r\nwitness that Bamdele tried to intimidate had provided an\r\nearly lead in the investigation of the scheme for which\r\nBamdele was ultimately convicted in the district court.  It\r\nis irrelevant whether the particular check or checks\r\nconnected to the witness happened to be the focus of the\r\nprosecution.\r\n    2.   The more interesting issue in the case, which we need not\r\ndecide on the merits, is appellants' claim that a downward\r\ndeparture was appropriate because of their status as aliens. \r\n18 U.S.C.  3624(c) instructs the Bureau of Prisons, \"to the\r\nextent practicable,\" to move prisoners from prisons into\r\ntransitional detention, like halfway houses, during the last\r\ntenth of their sentences.  Under Bureau of Prisons policy,\r\nthis arrangement (we are told) is not available to convicted\r\naliens.  Therefore, the appellants reason, district courts\r\nshould be allowed to reduce by ten percent the length of\r\naliens' sentences.\r\n    When the argument was made to the district court, it\r\nsummarily denied the requested departure.  At least two\r\ncircuits have indicated that such a departure is permitted. \r\nSee United States v. Smith, 27 F.3d 649, 655 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1994); United States v. Farouil, 124 F.3d 838, 847 (7th Cir.\r\n1997).  Another district judge in this circuit has recently\r\ndeparted on the same basis.  See United States v. Bakeas,    \r\nF. Supp.    , 1997 WL 757860, *8 (D. Mass. Nov. 14, 1997). \r\nBamdele cited Smith to the district court in his sentencing\r\nbrief; nothing to the contrary was cited by the government.\r\n    It is common practice that when a district court wants to\r\ndepart but thinks that the law bars such a departure, the\r\ndistrict court makes this clear at sentencing.  Here, the\r\nonly authority cited to the judge was Smith, affirming a\r\nsimilar departure.  We are satisfied that the district court\r\nrefused to exercise its discretion to depart, see, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Rizzo, 121 F.3d 794, 799-800 (1st Cir.\r\n1997); United States v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130-33 (1st\r\nCir. 1995), and we reserve for another time the question\r\nwhether such a departure would ever be permitted.\r\n    Ogbemudia and Bamdele raise a number of other claims that are\r\nadequately answered in the government's brief.  These include\r\njury venire composition arguments and a number of sentencing\r\narguments that, while legitimately raised, do not come close\r\nto showing an abuse of the district court's discretion or\r\nclear error.  Bamdele also says that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to convict him on certain counts, but we hold\r\nthat it was sufficient.  Ogbemudia challenges the restitution\r\norder, which we also hold to have been proper.\r\n    Affirmed.\n",
