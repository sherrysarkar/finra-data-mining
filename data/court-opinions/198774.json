Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Kern Cleven for appellant.\r\n   Arnold H. Huftalen, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJanuary 24, 2000\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant Geraldo\r\nGonzalez appeals from the district court's refusal to allow him to\r\nwithdraw his plea before sentencing, and its failure to conduct an\r\nevidentiary hearing on the motion seeking such withdrawal.  We\r\naffirm.\r\n                             I.\r\n                         Background\r\nOn April 10, 1997, Gonzalez, a national of Cuba who has\r\nresided in the United States since 1980, was indicted on three\r\nseparate charges.  Attorney Phillip Desfosses was appointed to\r\nrepresent him.  On August 4, 1997, represented by Desfosses's\r\npartner Harry Starbranch, Gonzalez pleaded guilty to two charges:\r\nmail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1341 (1994), and the use of\r\nan unauthorized access device to obtain property exceeding $1,000\r\nin value, as proscribed by 18 U.S.C.  1029(a)(2) (1994).  During\r\nhis plea colloquy, Gonzalez admitted that the losses resulting from\r\nhis crimes in fact exceeded $10,000.\r\nGonzalez successfully moved to continue sentencing on\r\nNovember 10, 1997, and on December 25, 1997, he requested\r\nsubstitute counsel.  On December 30, 1997, Desfosses moved to\r\nwithdraw from the case.  In January, 1998, the court granted\r\nDesfosses's motion and appointed attorney Sven Wiberg to represent\r\nGonzalez.\r\nOn September 4, 1998, following several more continuances\r\nwhich further postponed sentencing, Gonzalez moved to withdraw his\r\nplea pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e) (\"Rule\r\n32(e)\").  Gonzalez's Rule 32(e) motion averred that he had not been\r\ninformed of his guilty plea's \"potential and/or likely adverse\r\nimmigration consequences\" until after the plea was made.  The\r\nmotion included a letter from Desfosses confirming Gonzalez's\r\nassertion.  Gonzalez argued that Desfosses's failure to advise him\r\nof the immigration issue constituted ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel and rendered his plea defective.  Gonzalez did not request,\r\nand the court did not conduct, an evidentiary hearing on the Rule\r\n32(e) motion. \r\nOn December 7, 1998, the court denied Gonzalez's motion. \r\nGonzalez filed a \"Motion to Reconsider Motion to Withdraw Plea,\"\r\nwhich was denied on January 4, 1999.  The next day, the court\r\nsentenced Gonzalez to twenty-seven (27) months of imprisonment and\r\nordered him to pay $17,273.03 in restitution.\r\nIn addition to his criminal punishment, Gonzalez's\r\nconviction subjected him to potential immigration-related\r\nconsequences.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8\r\nU.S.C.  1101 et seq. (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996), enumerates various\r\n\"aggravated felonies\" the commission of which will render an alien\r\ndeportable.  See id.  1101 (a)(43); id.  1227 (a)(2)(A)(iii). \r\nThis list includes \"an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit\r\nin which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\"  Id.\r\n1101(a)(43)(M).  Because Gonzalez's fraudulent activities caused\r\nlosses exceeding $10,000, he had committed an \"aggravated felony\"\r\nunder the INA, and had therefore become subject to deportation.\r\nThe INA directs the Attorney General to \"take into\r\ncustody any alien who . . . is deportable by reason of having\r\ncommitted [among other things, any aggravated felony] . . . when\r\nthe alien is released.\"  Id.  1226(c)(1).  The Attorney General\r\nmay release such an alien only in narrowly limited circumstances\r\nnot here applicable.  This regime reflects amendments embodied in\r\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\r\n1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (\"IIRIRA\").  As a\r\nnative of Cuba, which has no deportation agreement with the United\r\nStates, Gonzalez now faces the possibility of indefinite\r\nadministrative detention following his release from prison.\r\n                            II.\r\n                         Discussion\r\nGonzalez advances several arguments in his attempt to\r\nreverse the district court's refusal to grant his Rule 32(e)\r\nmotion.  He also challenges the court's failure to hold an\r\nevidentiary hearing prior to ruling on the motion.  We address\r\nthese arguments in turn.\r\nA.  Motion to Withdraw Plea\r\nThe heart of Gonzalez's claim is that neither his\r\nattorneys nor the district judge advised him that if he pleaded\r\nguilty, he would be deemed \"deportable\" and subject to detention by\r\nthe INS.  He further complains that the district court failed to\r\nwarn him of the possibility of restitution.  Gonzalez contends that\r\nthese deficiencies entitled him to withdraw his plea.  We review\r\nthe trial court's refusal to grant a change of plea only for abuse\r\nof discretion, see, e.g., United States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 41\r\n(1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 787 (1st\r\nCir. 1991), and finding none, we affirm.  \r\nRule 32(e) states that \"[i]f a motion to withdraw a plea\r\nof guilty . . . is made before sentence is imposed, the court may\r\npermit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and\r\njust reason.\"   Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e) (emphasis added).  A\r\ndefendant thus has no absolute right to withdraw a plea.  See\r\nUnited States v. Muriel, 111 F.3d 975, 978 (1st Cir. 1997); United\r\nStates v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 834 (1st Cir. 1996).  A \"fair and just\r\nreason\" is a necessary, but not sufficient, predicate to plea\r\nwithdrawal.  See United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st\r\nCir. 1992) (\"A defendant may withdraw a guilty plea prior to\r\nsentencing only upon a showing a fair and just reason for the\r\nrequest.\"); see also Raineri, 42 F.3d at 41 (same).  \r\nRule 32(e) motions must be considered in the general\r\ncontext of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (\"Rule 11\"), which governs the entry\r\nof all guilty pleas.  Rule 11(c) provides that:\r\n  [b]efore accepting a plea of guilty . . . the\r\ncourt must address the defendant personally in\r\nopen court and inform the defendant of, and\r\ndetermine that the defendant understands, . .\r\n. the nature of the charge to which the plea\r\nis offered, the mandatory minimum penalty\r\nprovided by law, if any, and the maximum\r\npossible penalty provided by law, including\r\nthe effect of any special parole or supervised\r\nrelease term, the fact that the court is\r\nrequired to consider any applicable sentencing\r\nguidelines but may depart from those\r\nguidelines under some circumstances, and, when\r\napplicable, that the court may also order the\r\ndefendant to make restitution to any victim of\r\nthe offense.\r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11.  Yet Rule 11(h), labeled \"Harmless Error,\"\r\nstates that \"[a]ny variance from the procedures required by [Rule\r\n11] which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\"\r\nIn evaluating Rule 32(e) motions, a court's central\r\nconcern is whether the plea was \"voluntary, intelligent and\r\nknowing, within the meaning of Rule 11.\"  United States v. Marrero-\r\nRivera, 124 F.3d 342, 347 (1st Cir. 1997); see also United States\r\nv. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.\r\nAllard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1243 (1st Cir. 1991).  In addition, the\r\ndistrict court must consider four factors: (1) the force of the\r\ndefendant's reason for the change of plea; (2) the timing of the\r\nrequest; (3) whether or not the defendant asserts innocence in\r\nconnection with his plea withdrawal; and (4) whether a plea\r\nagreement had been reached.  See Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 347;\r\nIsom, 85 F.3d at 834; Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4.  We address the\r\nfinal three factors first and then turn to the reasons for\r\nGonzalez's requested plea withdrawal and whether those reasons\r\nrender his plea involuntary.\r\nThe timing of Gonzalez's motion casts doubt on his\r\nentitlement to a plea withdrawal.  \"[A] long interval between the\r\nplea and the request often weakens any claim that the plea was\r\nentered in confusion or under false pretenses.\"  Doyle, 981 F.2d at\r\n595; see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 838-39.  Of course, when a defendant\r\nseeks to withdraw his plea based on knowledge that was obtained\r\nafter the plea, the relevant temporal gap is not the time between\r\nthe Rule 32(e) motion and the original plea, but the time between\r\nhis discovery of the new information and the filing of his motion. \r\nHere, this gap is extensive.  In the letter from Desfosses that\r\nGonzalez submitted with his Motion to Withdraw Plea, Desfosses\r\nstated that \"[i]t was not until the attorney-client relationship\r\nbetween myself and Mr. Gonzalez had started to breakdown did he\r\ninform me that the law had recently been changed regarding the\r\ndeportation of Cubans due to felony convictions.\"  Thus, Gonzalez\r\nbecame aware of his plea's immigration consequences sometime before\r\nthe end of December, 1997, when Desfosses sought to remove himself\r\nfrom further representation.  Yet, notwithstanding that acquired\r\nknowledge, Gonzalez did not move to withdraw his plea until\r\nSeptember, 1998.  We have previously rejected plea withdrawal\r\nmotions in which the relevant gap was six months, see Doyle, 981\r\nF.2d at 595, two months, see Isom, 85 F.3d at 839, three weeks, see\r\nUnited States v. Keefe, 621 F.2d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 1980), and even\r\nthirteen days, see United States v. Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 313 (1st\r\nCir. 1987). \r\nGonzalez's consistent failure to assert his innocence\r\nalso weighs against the reversal of the district court's decision. \r\n\"Courts look more hospitably on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea\r\nwhen the motion is coupled with an assertion of innocence. . . .\r\n[T]he absence of a claim of innocence weighs in favor of allowing\r\na guilty plea to stand.\"  Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596.  Gonzalez at no\r\ntime asserted his innocence.  Finally, Gonzalez does not dispute\r\nthat he signed a plea agreement, and that signed agreement casts\r\nfurther doubt on his claims.\r\nWe thus turn to the three purported bases of Gonzalez's\r\nMotion to Withdraw Plea, and the question whether in light of these\r\nclaims, his plea was \"knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\"\r\n         1.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r\nThe principal argument that Gonzalez makes for his claim\r\nthat his plea was defective under Rules 11 is that his counsel\r\nfailed to advise him of the plea's immigration consequences before\r\nit was offered.  Thus, Gonzalez claims, he was entitled to withdraw\r\nhis plea.  We disagree.\r\nIn 1984, the Supreme Court established the now-familiar\r\nstandard for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel:\r\n\"First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was\r\ndeficient. . . .  Second, the defendant must show that the\r\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defense.\"  Strickland v.\r\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).  In the plea context, a\r\ndefendant must show \"a reasonable probability that, but for\r\ncounsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have\r\ninsisted on going to trial.\"  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59\r\n(1985); see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 837 (same); Knight v. United\r\nStates, 37 F.3d 769, 774 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nEven if Gonzalez could demonstrate ineffective assistance\r\nof counsel, he cannot show the necessary prejudice.  First, he had\r\npreviously been convicted of crimes in the state of New Hampshire\r\nthat exposed him to immigration consequences identical to those\r\nresulting from his federal conviction.  On July 19, 1996, Gonzalez\r\nwas arrested in Nashua, New Hampshire, and charged with (1)\r\npossession of marijuana with intent to sell and (2) conspiracy to\r\npossess marijuana with intent to sell.  He was convicted on both\r\ncounts and on July 2, 1999, the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld\r\nhis convictions.  Under the INA, those crimes, just like his\r\nfederal crimes, constitute aggravated felonies.  See 8 U.S.C.\r\n1101(a)(43) (defining term \"aggravated felony\" to include\r\n\"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance . . . including a\r\ndrug trafficking crime\" and to apply to such activity \"whether in\r\nviolation of Federal or State law\").\r\nEven if we were to ignore his state court convictions,\r\nand even if we were to assume -- despite a dearth of evidence on\r\nthe subject -- that Gonzalez would not have pleaded guilty had he\r\nknown of his plea's immigration consequences, we still would not\r\nregard Desfosses's representation as constitutionally defective. \r\nAlong with numerous other courts of appeals, we have held that\r\ndeportation is only a collateral concomitant to criminal\r\nconviction.  See, e.g., United States v. Quin, 836 F.2d 654, 655\r\n(1st Cir. 1988).  Counsel's failure to advise a defendant of a\r\ncollateral consequence is a legally insufficient ground for a plea\r\nwithdrawal.  See, e.g., id.; United States v. George, 869 F.2d 333,\r\n337 (7th Cir. 1989) (\"While the Sixth Amendment assures an accused\r\nof effective assistance of counsel in 'criminal prosecutions,' this\r\nassurance does not extend to collateral aspects of the\r\nprosecution.\"); United States v. Cariola, 323 F.2d 180, 186 (3d\r\nCir. 1963) (finding \"no basis for holding that the finality of a\r\nconviction depends upon a contemporaneous realization by the\r\ndefendant of the collateral consequences of his plea\"); United\r\nStates v. Parrino, 212 F.2d 919, 921-922 (2d Cir. 1954) (same).\r\nIn Quin, the defendant had \"waived jury and acceded to a\r\nbench trial in ignorance of the deportation consequences of a\r\nguilty finding due to the failure of his counsel to inform him\r\nthereof; [defendant argued] that this constituted constitutionally\r\nineffective counsel, and that he [was thus] entitled to start\r\nover.\"  Quin, 836 F.2d at 655.  We disagreed, noting that as a\r\n\"collateral consequence\" of conviction, deportation was \"legally\r\nirrelevant, even as to an outright guilty plea.\"  Id.; see also\r\nGeorge, 869 F.2d at 337 (\"A deportation proceeding is a civil\r\nproceeding which may result from a criminal prosecution, but is not\r\na part of or enmeshed in the criminal proceeding.  It is collateral\r\nto the criminal prosecution.\"); United States v. Yearwood, 863 F.2d\r\n6, 7 (4th Cir. 1988) (\"[A]n attorney's failure to advise a client\r\nthat deportation may result from a conviction does not constitute\r\nineffective assistance of counsel.\"); United States v. Campbell,\r\n778 F.2d 764, 766-67 (11th Cir. 1985) (finding no attorney\r\nobligation to inform client of plea's immigration consequences);\r\nSanchez v. United States, 572 F.2d 210, 211 (9th Cir. 1977) (same);\r\nParrino, 212 F.2d at 921, 923 (2d Cir. 1954) (holding that where\r\nevidence was clear that defendant had asked counsel whether he\r\ncould be deported after pleading guilty, and counsel had\r\nunequivocally, but erroneously, replied \"no,\" counsel had not been\r\nconstitutionally ineffective and withdrawal of guilty plea was not\r\nrequired).\r\nAlthough Gonzalez recognizes the doctrine of collateral\r\nconsequences, he contends that \"those cases relying [on it] may not\r\nhave aged well.\"  This claim is grounded only in conclusory\r\nassertions that, since IIRIRA's passage, \"various routes of\r\njudicial and administrative relief\" that were once available to\r\ndeportable felons are foreclosed, and that now, his deportation --\r\nor indefinite administrative detention -- is \"to be expected\r\nvirtually by operation of law.\" \r\n\"[I]n a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels,\r\ngenerally speaking, are bound by prior decisions on point.\"  Irving\r\nv. United States, 49 F.3d 830, 833 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Metcalf\r\n&amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., 991 F.2d 935,\r\n939 n.3 (1st Cir. 1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nGonzalez implicitly invokes one of this rule's noted exceptions,\r\nwhich \"pertains to those relatively rare instances in which\r\nauthority that postdates the original decision, although not\r\ndirectly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for\r\nbelieving that the former panel, in light of fresh developments,\r\nwould change its collective mind.\"  Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,\r\n45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nGonzalez has failed to persuade us that our precedents\r\nregarding the collateral nature of deportation require\r\nrevisitation.  Gonzalez appears to contend that the crimes for\r\nwhich he was convicted were only recently reclassified as\r\n\"aggravated felonies,\" and that Quin, which predates IIRIRA, is\r\ntherefore inapplicable.  Moreover, he notes that under the amended\r\nINA, the Attorney General is required to take him into custody\r\nimmediately upon his release from prison, and to place him into\r\nautomatic, indefinite, and unreviewable administrative detention. \r\nIn light of this statutory regime, Gonzalez suggests, the\r\nimmigration consequences of his guilty plea can no longer be\r\nconsidered merely collateral.  The first argument, while\r\ndescriptively sound, is irrelevant; the second is legally flawed.\r\nFirst, the decisions Gonzalez seeks to overturn nowhere\r\naddress, much less rely upon, the distinction between \"aggravated\r\nfelonies\" and other grounds for deportability.  Indeed, the term\r\n\"aggravated felony\" was first introduced into immigration\r\njurisprudence in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No.\r\n100-690,  7342, 102 Stat. 4181, 4469.  That act was passed in\r\nNovember of 1988, after Quin, Parrino, Sanchez, and Campbell had\r\nissued.  The collateral nature of deportation is not affected by\r\nIIRIRA's expansion of the \"aggravated felon\" category, because the\r\nimmigration consequences of a plea are collateral irrespective of\r\nthe reason for which an alien is deemed deportable.\r\nSecond, contrary to Gonzalez's claims, IIRIRA did not so\r\nsubstantially alter the treatment of individuals in his situation\r\nas to warrant reconsideration of whether deportation is still a\r\ncollateral consequence of conviction.  Even prior to IIRIRA's\r\npassage, any alien who committed an aggravated felony was\r\nconsidered deportable, see 8 U.S.C.  1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1995),\r\namended by 8 U.S.C.  1227 (Supp. II 1996), and the Attorney\r\nGeneral was directed to apprehend any such alien upon his or her\r\nrelease from prison, see 8 U.S.C.  1252(a)(2)(A) (1995), amended\r\nby 8 U.S.C.  1226 (Supp. II 1996).  Without minimizing the\r\nsignificance of the IIRIRA, we note that it is only relevant to\r\nthis case insofar as it curtailed the Attorney General's discretion\r\nto release such aliens.  Compare id.  1252(a)(2)(B) (1995),\r\namended by 8 U.S.C.  1226(c)(2) (Supp. II 1996) (allowing release\r\nof any alien who \"demonstrate[d] . . . that [he or she was] not a\r\nthreat to the community and [was] likely to appear before any\r\nscheduled hearings\") with 8 U.S.C.  1226(c)(2) (prohibiting\r\nrelease of such aliens).\r\nGonzalez argues that for aliens like him, who hail from\r\ncountries with which the United States has no deportation\r\nagreement, this shift will result in detention that is permanent,\r\nunreviewable, and automatic.  In fact, administrative detention by\r\nthe INS is neither permanent nor unreviewable, and the fact that\r\nsuch detention might \"be expected virtually by operation of law\"\r\ndoes not alter its status as a collateral consequence of\r\nconviction.\r\nAlthough 8 U.S.C.  1226(c)(2) prohibits permanent\r\nrelease of criminal aliens, regulations promulgated by the INS\r\nauthorize the temporary release -- pending ultimate removal -- of\r\nany alien who is deportable on the basis, inter alia, of having\r\ncommitted an aggravated felony.  See 8 C.F.R.  241.4.  Such\r\nrelease, which may be narrowly circumscribed, is available (but\r\nnot required) \"[i]f such an alien demonstrates by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that the release would not pose a danger to the\r\ncommunity or a significant flight risk.\"  Id.  In addition, interim\r\nprocedures recently established by the INS provide for regular\r\nreview of each detained alien's circumstances, ensuring repeated\r\nreevaluation of such aliens' eligibility for temporary release. \r\nSee United States Department of Justice, INS, Memorandum from\r\nMichael A. Pearson, Executive Associate Commissioner, Office of\r\nField Operations, Interim Changes and Instructions for Conduct of\r\nPost-Order Custody Reviews (Aug. 6, 1999), reprinted in Chi Thon\r\nNgo v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 192 F.3d 390, 399-\r\n401 (3d Cir. 1999). Because Gonzalez cannot be deported to Cuba for\r\nthe foreseeable future, there is the possibility that he may\r\nreceive the benefit of the regulations notwithstanding the\r\nstatute's apparent blanket proscription.  Contrary to his claims,\r\nthen, his potential for indefinite detention would be neither\r\nbeyond review nor necessarily permanent.\r\nSecond, federal courts -- including this one -- have\r\npreviously found various \"automatic\" consequences of conviction to\r\nbe merely \"collateral.\"  See, e.g., Nunez-Cordero v. United States,\r\n533 F.2d 723, 726 (1st Cir. 1976) (\"We can readily imagine that a\r\ncourt might be willing to grant leave to withdraw\" when defendant\r\nlearned, post-plea, of \"mandatory deportation\" resulting from\r\nconviction, \"[b]ut we cannot say that a court must grant leave.\");\r\nUnited States v. Crowley, 529 F.2d 1066, 1072 (3d Cir. 1976)\r\n(concluding that the automatic loss of a municipal job upon felony\r\nconviction was a collateral consequence of a plea); Meaton v.\r\nUnited States, 328 F.2d 379, 381 (5th Cir. 1964) (automatic loss of\r\nrights to vote and to travel abroad upon felony conviction were\r\ncollateral consequences of a plea).  What renders the plea's\r\nimmigration effects \"collateral\" is not that they arise \"virtually\r\nby operation of law,\" but the fact that deportation is \"not the\r\nsentence of the court which accept[s] the plea but of another\r\nagency over which the trial judge has no control and for which he\r\nhas no responsibility.\"  Fruchtman v. Kenton, 531 F.2d 946, 949\r\n(9th Cir. 1976) (quoting Michel v. United States, 507 F.2d 461, 465\r\n(2d Cir. 1974)); see also George, 869 F.2d at 337 (emphasizing that\r\ndeportation \"may result from a criminal prosecution, but is not a\r\npart of or enmeshed in the criminal proceeding\"); Sanchez, 572 F.2d\r\nat 211 (noting that the key inquiry is whether a consequence \"is\r\ncontrolled by an agency which operates beyond the direct authority\r\nof the trial judge\").  However \"automatically\" Gonzalez's\r\ndeportation -- or administrative detention -- might follow from his\r\nconviction, it remains beyond the control and responsibility of the\r\ndistrict court in which that conviction was entered and it thus\r\nremains a collateral consequence thereof.\r\nWe therefore reject the argument that recent amendments\r\nto the INA have so altered the relationship between conviction and\r\ndeportation that revisitation of our prior holdings on that\r\nrelationship is required.  These holdings bar any ineffective\r\nassistance claims based on an attorney's failure to advise a client\r\nof his plea's immigration consequences.  Gonzalez's ineffective\r\nassistance argument thus fails to support his Rule 32(e) motion.\r\n         2.     The District Court's Failure To Inform Gonzalez\r\n       of His Plea's Immigration Consequences\r\nGonzalez's second argument is that the district court's\r\nfailure to advise him of his plea's immigration consequences\r\ndeprived the plea of the requisite voluntariness.  This claim fails\r\nfor reasons akin to those that doomed his ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel claim.\r\nWe have previously identified \"the defendant's knowledge\r\nof the consequences of the guilty plea\" as a core concern of Rule\r\n11 which must be satisfied if a plea is to be upheld.  Isom, 85\r\nF.3d at 835; see also Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4.  But because\r\ndeportation is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea, district\r\ncourts are not obliged to grant plea withdrawal motions filed by\r\ndefendants who realize, post-plea, the immigration implications of\r\ntheir conviction.  See, e.g., Nunez-Cordero, 533 F.2d at 726;\r\nDurant v. United States, 410 F.2d 689, 692 (1st Cir. 1969); see\r\nalso Campbell, 778 F.2d at 767; United States v. Russell, 686 F.2d\r\n35, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1982); Fruchtman, 531 F.2d at 949; Michel, 507\r\nF.2d at 465.  Given the facts of Gonzalez's case, we see no more\r\nreason to disturb our precedent in this context than we did above.\r\n         3.     The District Court's Failure to Warn Gonzalez of\r\n       Potential Restitution\r\nGonzalez further asserts that his plea colloquy was\r\ndefective because he was never informed that he would have to pay\r\n$17,273.03 in restitution to his victims.  This argument is\r\nunavailing.  We have held that where a defendant who is not warned\r\nof the potential for restitution is nevertheless ordered to pay\r\nsuch restitution, but in an amount less than the total potential\r\ncriminal fine of which he was warned, the arguable error is\r\nharmless.  See, e.g., Raineri, 43 F.3d at 42; United States v.\r\nPadin Torres, 988 F.2d 280, 284 (1st Cir. 1993).  The district\r\njudge and the plea agreement each warned Gonzalez that he was\r\nsubject to a fine of up to $250,000.  Although ordered to pay\r\nrestitution in the amount of $17,273.03, he was not subjected to\r\nany fine.  Thus, his actual financial burden at sentencing was far\r\nless than the potential penalty of which he was warned.  Even if\r\nthe court had erred by not informing him of the prospect of a\r\nrestitution order, such error was harmless and did not violate Rule\r\n11.\r\nB.  Evidentiary Hearing\r\nGonzalez also protests the district court's failure to\r\nhold an evidentiary hearing at which he could press his Motion to\r\nWithdraw Plea -- an evidentiary hearing that we note Gonzalez never\r\nrequested.  It is axiomatic that a defendant is not entitled to an\r\nevidentiary hearing on every motion he chooses to file.  See Isom,\r\n85 F.3d at 838; United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 310 (1st Cir. 1992). \r\nAn evidentiary hearing on a Rule 32(e) motion is only required when\r\na defendant alleges facts which, if taken as true, would entitle\r\nhim to relief.  See United States v. Crooker, 729 F.2d 889, 890\r\n(1st Cir. 1984); United States v. Fournier, 594 F.2d 276, 279 (1st\r\nCir. 1979).  Because we have held above that Gonzalez has failed to\r\nallege any such facts, we find that the district court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in denying his Motion to Withdraw Plea without\r\nholding an evidentiary hearing.\r\n                            III.\r\n                         Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision\r\nto deny Gonzalez's Motion to Withdraw Plea is affirmed.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 10, 1997, Gonzalez, a national of Cuba who has resided in the United States since 1980, was indicted on three separate charges. Attorney Phillip Desfosses was appointed to represent him. On August 4, 1997, represented by Desfosses's partner Harry Starbranch, Gonzalez pleaded guilty to two charges: mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (1994), and the use of an unauthorized access device to obtain property exceeding $1,000 in value, as proscribed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(2) (1994). During his plea colloquy, Gonzalez admitted that the losses resulting from his crimes in fact exceeded $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez successfully moved to continue sentencing on November 10, 1997, and on December 25, 1997, he requested substitute counsel. On December 30, 1997, Desfosses moved to withdraw from the case. In January, 1998, the court granted Desfosses's motion and appointed attorney Sven Wiberg to represent Gonzalez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 4, 1998, following several more continuances which further postponed sentencing, Gonzalez moved to withdraw his plea pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e) (\"Rule 32(e)\"). Gonzalez's Rule 32(e) motion averred that he had not been informed of his guilty plea's \"potential and/or likely adverse immigration consequences\" until after the plea was made. The motion included a letter from Desfosses confirming Gonzalez's assertion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gonzalez argued that Desfosses's failure to advise him of the immigration issue constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and rendered his plea defective. Gonzalez did not request, and the court did not conduct, an evidentiary hearing on the Rule 32(e) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1998, the court denied Gonzalez's motion. Gonzalez filed a \"Motion to Reconsider Motion to Withdraw Plea,\" which was denied on January 4, 1999. The next day, the court sentenced Gonzalez to twenty-seven (27) months of imprisonment and ordered him to pay $17,273.03 in restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to his criminal punishment, Gonzalez's conviction subjected him to potential immigration-related consequences. The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 et seq. (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996), enumerates various \"aggravated felonies\" the commission of which will render an alien deportable. See id. &#167; 1101 (a)(43); id. &#167; 1227 (a)(2)(A)(iii). This list includes \"an offense that... involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\" Id. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(M). Because Gonzalez's fraudulent activities caused losses exceeding $10,000, he had committed an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA, and had therefore become subject to deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INA directs the Attorney General to \"take into custody any alien who... is deportable by reason of having committed [among other things, any aggravated felony]... when the alien is released.\" Id. &#167; 1226(c)(1). The Attorney General may release such an alien only in narrowly limited circumstances not here applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This regime reflects amendments embodied in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (\"IIRIRA\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As a native of Cuba, which has no deportation agreement with the United States, Gonzalez now faces the possibility of indefinite administrative detention following his release from prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez advances several arguments in his attempt to reverse the district court's refusal to grant his Rule 32(e) motion. He also challenges the court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing prior to ruling on the motion. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Motion to Withdraw Plea</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The heart of Gonzalez's claim is that neither his attorneys nor the district judge advised him that if he pleaded guilty, he would be deemed \"deportable\" and subject to detention by the INS. He further complains that the district court failed to warn him of the possibility of restitution. Gonzalez contends that these deficiencies entitled him to withdraw his plea. We review the trial court's refusal to grant a change of plea only for abuse of discretion, see, e.g., United States v. Raineri, 42 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 787 (1st Cir. 1991), and finding none, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 32(e) states that \"[i]f a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty... is made before sentence is imposed, the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(e) (emphasis added). A defendant thus has no absolute right to withdraw a plea. See United States v. Muriel, 111 F.3d 975, 978 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 834 (1st Cir. 1996). A \"fair and just reason\" is a necessary, but not sufficient, predicate to plea withdrawal. See United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"A defendant may withdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing only upon a showing a fair and just reason for the request.\"); see also Raineri, 42 F.3d at 41 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 32(e) motions must be considered in the general context of Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (\"Rule 11\"), which governs the entry of all guilty pleas. Rule 11(c) provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[b]efore accepting a plea of guilty... the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands,... the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law, including the effect of any special parole or supervised release term, the fact that the court is required to consider any applicable sentencing guidelines but may depart from those guidelines under some circumstances, and, when applicable, that the court may also order the defendant to make restitution to any victim of the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Crim. P. 11. Yet Rule 11(h), labeled \"Harmless Error,\" states that \"[a]ny variance from the procedures required by [Rule 11] which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating Rule 32(e) motions, a court's central concern is whether the plea was \"voluntary, intelligent and knowing, within the meaning of Rule 11.\" United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 347 (1st Cir. 1997); see also United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1243 (1st Cir. 1991). In addition, the district court must consider four factors: (1) the force of the defendant's reason for the change of plea; (2) the timing of the request; (3) whether or not the defendant asserts innocence in connection with his plea withdrawal; and (4) whether a plea agreement had been reached. See Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d at 347; Isom, 85 F.3d at 834; Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4. We address the final three factors first and then turn to the reasons for Gonzalez's requested plea withdrawal and whether those reasons render his plea involuntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The timing of Gonzalez's motion casts doubt on his entitlement to a plea withdrawal. \"[A] long interval between the plea and the request often weakens any claim that the plea was entered in confusion or under false pretenses.\" Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595; see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 838-39. Of course, when a defendant seeks to withdraw his plea based on knowledge that was obtained after the plea, the relevant temporal gap is not the time between the Rule 32(e) motion and the original plea, but the time between his discovery of the new information and the filing of his motion. Here, this gap is extensive. In the letter from Desfosses that Gonzalez submitted with his Motion to Withdraw Plea, Desfosses stated that \"[i]t was not until the attorney-client relationship between myself and Mr. Gonzalez had started to breakdown did he inform me that the law had recently been changed regarding the deportation of Cubans due to felony convictions.\" Thus, Gonzalez became aware of his plea's immigration consequences sometime before the end of December, 1997, when Desfosses sought to remove himself from further representation. Yet, notwithstanding that acquired knowledge, Gonzalez did not move to withdraw his plea until September, 1998. We have previously rejected plea withdrawal motions in which the relevant gap was six months, see Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595, two months, see Isom, 85 F.3d at 839, three weeks, see United States v. Keefe, 621 F.2d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 1980), and even thirteen days, see United States v. Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 313 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez's consistent failure to assert his innocence also weighs against the reversal of the district court's decision. \"Courts look more hospitably on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea when the motion is coupled with an assertion of innocence.... [T]he absence of a claim of innocence weighs in favor of allowing a guilty plea to stand.\" Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596. Gonzalez at no time asserted his innocence. Finally, Gonzalez does not dispute that he signed a plea agreement, and that signed agreement casts further doubt on his claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus turn to the three purported bases of Gonzalez's Motion to Withdraw Plea, and the question whether in light of these claims, his plea was \"knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal argument that Gonzalez makes for his claim that his plea was defective under Rules 11 is that his counsel failed to advise him of the plea's immigration consequences before it was offered. Thus, Gonzalez claims, he was entitled to withdraw his plea. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, the Supreme Court established the now-familiar standard for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel: \"First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient.... Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). In the plea context, a defendant must show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\" Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985); see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 837 (same); Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 774 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Gonzalez could demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, he cannot show the necessary prejudice. First, he had previously been convicted of crimes in the state of New Hampshire that exposed him to immigration consequences identical to those resulting from his federal conviction. On July 19, 1996, Gonzalez was arrested in Nashua, New Hampshire, and charged with (1) possession of marijuana with intent to sell and (2) conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell. He was convicted on both counts and on July 2, 1999, the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld his convictions. Under the INA, those crimes, just like his federal crimes, constitute aggravated felonies. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43) (defining term \"aggravated felony\" to include \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance... including a drug trafficking crime\" and to apply to such activity \"whether in violation of Federal or State law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to ignore his state court convictions, and even if we were to assume -- despite a dearth of evidence on the subject -- that Gonzalez would not have pleaded guilty had he known of his plea's immigration consequences, we still would not regard Desfosses's representation as constitutionally defective. Along with numerous other courts of appeals, we have held that deportation is only a collateral concomitant to criminal conviction. See, e.g., United States v. Quin, 836 F.2d 654, 655 (1st Cir. 1988). Counsel's failure to advise a defendant of a collateral consequence is a legally insufficient ground for a plea withdrawal. See, e.g., id.; United States v. George, 869 F.2d 333, 337 (7th Cir. 1989) (\"While the Sixth Amendment assures an accused of effective assistance of counsel in 'criminal prosecutions,' this assurance does not extend to collateral aspects of the prosecution.\"); United States v. Cariola, 323 F.2d 180, 186 (3d Cir. 1963) (finding \"no basis for holding that the finality of a conviction depends upon a contemporaneous realization by the defendant of the collateral consequences of his plea\"); United States v. Parrino, 212 F.2d 919, 921-922 (2d Cir. 1954) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Quin, the defendant had \"waived jury and acceded to a bench trial in ignorance of the deportation consequences of a guilty finding due to the failure of his counsel to inform him thereof; [defendant argued] that this constituted constitutionally ineffective counsel, and that he [was thus] entitled to start over.\" Quin, 836 F.2d at 655. We disagreed, noting that as a \"collateral consequence\" of conviction, deportation was \"legally irrelevant, even as to an outright guilty plea.\" Id.; see also George, 869 F.2d at 337 (\"A deportation proceeding is a civil proceeding which may result from a criminal prosecution, but is not a part of or enmeshed in the criminal proceeding. It is collateral to the criminal prosecution.\"); United States v. Yearwood, 863 F.2d 6, 7 (4th Cir. 1988) (\"[A]n attorney's failure to advise a client that deportation may result from a conviction does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\"); United States v. Campbell, 778 F.2d 764, 766-67 (11th Cir. 1985) (finding no attorney obligation to inform client of plea's immigration consequences); Sanchez v. United States, 572 F.2d 210, 211 (9th Cir. 1977) (same); Parrino, 212 F.2d at 921, 923 (2d Cir. 1954) (holding that where evidence was clear that defendant had asked counsel whether he could be deported after pleading guilty, and counsel had unequivocally, but erroneously, replied \"no,\" counsel had not been constitutionally ineffective and withdrawal of guilty plea was not required).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Gonzalez recognizes the doctrine of collateral consequences, he contends that \"those cases relying [on it] may not have aged well.\" This claim is grounded only in conclusory assertions that, since IIRIRA's passage, \"various routes of judicial and administrative relief\" that were once available to deportable felons are foreclosed, and that now, his deportation -- or indefinite administrative detention -- is \"to be expected virtually by operation of law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[I]n a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels, generally speaking, are bound by prior decisions on point.\" Irving v. United States, 49 F.3d 830, 833 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., 991 F.2d 935, 939 n.3 (1st Cir. 1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Gonzalez implicitly invokes one of this rule's noted exceptions, which \"pertains to those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez has failed to persuade us that our precedents regarding the collateral nature of deportation require revisitation. Gonzalez appears to contend that the crimes for which he was convicted were only recently reclassified as \"aggravated felonies,\" and that Quin, which predates IIRIRA, is therefore inapplicable. Moreover, he notes that under the amended INA, the Attorney General is required to take him into custody immediately upon his release from prison, and to place him into automatic, indefinite, and unreviewable administrative detention. In light of this statutory regime, Gonzalez suggests, the immigration consequences of his guilty plea can no longer be considered merely collateral. The first argument, while descriptively sound, is irrelevant; the second is legally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the decisions Gonzalez seeks to overturn nowhere address, much less rely upon, the distinction between \"aggravated felonies\" and other grounds for deportability. Indeed, the term \"aggravated felony\" was first introduced into immigration jurisprudence in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690, &#167; 7342, 102 Stat. 4181, 4469. That act was passed in November of 1988, after Quin, Parrino, Sanchez, and Campbell had issued. The collateral nature of deportation is not affected by IIRIRA's expansion of the \"aggravated felon\" category, because the immigration consequences of a plea are collateral irrespective of the reason for which an alien is deemed deportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, contrary to Gonzalez's claims, IIRIRA did not so substantially alter the treatment of individuals in his situation as to warrant reconsideration of whether deportation is still a collateral consequence of conviction. Even prior to IIRIRA's passage, any alien who committed an aggravated felony was considered deportable, see 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1995), amended by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227 (Supp. II 1996), and the Attorney General was directed to apprehend any such alien upon his or her release from prison, see 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(A) (1995), amended by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226 (Supp. II 1996). Without minimizing the significance of the IIRIRA, we note that it is only relevant to this case insofar as it curtailed the Attorney General's discretion to release such aliens. Compare id. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B) (1995), amended by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c)(2) (Supp. II 1996) (allowing release of any alien who \"demonstrate[d]... that [he or she was] not a threat to the community and [was] likely to appear before any scheduled hearings\") with 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c)(2) (prohibiting release of such aliens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez argues that for aliens like him, who hail from countries with which the United States has no deportation agreement, this shift will result in detention that is permanent, unreviewable, and automatic. In fact, administrative detention by the INS is neither permanent nor unreviewable, and the fact that such detention might \"be expected virtually by operation of law\" does not alter its status as a collateral consequence of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c)(2) prohibits permanent release of criminal aliens, regulations promulgated by the INS authorize the temporary release -- pending ultimate removal -- of any alien who is deportable on the basis, inter alia, of having committed an aggravated felony. See 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.4. Such release, which may be narrowly circumscribed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> is available (but not required) \"[i]f such an alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the release would not pose a danger to the community or a significant flight risk.\" Id. In addition, interim procedures recently established by the INS provide for regular review of each detained alien's circumstances, ensuring repeated reevaluation of such aliens' eligibility for temporary release. See United States Department of Justice, INS, Memorandum from Michael A. Pearson, Executive Associate Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, Interim Changes and Instructions for Conduct of Post-Order Custody Reviews (Aug. 6, 1999), reprinted in Chi Thon Ngo v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 192 F.3d 390, 399-401 (3d Cir. 1999). Because Gonzalez cannot be deported to Cuba for the foreseeable future, there is the possibility that he may receive the benefit of the regulations notwithstanding the statute's apparent blanket proscription. Contrary to his claims, then, his potential for indefinite detention would be neither beyond review nor necessarily permanent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, federal courts -- including this one -- have previously found various \"automatic\" consequences of conviction to be merely \"collateral.\" See, e.g., Nunez-Cordero v. United States, 533 F.2d 723, 726 (1st Cir. 1976) (\"We can readily imagine that a court might be willing to grant leave to withdraw\" when defendant learned, post-plea, of \"mandatory deportation\" resulting from conviction, \"[b]ut we cannot say that a court must grant leave.\"); United States v. Crowley, 529 F.2d 1066, 1072 (3d Cir. 1976) (concluding that the automatic loss of a municipal job upon felony conviction was a collateral consequence of a plea); Meaton v. United States, 328 F.2d 379, 381 (5th Cir. 1964) (automatic loss of rights to vote and to travel abroad upon felony conviction were collateral consequences of a plea). What renders the plea's immigration effects \"collateral\" is not that they arise \"virtually by operation of law,\" but the fact that deportation is \"not the sentence of the court which accept[s] the plea but of another agency over which the trial judge has no control and for which he has no responsibility.\" Fruchtman v. Kenton, 531 F.2d 946, 949 (9th Cir. 1976) (quoting Michel v. United States, 507 F.2d 461, 465 (2d Cir. 1974)); see also George, 869 F.2d at 337 (emphasizing that deportation \"may result from a criminal prosecution, but is not a part of or enmeshed in the criminal proceeding\"); Sanchez, 572 F.2d at 211 (noting that the key inquiry is whether a consequence \"is controlled by an agency which operates beyond the direct authority of the trial judge\"). However \"automatically\" Gonzalez's deportation -- or administrative detention -- might follow from his conviction, it remains beyond the control and responsibility of the district court in which that conviction was entered and it thus remains a collateral consequence thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject the argument that recent amendments to the INA have so altered the relationship between conviction and deportation that revisitation of our prior holdings on that relationship is required. These holdings bar any ineffective assistance claims based on an attorney's failure to advise a client of his plea's immigration consequences. Gonzalez's ineffective assistance argument thus fails to support his Rule 32(e) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The District Court's Failure To Inform Gonzalez of His Plea's Immigration Consequences</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez's second argument is that the district court's failure to advise him of his plea's immigration consequences deprived the plea of the requisite voluntariness. This claim fails for reasons akin to those that doomed his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously identified \"the defendant's knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea\" as a core concern of Rule 11 which must be satisfied if a plea is to be upheld. Isom, 85 F.3d at 835; see also Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4. But because deportation is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea, district courts are not obliged to grant plea withdrawal motions filed by defendants who realize, post-plea, the immigration implications of their conviction. See, e.g., Nunez-Cordero, 533 F.2d at 726; Durant v. United States, 410 F.2d 689, 692 (1st Cir. 1969); see also Campbell, 778 F.2d at 767; United States v. Russell, 686 F.2d 35, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1982); Fruchtman, 531 F.2d at 949; Michel, 507 F.2d at 465. Given the facts of Gonzalez's case, we see no more reason to disturb our precedent in this context than we did above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The District Court's Failure to Warn Gonzalez of Potential Restitution</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez further asserts that his plea colloquy was defective because he was never informed that he would have to pay $17,273.03 in restitution to his victims. This argument is unavailing. We have held that where a defendant who is not warned of the potential for restitution is nevertheless ordered to pay such restitution, but in an amount less than the total potential criminal fine of which he was warned, the arguable error is harmless. See, e.g., Raineri, 43 F.3d at 42; United States v. Padin Torres, 988 F.2d 280, 284 (1st Cir. 1993). The district judge and the plea agreement each warned Gonzalez that he was subject to a fine of up to $250,000. Although ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $17,273.03, he was not subjected to any fine. Thus, his actual financial burden at sentencing was far less than the potential penalty of which he was warned. Even if the court had erred by not informing him of the prospect of a restitution order, such error was harmless and did not violate Rule 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez also protests the district court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing at which he could press his Motion to Withdraw Plea -- an evidentiary hearing that we note Gonzalez never requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It is axiomatic that a defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on every motion he chooses to file. See Isom, 85 F.3d at 838; United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 310 (1st Cir. 1992). An evidentiary hearing on a Rule 32(e) motion is only required when a defendant alleges facts which, if taken as true, would entitle him to relief. See United States v. Crooker, 729 F.2d 889, 890 (1st Cir. 1984); United States v. Fournier, 594 F.2d 276, 279 (1st Cir. 1979). Because we have held above that Gonzalez has failed to allege any such facts, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his Motion to Withdraw Plea without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision to deny Gonzalez's Motion to Withdraw Plea is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  It appears that Gonzalez learned of these consequences from a third party.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  To qualify for such release, an alien must be a witness, a potential witness, a person cooperating with an investigation into criminal activity, or an immediate family member of such a person.

Certainly, the Rule's ends are best served when a defendant is made aware of all potential costs and benefits. We recognize, too, that even \"collateral\" immigration consequences will sometimes exert a greater impact on the defendant's life than will the criminal sanction imposed. Thus, in Nunez-Cordero, we approvingly noted that we could \"readily imagine\" a court being willing to grant a defendant leave to withdraw his plea in circumstances similar to Gonzalez's. 533 F.2d at 726. But we reject now -- as we did then -- the proposition that such a grant is required. Where the defendant has failed to elaborate the bases for overturning our precedents, and where --contrary to Gonzalez's assertions -- the immigration consequences complained of remain subject to the discretion of entities other than the district court, we cannot find that the district judge's failure to advise him \"affect[ed] substantial rights\" any more so than did the judicial errors addressed in the cases cited above.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Gonzalez now claims that he inferentially requested such a hearing in his Motion to Withdraw Plea by citing a case in which one was held.

Attorney Phillip Desfosses was appointed to represent him. On August 4, 1997, represented by Desfosses's partner Harry Starbranch, Gonzalez pleaded guilty to two charges: mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (1994), and the use of an unauthorized access device to obtain property exceeding $1,000 in value, as proscribed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(2) (1994). During his plea colloquy, Gonzalez admitted that the losses resulting from his crimes in fact exceeded $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez successfully moved to continue sentencing on November 10, 1997, and on December 25, 1997, he requested substitute counsel. On December 30, 1997, Desfosses moved to withdraw from the case. In January, 1998, the court granted Desfosses's motion and appointed attorney Sven Wiberg to represent Gonzalez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 4, 1998, following several more continuances which further postponed sentencing, Gonzalez moved to withdraw his plea pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e) (\"Rule 32(e)\"). Gonzalez's Rule 32(e) motion averred that he had not been informed of his guilty plea's \"potential and/or likely adverse immigration consequences\" until after the plea was made. The motion included a letter from Desfosses confirming Gonzalez's assertion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Gonzalez argued that Desfosses's failure to advise him of the immigration issue constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and rendered his plea defective. Gonzalez did not request, and the court did not conduct, an evidentiary hearing on the Rule 32(e) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7, 1998, the court denied Gonzalez's motion. Gonzalez filed a \"Motion to Reconsider Motion to Withdraw Plea,\" which was denied on January 4, 1999. The next day, the court sentenced Gonzalez to twenty-seven (27) months of imprisonment and ordered him to pay $17,273.03 in restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to his criminal punishment, Gonzalez's conviction subjected him to potential immigration-related consequences. The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101 et seq. (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996), enumerates various \"aggravated felonies\" the commission of which will render an alien deportable. See id. &#167; 1101 (a)(43); id. &#167; 1227 (a)(2)(A)(iii). This list includes \"an offense that... involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\" Id. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(M). Because Gonzalez's fraudulent activities caused losses exceeding $10,000, he had committed an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA, and had therefore become subject to deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INA directs the Attorney General to \"take into custody any alien who... is deportable by reason of having committed [among other things, any aggravated felony]... when the alien is released.\" Id. &#167; 1226(c)(1). The Attorney General may release such an alien only in narrowly limited circumstances not here applicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This regime reflects amendments embodied in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.

Motion to Withdraw Plea</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The heart of Gonzalez's claim is that neither his attorneys nor the district judge advised him that if he pleaded guilty, he would be deemed \"deportable\" and subject to detention by the INS. He further complains that the district court failed to warn him of the possibility of restitution. Gonzalez contends that these deficiencies entitled him to withdraw his plea. We review the trial court's refusal to grant a change of plea only for abuse of discretion, see, e.g., United States v.

We address the final three factors first and then turn to the reasons for Gonzalez's requested plea withdrawal and whether those reasons render his plea involuntary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The timing of Gonzalez's motion casts doubt on his entitlement to a plea withdrawal. \"[A] long interval between the plea and the request often weakens any claim that the plea was entered in confusion or under false pretenses.\" Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595; see also Isom, 85 F.3d at 838-39. Of course, when a defendant seeks to withdraw his plea based on knowledge that was obtained after the plea, the relevant temporal gap is not the time between the Rule 32(e) motion and the original plea, but the time between his discovery of the new information and the filing of his motion. Here, this gap is extensive. In the letter from Desfosses that Gonzalez submitted with his Motion to Withdraw Plea, Desfosses stated that \"[i]t was not until the attorney-client relationship between myself and Mr. Gonzalez had started to breakdown did he inform me that the law had recently been changed regarding the deportation of Cubans due to felony convictions.\" Thus, Gonzalez became aware of his plea's immigration consequences sometime before the end of December, 1997, when Desfosses sought to remove himself from further representation. Yet, notwithstanding that acquired knowledge, Gonzalez did not move to withdraw his plea until September, 1998. We have previously rejected plea withdrawal motions in which the relevant gap was six months, see Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595, two months, see Isom, 85 F.3d at 839, three weeks, see United States v. Keefe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377948\"><a href=\"/opinion/377948/united-states-v-stephen-f-keefe/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1980), and even thirteen days, see United States v.

[T]he absence of a claim of innocence weighs in favor of allowing a guilty plea to stand.\" Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596. Gonzalez at no time asserted his innocence. Finally, Gonzalez does not dispute that he signed a plea agreement, and that signed agreement casts further doubt on his claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus turn to the three purported bases of Gonzalez's Motion to Withdraw Plea, and the question whether in light of these claims, his plea was \"knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal argument that Gonzalez makes for his claim that his plea was defective under Rules 11 is that his counsel failed to advise him of the plea's immigration consequences before it was offered. Thus, Gonzalez claims, he was entitled to withdraw his plea. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984, the Supreme Court established the now-familiar standard for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel: \"First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient.... Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\" Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687 (1984).

First, he had previously been convicted of crimes in the state of New Hampshire that exposed him to immigration consequences identical to those resulting from his federal conviction. On July 19, 1996, Gonzalez was arrested in Nashua, New Hampshire, and charged with (1) possession of marijuana with intent to sell and (2) conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell. He was convicted on both counts and on July 2, 1999, the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld his convictions. Under the INA, those crimes, just like his federal crimes, constitute aggravated felonies. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43) (defining term \"aggravated felony\" to include \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance... including a drug trafficking crime\" and to apply to such activity \"whether in violation of Federal or State law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to ignore his state court convictions, and even if we were to assume -- despite a dearth of evidence on the subject -- that Gonzalez would not have pleaded guilty had he known of his plea's immigration consequences, we still would not regard Desfosses's representation as constitutionally defective. Along with numerous other courts of appeals, we have held that deportation is only a collateral concomitant to criminal conviction. See, e.g., United States v. Quin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499723\"><a href=\"/opinion/499723/united-states-v-alan-peter-quin/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span>, 655 (1st Cir. 1988). Counsel's failure to advise a defendant of a collateral consequence is a legally insufficient ground for a plea withdrawal. See, e.g., id.; United States v.

Gonzalez appears to contend that the crimes for which he was convicted were only recently reclassified as \"aggravated felonies,\" and that Quin, which predates IIRIRA, is therefore inapplicable. Moreover, he notes that under the amended INA, the Attorney General is required to take him into custody immediately upon his release from prison, and to place him into automatic, indefinite, and unreviewable administrative detention. In light of this statutory regime, Gonzalez suggests, the immigration consequences of his guilty plea can no longer be considered merely collateral. The first argument, while descriptively sound, is irrelevant; the second is legally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the decisions Gonzalez seeks to overturn nowhere address, much less rely upon, the distinction between \"aggravated felonies\" and other grounds for deportability. Indeed, the term \"aggravated felony\" was first introduced into immigration jurisprudence in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690, &#167; 7342, 102 Stat. 4181, 4469. That act was passed in November of 1988, after Quin, Parrino, Sanchez, and Campbell had issued. The collateral nature of deportation is not affected by IIRIRA's expansion of the \"aggravated felon\" category, because the immigration consequences of a plea are collateral irrespective of the reason for which an alien is deemed deportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, contrary to Gonzalez's claims, IIRIRA did not so substantially alter the treatment of individuals in his situation as to warrant reconsideration of whether deportation is still a collateral consequence of conviction. Even prior to IIRIRA's passage, any alien who committed an aggravated felony was considered deportable, see 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1995), amended by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227 (Supp. II 1996), and the Attorney General was directed to apprehend any such alien upon his or her release from prison, see 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(A) (1995), amended by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226 (Supp. II 1996). Without minimizing the significance of the IIRIRA, we note that it is only relevant to this case insofar as it curtailed the Attorney General's discretion to release such aliens. Compare id. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B) (1995), amended by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c)(2) (Supp. II 1996) (allowing release of any alien who \"demonstrate[d]... that [he or she was] not a threat to the community and [was] likely to appear before any scheduled hearings\") with 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c)(2) (prohibiting release of such aliens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez argues that for aliens like him, who hail from countries with which the United States has no deportation agreement, this shift will result in detention that is permanent, unreviewable, and automatic. In fact, administrative detention by the INS is neither permanent nor unreviewable, and the fact that such detention might \"be expected virtually by operation of law\" does not alter its status as a collateral consequence of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c)(2) prohibits permanent release of criminal aliens, regulations promulgated by the INS authorize the temporary release -- pending ultimate removal -- of any alien who is deportable on the basis, inter alia, of having committed an aggravated felony. See 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.4. Such release, which may be narrowly circumscribed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> is available (but not required) \"[i]f such an alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the release would not pose a danger to the community or a significant flight risk.\" Id. In addition, interim procedures recently established by the INS provide for regular review of each detained alien's circumstances, ensuring repeated reevaluation of such aliens' eligibility for temporary release. See United States Department of Justice, INS, Memorandum from Michael A. Pearson, Executive Associate Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, Interim Changes and Instructions for Conduct of Post-Order Custody Reviews (Aug. 6, 1999), reprinted in Chi Thon Ngo v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766242\"><a href=\"/opinion/766242/chi-thon-ngo-aka-david-lam-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 399-401 (3d Cir. 1999). Because Gonzalez cannot be deported to Cuba for the foreseeable future, there is the possibility that he may receive the benefit of the regulations notwithstanding the statute's apparent blanket proscription. Contrary to his claims, then, his potential for indefinite detention would be neither beyond review nor necessarily permanent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, federal courts -- including this one -- have previously found various \"automatic\" consequences of conviction to be merely \"collateral.\" See, e.g., Nunez-Cordero v.

What renders the plea's immigration effects \"collateral\" is not that they arise \"virtually by operation of law,\" but the fact that deportation is \"not the sentence of the court which accept[s] the plea but of another agency over which the trial judge has no control and for which he has no responsibility.\" Fruchtman v.

Isom, 85 F.3d at 835; see also Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4. But because deportation is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea, district courts are not obliged to grant plea withdrawal motions filed by defendants who realize, post-plea, the immigration implications of their conviction. See, e.g., Nunez-Cordero, 533 F.2d at 726; Durant v.

Cir. 1982); Fruchtman, 531 F.2d at 949; Michel, 507 F.2d at 465. Given the facts of Gonzalez's case, we see no more reason to disturb our precedent in this context than we did above.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The District Court's Failure to Warn Gonzalez of Potential Restitution</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez further asserts that his plea colloquy was defective because he was never informed that he would have to pay $17,273.03 in restitution to his victims. This argument is unavailing. We have held that where a defendant who is not warned of the potential for restitution is nevertheless ordered to pay such restitution, but in an amount less than the total potential criminal fine of which he was warned, the arguable error is harmless. See, e.g., Raineri, 43 F.3d at 42; United States v. Padin Torres, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602348\"><a href=\"/opinion/602348/united-states-v-julio-cesar-padin-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 284 (1st Cir. 1993). The district judge and the plea agreement each warned Gonzalez that he was subject to a fine of up to $250,000. Although ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $17,273.03, he was not subjected to any fine. Thus, his actual financial burden at sentencing was far less than the potential penalty of which he was warned. Even if the court had erred by not informing him of the prospect of a restitution order, such error was harmless and did not violate Rule 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez also protests the district court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing at which he could press his Motion to Withdraw Plea -- an evidentiary hearing that we note Gonzalez never requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It is axiomatic that a defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on every motion he chooses to file. See Isom, 85 F.3d at 838; United States v.

An evidentiary hearing on a Rule 32(e) motion is only required when a defendant alleges facts which, if taken as true, would entitle him to relief. See United States v. Crooker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"432231\"><a href=\"/opinion/432231/united-states-v-stephen-scott-crooker/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span>, 890 (1st Cir. 1984); United States v.

Because we have held above that Gonzalez has failed to allege any such facts, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his Motion to Withdraw Plea without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision to deny Gonzalez's Motion to Withdraw Plea is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  It appears that Gonzalez learned of these consequences from a third party.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  To qualify for such release, an alien must be a witness, a potential witness, a person cooperating with an investigation into criminal activity, or an immediate family member of such a person. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c)(2) (Supp. II 1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  Prior to IIRIRA, the INA permitted (but did not require) release of aggravated felons who did not pose a threat to society pending their removal from the United States. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B) (1995), amended by 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1226(c) (Supp. II 1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  An alien released pursuant to this provision may be required, among other things, to post a bond ensuring ultimate return, see 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.4, to report to an INS officer periodically, to undergo physical or mental examinations, or to obtain approval before traveling beyond a certain distance, see id. &#167; 241.5.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  We emphasize that we are declining to pass judgment on whether or not Rule 11 could ever require a sentencing judge to inform a criminal defendant of his plea's immigration consequences. Certainly, the Rule's ends are best served when a defendant is made aware of all potential costs and benefits. We recognize, too, that even \"collateral\" immigration consequences will sometimes exert a greater impact on the defendant's life than will the criminal sanction imposed. Thus, in Nunez-Cordero, we approvingly noted that we could \"readily imagine\" a court being willing to grant a defendant leave to withdraw his plea in circumstances similar to Gonzalez's. 533 F.2d at 726. But we reject now -- as we did then -- the proposition that such a grant is required. Where the defendant has failed to elaborate the bases for overturning our precedents, and where --contrary to Gonzalez's assertions -- the immigration consequences complained of remain subject to the discretion of entities other than the district court, we cannot find that the district judge's failure to advise him \"affect[ed] substantial rights\" any more so than did the judicial errors addressed in the cases cited above.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Gonzalez now claims that he inferentially requested such a hearing in his Motion to Withdraw Plea by citing a case in which one was held. However, no direct request was ever made to the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
