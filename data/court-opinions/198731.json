Fitzgerald, III, Assistant United States Trustee, with\r\nwhom Gary L. Donahue, Attorney Advisor, United States Department of\r\nJustice, was on brief, for appellee.\r\n\nNovember 30, 1999\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge.  Thomas Miller appeals from a\r\ndecision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\") for the First\r\nCircuit.  That decision affirmed an order of the United States\r\nBankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts (the \"bankruptcy\r\ncourt\"),  disqualifying Miller from serving as counsel for\r\nIndependent Engineering Company, Inc. (the \"Debtor\"), and requiring\r\nhim to return all fees and retainers to the Debtor.  For the\r\nreasons set forth below, we affirm.\r\n                             I.\r\n                         Background\r\nWe draw the facts of this case, which are not in dispute,\r\nfrom the opinion of the BAP:\r\n    On September 29, 1993, the Debtor,\r\nIndependent Engineering Company, Inc., filed a\r\nvoluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11\r\nof the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 101, et.\r\nseq.  On that same date, the Debtor filed a\r\nMotion to Employ Thomas Miller as counsel, a\r\nsupporting affidavit and a \"Statement pursuant\r\nto Rule 2016(b).\"  At that time, Miller's\r\naffidavit and rule 2016 Statement reflected\r\nthat the source of the $10,000 retainer [for\r\nMiller's services] was the company's\r\npresident, Al Peterson.  The initial\r\napplication, affidavit and rule 2016 statement\r\ndid not set forth the terms of the engagement\r\nor the fee agreement between the Debtor and\r\nMiller.\r\n           . . . .\r\n\n    On October 27, 1993, the Debtor filed\r\nan amended motion to employ counsel that\r\nincorporated a copy of a fee agreement by and\r\nbetween the Debtor, Miller, and Peterson.\r\n(footnote omitted.)  Paragraph 2 of the fee\r\nagreement stated that \"[Miller's] Firm will be\r\npaid $10,000 as a security deposit retainer.\" \r\nParagraph 6 provided for monthly billing\r\nagainst the retainer, with the retainer to be\r\nreplenished by the Debtor.  [Paragraph 4\r\nprovided for any balance remaining in the\r\nretainer to be \"refunded to the Client,\"\r\ndesignated by Paragraph 1 as Independent\r\nEngineering Company, Inc.  The fee agreement\r\nalso indicated that the source of the\r\nretainer, Alfred Peterson, was designated as a\r\nthird party guarantor and \"not [a] client[] of\r\nthe Firm.\"]\r\n\n           . . . .\r\n\n    On October 29, 1993, the [Bankruptcy]\r\nCourt endorsed the amended motion to employ as\r\nfollows: \"Application approved.\r\nNotwithstanding paragraph 6 of the attached\r\nagreement, all compensation shall be subject\r\nto approval by the court upon appropriate\r\napplication. /s/Joan N. Feeney.\"\r\n\n           . . . .\r\n\n    On December 2, 1993, Miller filed his\r\nFirst Amendment to the Rule 2016(b) Statement\r\nwherein he disclosed for the first time that\r\nhe had taken draws against the retainer and\r\nhad received post-petition payments from the\r\nDebtor as follows:\r\n\n    Oct. 9, 1993: $3,007.80 (billed against\r\nretainer)\r\n\n    Oct. 29, 1993: $3,007.80 (post-petition\r\npayment by the Debtor)\r\n\n    Nov. 30, 1993: $4,612.80 ($3,088.68\r\nbilled against retainer)\r\n\n    As of December 2, 1993, Miller had\r\nfiled no fee applications.  The Court had\r\napproved no fees; it had authorized no\r\npayments.  In response to Miller's December 2\r\ndisclosure, the Court ordered him to file an\r\ninterim fee application[, which Miller did on\r\nJanuary 7, 1994]. . . .   The United States\r\nTrustee objected [on February 3, 1994 to\r\nMiller's First Interim Fee Application and\r\nfiled a Motion to Vacate Miller's employment,\r\nbased on Miller's lack of disinterestedness]. \r\nAfter a hearing [on February 15, 1994], the\r\nbankruptcy court entered its order vacating\r\nthe October 29, 1993 endorsed order approving\r\nMiller as counsel and further ordered Miller\r\nto disgorge all retainers and fees.\r\n\nThe bankruptcy court instructed the Debtor to obtain new\r\ncounsel by March 2, 1994.  Miller, who did not request\r\nreinstatement, appeals the bankruptcy court's ruling insofar as it\r\nrequired him to disgorge his fees and retainer.\r\n                            II.\r\n                     Standard of Review\r\nWe review a bankruptcy court's findings of fact for clear\r\nerror and examine its conclusions of law de novo.  See Winthrop Old\r\nFarm Nurseries, Inc. v. New Bedford Inst. for Sav. (In re Winthrop),\r\n50 F.3d 72, 73 (1st Cir. 1995).  The bankruptcy court's\r\ninterpretation of the Bankruptcy Code presents a question of law. \r\nSee id.  The application of the code to a particular case poses a\r\nmixed question of law and fact, which is subject to review for clear\r\nerror unless the bankruptcy court's analysis was infected by legal\r\nerror or based on a mistaken impression of applicable legal\r\nprinciples.  See Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir.\r\n1993); see also Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S.\r\n844, 855 n.15 (1982); In re Winthrop, 50 F.3d at 73.  \r\n                            III.\r\n                         Discussion\r\nMiller contends that the BAP erred in upholding the order\r\nof the bankruptcy judge because, when he drew against his client's\r\nretainer, the lawfulness of his conduct was unclear.  On appeal,\r\nMiller claims that:  he was disinterested, he was not required to\r\nobtain prior judicial approval for withdrawals from the retainer\r\nbecause it was not property of the estate, his fee agreement\r\npermitted replenishment of the retainer by the Debtor, and the\r\nbankruptcy court's order was ambiguous.\r\nRelying upon In re Printcrafters, Inc., 233 B.R. 113, 120\r\n(D. Colo. 1999), a case in which counsel who had drawn on a retainer\r\nprior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition was nevertheless found\r\nto be \"disinterested,\" Miller argues that his draws were not\r\nnecessarily proscribed as a matter of law.  Unlike the attorney in\r\nPrintcrafters, however, Miller not only drew on a pre-petition\r\nretainer but also failed to disclose that fact in his amended motion\r\nfor employment or in any accompanying statements to the bankruptcy\r\ncourt.  \r\nMiller also attempts to justify his failure to submit a\r\ntimely fee application for either of his first two withdrawals by\r\nciting cases suggesting that prior judicial approval is not required\r\nfor draws on retainers not the property of the estate.  See In re\r\nMcDonald Bros. Constr., Inc., 114 B.R. 989, 994 (Bankr. N.D. Ill.\r\n1990); Indian Motocycle Assocs. III Ltd. Partnership v.\r\nMassachusetts Hous. Auth., 66 F.3d 1246, 1254 (1st Cir. 1995).  We\r\nneed not reach this question because the fee agreement itself\r\nprovided for any balance of the retainer to be \"refunded to the\r\nclient,\" in this case, the Debtor.\r\nBut even if the cases permitting certain withdrawals from\r\nretainers without prior judicial approval were on all fours with\r\nthis case, notice to parties in interest, a hearing, and judicial\r\napproval are required when counsel seeks compensation from the\r\ndebtor's estate.  See 11 U.S.C.  330(a), 331; In re Chapel Gate\r\nApartments, Ltd., 64 B.R. 569, 575 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 1986) (holding\r\nthat \"fees in bankruptcy cases . . . are subject to review,\r\nmodification, and outright cancellation by the Court\").   Moreover,\r\nthe fact remains that Miller ignored an order of the bankruptcy\r\ncourt requiring him to obtain prior judicial approval for any\r\ncompensation he was to receive notwithstanding that paragraph 6 of\r\nthe fee agreement purported to allow him to bill and collect\r\nadditional reimbursement directly from the debtor.  This order was,\r\nof course, entirely lawful, see 11 U.S.C.  328(c), 329(a),\r\n330(a)(1)(A) &amp; (B), 331; In re Martin, 817 F.2d at 180; In re Chapel\r\nGate Apartments, Ltd., 64 B.R. at 575, and Miller's violation of it\r\nproperly subjected him to sanctions, see 11 U.S.C.  328(c),\r\n329(b); In re Martin, 817 F.2d at 182-183 (observing that the\r\nfailure to disclose a fee arrangement can provide grounds for the\r\ndisqualification of debtor's counsel and the disgorgement of fees);\r\nsee also Rome v. Braunstein, 19 F.3d 54, 58, 62 (1st Cir. 1994);\r\nSmith v. Marshall (In re Hot Tin Roof, Inc.), 205 B.R. 1000, 1003-04\r\n(B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1997); In re Saturley, 131 B.R. 509, 517 (Bankr.\r\nD. Me. 1991).\r\nMiller also argues that even if he properly was subject\r\nto sanctions, the total disgorgement of his retainer and fees\r\nconstituted an abuse of the bankruptcy court's discretion.  We\r\ndisagree.  Bankruptcy courts historically have been accorded wide\r\ndiscretion to oversee the terms and conditions of a debtor's\r\nengagement of professionals because \"[t]he bankruptcy judge is on\r\nthe front line, in the best position to gauge the ongoing interplay\r\nof factors and to make the delicate judgment calls which such a\r\ndecision entails.\"  In re Martin, 817 F.2d at 182.  Section 327(a)\r\nauthorizes an estate trustee or a debtor in possession to employ\r\n\"disinterested\" professionals who \"do not hold or represent an\r\ninterest adverse to the estate.\"  11 U.S.C.  327(a); see also id.\r\n328(c) (allowing courts to deny compensation and reimbursement to\r\nsuch professionals).  \r\nSection 329 requires debtor's counsel to disclose to the\r\ncourt the amount and the source of any compensation that counsel has\r\nreceived, or expects to receive, from the client for the year that\r\npreceded the bankruptcy petition.  See 11 U.S.C.  329. \r\nProfessionals employed in bankruptcy cases are subject to\r\n\"particularly rigorous conflict-of-interest restraints,\" Rome, 19\r\nF.3d at 57, whereby they must not evidence \"even [an] appearance of\r\nimpropriety,\" id. at 58 (internal quotation marks and citation\r\nomitted).  The bankruptcy court has continuing authority to revisit\r\nan order employing a particular attorney to represent a debtor.  See\r\n11 U.S.C.  328(c); see also Rome, 19 F.3d at 58; In re Hot Tin\r\nRoof, Inc., 205 B.R. at 1003.  Every potential conflict must be\r\ndisclosed, and upon finding that counsel has failed to comply, the\r\nbankruptcy judge can impose various remedies, including\r\ndisqualification of counsel and the denial of fees.  See In re\r\nMartin, 817 F.2d at 182-83; see also In re Chapel Gate Apartments,\r\nLtd., 64 B.R. at 575 (holding that fees can be denied even where the\r\nfailure to disclose results from negligence rather than from\r\ndesign).\r\nBy failing to timely disclose and secure prior judicial\r\napproval of withdrawals from the pre-petition retainer and\r\nsubsequent replenishment by the Debtor, Miller flouted a lawful\r\norder of the bankruptcy court and thereby frustrated its ability to\r\noversee the bankruptcy proceedings.  On these facts, we cannot say\r\nthat the bankruptcy court's decision was clearly erroneous. \r\nAffirmed. Costs to appellees.\n",

Moreover,\r\nthe fact remains that Miller ignored an order of the bankruptcy\r\ncourt requiring him to obtain prior judicial approval for any\r\ncompensation he was to receive notwithstanding that paragraph 6 of\r\nthe fee agreement purported to allow him to bill and collect\r\nadditional reimbursement directly from the debtor.  This order was,\r\nof course, entirely lawful, see 11 U.S.C.  328(c), 329(a),\r\n330(a)(1)(A) &amp; (B), 331; In re Martin, 817 F.2d at 180; In re Chapel\r\nGate Apartments, Ltd., 64 B.R. at 575, and Miller's violation of it\r\nproperly subjected him to sanctions, see 11 U.S.C.  328(c),\r\n329(b); In re Martin, 817 F.2d at 182-183 (observing that the\r\nfailure to disclose a fee arrangement can provide grounds for the\r\ndisqualification of debtor's counsel and the disgorgement of fees);\r\nsee also Rome v.

Me. 1991).\r\nMiller also argues that even if he properly was subject\r\nto sanctions, the total disgorgement of his retainer and fees\r\nconstituted an abuse of the bankruptcy court's discretion.  We\r\ndisagree.  Bankruptcy courts historically have been accorded wide\r\ndiscretion to oversee the terms and conditions of a debtor's\r\nengagement of professionals because \"[t]he bankruptcy judge is on\r\nthe front line, in the best position to gauge the ongoing interplay\r\nof factors and to make the delicate judgment calls which such a\r\ndecision entails.\"  In re Martin, 817 F.2d at 182.  Section 327(a)\r\nauthorizes an estate trustee or a debtor in possession to employ\r\n\"disinterested\" professionals who \"do not hold or represent an\r\ninterest adverse to the estate.\"  11 U.S.C.  327(a); see also id.\r\n328(c) (allowing courts to deny compensation and reimbursement to\r\nsuch professionals).  \r\nSection 329 requires debtor's counsel to disclose to the\r\ncourt the amount and the source of any compensation that counsel has\r\nreceived, or expects to receive, from the client for the year that\r\npreceded the bankruptcy petition.  See 11 U.S.C.  329. \r\nProfessionals employed in bankruptcy cases are subject to\r\n\"particularly rigorous conflict-of-interest restraints,\" Rome, 19\r\nF.3d at 57, whereby they must not evidence \"even [an] appearance of\r\nimpropriety,\" id. at 58 (internal quotation marks and citation\r\nomitted).  The bankruptcy court has continuing authority to revisit\r\nan order employing a particular attorney to represent a debtor.  See\r\n11 U.S.C.  328(c); see also Rome, 19 F.3d at 58; In re Hot Tin\r\nRoof, Inc., 205 B.R. at 1003.  Every potential conflict must be\r\ndisclosed, and upon finding that counsel has failed to comply, the\r\nbankruptcy judge can impose various remedies, including\r\ndisqualification of counsel and the denial of fees.  See In re\r\nMartin, 817 F.2d at 182-83; see also In re Chapel Gate Apartments,\r\nLtd., 64 B.R. at 575 (holding that fees can be denied even where the\r\nfailure to disclose results from negligence rather than from\r\ndesign).\r\nBy failing to timely disclose and secure prior judicial\r\napproval of withdrawals from the pre-petition retainer and\r\nsubsequent replenishment by the Debtor, Miller flouted a lawful\r\norder of the bankruptcy court and thereby frustrated its ability to\r\noversee the bankruptcy proceedings.  On these facts, we cannot say\r\nthat the bankruptcy court's decision was clearly erroneous. \r\nAffirmed. Costs to appellees.\n</pre>",
