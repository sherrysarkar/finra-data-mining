In this appeal, pro se appellant Dennis\n\n Morani objects to the district court's denial of his motion\n\n for relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).                      We\n\n affirm, commenting here on only one of the claims raised in\n\n the motion.1     Morani asserted that Thomas Nicholson, counsel\n\n for appellees, William Landenberger and Commonwealth Equity\n\n Service,   Inc.,       had   engaged   in   \"fraud   on    the   court\"    by\n\n misrepresenting         certain   facts     to   the      district    court\n\n concerning      Morani's     failure   to    call    Landenberger     as    a\n\n witness during arbitration proceedings.              The district court\n\n had apparently relied on Nicholson's representations in\n\n denying Morani's motion to vacate an arbitration award.2                   In\n\n support    of    his    claim,    Morani    submitted      excerpts    from\n\n transcripts of the arbitration hearings (but did not provide\n\n the court with full transcripts).             However, these excerpts\n\n did not establish that Nicholson had engaged in the alleged\n\n misconduct.      Accordingly, the district court did not abuse\n\n\n    1 The other claims did not justify Rule 60(b) relief because\nthey were either irrelevant to the particular issues resolved by\nthe district court judgment, sought reconsideration of issues\nresolved in a prior appeal, see footnote 2 below, or had been\nwaived in prior proceedings.\n    2We affirmed the court's judgment denying the motion to\nvacate in a prior appeal, Morani v. Landenberger, 196 F.3d 9\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fits discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) motion.              See Hoult\n\nv. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that this\n\ncourt reviews the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of\n\ndiscretion);    id.   at   6   (holding    that    \"newly   discovered\n\nevidence\" under Rule 60(b)(2) must be \"of such a material\n\nand controlling nature as would probably have changed the\n\noutcome\" of the pertinent proceeding) (citation omitted;\n\ninternal    quotation      marks   and     brackets   omitted);       see\n\nAnderson v.
