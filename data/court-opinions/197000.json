Appellant Juan M. Cofield appeals from\r                                \r\n\nthe district  court's affirmance of a  bankruptcy court order\r\n\nwhich permitted appellant to convert his chapter 7 bankruptcy\r\n\ncase  to  a  case  under  chapter  11,  but  then immediately\r\n\nreconverted  the case  back to  chapter 7.   After  carefully\r\n\nreviewing  the briefs and the record,  we affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's judgment  for essentially  the reasons stated  in its\r\n\nMemorandum  and Order, dated January  26, 1996.   We add only\r\n\nthe following comments.\r\n\n          1.  A  notice of conversion,  filed pursuant to  11\r\n\nU.S.C.   706(a), is not effective on filing.  Bankruptcy Rule\r\n\n1017(d) provides that conversion under    706(a) \"shall be on\r\n\nmotion  filed and  served as  required by  Rule 9013.\"   Rule\r\n\n9013, in  turn, states that \"[a]  request for an order  . . .\r\n\nshall  be  by written  motion.\"    Thus, \"[t]hese  provisions\r\n\nindicate that a motion to convert pursuant to   706(a) is not\r                                  \r\n\neffective in and  of itself, but  rather is  a request for  a\r\n\ncourt order of conversion.\"  In re Calder, 973 F.2d 862,  867\r                                                     \r\n\n(10th  Cir. 1992).   As  a result,  the bankruptcy  court was\r\n\ncorrect  in treating appellant's \"notice\" as a motion and the\r\n\nconversion was not effective on January 13, 1995, when it was\r\n\nfiled.\r\n\n          2.   Even assuming that \"cause\" for reconversion to\r\n\nchapter 7 must exist at the  time a   706(a) motion is filed,\r\n\nsuch  \"cause\" existed  here.   The  bankruptcy court's  cause\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndetermination   rested   primarily   on   the   futility   of\r\n\nreorganization.   The court based the futility finding on the\r\n\nspeculative nature of  the Fannie Mae lawsuit.   Although the\r\n\ncourt entered  these findings  three  months after  appellant\r                         \r\n\nfiled his    706(a) notice,  it plainly was  determining that\r\n\nfutility had existed  as long  as the Fannie  Mae action  had\r                                \r\n\nbeen pending.   That  is, if  funding for reorganization  was\r\n\ndependent on the success  of the lawsuit and the  lawsuit had\r\n\nlittle  chance of succeeding,  the reorganization  was futile\r\n\nwhen appellant filed the conversion notice.\r\n\n          3.   Appellant's  procedural due  process arguments\r\n\nalso fail.  He first maintains that the bankruptcy court made\r\n\na determination  prior to holding the hearings  that it would\r                                     \r\n\ndeny  conversion.  There is  simply no support  in the record\r\n\nfor  this  description of  what  happened.  Second, appellant\r\n\nasserts that  although the  bankruptcy court noticed  the two\r\n\nhearings  as non-evidentiary, it  took evidence  at them.   A\r\n\nreading  of  the   transcripts  from  these   hearings  shows\r\n\notherwise.    The court  only  ordered  appellant to  produce\r\n\ncertain documents at a future time.\r                                         \r\n\n          4.    Appellant's  arguments  that  the  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt's actions  constituted a  \"taking\" in violation  of the\r\n\nConstitution  and  that  the  bankruptcy  court violated  the\r\n\nsubstantive due  process clause were  not raised  below.   As\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nsuch, they are waived.   See McCoy v. Massachusetts  Inst. of\r                                                                         \r\n\nTechnology, 950\r                      \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nF.2d  13,  22 (1st  Cir. 1991),  cert.  denied, 504  U.S. 910\r                                                          \r\n\n(1992).        Affirmed.\r                                   \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
