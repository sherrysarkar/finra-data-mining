HARRELSON,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n        [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Gibson,* Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Anthony A. Scibelli on brief for appellant.\r\n   Lee M. Berger, Richard T. Marr, and Berger &amp; Markir, P.C. on\r\nbrief for appellees. \r\n\nAUGUST 25, 1999\r\n\n                   \r\n\n*Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.  Per Curiam.  This is an appeal of an award of attorneys'\r\nfees under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws ch. 12,  11I.  Defendant-appellant Woodrow T. Harrelson\r\ncontends that the district court erred by awarding unreasonably\r\nhigh attorneys' fees in light of the results obtained by plaintiffs\r\nin this case.  We affirm the order of the district court.\r\n                   I. Factual Background\r\nHarrelson, an actor, was involved in an altercation with\r\nplaintiffs, both of whom were photographers.  As a result of the\r\naltercation, plaintiffs brought this diversity action, charging\r\nvarious intentional torts, as well as civil rights violations under\r\nthe MCRA.  In their complaint, each plaintiff sought in excess of\r\n$150,000 damages.\r\nAfter a five-day trial, the jury found for plaintiffs on\r\nall the intentional tort and MCRA counts.  The jury awarded one\r\nplaintiff approximately $2,500 in compensatory damages and the\r\nother $1.\r\nPlaintiffs subsequently sought attorneys' fees as\r\nprevailing and aggrieved parties under the MCRA.  The district\r\ncourt awarded approximately $79,000 in fees.  Although he had an\r\nopportunity to do so, Harrelson never substantively challenged\r\nplaintiffs' submissions regarding appropriate fees.  Harrelson\r\nappealed both the underlying verdict and the size of the fee award. \r\nHe subsequently dropped his challenge to the verdict and thus we\r\nare concerned here only with his appeal of the fee award.                         II. Discussion\r\nThis court reviews an award of attorneys' fees for abuse\r\nof discretion.  See Krewson v. City of Quincy, 74 F.3d 15, 17 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  Massachusetts law provides the \"proper rule of\r\ndecision.\"  Id.  The MCRA requires judges to award reasonable\r\nattorneys' fees to a prevailing and aggrieved party.  See Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 12,  11I.  Harrelson contests only the\r\n\"reasonableness\" of the award.\r\nIn awarding fees under remedial statutes, Massachusetts\r\ncourts \"may consider a variety of factors, including the nature of\r\nthe case, the time and labor required, the amount of damages\r\ninvolved, the result obtained, the experience and reputation of the\r\nattorney, the usual price charged by other attorneys for similar\r\nwork, and the amount of awards granted in other cases.\"  Krewson,\r\n74 F.3d at 17 (citing Linthicum v. Archambault, 379 Mass. 381, 388-\r\n89 (1979)).\r\nHarrelson's only contention on appeal is that the\r\nplaintiffs' \"result obtained\" in this suit -- $2,501 collectively\r\n-- should be measured against the damages they sought in their\r\noriginal complaint.  He argues that given the wide disproportion\r\nbetween the damages sought and the damages awarded, plaintiffs \r\nobtained little success.  For this reason, in his view, the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in awarding $79,000 in fees.\r\nWe do not agree.  Under the MCRA and other remedial\r\nMassachusetts statutes, the \"result obtained\" is only one of the\r\nmultiple factors courts may consider.  See Krewson, 74 F.3d at 17-\r\n18.  The district court had before it -- and averted to -- numerous\r\nsubmissions of plaintiffs, none of which Harrelson contested. \r\nMoreover, the court, in arriving at the fee award, expressly\r\nconsidered the \"result obtained\" in addition to these submissions. \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion.  See Deary v. City of Gloucester,\r\n9 F.3d 191, 197 (1st Cir. 1993) (stating that appellate courts\r\nshould give deference to a district court's determination of\r\nattorneys' fees and \"avoid extensive second guessing\").\r\n                    III. Fees on Appeal\r\nPlaintiffs seek an award of attorneys' fees in connection\r\nwith the present appeal.  Under Massachusetts law, the decision to\r\naward such fees is purely discretionary.  See Linthicum, 379 Mass.\r\nat 389; Burney v. City of Pawtucket, 728 F.2d 547, 550 (1st Cir.\r\n1983).  We decline to make such an award.\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellees.\n",
