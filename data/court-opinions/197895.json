Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                      Before\r\n\n              Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n            Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n             and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJose A. Pagan Nieves for appellants.\r\nIgor Dominguez, with whom Igor Dominguez Law offices, was on\r\nbrief for appellees.\r\n\n                 April 13, 1998\r\n\n                                             Per Curiam.  Plaintiffs and their conjugal partnership\r\nappeal from a district court judgment dismissing their claims\r\nagainst the individual members of the credentialing committee at\r\nHospital San Fransisco [\"HSF\"] for negligently extending emergency\r\nroom privileges to Dr. Victor Medina, who attended plaintiffs'\r\nfive-year-old daughter immediately before her death on November 25,\r\n1989.\r\nPlaintiffs brought suit against Dr. Medina and HSF on\r\nJuly 11, 1991, for alleged negligent treatment of their daughter. \r\nOther defendants were added through various amendments to the\r\ncomplaint.  On January 25, 1994, plaintiffs released HSF from \"any\r\nclaim for . . . damages suffered by the plaintiffs past, present,\r\nand future, related to the treatment and hospitalization that\r\n[their daughter] received at [HSF] . . . .\"  As contemplated by the\r\nsettlement agreement, plaintiffs thereafter stipulated to the\r\ndismissal of all claims against HSF.\r\nSix months later, however, plaintiffs filed their Fourth\r\nAmended Complaint, claiming that the individual members of the HSF\r\ncredentialing committee \"negligently selected, qualified and\r\nauthorized Dr. Victor Medina to practice\" in the emergency room\r\nnotwithstanding an alleged lack of professional qualifications and\r\ntraining.  The district court ultimately dismissed the Fourth\r\nAmended Complaint in its entirety, on the ground that all claims\r\nwere time-barred.  We review its ruling de novo.  See Gonzalez-\r\nBernal v. United States, 907 F.2d 246, 248 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\nAs the Fourth Amended Complaint was not filed within the\r\none-year limitations period prescribed in P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,\r\n5298(2), plaintiffs sought to demonstrate that the running of the\r\nlimitations period had been tolled.  See Rodriguez Narvaez v.\r\nNazario, 895 F.2d 38, 45 (1st Cir. 1990).  Nevertheless, we need\r\nnot address appellants' tolling arguments since the cause of action\r\nasserted in the Fourth Amended Complaint (i.e., negligent\r\ncredentialing) is not identical to that in the original complaint\r\n(i.e., negligent treatment).  See id. at 43 (although \"tolling the\r\nstatute [of limitations] as to one jointly and severally liable\r\ndefendant tolls it as to all, . . . the tolling is effective with\r\nregard only to identical causes of action.  The statute oflimitations is not tolled for all claims arising out of the sameset of facts.\") (emphasis added); see also Fernandez v. Chardon,\r\n681 F.2d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 1982) (same).\r\nWhereas the original complaint made no mention of Dr.\r\nMedina's allegedly deficient professional qualifications, the\r\nFourth Amended Complaint asserted that the members of the\r\ncredentialing committee \"negligently selected, qualified and\r\nauthorized Dr. Victor Medina to practice medicine [in the HSF\r\nemergency room.]  At the time of the events, Dr. Medina was not\r\nqualified nor had the training necessary to treat Anes Fuentes . .\r\n. .\"  See, e.g., Marquez Vega v. Martinez Rosado, 116 D.P.R. 397\r\n(1985) (recognizing that, in Puerto Rico, \"public policy dictates\r\nthat . . . the hospital has the continuous obligation to protect\r\nthe health of its patients by . . . carefully selecting the\r\nphysicians who . . . are granted the privilege of using its\r\nfacilities . . . .\"); see also, e.g., Browning v. Burt, 613 N.E.2d\r\n993, 1004 (Ohio 1993) (\"Negligent credentialing claims arise out of\r\nthe hospital's failure to satisfy its independent duty to grant and\r\ncontinue staff privileges only to competent physicians.\").\r\nThe legal responsibility of a hospital to extend\r\nprivileges only to qualified professionals is distinct from its\r\nvicarious liability for the torts of the professionals to whom it\r\nextends hospital privileges.  See, e.g., Johnson v. Misericordia\r\nCommunity Hosp., 301 N.W.2d 156, 165 (Wisc. 1981) (citing with\r\napproval cases holding \"that a hospital has a direct and\r\nindependent responsibility to its patients, over and above that of\r\nthe physicians and surgeons practicing therein, to take reasonable\r\nsteps to . . . insure that its medical staff is qualified for the\r\nprivileges granted\").  Since the original complaint asserted a\r\ncause of action for negligent treatment, its filing did not toll\r\nthe limitations period with respect to the distinct cause of action\r\nfor negligent credentialing asserted in the Fourth Amended\r\nComplaint.\r\nThe district court judgment is affirmed.  Costs are\r\nawarded to appellees.\r\nSO ORDERED.\r\n",
