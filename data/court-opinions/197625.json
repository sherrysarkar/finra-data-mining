For the following\r\n\nreasons, we affirm.\r\n\n                    I.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n     This appeal from summary judgment is all that remains from a\r\n\nshareholder class  action filed in 1991  by Plaintiffs-Appellants\r\n\nChanning M. Wells, III et al. (the Class)1 under Section 10(b) of\r                                       \r\n\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.   78j(b), and Rule\r\n\n10b-5  promulgated thereunder,  17  C.F.R.    240.10b-5,  against\r\n\nMonarch Capital Corporation  (Monarch Capital), its  wholly owned\r\n\nand  largest subsidiary,  Monarch  Life  Insurance  Co.  (Monarch\r\n\nLife), and  Monarch Life s  wholly owned  subsidiary, Springfield\r\n\nLife Insurance  Co., Inc.  (Springfield Life)  (collectively, the\r\n\nMonarch Defendants),  and E&amp;Y.  Fourteen months  after filing the\r\n\ncomplaint, the Class settled with the Monarch Defendants for $4.7\r\n\nmillion.   Following the settlement, the only remaining defendant\r\n\nwas E&amp;Y.  The gravamen of the Class complaint against E&amp;Y alleged\r\n\nthat E&amp;Y violated federal securities laws and state law by making\r\n\nmaterial misrepresentations  in (and omissions from)  the Monarch\r\n\nDefendants   1989  consolidated financial  statements  (and E&amp;Y s\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Wells  represented  a class  of  shareholders  who  purchased\r\nMonarch Capital stock between November 10, 1989, and November 14,\r\n1990, at prices ranging from $16 1/8 to $4 3/8 per share.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\naccompanying 1990 audit  opinion) with scienter.  It  did so, the\r\n\nClass alleged,  by materially overstating the  statutory surplus2\r\n\nof Monarch  Capital s subsidiaries, more particularly,  the value\r\n\nof the Cash Management Account (CMA).  See Part II.B. infra.  The\r                                                                     \r\n\nend result of these actions, the Class complained, was to mislead\r\n\ninvestors  by   artificially  inflating  the   price  of  Monarch\r\n\nCapital s stock.\r\n\n     After  the 1992 settlement,  the case remained  stagnant for\r\n\nthree years.3  Then, in March 1995, the district court sua sponte\r                                                                           \r\n\nscheduled a status  conference.  Three months later,  E&amp;Y filed a\r\n\nmotion for  summary judgment.   In response, the Class  filed its\r\n\nopposition  to E&amp;Y s  motion and  a motion  for  leave to  file a\r\n\nSecond Amended  Class  Action Complaint.   In  January 1996,  the\r\n\nClass   filed  its  own  motion  for  partial  summary  judgment.\r\n\nStating,  in its forty-five  page opinion, that   Plaintiffs [the\r\n\nClass]  virtually abandoned the case,  the district court granted\r\n\nsummary  judgment  for  E&amp;Y  on the  Class   claims  for  primary\r\n\nliability  under Section  10(b) and  denied  the Class   motions.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  An insurance company s  statutory surplus  is comprised of its\r\n admitted   assets    (or   statutory  assets   minus   statutory\r\nliabilities).\r\n\n3  During this period of inactivity, the Supreme Court issued its\r\ndecision in Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank\r                                                                           \r\nof  Denver, N.A.,  511 U.S.  164 (1994),  holding that  a private\r                          \r\nplaintiff  may not  maintain an  aiding and  abetting suit  under\r\nSection 10(b) as  the text of the  1934 Act does not itself reach\r\nthose who aid and  abet a   10(b) violation.    Id. at 177.   The\r                                                            \r\ndistrict  court found,  after  Central  Bank,  that  all  pending\r                                                      \r\nsecondary  liability claims against  E&amp;Y were barred  and granted\r\nsummary judgment  in favor  of E&amp;Y on  all claims for  aiding and\r\nabetting.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nThis appeal follows.\r\n\n                     II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\n\nA.  Monarch Capital - the Parent Holding Company\r                                                          \r\n\n     Monarch Capital was  a typical financial holding  company of\r\n\nthe  1970s  and 1980s.    Its operations  included  insurance and\r\n\ninsurance services, corporate, real estate investment and venture\r\n\ncapital,  and investment  management.   For  nearly two  decades,\r\n\nMonarch Capital  centered its focus on its  real estate business.\r\n\nBy 1989,  it was  clear that this  focus was  in error.   Monarch\r\n\nCapital  was in severe  financial distress, with  reported losses\r\n\ntotaling millions  of dollars.   Even its president, in  his 1989\r\n\nannual  report to  shareholders,  conceded that   [o]ur financial\r\n\nresults  for the  past two  years have been  very disappointing. \r\n\nMonarch  Capital announced plans to terminate its capital markets\r\n\nand  real estate  operations and  concentrate  on its  profitable\r\n\ninsurance  sector.   Despite vows  to  pull out  of its  downward\r\n\nspiral,  Monarch  Capital continued  to  deteriorate financially.\r\n\nThe present  action struck the  death knell blow;  parent Monarch\r\n\nCapital was forced  into bankruptcy4 and subsidiary  Monarch Life\r\n\nwas   placed  in  receivership  by  the  Massachusetts  insurance\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  The bankruptcy action stayed the Class  claims against Monarch\r\nCapital.   When  the  settlement  agreement  was  finalized,  the\r\nbankruptcy court approved Monarch Capital s reorganization  plan,\r\ndischarging and releasing the Class  claims against it.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncommissioner.5\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Monarch Life was  regulated by the Commissioner  of Insurance\r\nfor  the Commonwealth  of Massachusetts.   As  a state  regulated\r\ninsurance company,  it was  required to  file annual  statements,\r\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 175    25, annual audited financial statements,\r\n211  C.M.R.  Part  19:01, et  seq.,  and  registration statements\r                                            \r\ncontaining current information  about material transactions, such\r\nas loans, between it and its  unregulated parent holding company.\r\nMass. Gen.  L. ch.  175   193N(b)(iii)(1).   Under  Massachusetts\r\nlaw,  an  insurance  company  is  prohibited  from  including  an\r\nunsecured loan  to its  parent holding  company in its   admitted\r\nassets  and  statutory surplus.   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175   11; see\r                                                                           \r\nnote 2 supra.\r                      \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nB.  The Cash Management Account (CMA)\r                                               \r\n\n     Monarch  Capital  established  the CMA  for  itself  and its\r\n\nsubsidiaries in 1985.  It was formalized in 1986 by  a Short-Term\r\n\nInvestment Pool Agreement (STIP).  Pursuant to  the STIP, Monarch\r\n\nCapital, Monarch Life, and Springfield  Life agreed to pool, on a\r\n\ndaily basis,  any available  cash into the  CMA.6   A STIP  party\r\n\nrequiring funds could  draw upon the CMA to  meet operating costs\r\n\nand obtain them from the  CMA at short-term interest rates.   The\r\n\nSTIP agreement  provided that pooled funds would  be available to\r\n\nthe depositing company in cash on  a demand basis.7  The official\r\n\npurpose of  the CMA was  to minimize administrative  expenses and\r\n\nexternal borrowing costs,  and maximize investment returns.   The\r\n\nunofficial purpose of the CMA,  the Class contended, was to offer\r\n\nan unsecured,  unregulated line of  credit to a  faltering parent\r\n\nand enable  it to obtain  illegal dividends.8  The  Class accused\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Springfield Life was a Vermont corporation.  Vermont insurance\r\nregulators initially  questioned Springfield Life s  inclusion of\r\nthe CMA investment in its statutory surplus, but acquiesced after\r\nthe  STIP was  formalized.    Another  one of  Monarch  Capital s\r\nsubsidiaries,  First  Variable  Life  Insurance  Company   (First\r\nVariable), an Arkansas corporation, was  an original party to the\r\nSTIP.    When   the  Arkansas  Department  of   Insurance  raised\r\nobjections to the CMA, First Variable ceased participation in the\r\nSTIP.\r\n\n7  Monarch  Capital disclosed the existence  of the CMA to  state\r\ninsurance regulators  in June  1986, in  an amended  registration\r\nstatement.  It declared that it had $125 million in bank lines of\r\ncredit with  which to  guarantee on  demand  the availability  of\r\nfunds to the STIP participants.\r\n\n8   Under Massachusetts insurance  laws, Monarch  Life could  pay\r\ndividends  to Monarch Capital  only out of  its statutory surplus\r\nand  only if its statutory  surplus (after paying such dividends)\r\nwas reasonable  in relation  to its  outstanding liabilities  and\r\nadequate  for its  financial  needs.

L.  ch. 175   \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe  Monarch Defendants  of abusing the  CMA by using  it to fund\r\n\nMonarch Capital s long-term, speculative real estate  activities.\r\n\nAfter settling with  the Monarch Defendants, the Class turned its\r\n\nattention to E&amp;Y s role in this sequence of events.\r\n\nC.

The Contentions of E&amp;Y. \r                                     \r\n\n     Countering  that this is  not a negligence  case, E&amp;Y claims\r\n\nthat, by  including CMA assets  in its computations  of statutory\r\n\nsurplus, it acted without requisite Section 10(b) scienter, as it\r\n\nrelied on the opinion of state insurance examiners.  E&amp;Y contends\r\n\nthat it  is uncontroverted in  the record that  the Massachusetts\r\n\ninsurance  regulators,  with  jurisdiction   over  Monarch  Life,\r\n\nconcluded in a regulatory examination  report, issued only a  few\r\n\nmonths  before  its  1990  report,  that  the  CMA  was  properly\r\n\nincludable  when  calculating   a  life  insurance   subsidiary s\r\n\nstatutory  surplus and that  E&amp;Y explicitly read  and relied upon\r\n\nthis conclusion  by noting  in its work  papers:  [the]  State of\r\n\nMassachusetts  has approved  the  carrying  of  the [CMA]  as  an\r\n\nadmitted asset.  This balance should be considered admissible. 11\r\n\n     E&amp;Y claims that  neither the Class nor  market professionals\r\n\nrelied  upon  its   purported  overstatements  in   making  their\r\n\ninvestment decisions or recommendations.   Further, E&amp;Y  contends\r\n\nthat  three  of  its   partners  contemporaneously  performed  or\r\n\nreviewed  their  own  independent   and  internal  collectibility\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n11   E&amp;Y claims that its auditors even raised this issue directly\r\nwith  the Massachusetts  regulators who  confirmed  that the  CMA\r\nshould be included as a statutory asset of Monarch Life.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nanalyses  and determined  that  Monarch  Life s  and  Springfield\r\n\nLife s $125 million  CMA investment was collectible  from Monarch\r\n\nCapital.\r\n\n                     III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n     We review  the grant by  the district court of  E&amp;Y s motion\r\n\nfor  summary judgment de  novo.  Merino Calenti  v.

To\r                                 \r\n\ndefeat summary  judgment, the  Class must  present facts  showing\r\n\nthere  is a  genuine issue  for trial.   See  Mulero-Rodr guez v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPonte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 673 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                     \r\n\n                         IV.

MacDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 49 (1st Cir. 1983)(substantial\r                              \r\n\nlikelihood that  misstatements were  actually significant  in the\r\n\ndeliberations of a  reasonable shareholder).  It  also found that\r\n\nthe  record failed  to  show that  any E&amp;Y  misrepresentations or\r\n\nomissions,  purportedly relied upon by  the Class, were made with\r\n\nSection 10(b)  scienter.  Ernst  &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,  425 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n185 (1976) (section 10(b) cannot  be read to impose liability for\r\n\nnegligent  conduct  alone).   The  district  court  granted E&amp;Y s\r\n\nmotion for summary judgment.  Under a  de novo review, we examine\r                                                        \r\n\neach element separately.\r\n\nB.  The Element of Materiality\r                                        \r\n\n     In most  circumstances,  disputes over  the  materiality  of\r\n\nallegedly false or misleading statements must be reserved for the\r\n\ntrier of  fact.  Shaw v.  Digital Equipment Corp., 82  F.3d 1194,\r                                                           \r\n\n1217  (1st Cir. 1996); see Basic  Inc. v.

But  not every unfulfilled\r                            \r\n\nexpression  of  corporate  optimism,  even  if  characterized  as\r\n\nmisstatement, can  give rise  to a genuine  issue of  materiality\r\n\nunder the  securities laws.    Shaw, 82  F.3d at 1217;  Lucia, 36\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nF.3d at 176  (leaving open the possibility  that some materiality\r\n\ndeterminations  may  be made  as  a  matter  of law).

The mere fact\r                      \r\n\nthat  an investor might find information interesting or desirable\r\n\nis   not  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  materiality  requirement.\r\n\nRather,  information is  material   only if its  disclosure would\r\n\nalter  the  total mix  of facts available to the investor and  if\r                               \r\n\nthere is a  substantial likelihood that a  reasonable shareholder\r                                            \r\n\nwould consider it important  to the investment decision.

It determined that a jury could not\r\n\nhave  concluded  that  E&amp;Y made  material  misrepresentations  or\r\n\nomissions in its  1990 opinion because the opinion  did not alter\r\n\nthe  total mix   of information available to the  Class.  Milton,\r                                                                          \r\n\n961  F.2d at  972.    Other public  filings,  the district  court\r\n\nreasoned, were  available to the  Class and clearly  revealed the\r\n\nexistence and true nature of the CMA.12\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n12  These public filings included:  Monarch Capital s 1989 annual\r\nreport   and  Form  10K;  the  financial  statements  of  Monarch\r\nCapital s  subsidiaries,  Monarch   Life  and  Springfield  Life;\r\nMonarch    Capital s   president s    pessimistic   message    to\r\nstockholders;  annual statements filed by Monarch Life with state\r\ninsurance regulators listing the STIP;  the triennial examination\r\nreport  on  Monarch  Life  issued  in  November  1989,  by  state\r\ninsurance  examiners; and  statutory  basis financial  statements\r\nfiled by Monarch Life and  Springfield Life with state  insurance\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n     After reviewing the record, we  agree.  The undisputed facts\r\n\ndemonstrate  that  the  disclosure of  Monarch  Life s  statutory\r\n\nsurplus  in Footnote  F of  Monarch  Capital s 1989  consolidated\r\n\nfinancial  statements, filed in  March 1990, was  not material to\r\n\ninvestors, but merely  duplicative of prior filings.   It is also\r\n\nclear that it was not a primary source of reliance for  insurance\r\n\nanalysts evaluating insurance  companies.  We also note  that the\r\n\nrecord does  not reflect any   concrete evidence  put  forward by\r\n\nthe  Class  to  indicate that  E&amp;Y s  disclosures  were genuinely\r\n\nmaterial to investors, Anderson v.

The\r                                                \r\n\ndistrict court found that a reasonable and prudent investor would\r\n\nnot be misled about the CMA due to the existence of  other public\r\n\nfilings  and  that  E&amp;Y s knowledge  of  these  prior disclosures\r\n\nnegated the possibility that it acted with scienter.\r\n\n     Based upon  our review  of the  voluminous record,  we agree\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n15   Other  circuits have  held  that scienter  in Section  10(b)\r\nactions  against  accountants  or  independent  auditors  is  not\r\nestablished merely through a showing of an error of judgment or a\r\nmisapplication of  accounting  principles.   The  plaintiff  must\r\nprove that  the accounting  practices were so deficient that  the\r\naudit amounted to no audit at all, or an egregious refusal to see\r\nthe  obvious,  or  to  investigate  the  doubtful,  or  that  the\r\naccounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable\r\naccountant would have  made the same decision if  confronted with\r\nthe  same facts.

As  an\r\n\nindependent  auditor,  E&amp;Y  had no  motive  to  commit securities\r\n\nfraud.  In  addition, we find no evidence  that E&amp;Y intentionally\r\n\n(or recklessly)  prepared inadequate  collectibility analyses  in\r\n\norder  deliberately (or  recklessly)  to mislead  Monarch Capital\r\n\ninvestors.    Nor  do  we  find  evidence  that  E&amp;Y  acted  with\r\n\nfraudulent  or  reckless  intent in  relying  on  state insurance\r\n\nexaminers.  As to Footnote F of  the 1990 audit opinion, there is\r\n\nno evidence that E&amp;Y deliberately or recklessly chose not to find\r\n\nfault  with the  figures  contained  therein.  Neither  is  there\r\n\nevidence  of conspiratorial  misconduct by  E&amp;Y to  aid  in fraud\r\n\nallegedly being perpetrated  by the Monarch Defendants,  nor does\r\n\nthe Class  supply any.

For example,  it may\r\n\nhave been a mistake for E&amp;Y to take Monarch Capital s word on its\r\n\nown credit position.  It may have been a mistake to rely on state\r\n\ninsurance  department examiners  who,  themselves, may  have been\r\n\nmisinformed.    It  may  have  been a  mistake  to  view  Monarch\r\n\nCapital s subsidiaries  statutory surplus as a regulatory, not an\r\n\naccounting, issue.   And, it may have  been a mistake for  E&amp;Y to\r\n\nrely  upon its own  internal collectibility analyses  (which were\r\n\nnot models of professional accounting competence).  Nevertheless,\r\n\nmistakes  such as  these do  not support  a finding  of scienter.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nHochfelder, 425 U.S. at 214. Under the standards set forth above,\r                    \r\n\nbased  upon  the  facts  of   this  case,  we  find  no  knowing,\r\n\ndeliberate, or reckless fraud on the part of E&amp;Y.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n     This appeal from summary judgment is all that remains from a\r\n\nshareholder class  action filed in 1991  by Plaintiffs-Appellants\r\n\nChanning M. Wells, III et al. (the Class)1 under Section 10(b) of\r                                       \r\n\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.   78j(b), and Rule\r\n\n10b-5  promulgated thereunder,  17  C.F.R.    240.10b-5,  against\r\n\nMonarch Capital Corporation  (Monarch Capital), its  wholly owned\r\n\nand  largest subsidiary,  Monarch  Life  Insurance  Co.  (Monarch\r\n\nLife), and  Monarch Life s  wholly owned  subsidiary, Springfield\r\n\nLife Insurance  Co., Inc.  (Springfield Life)  (collectively, the\r\n\nMonarch Defendants),  and E&amp;Y.  Fourteen months  after filing the\r\n\ncomplaint, the Class settled with the Monarch Defendants for $4.7\r\n\nmillion.   Following the settlement, the only remaining defendant\r\n\nwas E&amp;Y.  The gravamen of the Class complaint against E&amp;Y alleged\r\n\nthat E&amp;Y violated federal securities laws and state law by making\r\n\nmaterial misrepresentations  in (and omissions from)  the Monarch\r\n\nDefendants   1989  consolidated financial  statements  (and E&amp;Y s\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Wells  represented  a class  of  shareholders  who  purchased\r\nMonarch Capital stock between November 10, 1989, and November 14,\r\n1990, at prices ranging from $16 1/8 to $4 3/8 per share.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\naccompanying 1990 audit  opinion) with scienter.  It  did so, the\r\n\nClass alleged,  by materially overstating the  statutory surplus2\r\n\nof Monarch  Capital s subsidiaries, more particularly,  the value\r\n\nof the Cash Management Account (CMA).  See Part II.B. infra.  The\r                                                                     \r\n\nend result of these actions, the Class complained, was to mislead\r\n\ninvestors  by   artificially  inflating  the   price  of  Monarch\r\n\nCapital s stock.\r\n\n     After  the 1992 settlement,  the case remained  stagnant for\r\n\nthree years.3  Then, in March 1995, the district court sua sponte\r                                                                           \r\n\nscheduled a status  conference.  Three months later,  E&amp;Y filed a\r\n\nmotion for  summary judgment.   In response, the Class  filed its\r\n\nopposition  to E&amp;Y s  motion and  a motion  for  leave to  file a\r\n\nSecond Amended  Class  Action Complaint.   In  January 1996,  the\r\n\nClass   filed  its  own  motion  for  partial  summary  judgment.\r\n\nStating,  in its forty-five  page opinion, that   Plaintiffs [the\r\n\nClass]  virtually abandoned the case,  the district court granted\r\n\nsummary  judgment  for  E&amp;Y  on the  Class   claims  for  primary\r\n\nliability  under Section  10(b) and  denied  the Class   motions.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  An insurance company s  statutory surplus  is comprised of its\r\n admitted   assets    (or   statutory  assets   minus   statutory\r\nliabilities).\r\n\n3  During this period of inactivity, the Supreme Court issued its\r\ndecision in Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\n\nA.  Monarch Capital - the Parent Holding Company\r                                                          \r\n\n     Monarch Capital was  a typical financial holding  company of\r\n\nthe  1970s  and 1980s.    Its operations  included  insurance and\r\n\ninsurance services, corporate, real estate investment and venture\r\n\ncapital,  and investment  management.   For  nearly two  decades,\r\n\nMonarch Capital  centered its focus on its  real estate business.\r\n\nBy 1989,  it was  clear that this  focus was  in error.   Monarch\r\n\nCapital  was in severe  financial distress, with  reported losses\r\n\ntotaling millions  of dollars.   Even its president, in  his 1989\r\n\nannual  report to  shareholders,  conceded that   [o]ur financial\r\n\nresults  for the  past two  years have been  very disappointing. \r\n\nMonarch  Capital announced plans to terminate its capital markets\r\n\nand  real estate  operations and  concentrate  on its  profitable\r\n\ninsurance  sector.   Despite vows  to  pull out  of its  downward\r\n\nspiral,  Monarch  Capital continued  to  deteriorate financially.\r\n\nThe present  action struck the  death knell blow;  parent Monarch\r\n\nCapital was forced  into bankruptcy4 and subsidiary  Monarch Life\r\n\nwas   placed  in  receivership  by  the  Massachusetts  insurance\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  The bankruptcy action stayed the Class  claims against Monarch\r\nCapital.   When  the  settlement  agreement  was  finalized,  the\r\nbankruptcy court approved Monarch Capital s reorganization  plan,\r\ndischarging and releasing the Class  claims against it.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncommissioner.5\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   Monarch Life was  regulated by the Commissioner  of Insurance\r\nfor  the Commonwealth  of Massachusetts.   As  a state  regulated\r\ninsurance company,  it was  required to  file annual  statements,\r\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 175    25, annual audited financial statements,\r\n211  C.M.R.  Part  19:01, et  seq.,  and  registration statements\r                                            \r\ncontaining current information  about material transactions, such\r\nas loans, between it and its  unregulated parent holding company.\r\nMass. Gen.  L. ch.  175   193N(b)(iii)(1).   Under  Massachusetts\r\nlaw,  an  insurance  company  is  prohibited  from  including  an\r\nunsecured loan  to its  parent holding  company in its   admitted\r\nassets  and  statutory surplus.

It was formalized in 1986 by  a Short-Term\r\n\nInvestment Pool Agreement (STIP).  Pursuant to  the STIP, Monarch\r\n\nCapital, Monarch Life, and Springfield  Life agreed to pool, on a\r\n\ndaily basis,  any available  cash into the  CMA.6   A STIP  party\r\n\nrequiring funds could  draw upon the CMA to  meet operating costs\r\n\nand obtain them from the  CMA at short-term interest rates.   The\r\n\nSTIP agreement  provided that pooled funds would  be available to\r\n\nthe depositing company in cash on  a demand basis.7  The official\r\n\npurpose of  the CMA was  to minimize administrative  expenses and\r\n\nexternal borrowing costs,  and maximize investment returns.   The\r\n\nunofficial purpose of the CMA,  the Class contended, was to offer\r\n\nan unsecured,  unregulated line of  credit to a  faltering parent\r\n\nand enable  it to obtain  illegal dividends.8  The  Class accused\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Springfield Life was a Vermont corporation.  Vermont insurance\r\nregulators initially  questioned Springfield Life s  inclusion of\r\nthe CMA investment in its statutory surplus, but acquiesced after\r\nthe  STIP was  formalized.    Another  one of  Monarch  Capital s\r\nsubsidiaries,  First  Variable  Life  Insurance  Company   (First\r\nVariable), an Arkansas corporation, was  an original party to the\r\nSTIP.    When   the  Arkansas  Department  of   Insurance  raised\r\nobjections to the CMA, First Variable ceased participation in the\r\nSTIP.\r\n\n7  Monarch  Capital disclosed the existence  of the CMA to  state\r\ninsurance regulators  in June  1986, in  an amended  registration\r\nstatement.  It declared that it had $125 million in bank lines of\r\ncredit with  which to  guarantee on  demand  the availability  of\r\nfunds to the STIP participants.\r\n\n8   Under Massachusetts insurance  laws, Monarch  Life could  pay\r\ndividends  to Monarch Capital  only out of  its statutory surplus\r\nand  only if its statutory  surplus (after paying such dividends)\r\nwas reasonable  in relation  to its  outstanding liabilities  and\r\nadequate  for its  financial  needs.

It  may  have  been a  mistake  to  view  Monarch\r\n\nCapital s subsidiaries  statutory surplus as a regulatory, not an\r\n\naccounting, issue.   And, it may have  been a mistake for  E&amp;Y to\r\n\nrely  upon its own  internal collectibility analyses  (which were\r\n\nnot models of professional accounting competence).
