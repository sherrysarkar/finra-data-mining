Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Anthony Mazza on brief pro se.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Linda A. Wagner,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         March 4, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam.   The district court held that Anthony\n\nMazza's habeas petition was time-barred because the one year period\n\nof limitations, see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d), had expired prior to its\n\nfiling. The court's conclusion was based on its view that the\n\nlimitations period was not tolled during that fourteen month period\n\nbetween the state superior court's denial of Mazza's new trial\n\nmotion in December 1996 and Mazza's application for leave to appeal\n\nfiled in February 1998.\n\n           Two pertinent decisions have issued since this district\n\ncourt determination. In a prospective ruling, the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court held that a capital defendant must file his\n\napplication for leave to appeal within 30 days of the superior\n\ncourt's judgment. Mains v. Commonwealth, 433 Mass. 30, 37 n.10\n\n(2000). And, in Currie v. Matesanz, ___ F.3d ___, No. 01-1108,\n\n2002 WL 226925 (1st Cir. Feb. 19, 2002), we held that, in the case\n\nof a pre-Mains capital defendant in which there was no time limit\n\non the filing of an application for leave to appeal, a properly\n\nfiled application for state post-conviction review is \"pending\" for\n\npurposes of § 2244(d)(2) from the time it is filed in the state\n\nsuperior court until it is disposed of by an SJC single justice.\n\nSee Currie v. Matesanz, slip op. at 13.\n\n           This appeal is controlled by our decision in Currie. For\n\nMazza, this means that his motion for a new trial was pending for\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f purposes of § 2244(d)(2) from the time that he filed it in the\n\n superior court on May 1, 1995 until the SJC single justice denied\n\n it on August 4, 1998. Since the time during which a properly filed\n\n application for State post-conviction review is not counted towards\n\n the one year period of limitations, Mazza's one year period did not\n\n begin to run until August 5, 1998.     His filing of his federal\n\n habeas period petition on July 27, 1999 was within the one year\n\n period and thus was timely.1 We vacate the district court judgment\n\n of dismissal of September 28, 2000 and remand to the district\n\n court.\n\n            We note that the United States Supreme Court has granted\n\n certiorari in a case that may have some bearing on the issue\n\n presented here. See Saffold v. Newland, 250 F.3d 1262 (9th Cir.\n\n 2000), cert. granted sub nom Carey v. Saffold, 122 S. Ct. 393\n\n (2001). Our remand, of course, is without prejudice to either\n\n party raising and/or the district court considering the relevance,\n\n if any, of a forthcoming Supreme Court Saffold decision.\n\n            Appellant's motions for oral argument and appointment of\n\n counsel are denied.\n\n            Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n    1 Mazza certified that he mailed his habeas petition on July\n27, 1999. It was actually filed in the district court on August\n2, 1999. Even were we to take the August 2nd date as the filing\ndate, the habeas petition was timely.\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
