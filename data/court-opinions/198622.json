George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Richard Barrett on brief for appellant.\r\n   Merita A. Hopkins, Corporation Counsel, and Krisna M. Basu,\r\nAssistant Corporation Counsel, City of Boston Law Department, on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 2, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Appellant The Nationalist Movement\r\nappeals from the denial of its application, filed under 42\r\nU.S.C.  1988, for an award of attorney's fees for legal work\r\nperformed by Richard Barrett, Esq. and for certain costs\r\nincurred by Barrett during the course of the litigation below. \r\nThe Movement also requests that oral argument be waived.  We\r\ngrant this request and, after reviewing the record and the\r\nparties' briefs, find that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying the application for fees and costs.\r\n          1.  The language of Local Rule 83.5.3(b), which\r\ngoverns pro hac vice admissions in the Massachusetts district\r\ncourt, provides that \"[a]n attorney . . . may appear and\r\npractice in [the district] court in a particular case by leave\r\ngranted in the discretion of the court.\"  Under this rule, an\r\nattorney who lacks pro hac vice status may be viewed as being\r\non the same footing as a non-lawyer.  Such a layperson, of\r\ncourse, is not entitled to  1988 fees.  See Kay v. Ehrler, 499\r\nU.S. 432, 435 (1991).  Thus, an attorney like Barrett, who\r\nengages in legal activities without having been admitted pro\r\nhac vice, accepts the risk that if his or her application for\r\nadmission is denied,  1988 fees will not be forthcoming.\r\n          Further, we think that the decision to bar Barrett\r\nfrom representing the Movement in the case because of ethical\r\nconcerns is a sufficiently \"special circumstance\" to support\r\nthe denial of  1988 fees to Barrett.  That is, the purpose of\r\n 1988   \"to enable potential plaintiffs to obtain the\r\nassistance of competent counsel in vindicating their rights,\"\r\nKay, 499 U.S. at 436   would not be furthered by awarding fees\r\nto such an attorney.  In any event, the Movement was\r\nrepresented by qualified counsel during most of the litigation\r\nand the court awarded attorney's fees for the services these\r\nlawyers had provided.\r\n          2.  As for the Movement's  1988 request for certain\r\ncosts expended by Barrett, we affirm the district court's\r\ndenial of the request essentially for the reasons set out in\r\nthe court's Statement of Reasons, dated August 10, 1999.\r\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r\n",
