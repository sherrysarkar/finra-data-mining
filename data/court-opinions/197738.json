After experiencing financial  difficulties,\r\n\nGreen &amp; Freedman ceased to make the agreed-upon contributions\r\n\nand  transferred all remaining  assets to a  successor entity\r\n\nnamed Boston  Bakers, Inc.   The Fund  Manager of  the Health\r\n\nBenefits and Insurance  Fund (referred to hereinafter  as the\r\n\n\"Health Fund\") thereupon sued Green &amp; Freedman, Boston Bakers\r\n\nand the  two  corporations'  principals,  Richard  Elman  and\r\n\nStanley Elman, in the district  court to recover the payments\r\n\nowed by Green &amp; Freedman with interest, costs  and penalties.\r\n\n          Both  corporate defendants  conceded liability  for\r\n\nthe delinquent  contributions owed by Green &amp; Freedman to the\r\n\nHealth  Fund.     The  Elmans,  however,  denied   they  were\r\n\npersonally liable for these corporate debts, and a jury trial\r\n\ntook place to  determine that issue.   After the presentation\r\n\nof evidence, and before submission to the jury, the  district\r\n\ncourt entered judgment  as a matter  of law  in favor of  the\r\n\nElmans,  pursuant to Federal  Rule of Civil  Procedure 50(a).\r\n\nThe Health Fund appeals.   We affirm in  part and reverse  in\r\n\npart. \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nI.        Background\r                                \r\n\n          Defendant-Appellee Green &amp;  Freedman Baking Company\r\n\n(\"Green  &amp;  Freedman\")   was  a  family-owned   Massachusetts\r\n\ncorporation formed in 1934 that produced and sold baked goods\r\n\nuntil,  on  January  15,  1993,  its  remaining  assets  were\r\n\ntransferred  in bulk to Appellee Boston Bakers, Inc. (\"Boston\r\n\nBakers\").    Boston  Bakers  operated  essentially  the  same\r\n\nbusiness as Green &amp; Freedman until its demise in 1995.  \r\n\n          Starting  in  1975,  responsibility   for  Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's affairs  rested with  Defendants-Appellees Stanley\r\n\nElman  and Richard  Elman, grandsons  of one  of the  company\r\n\nfounders.  Stanley Elman started working for Green &amp; Freedman\r\n\nin  1959 and  by 1969  became its  treasurer and  a director,\r\n\npositions  he occupied through  the end of  the corporation's\r\n\nand  its successor's  existence.   Richard  Elman began  with\r\n\nGreen &amp;  Freedman in 1964 and  served as its President  and a\r\n\ndirector from 1975.  \r\n\n          Prior to  transferring its assets  to Boston Bakers\r\n\nas of January 15, 1993,  Green &amp; Freedman employed between 12\r\n\nand 18 truck  drivers who were members of  the Bakery Drivers\r\n\nand Helpers Local 494.   The union drivers' wages, hours, and\r\n\nconditions  of  employment  were  governed  by  a  collective\r\n\nbargaining  agreement between the Union and Green &amp; Freedman,\r\n\neffective from May 5,  1991 to May 1,  1994.  That  agreement\r\n\nrequired Green  &amp;  Freedman to  contribute $88  per week  for\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nevery  covered worker to the New England Teamsters and Baking\r\n\nIndustry  Health Benefits  and Insurance  Fund.   The  Health\r\n\nFund's  contractual  right to  contribution  was additionally\r\n\nprotected by   515 of the Employee Retirement Income Security\r\n\nAct (\"ERISA\"),  29 U.S.C.    1145 (1985),  which doubles  the\r\n\nobligation  of  any  employer who  promises  in  a collective\r\n\nbargaining agreement to make contributions to a multiemployer\r\n\nbenefits or pension plan.\r\n\n          From  1991, Green &amp;  Freedman began to  suffer what\r\n\nthe  Elmans   described   as  a   serious,   and   ultimately\r\n\nirreversible, decline  in sales  and profits.   Beginning  in\r\n\nApril  1992, and continuing until its business was terminated\r\n\nin  January 15,  1993, Green  &amp; Freedman  stopped making  its\r\n\nrequired  contributions  to   the  Health  Fund.     Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's  unpaid  contributions for  this  period, totaling\r\n\n$39,776, are  the  basis for  the liability  the Health  Fund\r\n\nseeks to impose in this action.\r\n\n          By  December  1992,  the  Elmans  had  decided   to\r\n\ntransfer all of  Green &amp; Freedman's assets to  a newly-formed\r\n\ncorporate shell entitled Boston Bakers, Inc., pursuant to the\r\n\nbulk  transfer  provisions   of  the  Massachusetts   Uniform\r\n\nCommercial Code.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106,    6-101 to 6-\r                                 \r\n\n110 (1990), repealed,  Mass. Acts 1996 ch. 160,    3 (1996).1\r                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Although  repealed  in  1996,  the  former  Massachusetts\r\nU.C.C. Article 6  still applies to bulk  transfers that, like\r\nthe  Boston Bakers transaction, occurred prior to the repeal.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          Boston  Bakers was simply a continuation of Green &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's  business.  Its  nominal and sole  shareholder was\r\n\nClaire  Lank, a long-time Green &amp; Freedman employee installed\r\n\nby  the  Elmans.   The  Elmans  were  designated as  the  new\r\n\ncorporation's  officers and, along  with their wives,  as its\r\n\ndirectors.   A voting trust  with Lank enabled the  Elmans to\r\n\ncontinue exercising  complete control  of Green  &amp; Freedman's\r\n\nassets, once transferred, in the form of Boston Bakers.\r\n\n          The bulk transfer shifted all of Green &amp; Freedman's\r\n\nassets,  which were then worth somewhere between $480,000 and\r\n\n$500,000,  to  Boston  Bakers.   In  exchange,  Boston Bakers\r\n\nassumed Green  &amp; Freedman's secured debt.   The secured debt,\r\n\nwhich totaled $498,498.17, was owed to two secured creditors:\r\n\nU.S.  Trust, the company's  institutional lender, and  the 75\r\n\nOld  Colony Avenue Realty Trust  (the \"Realty Trust\"), a real\r\n\nestate trust that owned the  company's plant for the  benefit\r\n\nof the Elmans.  U.S. Trust held a security interest in all of\r\n\nGreen &amp;  Freedman's property, both  then-owned and thereafter\r\n\nacquired, while  the  Realty Trust  held  a mortgage  on  the\r\n\nplant.  \r\n\n          As  part of the  bulk transfer, Boston  Bakers gave\r\n\nGreen &amp; Freedman a promissory  note, which Boston Bakers held\r\n\nfor  the benefit of  Green &amp; Freedman's  unsecured creditors,\r\n\nworth  $32,798.99.  That amount left the unsecured creditors,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nSee 1996 Mass. Acts ch. 160,   5.\r               \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nincluding the  Health Fund,  with claims  worth roughly  five\r\n\ncents on the dollar. \r\n\n          As  required by law,  Green &amp; Freedman,  after some\r\n\nhesitation,  announced the bulk transfer to creditors in late\r\n\nDecember 1992 and  provided a list of its assets.   See Mass.\r                                                                   \r\n\nGen. Laws  ch. 106,     6-104 to 6-106, repealed,  Mass. Acts\r                                                            \r\n\n1996  ch. 160,    3.   The Health Fund  responded by bringing\r\n\nthis  action in  the  federal district  court  which, in  its\r\n\ninitial form, sought,  inter alia,  a preliminary  injunction\r                                             \r\n\nagainst the transfer  of Green &amp; Freedman's  assets, alleging\r\n\nthe transfer to  violate ERISA   515,  29 U.S.C.   1145.   On\r\n\nJanuary  12,  1993,  the  district  court  denied  injunctive\r\n\nrelief.  Three days later, the bulk transfer was consummated.\r\n\n          Boston Bakers thereafter carried on business in the\r\n\nsame manner as Green &amp;  Freedman.  Employing the same workers\r\n\nand equipment at  the same plant, it produced  the same kinds\r\n\nof baked goods for the same customers.  Boston  Bakers was as\r\n\nunprofitable as Green &amp; Freedman.  After two-and-a-half years\r\n\nof  continued difficulties, U.S. Trust foreclosed, and Boston\r\n\nBakers closed its doors in August 1995.  According to Richard\r\n\nElman's  testimony, which  was not  contradicted, the  Elmans\r\n\npersonally received no distribution in settling the company's\r\n\naffairs.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          Following the liquidation of Boston Bakers' assets,\r\n\nthe  Health Fund filed an amended complaint2 seeking recovery\r\n\nof  the delinquent contributions  from both corporations, and\r\n\nfrom Richard  Elman and Stanley  Elman as well.   As Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman  had   done  previously,   Boston  Bakers   conceded\r\n\nliability  for the contributions  Green &amp; Freedman  failed to\r\n\nmake  to the  Health  Fund  from April  1992  until the  bulk\r\n\ntransfer on January 15, 1993.   With the assets of both Green\r\n\n&amp;  Freedman  and  Boston  Bakers completely  liquidated,  the\r\n\nHealth Fund looked  to the Elmans personally for  recovery of\r\n\nGreen &amp; Freedman's delinquent contributions.   Count 3 of the\r\n\nHealth Fund's  Second  Amended  Complaint  alleged  that  the\r\n\nElmans were personally  liable as the \"'alter  egos' of Green\r\n\nand  Freedman.\"    Count  4  premised  the  Elmans'  personal\r\n\nliability  on their  disregard for  Boston Bakers'  corporate\r\n\nidentity,  alleging  that  the Elmans  completely  controlled\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  An  amended complaint dated March 1, 1995, was superseded\r\nby a  Second Amended Complaint dated July  14, 1995.  In both\r\ncomplaints,  the  Health  Fund sought  recovery  for  Green &amp;\r\nFreedman's  defaulted  payments   due  under  the  collective\r\nbargaining  agreement  for  the  period  April  1992  through\r\nJanuary 15, 1993,  totaling $39,770,  exclusive of  interest,\r\ncosts and liquidated damages.  Recovery from Green &amp; Freedman\r\nwas sought under the contract,  and from Boston Bakers on the\r\ntheory  that, as  a  successor entity  to  Green &amp;  Freedman,\r\nBoston  Bakers was obligated to remit the latter's delinquent\r\ncontributions.  Recovery  from the two Elmans  personally was\r\nsought because  they were allegedly  \"alter egos\" of  Green &amp;\r\nFreedman,  and  because  they  allegedly  established  Boston\r\nBakers  with  fraudulent intent,  exercised  complete control\r\nover  it  (although  owning no  stock),  and  disregarded its\r\ncorporate identity.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nBoston  Bakers and created  it with fraudulent  intent.  Both\r\n\nparties requested a trial by jury.\r\n\n          At trial,  the  Health Fund  called Stanley  Elman,\r\n\nRichard  Elman,   and  Richard's  wife,   Barbara  Elman   as\r\n\nwitnesses.  Counsel for the Elmans declined cross-examination\r\n\nat  the time, planning to call  the Elmans later as their own\r\n\nwitnesses.   The Health  Fund also introduced  the deposition\r\n\ntestimony  of   Claire  Lank,  who  had  served  as  Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's secretary before being installed as Boston Bakers'\r\n\nnominal  shareholder.  In addition, the parties stipulated to\r\n\nthe  admission of  many  documents recording  the  collective\r\n\nbargaining  agreement, the creation of Boston Bakers, and the\r\n\noperation of Green &amp; Freedman. \r\n\n          At the  close of  the Health  Fund's case-in-chief,\r\n\nthe Elmans moved for  judgment in their favor as  a matter of\r\n\nlaw pursuant to  Rule 50(a).  The district  court granted the\r\n\nmotion  with respect to Count 3  and the liability of Green &amp;\r\n\nFreedman, ruling that the Health  Fund had failed to meet the\r\n\ncriteria  stated in  Alman v.  Danin,  801 F.2d  1 (1st  Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1986), for  corporate veil-piercing  in an  ERISA case.   The\r\n\ncourt left  open for the  time being the Health  Fund's claim\r\n\nthat the  Elmans were  personally liable  for Boston  Bakers'\r\n\nliability. \r\n\n          The defense then called as its only witness Richard\r\n\nElman,  who testified  about the  creation  and operation  of\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nBoston  Bakers.  The Elmans renewed their motion for judgment\r\n\nas a matter  of law.   Again relying  on Alman, the  district\r                                                          \r\n\ncourt allowed the motion.  \r\n\n          The  Health  Fund  now  appeals  from  the district\r\n\ncourt's grant of judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\nII.       Standard of Review\r                                        \r\n\n          To review a  grant of judgment as a  matter of law,\r\n\nwe stand in the district court's shoes and may affirm only if\r\n\nthe evidence did not furnish a  \"legally sufficient basis for\r\n\na reasonable jury to find\" for the non-moving party.  Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv.  P. 50(a)(1);  see  also Coyante  v.  Puerto Rico  Ports\r                                                                         \r\n\nAuth.,  105 F.3d  17,  21  (1st Cir.  1997).   This  standard\r                 \r\n\nrequires more than \"a mere scintilla\" of evidence in the non-\r\n\nmoving party's favor.   Fashion House, Inc. v.  K Mart Corp.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n892 F.2d  1076,  1088  (1st Cir.  1989).    Every  reasonable\r\n\ninference, however, must be drawn in favor  of the non-moving\r\n\nparty.   See Favorito v. Pannell,  27 F.3d 716, 719 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1994). \r\n\n          In the instant appeal, we must decide whether there\r\n\nwas a legally sufficient basis  in the evidence presented for\r\n\na reasonable jury to have  pierced the corporate veils and to\r\n\nhave imposed  personal liability  on the  two Elmans  for the\r\n\nconceded indebtedness to the Health Fund of both companies.\r\n\n          The legal standard  for when it is proper to pierce\r\n\nthe corporate  veil is notably  imprecise and fact-intensive.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nLeading commentators state that \"no  hard and fast rule as to\r\n\nthe  conditions under  which the  [corporate]  entity may  be\r\n\ndisregarded  can  be stated  as  they vary  according  to the\r\n\ncircumstances  of each case,\" William M. Fletcher, 1 Fletcher\r                                                                         \r\n\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corps.   41.30, at 662 (1990\r                                                   \r\n\nrev.   ed.),  and,  more  skeptically,  that  \"[t]here  is  a\r\n\nconsensus  that  the  whole area  of  limited  liability, and\r\n\nconversely of  piercing the corporate veil, is among the most\r\n\nconfusing in corporate law,\" Frank H.

We said in  Alman that courts\r                                                             \r\n\nshould  consider  \"the  respect  paid   by  the  shareholders\r\n\nthemselves  to   [the]  separate   corporate  identity;   the\r\n\nfraudulent  intent of  the  [individual defendants];  and the\r\n\ndegree of injustice that would be visited on the litigants by\r\n\nrecognizing the corporate  identity.\"  Alman, 801  F.2d at 4.\r                                                        \r\n\nOf these three elements, \"a finding of some fraudulent intent\r\n\nis a sine qua non to the  remedy's availability.\"  See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nElec.,  Radio  and  Machine Workers  v.  163  Pleasant Street\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1093 (1st Cir. 1992).  \r                 \r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n          Before  examining the  district court's  Rule 50(a)\r\n\nruling in  light of these  criteria, we need to  consider yet\r\n\nanother problem.   The ERISA cause of action  under which the\r\n\nHealth  Fund sued here, ERISA   515(a)(1)(3), authorizes only\r\n\ninjunctive or  \"other  appropriate  equitable  relief.\"    29\r                                                         \r\n\nU.S.C.      1132(a)(1)(3)  (emphasis  added).    Courts  have\r\n\ninterpreted this cause  of action as providing no  right to a\r\n\njury trial,  even when the  relief sought is monetary.   See,\r                                                                         \r\n\ne.g., Spinelli v. Gaughan, 12  F.3d 853, 855 (9th Cir. 1993).\r                                     \r\n\nAs a  result, Alman  and other federal  precedent were  bench\r                               \r\n\nproceedings in  which the judge  determined both the  law and\r\n\nthe  facts.   No  consideration  was  given to  the  separate\r\n\nresponsibilities of judge  and jury in the  applying of veil-\r\n\npiercing criteria.  \r\n\n          The  jury trial  here,  not  being  of  right,  was\r\n\nundertaken  by the judge  with the  consent of  both parties.\r\n\nFederal Rule  of Civil  Procedure 39(c),  allows  a judge  to\r\n\norder a  consensual jury trial  in actions not triable  as of\r\n\nright by a  jury.  In such  cases, the \"verdict has  the same\r\n\neffect as if trial by  jury had been a matter of right.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nAccordingly,  in reviewing  the district  court's Rule  50(a)\r\n\ndetermination, we are  supposed to apply the  same principles\r\n\nas if the jury  trial had been one  of right.  We must  do so\r\n\nhere,  however,  without  the  benefit  of   ERISA  precedent\r\n\ninstructing on whether, and to  what  degree, the jury rather\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nthan  the judge is  responsible for applying  the Alman veil-\r                                                                   \r\n\npiercing factors.  \r\n\n          While the absence of ERISA precedent on this aspect\r\n\nis somewhat troubling, we conclude that, in a consensual jury\r\n\ntrial, it  is principally the  jury's function,  and not  the\r\n\ncourt's, to  decide whether  or not  the Alman  veil-piercing\r                                                          \r\n\nstandards  were  met.    The  jury,  to  be  sure,  can  find\r\n\nindividual  liability  only  if  the  evidence  is  minimally\r\n\nsufficient  to  do  so under  Alman  criteria.   Whether  the\r                                               \r\n\nevidence reaches  that threshold is  a question of law.   But\r\n\ngiven the issue's fact-intensive nature, the legal  threshold\r\n\nof evidentiary sufficiency is a relatively low one.\r\n\n          In reaching the above conclusion, we are influenced\r\n\nby  the fact that federal courts,  outside the ERISA context,\r\n\nhave  held that veil-piercing  \"is the sort  of determination\r\n\nusually made by a jury because it is so fact specific.\"   Wm.\r                                                                         \r\n\nPassalacqua  Builders, Inc. v.

See, e.g., Smetherman v. Wilson,\r                                                                        \r\n\n626 So.2d 71,  73 (La. Ct.

This choice would be next to meaningless were\r\n\nwe  now to  hold that  the principal  contested issue  -- the\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nElmans' personal liability  -- remained one for the  court to\r\n\ndetermine.   Given a Rule  39(c) election to proceed  by jury\r\n\ntrial,  other courts  have held that  the district  court may\r\n\nrelegate all factual  determinations to the jury,  even those\r\n\nnormally  treated as equitable.

We  find\r\n\nample  evidence to  afford a  reasonable  jury, applying  the\r\n\nAlman  criteria,  801 F.2d  at  4, and  exercising  its broad\r                 \r\n\nauthority  over  the  veil-piercing issue,  supra,  a legally\r                                                             \r\n\nsufficient basis to reach beyond Green &amp; Freedman's corporate\r\n\nidentity and  hold the  Elmans liable  for the  corporation's\r\n\nunpaid contributions.  \r\n\n          A.   Fraudulent Intent\r                                            \r\n\n          As previously  noted, \"the cases  that permit  veil\r\n\npiercing in the ERISA milieu  all emphasize that a finding of\r\n\nsome  fraudulent intent  is a  sine qua  non to  the remedy's\r\n\navailability.\"   United Elec., Radio and Machine Workers, 960\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at  1093.  We explained in that  case that, in the ERISA\r\n\nveil-piercing  sense, fraud need  not reach the  level needed\r\n\nfor  criminal or even  independently actionable  civil fraud.\r\n\nStill, it has to be more than \"invisible.\"  Id. \r                                                           \r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n          There was  evidence that the Elmans,  through their\r\n\ndomination of  Green &amp;  Freedman, caused  the corporation  to\r\n\nmake  payments to  themselves and their  relatives at  a time\r\n\nwhen the  corporation was  known to be  failing and  could be\r\n\nexpected to  default,  or  was  already in  default,  on  its\r\n\nobligations  to the  Health Fund.   These  payments  could be\r\n\nfound  to lack  any  business  justification.    Courts  have\r\n\nroutinely viewed  the wrongful diversion of  corporate assets\r\n\nto  or  for  controlling  individuals  at  a  time  when  the\r\n\ncorporation  is in  financial distress  as  a fraud  that can\r\n\njustify  piercing the corporate  veil.

These checks dated from January 1991 to\r\n\nJanuary 1993,  a period  during which,  according to  Richard\r\n\nElman,  Green &amp;  Freedman \"was  in  trouble,\" \"los[ing]  some\r\n\nmoney,\"  and experiencing a  \"decline in profits  and sales.\"\r\n\nIn the  last few  months of this  period,   Green &amp;  Freedman\r\n\nceased to  be able  to pay its  debts including  its required\r\n\ncontributions to  the Health Fund.   It then  transferred its\r\n\nassets to Boston Bakers.\r\n\n          Meanwhile, the  Elmans had been  writing themselves\r\n\nand their relatives checks  for no business purpose that  the\r\n\nElmans could adequately  explain.  When questioned  about one\r\n\nof   these  payments,   Richard  Elman  testified   that  the\r\n\ncorporation was  repaying him  an unrecorded  loan --  itself\r\n\nevidence  weighing in favor  of piercing the  corporate veil,\r\n\nsee United States v.  Pisani, 646 F.2d 83, 88 (3d  Cir. 1981)\r                                        \r\n\n(piercing   corporate   veil  on   basis   of   repayment  of\r\n\nshareholders' loan at  time when corporation was  failing) --\r\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\nbefore stating that he could  not remember the purpose of the\r\n\npayment.  \r\n\n          Particularly  flagrant  was   the  evidence  of   a\r\n\npersonal  vacation that  the  Elmans financed  with corporate\r\n\nfunds.  In  January 1991, the Elmans caused  Green &amp; Freedman\r\n\nto pay for them to travel to New Orleans, where they attended\r\n\nthe  Super  Bowl.    On  direct  examination,  Stanley  Elman\r\n\ntestified that  the checks  in question  represented \"payment\r\n\nfor expenses and conducting business.\"  On cross-examination,\r\n\nhowever,  Stanley Elman admitted that Green &amp; Freedman had no\r\n\ncustomers in Louisiana and did no business in connection with\r\n\nthe  Super  Bowl.    Nothing  in  Stanley  Elman's  testimony\r\n\nrehabilitated his initial claim that he conducted business on\r\n\nthe Super Bowl trip.  \r\n\n          In  addition, the Elmans caused Green &amp; Freedman to\r\n\npay Eleanor Elman, Stanley Elman's  wife, three checks for  a\r\n\ntotal of  $4,500.   Stanley Elman  initially explained  these\r\n\npayments as wages.   However, the Elmans did  not report this\r\n\namount on  their tax  return and there  was no  evidence that\r\n\nGreen &amp;  Freedman reported  it as wages.   Moreover,  Green &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's receptionist, Claire Lank,  testified that Eleanor\r\n\nElman did not work at Green &amp; Freedman during 1992.\r\n\n          Finally, just days before Green &amp; Freedman executed\r\n\nthe bulk transfer to  Boston Bakers, and at  a time when  the\r\n\ncompany had  ceased  to meet  its obligations  to the  Health\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nFund,  the  Elmans   caused  the  corporation  to   write  an\r\n\nunexplained check  for cash in  the amount of $10,000,  and a\r\n\nsecond check payable to Stanley Elman for $2,500.  \r\n\n          The payments made by Green &amp; Freedman to the Elmans\r\n\nand their  relatives during 1991  and 1992  with no  apparent\r\n\nbusiness justification amounted to $30,109.  In ruling on the\r\n\nElmans' Rule 50(a) motion, the district court was required to\r\n\ndraw all reasonable inferences and resolve credibility issues\r\n\nin favor of  the non-movant Health  Fund.  Looked at  in this\r\n\nlight,   the  evidence  was  sufficient  to  support  a  jury\r\n\ndetermination  that the Elmans  had used corporate  funds for\r\n\npersonal  purposes at  times when they  knew either  that the\r\n\ncompany was inadequately capitalized to meet its obligations,\r\n\nor  that,  in  fact,  it had  stopped  doing  so  --  and, in\r\n\nparticular,  had ceased to  pay its Health  Fund obligations.\r\n\nWe add  that the jury's  ability to conclude that  the Elmans\r\n\nhad acted  in a knowingly  fraudulent manner would  have been\r\n\nbolstered by  inconsistencies in the  Elmans' testimony about\r\n\nthe payments,  particularly their  testimony  that the  Super\r\n\nBowl trip and Eleanor Elman's \"wages\" had business purposes.\r\n\n          The  Elmans protest  that  the  amount of  arguable\r\n\nself-dealing evidenced  at trial  was too  little to  justify\r\n\nsending the Health Fund's case to the jury.  The Elmans point\r\n\nout  that the payments described  above amounted to less than\r\n\none percent of the corporation's gross annual sales, and that\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\nthe trip to New Orleans was, after all, only one trip.  While\r\n\nit  is  difficult to  quantify  nicely  the amount  of  fraud\r\n\nrequired,  the  Elmans's  self-dealing  occurred  on  several\r\n\noccasions,  at  a time  when  the  company was  in  financial\r\n\nstraits.   We cannot  say that this  conduct and  the amounts\r\n\ninvolved were  de minimis,  to the  point that no  reasonable\r\n\njury could find that the fraudulent intent prong of the Alman\r                                                                         \r\n\nstandard was established.\r\n\n          B.   Disregard of Corporate Identity\r                                                          \r\n\n          The  fraudulent  self-dealing  just  discussed  was\r\n\nprobative not only  of fraudulent intent but  also of another\r\n\nAlman  element,  disregard  of corporate  identity.    On the\r                 \r\n\nlatter  score, there was  additional evidence.   For example,\r\n\nthe Elmans appear to have mixed their own finances with those\r\n\nof Green &amp;  Freedman's.  At a  time that the Elmans  owed the\r\n\ncorporation $141,000 in  loans, they also loaned  it $170,000\r\n\nthrough  their real estate trust.  These unexplained dealings\r\n\nsuggest that money  was being moved around with  little or no\r\n\nregard for  the corporate identity.   There was no  record of\r\n\nthe  terms of  the purported  loans nor  of any  agreement to\r\n\nrepay.  Undocumented  and interest-free loans could  be found\r\n\nto  show a  disregard for  the  corporate form.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUriarte, 736 F.2d  at 524 (treating unrecorded  and interest-\r                   \r\n\nfree loans from  shareholders to the corporation  as evidence\r\n\nof shareholders' disrespect for corporate form).  \r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\n          Beyond the  undocumented loans, there  was evidence\r\n\nof  inadequate and, indeed,  fraudulent record keeping.   The\r\n\nElmans admittedly  falsified  Green &amp;  Freedman's minutes  to\r\n\nstate  that their  wives, who  served  as nominal  directors,\r\n\nattended and  authorized corporate  borrowing,  when in  fact\r\n\ntheir wives did neither.  \r\n\n          We accept  the Elmans'  contention that  a closely-\r\n\nheld corporation need not hew to every corporate formality in\r\n\norder  to  maintain  its  shareholders'   immunity  from  the\r\n\ncorporation's debts.    A veil-piercing  plaintiff  will  not\r\n\nprevail  if the  evidence shows  only  that the  closely-held\r\n\ndefendant  corporation was run without the strict formalities\r\n\nof its publicly-held  counterpart.  But the  evidence adduced\r\n\nat trial, viewed most favorably  to the Health Fund, could be\r\n\nfound  to show practices that went beyond mere informalities.\r\n\nImportant  transactions  between   the  corporation  and  its\r\n\ncontrolling  shareholders  went  undefined,  and  the  Elmans\r\n\nappear  to  have created  false minutes.   These  facts, when\r\n\nadded  to the  financial self-dealing  and  when viewed  in a\r\n\nlight most favorable to the Health Fund, support a reasonable\r\n\ninference by a  jury that the Elmans, in the two years before\r\n\nGreen &amp; Freedman's demise, did  not treat Green &amp; Freedman as\r\n\na separate entity.  \r\n\n          C.   Manifest Injustice\r                                             \r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\n          The  evidence just  described under  the first  two\r\n\nAlman factors could also allow  a reasonable jury to conclude\r                 \r\n\nthat  sheltering the Elmans from Green &amp; Freedman's liability\r\n\nto  the Health  Fund  would  be manifestly  unjust.   As  one\r\n\ncommentator has explained,  courts have found this  prong met\r\n\nwhen \"a corporation  is so undercapitalized that it is unable\r\n\nto meet debts that may reasonably be expected to arise in the\r\n\nnormal course of business.\"  Note, Piercing the Corporate Law\r                                                                         \r\n\nVeil:   The Alter Ego  Doctrine Under Federal Common  Law, 95\r                                                                     \r\n\nHarv.  L. Rev. 853,  855 (1982).   Thus, a jury  would not be\r\n\nunreasonable  in viewing  as  manifestly unjust  the  Elmans'\r\n\ndecision  to  issue themselves  payments  for personal,  non-\r\n\ncorporate purposes, as well as other unexplained payments, at\r\n\na time when the corporation could not meet its obligations to\r\n\nthe  Health Fund.  Of course, the mere non-payment of debt is\r\n\nnot,  by itself,  enough to  justify  piercing the  corporate\r\n\nveil.  However, a jury could reasonably conclude on the basis\r\n\nof  the  evidence below  that  the Elmans  both  placed their\r\n\npersonal    interests    ahead   of    their    corporation's\r\n\nresponsibilities  and   did  not  themselves  honor  Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's corporate form.  As  a result, it could be thought\r\n\nmanifestly  unjust  to   insist  that  the  Health   Fund  be\r\n\nrestricted by the corporate form.\r\n\nIV.       Piercing the Corporate Veil:  Boston Bakers\r                                                                 \r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\n          Whether  the evidence sufficed  for a jury  to find\r\n\nthe Elmans personally liable for Boston Bakers' successorship\r\n\nobligation  to pay Green &amp; Freedman's indebtedness for Health\r\n\nFund  contributions missed  in  April 1992,  through  January\r\n\n1993,  is  more  problematic.   Given  the  Elmans' potential\r\n\ndirect liability, supra, for Green &amp; Freedman's debts on this\r                                   \r\n\nscore, the question of their tangential exposure for the same\r\n\ndebt via Boston Bakers  may seem more theoretical than  real.\r\n\nStill, the court's ruling on  count 4 of the complaint raises\r\n\nthe issue, and we must address it.\r\n\n          For  the showing of  fraud needed to  pierce Boston\r\n\nBakers' corporate  veil, the  Health Fund  relies inter  alia\r\n\nupon the  Elmans' transfer  of Green  &amp; Freedman's  assets to\r\n\nBoston   Bakers,  a   transaction  said   to  be   inherently\r\n\nfraudulent.   Yet we can  see nothing in the  transfer itself\r\n\nthat further disadvantaged the Health Fund in  its ability to\r\n\nrealize   its   claim   for   Green   &amp;   Freedman's   unpaid\r\n\ncontributions.           Had the Elmans chosen simply to shut\r\n\ndown  the  operations of  Green  &amp;  Freedman  in early  1993,\r\n\ninstead of undertaking the bulk  transfer to Boston Bakers, a\r\n\njury would have  to conclude that the Health  Fund would have\r\n\nreceived nothing.  At  the time of the bulk transfer,  it was\r\n\nundisputed that Green  &amp; Freedman had no more  than $2,000 in\r\n\ncash  on  hand,  and liabilities  to  secured  creditors that\r                                                         \r\n\noutweighed  its assets.  The firm's primary secured creditor,\r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\nU.S.  Trust, held  a  security  interest in  all  of Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's  assets.   Once  a  debtor  grants  an  all-assets\r\n\nsecurity  interest, unsecured creditors  like the Health Fund\r\n\nare  made no worse off  by a bulk  transfer:  the transferred\r\n\nassets were already  encumbered and therefore  unavailable to\r\n\nthe Health Fund regardless of the bulk transfer.\r\n\n          We  note   that  neither  in  its   second  amended\r\n\ncomplaint  nor in  arguments on  appeal, has the  Health Fund\r\n\nclaimed  that Boston Bakers, as Green &amp; Freedman's successor,\r\n\nwas liable under the latter's collective  bargaining contract\r\n\nfor  payments  after  January  15, 1993,  the  date  Green  &amp;\r                                \r\n\nFreedman shut  down.  Rather  the damages sought are  for the\r\n\nperiod from  April 1992,  until January  15, 1993,  being all\r\n\nbased on  defaulted contributions  owed by  Green &amp;  Freedman\r\n\nwhile it was  still operating.   Boston Bakers' liability  is\r\n\npremised  solely  on its  inherited responsibility  for these\r\n\nearlier  debts of  its predecessor.    As said,  had Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman simply shut  down on  January 15,  1993, the  Health\r\n\nFund would  apparently have been  no better off.   (It might,\r\n\narguably,  have  been  worse off.)    Plaintiff  propounds no\r\n\nconcrete  theory  as   to  how  the  bulk   transfer  further\r\n\ndiminished  its prospects  for recovering  the  sums owed  by\r\n\nGreen &amp; Freedman between April 1992 and January 15, 1993.\r\n\n          It is  significant  that, from  the outset,  Boston\r\n\nBakers continued openly  to carry on the  business of Green &amp;\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\nFreedman.    Lank,  Boston Bakers'  nominal  shareholder  and\r\n\nreceptionist, even continued  to answer the phone  \"Green and\r\n\nFreedman\" after the bulk sale.  A company does not extinguish\r\n\nits  ERISA obligations  simply by  changing the  name on  its\r\n\nletterhead.   See  Hawaii Carpenters  Trust  Funds v.  Waiola\r                                                                         \r\n\nCarpenter  Shop,  Inc., 823  F.2d  289, 294  (9th  Cir. 1987)\r                                  \r\n\n(holding  that alter ego  test is  met when  two corporations\r\n\nshare a  \"substantial continuity\"); cf. Guzman  v. MRM/ELGIN,\r                                                                        \r\n\n409  Mass. 563, 566  (1991) (explaining exception  to general\r\n\nrule of  successor non-liability  for a  transferee that  \"is\r\n\nmerely a  continuation of  the seller  corporation\").   Thus,\r\n\nBoston Bakers  was  available  throughout  its  existence  to\r\n\nanswer for the liabilities of its predecessor.\r\n\n          At trial, the  Health Fund produced no  evidence as\r\n\nto  how the  bulk transfer  worked to  its disadvantage.   As\r\n\nRichard Elman's uncontradicted testimony put  it, by December\r\n\n1992,  Green &amp; Freedman was in  such dire straits that it had\r\n\nto choose between liquidation and reorganization.  The Elmans\r\n\nchose the  latter  course,  and  undertook  a  reorganization\r\n\nthrough the bulk transfer.  \r\n\n          Further undercutting the  contention that the  mere\r\n\nfact of the bulk transfer demonstrates the Elmans' fraudulent\r\n\nintent is  the fact that  they did not conceal  the transfer.\r\n\nAs  required  by  statute,  Green  &amp;  Freedman  notified  its\r\n\ncreditors, including  the Health Fund,  before executing  the\r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n\nbulk  transfer.   The district  court  thereafter denied  the\r\n\nHealth Fund's motion  to enjoin the transfer,  an action from\r\n\nwhich no appeal was taken.\r\n\n          We are  thus unable to  find, on this  record, that\r\n\nthe   bulk  transfer  provided  the  Elmans  with  an  unfair\r\n\nadvantage,  amounting  to  a fraud,  material  to  the Health\r\n\nFund's  current claim.   Under Alman, fraudulent  intent is a\r                                                \r\n\nnecessary element in  order to piece the corporate  veil.  We\r\n\ndo not think a jury  could properly derive a relevant finding\r\n\nof  fraudulent intent material  to the harm  alleged from the\r\n\ntransfer  by itself.   See  United Elec.,  Radio and  Machine\r                                                                         \r\n\nWorkers,  960  F.2d   at  1094  (approving  \"good   faith  if\r                   \r\n\nultimately  unsuccessful  attempt  to  resurrect  a  moribund\r\n\ncompany\"); Laborers  Clean-Up Contract  Admin. Trust  Fund v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUriarte Clean-Up  Serv., Inc.,  736 F.2d  516, 525 (9th  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1984)  (noting  difference  between  a corporation  that  was\r\n\nunable  to pay its debts from  the outset and one that simply\r\n\n\"fell upon bad times\").  \r\n\n          Besides the fact  of the bulk transfer,  the Health\r\n\nFund points to other factors as a supposed basis for piercing\r\n\nBoston Bakers'  veil.  In  its complaint it alleged  that the\r\n\nnominal and sole  shareholder, Claire Lank, was  \"unaware\" of\r\n\nher  obligations and rights as a  shareholder and, instead of\r\n\nfollowing  her  independent  judgment,  followed the  Elmans'\r\n\ninstructions.   Also alleged was the Elmans' complete control\r\n\n                             -26-\r\r\n\nover  Boston Bakers,  even though  they  owned no  stock; the\r\n\nElmans'   disregard   of   corporate   identity;   and    the\r\n\nincorporation of Boston Bakers with fraudulent intent.  These\r\n\nallegations, however,  to the extent  legally material,  must\r\n\nstand  or  fall  on  the  existence in  the  record  of  some\r\n\nsupporting   evidence.      Moreover,   proof  of   corporate\r\n\ninformalities, standing  alone, are insufficient.   Plaintiff\r\n\nmay  not prevail without  some evidence of  fraudulent intent\r\n\nmaterial to the harm suffered.  \r                                         \r\n\n          There  is no evidence  of financial self-dealing in\r\n\nthe  case of  Boston Bakers  such  as occurred  with Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman.  None  of the checks introduced by  the Health Fund\r\n\nas  payable to  or for  the Elmans  came from  Boston Bakers'\r\n\naccounts.\r\n\n          In respect to the  claimed \"undercapitalization\" of\r\n\nBoston  Bakers, all the  latter's capital came  from the bulk\r\n\ntransfer; there was  no unmet agreement by the  Elmans to add\r\n\nmore, nor  evidence that,  after transfer  to Boston  Bakers,\r\n\nthey diverted the bulk transfer funds to personal objectives.\r\n\nThe mere  fact that  Boston Bakers  eventually failed  or had\r\n\nless  capital than  needed is  not a  basis for  reaching the\r\n\nElmans personally, absent fraud.\r\n\n          Much  is  made  of  the  fact  that  Richard  Elman\r\n\nindicated  ignorance as  to how  he was  named  president and\r\n\n                             -27-\r\r\n\ndirector of Boston  Bakers3 or whether Boston Bakers  held an\r\n\nannual  shareholders'  meeting.    Stanley  Elman  failed  to\r\n\nrecognize  the firm's  stock  ledger.    And Lank,  the  sole\r\n\nshareholder, appears  to have  been a  straw for  the Elmans,\r\n\nallegedly so as to make it harder for creditors to reach them\r\n\npersonally.     None  of  these  items,  however,  singly  or\r\n\ntogether, provide  a sufficient  evidentiary basis  to pierce\r\n\nthe  corporate  veil.   While  they  may  suggest a  lack  of\r\n\nattention  to  corporate  formalities,  they do  not  reflect\r\n\nfraudulent intent  material to  the harm alleged,  nor is  it\r\n\nclear  how  any  of them,  even  slightly,  disadvantaged the\r\n\nplaintiff.\r\n\n          There  was also evidence that the Elmans' wives did\r\n\nnot know  they were directors;  did not participate  in board\r\n\nmeetings, although corporate  records falsely indicated  they\r\n\ndid; and  did not  know that Lank  was the  sole stockholder.\r\n\nBut  these  snippets  do  little  to  demonstrate  more  than\r\n\ncorporate informality.   Even if the false  corporate records\r\n\nconcerning the wives'  attendance at directors'  meetings are\r\n\ncharacterized as a  \"fraud,\" there is no  evidence the Health\r\n\nFund knew or  relied on this information to  its detriment or\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   Q:   And would you acknowledge, sir, that you don't know\r\n          by  what authority you  were elected a  director of\r\n          Boston Bakers?\r\n     A:   The attorneys set up the corporation.  I don't know\r\n          the direction.    I  know I  was  an  officer,  the\r\n          president.\r\n\n                             -28-\r\r\n\nsustained any injury  whatever as a result.   The \"fraudulent\r\n\nintent  of  the  individual  defendants\" mentioned  in  Alman\r                                                                         \r\n\nrequires some meaningful relationship between the  intent and\r\n\nthe harm visited upon plaintiff.  We add that even the Health\r\n\nFund  itself does  not  argue that  the incorrect  records by\r\n\nthemselves show fraudulent intent sufficient under Alman.\r                                                                    \r\n\n          We  conclude that the district court was correct in\r\n\ngranting the Elmans'  motion for judgment as a  matter of law\r\n\nwith  respect to the  Elmans' alleged personal  liability for\r\n\nBoston  Bakers' corporate  obligation to  make  good Green  &amp;\r\n\nFreedman's delinquent payments to the Health Fund.\r\n\nV.

After experiencing financial difficulties, Green &amp; Freedman ceased to make the agreed-upon contributions and transferred all remaining assets to a successor entity named Boston Bakers, Inc. The Fund Manager of the Health Benefits and Insurance Fund (referred to hereinafter as the \"Health Fund\") thereupon sued Green &amp; Freedman, Boston Bakers and the two corporations' principals, Richard Elman and Stanley Elman, in the district court to recover the payments owed by Green &amp; Freedman with interest, costs and penalties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both corporate defendants conceded liability for the delinquent contributions owed by Green &amp; Freedman to the Health Fund.  The Elmans, however, denied they were personally liable for these corporate debts, and a jury trial took place to determine that issue.  After the presentation of evidence, and before submission to the jury, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Elmans, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a).  The Health Fund appeals.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-Appellee Green &amp; Freedman Baking Company (\"Green &amp; Freedman\") was a family-owned Massachusetts corporation formed in 1934 that produced and sold baked goods until, on January 15, 1993, its remaining assets were transferred in bulk to Appellee Boston Bakers, Inc.  (\"Boston Bakers\").  Boston Bakers operated essentially the same business as Green &amp; Freedman until its demise in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting in 1975, responsibility for Green &amp; Freedman's affairs rested with Defendants-Appellees Stanley Elman and Richard Elman, grandsons of one of the company founders.  Stanley Elman started working for Green &amp; Freedman in 1959 and by 1969 became its treasurer and a director, positions he occupied through the end of the corporation's and its successor's existence.  Richard Elman began with Green &amp; Freedman in 1964 and served as its President and a director from 1975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to transferring its assets to Boston Bakers as of January 15, 1993, Green &amp; Freedman employed between 12 and 18 truck drivers who were members of the Bakery Drivers and Helpers Local 494.  The union drivers' wages, hours, and conditions of employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and Green &amp; Freedman, effective from May 5, 1991 to May 1, 1994.  That agreement required Green &amp; Freedman to contribute $88 per week for every covered worker to the New England Teamsters and Baking Industry Health Benefits and Insurance Fund.  The Health Fund's contractual right to contribution was additionally protected by &#167; 515 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1145 (1985), which doubles the obligation of any employer who promises in a collective bargaining agreement to make contributions to a multiemployer benefits or pension plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1991, Green &amp; Freedman began to suffer what the Elmans described as a serious, and ultimately irreversible, decline in sales and profits.  Beginning in April 1992, and continuing until its business was terminated in January 15, 1993, Green &amp; Freedman stopped making its required contributions to the Health Fund.  Green &amp; Freedman's unpaid contributions for this period, totaling $39,776, are the basis for the liability the Health Fund seeks to impose in this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By December 1992, the Elmans had decided to transfer all of Green &amp; Freedman's assets to a newly-formed corporate shell entitled Boston Bakers, Inc., pursuant to the bulk transfer provisions of the Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 106, &#167;&#167; 6-101 to 6-110 (1990), repealed, Mass.  Acts 1996 ch. 160, &#167; 3 (1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston Bakers was simply a continuation of Green &amp; Freedman's business.  Its nominal and sole shareholder was Claire Lank, a long-time Green &amp; Freedman employee installed by the Elmans.  The Elmans were designated as the new corporation's officers and, along with their wives, as its directors.  A voting trust with Lank enabled the Elmans to continue exercising complete control of Green &amp; Freedman's assets, once transferred, in the form of Boston Bakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk transfer shifted all of Green &amp; Freedman's assets, which were then worth somewhere between $480,000 and $500,000, to Boston Bakers.  In exchange, Boston Bakers assumed Green &amp; Freedman's secured debt.  The secured debt, which totaled $498,498.17, was owed to two secured creditors:  U.S. Trust, the company's institutional lender, and the 75 Old Colony Avenue Realty Trust (the \"Realty Trust\"), a real estate trust that owned the company's plant for the benefit of the Elmans.  U.S. Trust held a security interest in all of Green &amp; Freedman's property, both then-owned and thereafter acquired, while the Realty Trust held a mortgage on the plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the bulk transfer, Boston Bakers gave Green &amp; Freedman a promissory note, which Boston Bakers held for the benefit of Green &amp; Freedman's unsecured creditors, worth $32,798.99.  That amount left the unsecured creditors, including the Health Fund, with claims worth roughly five cents on the dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As required by law, Green &amp; Freedman, after some hesitation, announced the bulk transfer to creditors in late December 1992 and provided a list of its assets.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 106, &#167;&#167; 6-104 to 6-106, repealed, Mass.  Acts 1996 ch. 160, &#167; 3. The Health Fund responded by bringing this action in the federal district court which, in its initial form, sought, inter alia, a preliminary injunction against the transfer of Green &amp; Freedman's assets, alleging the transfer to violate ERISA &#167; 515, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1145.  On January 12, 1993, the district court denied injunctive relief.  Three days later, the bulk transfer was consummated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston Bakers thereafter carried on business in the same manner as Green &amp; Freedman.  Employing the same workers and equipment at the same plant, it produced the same kinds of baked goods for the same customers.  Boston Bakers was as unprofitable as Green &amp; Freedman.  After two-and-a-half years of continued difficulties, U.S. Trust foreclosed, and Boston Bakers closed its doors in August 1995.  According to Richard Elman's testimony, which was not contradicted, the Elmans personally received no distribution in settling the company's affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the liquidation of Boston Bakers' assets, the Health Fund filed an amended complaint<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> seeking recovery of the delinquent contributions from both corporations, and from Richard Elman and Stanley Elman as well.  As Green &amp; Freedman had done previously, Boston Bakers conceded liability for the contributions Green &amp; Freedman failed to make to the Health Fund from April 1992 until the bulk transfer on January 15, 1993.  With the assets of both Green &amp; Freedman and Boston Bakers completely liquidated, the Health Fund looked to the Elmans personally for recovery of Green &amp; Freedman's delinquent contributions.  Count 3 of the Health Fund's Second Amended Complaint alleged that the Elmans were personally liable as the \" 'alter egos' of Green and Freedman.\"   Count 4 premised the Elmans' personal liability on their disregard for Boston Bakers' corporate identity, alleging that the Elmans completely controlled Boston Bakers and created it with fraudulent intent.  Both parties requested a trial by jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Health Fund called Stanley Elman, Richard Elman, and Richard's wife, Barbara Elman as witnesses.  Counsel for the Elmans declined cross-examination at the time, planning to call the Elmans later as their own witnesses.  The Health Fund also introduced the deposition testimony of Claire Lank, who had served as Green &amp; Freedman's secretary before being installed as Boston Bakers' nominal shareholder.  In addition, the parties stipulated to the admission of many documents recording the collective bargaining agreement, the creation of Boston Bakers, and the operation of Green &amp; Freedman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the Health Fund's case-in-chief, the Elmans moved for judgment in their favor as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a).  The district court granted the motion with respect to Count 3 and the liability of Green &amp; Freedman, ruling that the Health Fund had failed to meet the criteria stated in Alman v. Danin, 801 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1986), for corporate veil-piercing in an ERISA case.  The court left open for the time being the Health Fund's claim that the Elmans were personally liable for Boston Bakers' liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense then called as its only witness Richard Elman, who testified about the creation and operation of Boston Bakers.  The Elmans renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Again relying on Alman, the district court allowed the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Health Fund now appeals from the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To review a grant of judgment as a matter of law, we stand in the district court's shoes and may affirm only if the evidence did not furnish a \"legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find\" for the non-moving party.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1);  see also Coyante v. Puerto Rico Ports Auth., 105 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1997).  This standard requires more than \"a mere scintilla\" of evidence in the non-moving party's favor.  Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1088 (1st Cir.1989).  Every reasonable inference, however, must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.  See Favorito v. Pannell, 27 F.3d 716, 719 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant appeal, we must decide whether there was a legally sufficient basis in the evidence presented for a reasonable jury to have pierced the corporate veils and to have imposed personal liability on the two Elmans for the conceded indebtedness to the Health Fund of both companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal standard for when it is proper to pierce the corporate veil is notably imprecise and fact-intensive.  Leading commentators state that \"no hard and fast rule as to the conditions under which the [corporate] entity may be disregarded can be stated as they vary according to the circumstances of each case,\" William M. Fletcher, 1 Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corps. &#167; 41.30, at 662 (1990 rev. ed.), and, more skeptically, that \"[t]here is a consensus that the whole area of limited liability, and conversely of piercing the corporate veil, is among the most confusing in corporate law,\" Frank H. Easterbrook &amp; Daniel R. Fischel, Limited Liability and the Corporation, 52 U. Chi.  L.Rev. 89, 89 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because a rigid test could not account for all the factual variety, the federal common law standard adopted in our Circuit for measuring an ERISA plaintiff's veil-piercing claim is somewhat open-ended.  We said in Alman that courts should consider \"the respect paid by the shareholders themselves to [the] separate corporate identity;  the fraudulent intent of the [individual defendants];  and the degree of injustice that would be visited on the litigants by recognizing the corporate identity.\"  Alman, 801 F.2d at 4. Of these three elements, \"a finding of some fraudulent intent is a sine qua non to the remedy's availability.\"   See United Elec., Radio and Machine Workers v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1093 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before examining the district court's Rule 50(a) ruling in light of these criteria, we need to consider yet another problem.  The ERISA cause of action under which the Health Fund sued here, ERISA &#167; 502(a)(1), (3), authorizes only injunctive or \"other appropriate equitable relief.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1), (3) (emphasis added).  Courts have interpreted this cause of action as providing no right to a jury trial, even when the relief sought is monetary.  See, e.g., Spinelli v. Gaughan, 12 F.3d 853, 855 (9th Cir.1993).  As a result, Alman and other federal precedent were bench proceedings in which the judge determined both the law and the facts.  No consideration was given to the separate responsibilities of judge and jury in the applying of veil-piercing criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury trial here, not being of right, was undertaken by the judge with the consent of both parties.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c), allows a judge to order a consensual jury trial in actions not triable as of right by a jury.  In such cases, the \"verdict has the same effect as if trial by jury had been a matter of right.\"  Id. Accordingly, in reviewing the district court's Rule 50(a) determination, we are supposed to apply the same principles as if the jury trial had been one of right.  We must do so here, however, without the benefit of ERISA precedent instructing on whether, and to what degree, the jury rather than the judge is responsible for applying the Alman veil-piercing factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the absence of ERISA precedent on this aspect is somewhat troubling, we conclude that, in a consensual jury trial, it is principally the jury's function, and not the court's, to decide whether or not the Alman veil-piercing standards were met.  The jury, to be sure, can find individual liability only if the evidence is minimally sufficient to do so under Alman criteria.  Whether the evidence reaches that threshold is a question of law.  But given the issue's fact-intensive nature, the legal threshold of evidentiary sufficiency is a relatively low one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the above conclusion, we are influenced by the fact that federal courts, outside the ERISA context, have held that veil-piercing \"is the sort of determination usually made by a jury because it is so fact specific.\"  Wm. Passalacqua Builders, Inc. v. Resnick Developers S., Inc., 933 F.2d 131, 137 (2d Cir.1991);  see also FMC Finance Corp. v. Murphree, 632 F.2d 413, 421 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that, as a matter of federal procedure in diversity cases, \"the issue of corporate entity disregard is one for the jury\").  Most state courts adopt a similar approach.  See, e.g., Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. v. Checkers, Inc., 754 F.2d 10, 14 (1st Cir.1985)(applying Massachusetts law);  Castleberry v. Branscum, 721 S.W.2d 270, 277 (Tex.1986) (treating veil-piercing as factual and, therefore, jury question).  Courts in these jurisdictions have emphasized that \"[t]he conditions under which the corporate entity will be disregarded vary according to the circumstances present in each case.\"  Electric Power Bd. v. St. Joseph Valley Structural Steel Corp., 691 S.W.2d 522, 526 (Tenn.1985).  Even where veil-piercing is decided by judge rather than jury, the courts have held that the question, while equitable, is one of fact.  See, e.g., Smetherman v. Wilson, 626 So.2d 71, 73 (La.Ct.App.1993) (explaining that trial judge decides whether to pierce corporate veil after examining the \"totality of the circumstances\").  Indeed, in Alman we reviewed the district court's determinations that the individual defendants \"had acted in bad faith\" and \"had not respected [corporation's] separate existence even minimally\" as \"inferences\" subject to the clearly-erroneous review accorded issues of fact.  801 F.2d at 4;  see also Pipe Fitters Health and Welfare Trust v. Waldo, R., Inc., 969 F.2d 718, 721 (8th Cir.1992) (reviewing ERISA veil-piercing decision for clear error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assigning veil-piercing here largely to the jury, we are also influenced by the fact that, although entitled to a bench trial, the parties agreed to proceed before a jury.  This choice would be next to meaningless were we now to hold that the principal contested issue--the Elmans' personal liability--remained one for the court to determine.  Given a Rule 39(c) election to proceed by jury trial, other courts have held that the district court may relegate all factual determinations to the jury, even those normally treated as equitable.  See, e.g., Gloria v. Valley Grain Prods., Inc., 72 F.3d 497, 499 (5th Cir.1996);  Thompson v. Parkes, 963 F.2d 885, 888 (6th Cir.1992);  cf.  McCain Foods, Inc. v. St. Pierre, 463 A.2d 785, 787 (Me.1983)(holding that veil-piercing, while normally in Maine a matter for the court, was properly submitted to jury under a state rule parallel to Fed.  R. Civ. P. 39(c)).  The point of Rule 39(c)'s jury-by-consent provision has been said to be to allow parties who so wish to have disputed facts, including ultimate facts, resolved by a jury.  See generally 9 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2333 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the veil-piercing determination is principally for the jury to make, we shall affirm the district court's grant of judgment for the individual defendants only, as previously noted, if we determine there was no \"legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find\" for the plaintiff Health Fund.  (Our review standard would obviously be different were veil-piercing regarded as a legal issue relegated to the judge even in a jury trial.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the evidence presented below, inquiring whether jury issues were presented concerning the Elmans' personal liability, first, for Green &amp; Freedman's obligations to the Health Fund, and, second for Boston Bakers responsibility for those same obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>III. Piercing the Corporate Veil:  Green &amp; Freedman</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that, on the record before the district court its decision to take from the jury the question of the Elmans' liability for Green &amp; Freedman's delinquent contributions was erroneous and must be vacated.  We find ample evidence to afford a reasonable jury, applying the Alman criteria, 801 F.2d at 4, and exercising its broad authority over the veil-piercing issue, supra, a legally sufficient basis to reach beyond Green &amp; Freedman's corporate identity and hold the Elmans liable for the corporation's unpaid contributions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Fraudulent Intent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, \"the cases that permit veil piercing in the ERISA milieu all emphasize that a finding of some fraudulent intent is a sine qua non to the remedy's availability.\"  United Elec., Radio and Machine Workers, 960 F.2d at 1093.   We explained in that case that, in the ERISA veil-piercing sense, fraud need not reach the level needed for criminal or even independently actionable civil fraud.  Still, it has to be more than \"invisible.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence that the Elmans, through their domination of Green &amp; Freedman, caused the corporation to make payments to themselves and their relatives at a time when the corporation was known to be failing and could be expected to default, or was already in default, on its obligations to the Health Fund.  These payments could be found to lack any business justification.  Courts have routinely viewed the wrongful diversion of corporate assets to or for controlling individuals at a time when the corporation is in financial distress as a fraud that can justify piercing the corporate veil.  See, e.g., Laborers' Pension Trust Fund v. Sidney Weinberger Homes, Inc., 872 F.2d 702, 705 (6th Cir.1988) (per curiam)(piercing veil where shareholder withdrew corporate funds at time of dissolution);  Lowen v. Tower Asset Management, Inc., 829 F.2d 1209, 1221 (2d Cir.1987) (holding individuals responsible for fiduciary's ERISA violations on evidence of \"extensive intermixing of assets ... among the corporations and individual defendants\");  Labadie Coal Co. v. Black, 672 F.2d 92, 98-99 (D.C.Cir.1982) (instructing trial court to consider defendants' diversion of corporate assets to personal uses);  I.A.M. National Pension Fund v. Wakefield Indus., Inc., 14 Employee Benefits Cas.  (BNA) 1890 (D.D.C.1991) (piercing employer's corporate veil under ERISA based in part on \"selective diversion of corporate assets\");  see generally 1 William M. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations &#167; 41.30, at 663 (listing among relevant factors \"siphoning of corporate funds by dominant stockholders\" and \"the use of corporate funds to pay personal expenses without proper accounting\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Health Fund introduced a series of checks that the Elmans made out to themselves from Green &amp; Freedman's corporate accounts.  These checks dated from January 1991 to January 1993, a period during which, according to Richard Elman, Green &amp; Freedman \"was in trouble,\" \"los[ing] some money,\" and experiencing a \"decline in profits and sales.\"   In the last few months of this period, Green &amp; Freedman ceased to be able to pay its debts including its required contributions to the Health Fund.  It then transferred its assets to Boston Bakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Elmans had been writing themselves and their relatives checks for no business purpose that the Elmans could adequately explain.  When questioned about one of these payments, Richard Elman testified that the corporation was repaying him an unrecorded loan--itself evidence weighing in favor of piercing the corporate veil, see United States v. Pisani, 646 F.2d 83, 88 (3d Cir.1981) (piercing corporate veil on basis of repayment of shareholders' loan at time when corporation was failing)--before stating that he could not remember the purpose of the payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particularly flagrant was the evidence of a personal vacation that the Elmans financed with corporate funds.  In January 1991, the Elmans caused Green &amp; Freedman to pay for them to travel to New Orleans, where they attended the Super Bowl.  On direct examination, Stanley Elman testified that the checks in question represented \"payment for expenses and conducting business.\"   On cross-examination, however, Stanley Elman admitted that Green &amp; Freedman had no customers in Louisiana and did no business in connection with the Super Bowl.  Nothing in Stanley Elman's testimony rehabilitated his initial claim that he conducted business on the Super Bowl trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Elmans caused Green &amp; Freedman to pay Eleanor Elman, Stanley Elman's wife, three checks for a total of $4,500.  Stanley Elman initially explained these payments as wages.  However, the Elmans did not report this amount on their tax return and there was no evidence that Green &amp; Freedman reported it as wages.  Moreover, Green &amp; Freedman's receptionist, Claire Lank, testified that Eleanor Elman did not work at Green &amp; Freedman during 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, just days before Green &amp; Freedman executed the bulk transfer to Boston Bakers, and at a time when the company had ceased to meet its obligations to the Health Fund, the Elmans caused the corporation to write an unexplained check for cash in the amount of $10,000, and a second check payable to Stanley Elman for $2,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The payments made by Green &amp; Freedman to the Elmans and their relatives during 1991 and 1992 with no apparent business justification amounted to $30,109.  In ruling on the Elmans' Rule 50(a) motion, the district court was required to draw all reasonable inferences and resolve credibility issues in favor of the non-movant Health Fund.  Looked at in this light, the evidence was sufficient to support a jury determination that the Elmans had used corporate funds for personal purposes at times when they knew either that the company was inadequately capitalized to meet its obligations, or that, in fact, it had stopped doing so--and, in particular, had ceased to pay its Health Fund obligations.  We add that the jury's ability to conclude that the Elmans had acted in a knowingly fraudulent manner would have been bolstered by inconsistencies in the Elmans' testimony about the payments, particularly their testimony that the Super Bowl trip and Eleanor Elman's \"wages\" had business purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Elmans protest that the amount of arguable self-dealing evidenced at trial was too little to justify sending the Health Fund's case to the jury.  The Elmans point out that the payments described above amounted to less than one percent of the corporation's gross annual sales, and that the trip to New Orleans was, after all, only one trip.  While it is difficult to quantify nicely the amount of fraud required, the Elmans's self-dealing occurred on several occasions, at a time when the company was in financial straits.  We cannot say that this conduct and the amounts involved were de minimis, to the point that no reasonable jury could find that the fraudulent intent prong of the Alman standard was established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Disregard of Corporate Identity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fraudulent self-dealing just discussed was probative not only of fraudulent intent but also of another Alman element, disregard of corporate identity.  On the latter score, there was additional evidence.  For example, the Elmans appear to have mixed their own finances with those of Green &amp; Freedman's.  At a time that the Elmans owed the corporation $141,000 in loans, they also loaned it $170,000 through their real estate trust.  These unexplained dealings suggest that money was being moved around with little or no regard for the corporate identity.  There was no record of the terms of the purported loans nor of any agreement to repay.  Undocumented and interest-free loans could be found to show a disregard for the corporate form.  See, e.g., Uriarte, 736 F.2d at 524 (treating unrecorded and interest-free loans from shareholders to the corporation as evidence of shareholders' disrespect for corporate form).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the undocumented loans, there was evidence of inadequate and, indeed, fraudulent record keeping.  The Elmans admittedly falsified Green &amp; Freedman's minutes to state that their wives, who served as nominal directors, attended and authorized corporate borrowing, when in fact their wives did neither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept the Elmans' contention that a closely-held corporation need not hew to every corporate formality in order to maintain its shareholders' immunity from the corporation's debts.  A veil-piercing plaintiff will not prevail if the evidence shows only that the closely-held defendant corporation was run without the strict formalities of its publicly-held counterpart.  But the evidence adduced at trial, viewed most favorably to the Health Fund, could be found to show practices that went beyond mere informalities.  Important transactions between the corporation and its controlling shareholders went undefined, and the Elmans appear to have created false minutes.  These facts, when added to the financial self-dealing and when viewed in a light most favorable to the Health Fund, support a reasonable inference by a jury that the Elmans, in the two years before Green &amp; Freedman's demise, did not treat Green &amp; Freedman as a separate entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Manifest Injustice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence just described under the first two Alman factors could also allow a reasonable jury to conclude that sheltering the Elmans from Green &amp; Freedman's liability to the Health Fund would be manifestly unjust.  As one commentator has explained, courts have found this prong met when \"a corporation is so undercapitalized that it is unable to meet debts that may reasonably be expected to arise in the normal course of business.\"   Note, Piercing the Corporate Law Veil:  The Alter Ego Doctrine Under Federal Common Law, 95 Harv.  L.Rev. 853, 855 (1982).  Thus, a jury would not be unreasonable in viewing as manifestly unjust the Elmans' decision to issue themselves payments for personal, non-corporate purposes, as well as other unexplained payments, at a time when the corporation could not meet its obligations to the Health Fund.  Of course, the mere non-payment of debt is not, by itself, enough to justify piercing the corporate veil.  However, a jury could reasonably conclude on the basis of the evidence below that the Elmans both placed their personal interests ahead of their corporation's responsibilities and did not themselves honor Green &amp; Freedman's corporate form.  As a result, it could be thought manifestly unjust to insist that the Health Fund be restricted by the corporate form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>IV. Piercing the Corporate Veil:  Boston Bakers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the evidence sufficed for a jury to find the Elmans personally liable for Boston Bakers' successorship obligation to pay Green &amp; Freedman's indebtedness for Health Fund contributions missed in April 1992, through January 1993, is more problematic.  Given the Elmans' potential direct liability, supra, for Green &amp; Freedman's debts on this score, the question of their tangential exposure for the same debt via Boston Bakers may seem more theoretical than real.  Still, the court's ruling on count 4 of the complaint raises the issue, and we must address it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the showing of fraud needed to pierce Boston Bakers' corporate veil, the Health Fund relies inter alia upon the Elmans' transfer of Green &amp; Freedman's assets to Boston Bakers, a transaction said to be inherently fraudulent.  Yet we can see nothing in the transfer itself that further disadvantaged the Health Fund in its ability to realize its claim for Green &amp; Freedman's unpaid contributions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the Elmans chosen simply to shut down the operations of Green &amp; Freedman in early 1993, instead of undertaking the bulk transfer to Boston Bakers, a jury would have to conclude that the Health Fund would have received nothing.  At the time of the bulk transfer, it was undisputed that Green &amp; Freedman had no more than $2,000 in cash on hand, and liabilities to secured creditors that outweighed its assets.  The firm's primary secured creditor, U.S. Trust, held a security interest in all of Green &amp; Freedman's assets.  Once a debtor grants an all-assets security interest, unsecured creditors like the Health Fund are made no worse off by a bulk transfer:  the transferred assets were already encumbered and therefore unavailable to the Health Fund regardless of the bulk transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that neither in its second amended complaint nor in arguments on appeal, has the Health Fund claimed that Boston Bakers, as Green &amp; Freedman's successor, was liable under the latter's collective bargaining contract for payments after January 15, 1993, the date Green &amp; Freedman shut down.  Rather the damages sought are for the period from April 1992, until January 15, 1993, being all based on defaulted contributions owed by Green &amp; Freedman while it was still operating.  Boston Bakers' liability is premised solely on its inherited responsibility for these earlier debts of its predecessor.  As said, had Green &amp; Freedman simply shut down on January 15, 1993, the Health Fund would apparently have been no better off.  (It might, arguably, have been worse off.)   Plaintiff propounds no concrete theory as to how the bulk transfer further diminished its prospects for recovering the sums owed by Green &amp; Freedman between April 1992 and January 15, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that, from the outset, Boston Bakers continued openly to carry on the business of Green &amp; Freedman.  Lank, Boston Bakers' nominal shareholder and receptionist, even continued to answer the phone \"Green and Freedman\" after the bulk sale.  A company does not extinguish its ERISA obligations simply by changing the name on its letterhead.  See Hawaii Carpenters Trust Funds v. Waiola Carpenter Shop, Inc., 823 F.2d 289, 294 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that alter ego test is met when two corporations share a \"substantial continuity\");  cf.  Guzman v. MRM/Elgin, 409 Mass. 563, 566, 567 N.E.2d 929 (1991) (explaining exception to general rule of successor non-liability for a transferee that \"is merely a continuation of the seller corporation\").  Thus, Boston Bakers was available throughout its existence to answer for the liabilities of its predecessor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Health Fund produced no evidence as to how the bulk transfer worked to its disadvantage.  As Richard Elman's uncontradicted testimony put it, by December 1992, Green &amp; Freedman was in such dire straits that it had to choose between liquidation and reorganization.  The Elmans chose the latter course, and undertook a reorganization through the bulk transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further undercutting the contention that the mere fact of the bulk transfer demonstrates the Elmans' fraudulent intent is the fact that they did not conceal the transfer.  As required by statute, Green &amp; Freedman notified its creditors, including the Health Fund, before executing the bulk transfer.  The district court thereafter denied the Health Fund's motion to enjoin the transfer, an action from which no appeal was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are thus unable to find, on this record, that the bulk transfer provided the Elmans with an unfair advantage, amounting to a fraud, material to the Health Fund's current claim.  Under Alman, fraudulent intent is a necessary element in order to piece the corporate veil.  We do not think a jury could properly derive a relevant finding of fraudulent intent material to the harm alleged from the transfer by itself.  See United Elec., Radio and Machine Workers, 960 F.2d at 1094 (approving \"good faith if ultimately unsuccessful attempt to resurrect a moribund company\");  Laborers Clean-Up Contract Admin. Trust Fund v. Uriarte Clean-Up Serv., Inc., 736 F.2d 516, 525 (9th Cir.1984) (noting difference between a corporation that was unable to pay its debts from the outset and one that simply \"fell upon bad times\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the fact of the bulk transfer, the Health Fund points to other factors as a supposed basis for piercing Boston Bakers' veil.  In its complaint it alleged that the nominal and sole shareholder, Claire Lank, was \"unaware\" of her obligations and rights as a shareholder and, instead of following her independent judgment, followed the Elmans' instructions.  Also alleged was the Elmans' complete control over Boston Bakers, even though they owned no stock;  the Elmans' disregard of corporate identity;  and the incorporation of Boston Bakers with fraudulent intent.  These allegations, however, to the extent legally material, must stand or fall on the existence in the record of some supporting evidence.  Moreover, proof of corporate informalities, standing alone, are insufficient.  Plaintiff may not prevail without some evidence of fraudulent intent material to the harm suffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence of financial self-dealing in the case of Boston Bakers such as occurred with Green &amp; Freedman.  None of the checks introduced by the Health Fund as payable to or for the Elmans came from Boston Bakers' accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect to the claimed \"undercapitalization\" of Boston Bakers, all the latter's capital came from the bulk transfer;  there was no unmet agreement by the Elmans to add more, nor evidence that, after transfer to Boston Bakers, they diverted the bulk transfer funds to personal objectives.  The mere fact that Boston Bakers eventually failed or had less capital than needed is not a basis for reaching the Elmans personally, absent fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much is made of the fact that Richard Elman indicated ignorance as to how he was named president and director of Boston Bakers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> or whether Boston Bakers held an annual shareholders' meeting.  Stanley Elman failed to recognize the firm's stock ledger.  And Lank, the sole shareholder, appears to have been a straw for the Elmans, allegedly so as to make it harder for creditors to reach them personally.  None of these items, however, singly or together, provide a sufficient evidentiary basis to pierce the corporate veil.  While they may suggest a lack of attention to corporate formalities, they do not reflect fraudulent intent material to the harm alleged, nor is it clear how any of them, even slightly, disadvantaged the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also evidence that the Elmans' wives did not know they were directors;  did not participate in board meetings, although corporate records falsely indicated they did;  and did not know that Lank was the sole stockholder.  But these snippets do little to demonstrate more than corporate informality.  Even if the false corporate records concerning the wives' attendance at directors' meetings are characterized as a \"fraud,\" there is no evidence the Health Fund knew or relied on this information to its detriment or sustained any injury whatever as a result.  The \"fraudulent intent of the individual defendants\" mentioned in Alman requires some meaningful relationship between the intent and the harm visited upon plaintiff.  We add that even the Health Fund itself does not argue that the incorrect records by themselves show fraudulent intent sufficient under Alman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court was correct in granting the Elmans' motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the Elmans' alleged personal liability for Boston Bakers' corporate obligation to make good Green &amp; Freedman's delinquent payments to the Health Fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law is vacated with respect to Count 3 and affirmed with respect to Count 4.

Recovery from Green &amp; Freedman was sought under the contract, and from Boston Bakers on the theory that, as a successor entity to Green &amp; Freedman, Boston Bakers was obligated to remit the latter's delinquent contributions.

After experiencing financial difficulties, Green &amp; Freedman ceased to make the agreed-upon contributions and transferred all remaining assets to a successor entity named Boston Bakers, Inc. The Fund Manager of the Health Benefits and Insurance Fund (referred to hereinafter as the \"Health Fund\") thereupon sued Green &amp; Freedman, Boston Bakers and the two corporations' principals, Richard Elman and Stanley Elman, in the district court to recover the payments owed by Green &amp; Freedman with interest, costs and penalties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both corporate defendants conceded liability for the delinquent contributions owed by Green &amp; Freedman to the Health Fund.  The Elmans, however, denied they were personally liable for these corporate debts, and a jury trial took place to determine that issue.  After the presentation of evidence, and before submission to the jury, the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Elmans, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a).  The Health Fund appeals.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-Appellee Green &amp; Freedman Baking Company (\"Green &amp; Freedman\") was a family-owned Massachusetts corporation formed in 1934 that produced and sold baked goods until, on January 15, 1993, its remaining assets were transferred in bulk to Appellee Boston Bakers, Inc.  (\"Boston Bakers\").  Boston Bakers operated essentially the same business as Green &amp; Freedman until its demise in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting in 1975, responsibility for Green &amp; Freedman's affairs rested with Defendants-Appellees Stanley Elman and Richard Elman, grandsons of one of the company founders.  Stanley Elman started working for Green &amp; Freedman in 1959 and by 1969 became its treasurer and a director, positions he occupied through the end of the corporation's and its successor's existence.  Richard Elman began with Green &amp; Freedman in 1964 and served as its President and a director from 1975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to transferring its assets to Boston Bakers as of January 15, 1993, Green &amp; Freedman employed between 12 and 18 truck drivers who were members of the Bakery Drivers and Helpers Local 494.  The union drivers' wages, hours, and conditions of employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and Green &amp; Freedman, effective from May 5, 1991 to May 1, 1994.  That agreement required Green &amp; Freedman to contribute $88 per week for every covered worker to the New England Teamsters and Baking Industry Health Benefits and Insurance Fund.  The Health Fund's contractual right to contribution was additionally protected by &#167; 515 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1145 (1985), which doubles the obligation of any employer who promises in a collective bargaining agreement to make contributions to a multiemployer benefits or pension plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1991, Green &amp; Freedman began to suffer what the Elmans described as a serious, and ultimately irreversible, decline in sales and profits.  Beginning in April 1992, and continuing until its business was terminated in January 15, 1993, Green &amp; Freedman stopped making its required contributions to the Health Fund.  Green &amp; Freedman's unpaid contributions for this period, totaling $39,776, are the basis for the liability the Health Fund seeks to impose in this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By December 1992, the Elmans had decided to transfer all of Green &amp; Freedman's assets to a newly-formed corporate shell entitled Boston Bakers, Inc., pursuant to the bulk transfer provisions of the Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 106, &#167;&#167; 6-101 to 6-110 (1990), repealed, Mass.  Acts 1996 ch. 160, &#167; 3 (1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston Bakers was simply a continuation of Green &amp; Freedman's business.  Its nominal and sole shareholder was Claire Lank, a long-time Green &amp; Freedman employee installed by the Elmans.  The Elmans were designated as the new corporation's officers and, along with their wives, as its directors.  A voting trust with Lank enabled the Elmans to continue exercising complete control of Green &amp; Freedman's assets, once transferred, in the form of Boston Bakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk transfer shifted all of Green &amp; Freedman's assets, which were then worth somewhere between $480,000 and $500,000, to Boston Bakers.  In exchange, Boston Bakers assumed Green &amp; Freedman's secured debt.  The secured debt, which totaled $498,498.17, was owed to two secured creditors:  U.S. Trust, the company's institutional lender, and the 75 Old Colony Avenue Realty Trust (the \"Realty Trust\"), a real estate trust that owned the company's plant for the benefit of the Elmans.  U.S. Trust held a security interest in all of Green &amp; Freedman's property, both then-owned and thereafter acquired, while the Realty Trust held a mortgage on the plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the bulk transfer, Boston Bakers gave Green &amp; Freedman a promissory note, which Boston Bakers held for the benefit of Green &amp; Freedman's unsecured creditors, worth $32,798.99.  That amount left the unsecured creditors, including the Health Fund, with claims worth roughly five cents on the dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As required by law, Green &amp; Freedman, after some hesitation, announced the bulk transfer to creditors in late December 1992 and provided a list of its assets.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 106, &#167;&#167; 6-104 to 6-106, repealed, Mass.  Acts 1996 ch. 160, &#167; 3. The Health Fund responded by bringing this action in the federal district court which, in its initial form, sought, inter alia, a preliminary injunction against the transfer of Green &amp; Freedman's assets, alleging the transfer to violate ERISA &#167; 515, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1145.  On January 12, 1993, the district court denied injunctive relief.  Three days later, the bulk transfer was consummated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston Bakers thereafter carried on business in the same manner as Green &amp; Freedman.  Employing the same workers and equipment at the same plant, it produced the same kinds of baked goods for the same customers.  Boston Bakers was as unprofitable as Green &amp; Freedman.  After two-and-a-half years of continued difficulties, U.S. Trust foreclosed, and Boston Bakers closed its doors in August 1995.  According to Richard Elman's testimony, which was not contradicted, the Elmans personally received no distribution in settling the company's affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the liquidation of Boston Bakers' assets, the Health Fund filed an amended complaint<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> seeking recovery of the delinquent contributions from both corporations, and from Richard Elman and Stanley Elman as well.  As Green &amp; Freedman had done previously, Boston Bakers conceded liability for the contributions Green &amp; Freedman failed to make to the Health Fund from April 1992 until the bulk transfer on January 15, 1993.  With the assets of both Green &amp; Freedman and Boston Bakers completely liquidated, the Health Fund looked to the Elmans personally for recovery of Green &amp; Freedman's delinquent contributions.  Count 3 of the Health Fund's Second Amended Complaint alleged that the Elmans were personally liable as the \" 'alter egos' of Green and Freedman.\"   Count 4 premised the Elmans' personal liability on their disregard for Boston Bakers' corporate identity, alleging that the Elmans completely controlled Boston Bakers and created it with fraudulent intent.  Both parties requested a trial by jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Health Fund called Stanley Elman, Richard Elman, and Richard's wife, Barbara Elman as witnesses.  Counsel for the Elmans declined cross-examination at the time, planning to call the Elmans later as their own witnesses.  The Health Fund also introduced the deposition testimony of Claire Lank, who had served as Green &amp; Freedman's secretary before being installed as Boston Bakers' nominal shareholder.  In addition, the parties stipulated to the admission of many documents recording the collective bargaining agreement, the creation of Boston Bakers, and the operation of Green &amp; Freedman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the Health Fund's case-in-chief, the Elmans moved for judgment in their favor as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a).  The district court granted the motion with respect to Count 3 and the liability of Green &amp; Freedman, ruling that the Health Fund had failed to meet the criteria stated in Alman v. Danin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476324\"><a href=\"/opinion/476324/ronald-alman-etc-v-jerome-danin/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1986), for corporate veil-piercing in an ERISA case.

Fletcher, 1 Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corps. &#167; 41.30, at 662 (1990 rev. ed.), and, more skeptically, that \"[t]here is a consensus that the whole area of limited liability, and conversely of piercing the corporate veil, is among the most confusing in corporate law,\" Frank H.

We said in Alman that courts should consider \"the respect paid by the shareholders themselves to [the] separate corporate identity;  the fraudulent intent of the [individual defendants];  and the degree of injustice that would be visited on the litigants by recognizing the corporate identity.\"  Alman, 801 F.2d at 4. Of these three elements, \"a finding of some fraudulent intent is a sine qua non to the remedy's availability.\"   See United Elec., Radio and Machine Workers v. 163 Pleasant Street Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580868\"><a href=\"/opinion/580868/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-v-163-pleasant/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span>, 1093 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before examining the district court's Rule 50(a) ruling in light of these criteria, we need to consider yet another problem.  The ERISA cause of action under which the Health Fund sued here, ERISA &#167; 502(a)(1), (3), authorizes only injunctive or \"other appropriate equitable relief.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1), (3) (emphasis added).  Courts have interpreted this cause of action as providing no right to a jury trial, even when the relief sought is monetary.  See, e.g., Spinelli v. Gaughan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659386\"><a href=\"/opinion/659386/christine-holt-spinelli-v-michael-gaughan/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 855 (9th Cir.1993).  As a result, Alman and other federal precedent were bench proceedings in which the judge determined both the law and the facts.  No consideration was given to the separate responsibilities of judge and jury in the applying of veil-piercing criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury trial here, not being of right, was undertaken by the judge with the consent of both parties.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c), allows a judge to order a consensual jury trial in actions not triable as of right by a jury.  In such cases, the \"verdict has the same effect as if trial by jury had been a matter of right.\"  Id. Accordingly, in reviewing the district court's Rule 50(a) determination, we are supposed to apply the same principles as if the jury trial had been one of right.  We must do so here, however, without the benefit of ERISA precedent instructing on whether, and to what degree, the jury rather than the judge is responsible for applying the Alman veil-piercing factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the absence of ERISA precedent on this aspect is somewhat troubling, we conclude that, in a consensual jury trial, it is principally the jury's function, and not the court's, to decide whether or not the Alman veil-piercing standards were met.  The jury, to be sure, can find individual liability only if the evidence is minimally sufficient to do so under Alman criteria.  Whether the evidence reaches that threshold is a question of law.  But given the issue's fact-intensive nature, the legal threshold of evidentiary sufficiency is a relatively low one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching the above conclusion, we are influenced by the fact that federal courts, outside the ERISA context, have held that veil-piercing \"is the sort of determination usually made by a jury because it is so fact specific.\"  Wm.

Most state courts adopt a similar approach.  See, e.g., Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co. v.

Even where veil-piercing is decided by judge rather than jury, the courts have held that the question, while equitable, is one of fact.  See, e.g., Smetherman v.

Indeed, in Alman we reviewed the district court's determinations that the individual defendants \"had acted in bad faith\" and \"had not respected [corporation's] separate existence even minimally\" as \"inferences\" subject to the clearly-erroneous review accorded issues of fact.  801 F.2d at 4;  see also Pipe Fitters Health and Welfare Trust v.

This choice would be next to meaningless were we now to hold that the principal contested issue--the Elmans' personal liability--remained one for the court to determine.  Given a Rule 39(c) election to proceed by jury trial, other courts have held that the district court may relegate all factual determinations to the jury, even those normally treated as equitable.

We find ample evidence to afford a reasonable jury, applying the Alman criteria, 801 F.2d at 4, and exercising its broad authority over the veil-piercing issue, supra, a legally sufficient basis to reach beyond Green &amp; Freedman's corporate identity and hold the Elmans liable for the corporation's unpaid contributions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Fraudulent Intent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, \"the cases that permit veil piercing in the ERISA milieu all emphasize that a finding of some fraudulent intent is a sine qua non to the remedy's availability.\"  United Elec., Radio and Machine Workers, 960 F.2d at 1093.   We explained in that case that, in the ERISA veil-piercing sense, fraud need not reach the level needed for criminal or even independently actionable civil fraud.  Still, it has to be more than \"invisible.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence that the Elmans, through their domination of Green &amp; Freedman, caused the corporation to make payments to themselves and their relatives at a time when the corporation was known to be failing and could be expected to default, or was already in default, on its obligations to the Health Fund.  These payments could be found to lack any business justification.  Courts have routinely viewed the wrongful diversion of corporate assets to or for controlling individuals at a time when the corporation is in financial distress as a fraud that can justify piercing the corporate veil.

These checks dated from January 1991 to January 1993, a period during which, according to Richard Elman, Green &amp; Freedman \"was in trouble,\" \"los[ing] some money,\" and experiencing a \"decline in profits and sales.\"   In the last few months of this period, Green &amp; Freedman ceased to be able to pay its debts including its required contributions to the Health Fund.  It then transferred its assets to Boston Bakers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Elmans had been writing themselves and their relatives checks for no business purpose that the Elmans could adequately explain.  When questioned about one of these payments, Richard Elman testified that the corporation was repaying him an unrecorded loan--itself evidence weighing in favor of piercing the corporate veil, see United States v. Pisani, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389276\"><a href=\"/opinion/389276/united-states-v-anthony-j-pisani-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 88 (3d Cir.1981) (piercing corporate veil on basis of repayment of shareholders' loan at time when corporation was failing)--before stating that he could not remember the purpose of the payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particularly flagrant was the evidence of a personal vacation that the Elmans financed with corporate funds.  In January 1991, the Elmans caused Green &amp; Freedman to pay for them to travel to New Orleans, where they attended the Super Bowl.  On direct examination, Stanley Elman testified that the checks in question represented \"payment for expenses and conducting business.\"   On cross-examination, however, Stanley Elman admitted that Green &amp; Freedman had no customers in Louisiana and did no business in connection with the Super Bowl.  Nothing in Stanley Elman's testimony rehabilitated his initial claim that he conducted business on the Super Bowl trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Elmans caused Green &amp; Freedman to pay Eleanor Elman, Stanley Elman's wife, three checks for a total of $4,500.  Stanley Elman initially explained these payments as wages.  However, the Elmans did not report this amount on their tax return and there was no evidence that Green &amp; Freedman reported it as wages.  Moreover, Green &amp; Freedman's receptionist, Claire Lank, testified that Eleanor Elman did not work at Green &amp; Freedman during 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, just days before Green &amp; Freedman executed the bulk transfer to Boston Bakers, and at a time when the company had ceased to meet its obligations to the Health Fund, the Elmans caused the corporation to write an unexplained check for cash in the amount of $10,000, and a second check payable to Stanley Elman for $2,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The payments made by Green &amp; Freedman to the Elmans and their relatives during 1991 and 1992 with no apparent business justification amounted to $30,109.  In ruling on the Elmans' Rule 50(a) motion, the district court was required to draw all reasonable inferences and resolve credibility issues in favor of the non-movant Health Fund.  Looked at in this light, the evidence was sufficient to support a jury determination that the Elmans had used corporate funds for personal purposes at times when they knew either that the company was inadequately capitalized to meet its obligations, or that, in fact, it had stopped doing so--and, in particular, had ceased to pay its Health Fund obligations.  We add that the jury's ability to conclude that the Elmans had acted in a knowingly fraudulent manner would have been bolstered by inconsistencies in the Elmans' testimony about the payments, particularly their testimony that the Super Bowl trip and Eleanor Elman's \"wages\" had business purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Elmans protest that the amount of arguable self-dealing evidenced at trial was too little to justify sending the Health Fund's case to the jury.  The Elmans point out that the payments described above amounted to less than one percent of the corporation's gross annual sales, and that the trip to New Orleans was, after all, only one trip.  While it is difficult to quantify nicely the amount of fraud required, the Elmans's self-dealing occurred on several occasions, at a time when the company was in financial straits.  We cannot say that this conduct and the amounts involved were de minimis, to the point that no reasonable jury could find that the fraudulent intent prong of the Alman standard was established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Disregard of Corporate Identity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fraudulent self-dealing just discussed was probative not only of fraudulent intent but also of another Alman element, disregard of corporate identity.  On the latter score, there was additional evidence.  For example, the Elmans appear to have mixed their own finances with those of Green &amp; Freedman's.  At a time that the Elmans owed the corporation $141,000 in loans, they also loaned it $170,000 through their real estate trust.  These unexplained dealings suggest that money was being moved around with little or no regard for the corporate identity.  There was no record of the terms of the purported loans nor of any agreement to repay.  Undocumented and interest-free loans could be found to show a disregard for the corporate form.  See, e.g., Uriarte, 736 F.2d at 524 (treating unrecorded and interest-free loans from shareholders to the corporation as evidence of shareholders' disrespect for corporate form).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the undocumented loans, there was evidence of inadequate and, indeed, fraudulent record keeping.  The Elmans admittedly falsified Green &amp; Freedman's minutes to state that their wives, who served as nominal directors, attended and authorized corporate borrowing, when in fact their wives did neither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept the Elmans' contention that a closely-held corporation need not hew to every corporate formality in order to maintain its shareholders' immunity from the corporation's debts.  A veil-piercing plaintiff will not prevail if the evidence shows only that the closely-held defendant corporation was run without the strict formalities of its publicly-held counterpart.  But the evidence adduced at trial, viewed most favorably to the Health Fund, could be found to show practices that went beyond mere informalities.  Important transactions between the corporation and its controlling shareholders went undefined, and the Elmans appear to have created false minutes.  These facts, when added to the financial self-dealing and when viewed in a light most favorable to the Health Fund, support a reasonable inference by a jury that the Elmans, in the two years before Green &amp; Freedman's demise, did not treat Green &amp; Freedman as a separate entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Manifest Injustice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence just described under the first two Alman factors could also allow a reasonable jury to conclude that sheltering the Elmans from Green &amp; Freedman's liability to the Health Fund would be manifestly unjust.  As one commentator has explained, courts have found this prong met when \"a corporation is so undercapitalized that it is unable to meet debts that may reasonably be expected to arise in the normal course of business.\"   Note, Piercing the Corporate Law Veil:  The Alter Ego Doctrine Under Federal Common Law, 95 Harv.  L.Rev. 853, 855 (1982).  Thus, a jury would not be unreasonable in viewing as manifestly unjust the Elmans' decision to issue themselves payments for personal, non-corporate purposes, as well as other unexplained payments, at a time when the corporation could not meet its obligations to the Health Fund.  Of course, the mere non-payment of debt is not, by itself, enough to justify piercing the corporate veil.  However, a jury could reasonably conclude on the basis of the evidence below that the Elmans both placed their personal interests ahead of their corporation's responsibilities and did not themselves honor Green &amp; Freedman's corporate form.  As a result, it could be thought manifestly unjust to insist that the Health Fund be restricted by the corporate form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>IV. Piercing the Corporate Veil:  Boston Bakers</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the evidence sufficed for a jury to find the Elmans personally liable for Boston Bakers' successorship obligation to pay Green &amp; Freedman's indebtedness for Health Fund contributions missed in April 1992, through January 1993, is more problematic.  Given the Elmans' potential direct liability, supra, for Green &amp; Freedman's debts on this score, the question of their tangential exposure for the same debt via Boston Bakers may seem more theoretical than real.  Still, the court's ruling on count 4 of the complaint raises the issue, and we must address it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the showing of fraud needed to pierce Boston Bakers' corporate veil, the Health Fund relies inter alia upon the Elmans' transfer of Green &amp; Freedman's assets to Boston Bakers, a transaction said to be inherently fraudulent.  Yet we can see nothing in the transfer itself that further disadvantaged the Health Fund in its ability to realize its claim for Green &amp; Freedman's unpaid contributions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the Elmans chosen simply to shut down the operations of Green &amp; Freedman in early 1993, instead of undertaking the bulk transfer to Boston Bakers, a jury would have to conclude that the Health Fund would have received nothing.  At the time of the bulk transfer, it was undisputed that Green &amp; Freedman had no more than $2,000 in cash on hand, and liabilities to secured creditors that outweighed its assets.  The firm's primary secured creditor, U.S. Trust, held a security interest in all of Green &amp; Freedman's assets.  Once a debtor grants an all-assets security interest, unsecured creditors like the Health Fund are made no worse off by a bulk transfer:  the transferred assets were already encumbered and therefore unavailable to the Health Fund regardless of the bulk transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that neither in its second amended complaint nor in arguments on appeal, has the Health Fund claimed that Boston Bakers, as Green &amp; Freedman's successor, was liable under the latter's collective bargaining contract for payments after January 15, 1993, the date Green &amp; Freedman shut down.  Rather the damages sought are for the period from April 1992, until January 15, 1993, being all based on defaulted contributions owed by Green &amp; Freedman while it was still operating.  Boston Bakers' liability is premised solely on its inherited responsibility for these earlier debts of its predecessor.  As said, had Green &amp; Freedman simply shut down on January 15, 1993, the Health Fund would apparently have been no better off.  (It might, arguably, have been worse off.)   Plaintiff propounds no concrete theory as to how the bulk transfer further diminished its prospects for recovering the sums owed by Green &amp; Freedman between April 1992 and January 15, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that, from the outset, Boston Bakers continued openly to carry on the business of Green &amp; Freedman.  Lank, Boston Bakers' nominal shareholder and receptionist, even continued to answer the phone \"Green and Freedman\" after the bulk sale.  A company does not extinguish its ERISA obligations simply by changing the name on its letterhead.  See Hawaii Carpenters Trust Funds v. Waiola Carpenter Shop, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491025\"><a href=\"/opinion/491025/hawaii-carpenters-trust-funds-health-welfare-trust-funds-by-its-trustees/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, 294 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that alter ego test is met when two corporations share a \"substantial continuity\");  cf.  Guzman v. MRM/Elgin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2083972\"><a href=\"/opinion/2083972/guzman-v-mrmelgin-willcox-gibbs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 566, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2083972\"><a href=\"/opinion/2083972/guzman-v-mrmelgin-willcox-gibbs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (1991) (explaining exception to general rule of successor non-liability for a transferee that \"is merely a continuation of the seller corporation\").  Thus, Boston Bakers was available throughout its existence to answer for the liabilities of its predecessor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the Health Fund produced no evidence as to how the bulk transfer worked to its disadvantage.  As Richard Elman's uncontradicted testimony put it, by December 1992, Green &amp; Freedman was in such dire straits that it had to choose between liquidation and reorganization.  The Elmans chose the latter course, and undertook a reorganization through the bulk transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further undercutting the contention that the mere fact of the bulk transfer demonstrates the Elmans' fraudulent intent is the fact that they did not conceal the transfer.  As required by statute, Green &amp; Freedman notified its creditors, including the Health Fund, before executing the bulk transfer.  The district court thereafter denied the Health Fund's motion to enjoin the transfer, an action from which no appeal was taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are thus unable to find, on this record, that the bulk transfer provided the Elmans with an unfair advantage, amounting to a fraud, material to the Health Fund's current claim.  Under Alman, fraudulent intent is a necessary element in order to piece the corporate veil.  We do not think a jury could properly derive a relevant finding of fraudulent intent material to the harm alleged from the transfer by itself.  See United Elec., Radio and Machine Workers, 960 F.2d at 1094 (approving \"good faith if ultimately unsuccessful attempt to resurrect a moribund company\");  Laborers Clean-Up Contract Admin. Trust Fund v. Uriarte Clean-Up Serv., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437189\"><a href=\"/opinion/437189/laborers-clean-up-contract-administration-trust-fund-v-uriarte-clean-up/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 525 (9th Cir.1984) (noting difference between a corporation that was unable to pay its debts from the outset and one that simply \"fell upon bad times\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides the fact of the bulk transfer, the Health Fund points to other factors as a supposed basis for piercing Boston Bakers' veil.  In its complaint it alleged that the nominal and sole shareholder, Claire Lank, was \"unaware\" of her obligations and rights as a shareholder and, instead of following her independent judgment, followed the Elmans' instructions.  Also alleged was the Elmans' complete control over Boston Bakers, even though they owned no stock;  the Elmans' disregard of corporate identity;  and the incorporation of Boston Bakers with fraudulent intent.  These allegations, however, to the extent legally material, must stand or fall on the existence in the record of some supporting evidence.  Moreover, proof of corporate informalities, standing alone, are insufficient.  Plaintiff may not prevail without some evidence of fraudulent intent material to the harm suffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence of financial self-dealing in the case of Boston Bakers such as occurred with Green &amp; Freedman.  None of the checks introduced by the Health Fund as payable to or for the Elmans came from Boston Bakers' accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In respect to the claimed \"undercapitalization\" of Boston Bakers, all the latter's capital came from the bulk transfer;  there was no unmet agreement by the Elmans to add more, nor evidence that, after transfer to Boston Bakers, they diverted the bulk transfer funds to personal objectives.  The mere fact that Boston Bakers eventually failed or had less capital than needed is not a basis for reaching the Elmans personally, absent fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much is made of the fact that Richard Elman indicated ignorance as to how he was named president and director of Boston Bakers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> or whether Boston Bakers held an annual shareholders' meeting.  Stanley Elman failed to recognize the firm's stock ledger.  And Lank, the sole shareholder, appears to have been a straw for the Elmans, allegedly so as to make it harder for creditors to reach them personally.  None of these items, however, singly or together, provide a sufficient evidentiary basis to pierce the corporate veil.  While they may suggest a lack of attention to corporate formalities, they do not reflect fraudulent intent material to the harm alleged, nor is it clear how any of them, even slightly, disadvantaged the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also evidence that the Elmans' wives did not know they were directors;  did not participate in board meetings, although corporate records falsely indicated they did;  and did not know that Lank was the sole stockholder.  But these snippets do little to demonstrate more than corporate informality.  Even if the false corporate records concerning the wives' attendance at directors' meetings are characterized as a \"fraud,\" there is no evidence the Health Fund knew or relied on this information to its detriment or sustained any injury whatever as a result.  The \"fraudulent intent of the individual defendants\" mentioned in Alman requires some meaningful relationship between the intent and the harm visited upon plaintiff.  We add that even the Health Fund itself does not argue that the incorrect records by themselves show fraudulent intent sufficient under Alman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the district court was correct in granting the Elmans' motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the Elmans' alleged personal liability for Boston Bakers' corporate obligation to make good Green &amp; Freedman's delinquent payments to the Health Fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law is vacated with respect to Count 3 and affirmed with respect to Count 4. The case is remanded for a new trial and other proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although repealed in 1996, the former Massachusetts U.C.C. Article 6 still applies to bulk transfers that, like the Boston Bakers transaction, occurred prior to the repeal.  See 1996 Mass.  Acts ch. 160, &#167; 5</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> An amended complaint dated March 1, 1995, was superseded by a Second Amended Complaint dated July 14, 1995.  In both complaints, the Health Fund sought recovery for Green &amp; Freedman's defaulted payments due under the collective bargaining agreement for the period April 1992 through January 15, 1993, totaling $39,770, exclusive of interest, costs and liquidated damages.  Recovery from Green &amp; Freedman was sought under the contract, and from Boston Bakers on the theory that, as a successor entity to Green &amp; Freedman, Boston Bakers was obligated to remit the latter's delinquent contributions.  Recovery from the two Elmans personally was sought because they were allegedly \"alter egos\" of Green &amp; Freedman, and because they allegedly established Boston Bakers with fraudulent intent, exercised complete control over it (although owning no stock), and disregarded its corporate identity</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Q: And would you acknowledge, sir, that you don't know by what authority you were elected a director of Boston Bakers?</p>\n        <p>A: The attorneys set up the corporation.
