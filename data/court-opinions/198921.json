After carefully reviewing the briefs\n\nand record on appeal, we affirm the order below.               The grand\n\njury    indictment    facially    established       probable   cause    to\n\nbelieve that the appellant had committed a relevant drug\n\noffense punishable by a maximum term of at least ten years.\n\nIt thereby triggered the rebuttable presumption that no\n\nconditions of bail could reasonably assure the appellant’s\n\nappearance or the community’s safety.                In addition, the\n\nappellant was charged with a serious           drug crime, the crime\n\nwas    allegedly   committed     while   he   was    on   probation    for\n\nanother offense, and the government proffered some evidence\n\nabout its case.      Although the appellant asserted that he may\n\nhave been misidentified, under the circumstances, he failed\n\nto counter the showing that he posed a risk of flight and a\n\ndanger to the community.
