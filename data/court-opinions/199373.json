In    this    appeal,    the     plaintiff,    a\n\ndisappointed job-seeker, challenges the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment in favor of her prospective employer (the\n\nUnited States Navy).      See Cannon-Atkinson v. Cohen, 95 F. Supp.\n\n2d 70, 76 (D.P.R. 2000).      We previously have acknowledged that\n\nwhen a trial judge accurately takes the measure of a case,\n\napplies the proper legal standards, and articulates a convincing\n\nrationale, \"an appellate court should refrain from writing at\n\nlength to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\"\n\nLawton v.

Consequently, we affirm the judgment below on\n\nthe basis of the lower court's opinion.\n\n         We    add   only   that   the    issue   here   is   not,   as    the\n\nplaintiff assumes, whether she might in fact have been a better\n\nprospect for the employer.         Rather, the issue is whether the\n\nemployer's reasons for selecting another applicant (Marrero) to\n\nfill the vacant position were pretextual.            See Feliciano de la\n\nCruz v. El Conquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 6\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f(1st Cir. 2000); Smith v. F. W. Morse & Co., 76 F.3d 413, 421\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).    We have carefully canvassed the record and,\n\nlike the district court, Cannon-Atkinson, 95 F. Supp. 2d at 75,\n\nwe have found no significantly probative evidence sufficient to\n\ncreate a genuine dispute as to pretext.\n\n            We need go no further.    We reject the plaintiff's\n\nappeal   for substantially the reasons elucidated in Judge Pérez-\n\nGiménez's thoughtful rescript.    See id. at 73-76.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.    See 1st Cir.
