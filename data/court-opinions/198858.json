Vega-Pacheco and\nCamille Vélez-Rivé, Assistant United States Attorneys, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 17, 2000\n\f\f               Per Curiam.        After a five-day trial, a jury found\n\ndefendant-appellant         Jerry         Resto-Díaz           (Resto)    guilty    of    two\n\ncounts of carjacking, each with intent to cause death or serious\n\nbodily     harm,1   18    U.S.C.      §    2119,         and    two    related     firearms\n\noffenses, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).                       The district court sentenced\n\nResto to life imprisonment.                Resto appeals.             We affirm.\n\n               The appellant advances only a single assignment of\n\nerror, contending that the trial judge committed reversible\n\nerror     in   refusing    to    declare        a    mistrial         when   a   government\n\nwitness,       Agent     Francisco         Ng       of    the     Federal        Bureau    of\n\nInvestigation, blurted out an inadmissible and incriminating bit\n\nof hearsay during his direct examination (despite forewarning\n\nfrom the prosecutor).2            Defense counsel objected and the court\n\nimmediately struck the offending testimony, cautioning the jury\n\nto disregard it.\n\n               Further proceedings ensued outside the jury's earshot.\n\nThe   appellant     moved       for   a    mistrial,           claiming      irretrievable\n\nprejudice.       Following a voir dire examination of Agent Ng, the\n\n\n\n      1\n     The proof showed conclusively that the carjackers shot and\nkilled one of the victims, Eliezer Ortiz-Rodríguez, in cold\nblood.\n      2\n     Agent Ng testified that, upon interviewing a witness, the\nwitness mentioned that one of the alleged perpetrators \"had\nconfided . . . that Eduardo Rodríguez Vásquez and Jerry Resto-\nDíaz had committed the carjacking.\"\n\n                                            -3-\n\fcourt     supportably   found    that   the    insertion    of     the    \"double\n\nhearsay\" statement into the case had been a manifestation of\n\nAgent     Ng's   confusion    rather    than   a    deliberate     attempt       to\n\ninfluence the outcome of the trial.            The court then denied the\n\nmistrial     motion.     In    its   charge    to    the   jury,    the     court\n\nreiterated its admonition to disregard testimony that had been\n\nstricken from the record.\n\n            The denial of a motion for a mistrial is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion.         See United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611,\n\n617 (1st Cir. 1994).         Despite defense counsel's able advocacy,\n\nwe discern no abuse of discretion here.                While the mention of\n\nthe   \"double     hearsay\"    statement      was    regrettable,     it    was    a\n\nmomentary interlude in a five-day trial.              Corrective action was\n\nswift and sure. 3       Given the strength of the government's case\n\nagainst Resto and the lower court's adroit handling of Agent\n\nNg's wayward remark, we conclude, on whole-record review, that\n\nthe incident was harmless.        Courts, after all, ordinarily should\n\npresume that jurors will follow a trial judge's instructions,\n\nsee Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987); United States\n\nv. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1998);                 United States v.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1185 (1st Cir. 1993), and the record in\n\n\n\n\n      3\n     We think it is noteworthy that defense counsel neither\nobjected to the wording of the trial court's cautionary\ninstructions nor suggested how those instructions might have\nbeen better phrased.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthis   case    affords   no    basis    for    discarding   that    venerable\n\npresumption.\n\n            We need go no further.            For aught that appears, the\n\nappellant     was   fairly    tried,   justly    convicted,   and   lawfully\n\nsentenced.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f",
