The district  court dismissed  the appeal  and\r\n\naffirmed  the bankruptcy court's denial of appellant's Motion\r\n\nfor Reconsideration  of the  Judgment (\"the  Motion\") on  the\r\n\nground that the notice of appeal had been untimely filed.\r\n\n     Appellant  concedes that the  notice of appeal  from the\r\n\ndistrict court order awarding costs and attorneys' fees (\"the\r\n\nJudgment\") was  untimely  filed under  Bankruptcy Rule  8001.\r\n\nThat Rule requires  an appeal to be  filed within 10 days  of\r\n\nthe judgment  appealed from.    The Judgment  was entered  on\r\n\nApril  2, 1993.  The Notice of  Appeal was filed on September\r\n\n21,  1993.  \"Untimely notice of  appeal deprives the district\r\n\ncourt  of  jurisdiction  to  review  the  bankruptcy  court's\r\n\norder.\"  In re Abdallah, 778 F.2d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1985).\r                                   \r\n\n     In  an  effort  to  overcome  this formidable  obstacle,\r\n\nappellant  argues  that  the  bankruptcy  court  abused   its\r\n\ndiscretion in not granting the  Motion.

Therefore,  Rule\r\n\n8002(c) did not  authorize the extension of the appeal period\r\n\nin  this  case,  even if  Colon  had  demonstrated \"excusable\r\n\nneglect.\"\r\n\n     2. Fed. R. Civ. P.

Rule 60(b),  made\r                \r\n\napplicable  to  bankruptcy  cases  by  Bankruptcy Rule  9024,\r\n\npermits  a motion for  relief from a judgment  or order to be\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nfiled \"within a  reasonable time\" after judgment enters.   We\r\n\nassume for  the purposes of  this appeal that the  Motion was\r\n\npursuant  to Rule  60(b)  and  that it  was  filed \"within  a\r\n\nreasonable time.\"\r\n\n     Appellant's  reliance   on  Rule  60(b)   is  misplaced,\r\n\nhowever,  where  lack   of  notice  is  the  reason  for  the\r\n\nuntimelines of  the appeal.   Bankruptcy  Rule 9022(a),  like\r\n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 77(d), provides that, although  the clerk is\r\n\nto  provide  notice  of entry  of  judgment  to the  parties,\r\n\n\"[l]ack of notice  of the entry does  not affect the  time to\r\n\nappeal or relieve  or authorize the court to  relieve a party\r\n\nfor failure  to appeal  within  the time  allowed, except  as\r\n\npermitted in Rule 8002.\" Rule 9022(a).\r\n\n     \"The courts have unanimously agreed, a mere lack of Rule\r\n\n77(d) notice does not justify Rule 60(b) relief.\"  12 Moore's\r                                                                         \r\n\nFederal  Practice,  60.48[6][c] (3d ed. 1997).  \"[P]arties to\r                             \r\n\nan ongoing case have an independent obligation to monitor all\r\n\ndevelopments  in  the case  and  cannot rely  on  the clerk's\r\n\noffice to do  their homework for them.\"  Witty  v.

Therefore, even if  we assume\r\n\n(without deciding) that  appellant did not receive  notice of\r\n\nentry of  the Judgment  within the  appeal period,  that fact\r\n\nalone would not justify Rule 60(b) relief.  Appellant has not\r\n\nalleged that  he  diligently monitored  the bankruptcy  court\r\n\ndocket to determine if there  had been a ruling on appellees'\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nMotion Requesting Ruling  on Sanctions, which was  filed only\r\n\nfour months before the Judgment  was entered.  The bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt  did  not abuse  its  broad discretion  in  denying the\r\n\nMotion.  See Witty, 3 F.3d at 521.\r                              \r\n\n     The district  court's Opinion  and Order  dated June  4,\r\n\n1996, is affirmed.  See Loc.

Bankruptcy  Rule 9022(a),  like\r\n\nFed. R. Civ.  P. 77(d), provides that, although  the clerk is\r\n\nto  provide  notice  of entry  of  judgment  to the  parties,\r\n\n\"[l]ack of notice  of the entry does  not affect the  time to\r\n\nappeal or relieve  or authorize the court to  relieve a party\r\n\nfor failure  to appeal  within  the time  allowed, except  as\r\n\npermitted in Rule 8002.\" Rule 9022(a).\r\n\n     \"The courts have unanimously agreed, a mere lack of Rule\r\n\n77(d) notice does not justify Rule 60(b) relief.\"  12 Moore's\r                                                                         \r\n\nFederal  Practice,  60.48[6][c] (3d ed. 1997).  \"[P]arties to\r                             \r\n\nan ongoing case have an independent obligation to monitor all\r\n\ndevelopments  in  the case  and  cannot rely  on  the clerk's\r\n\noffice to do  their homework for them.\"  Witty  v.

Therefore, even if  we assume\r\n\n(without deciding) that  appellant did not receive  notice of\r\n\nentry of  the Judgment  within the  appeal period,  that fact\r\n\nalone would not justify Rule 60(b) relief.
