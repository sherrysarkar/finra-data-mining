Two issues have been\r                      BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\r                                                  \r\n\nraised by the  parties in this case.  The first, in which the\r\n\nplaintiff Jere Scola,  Jr. is the appellant, is  an appeal by\r\n\nScola  on the  merits from  a  summary judgment  in favor  of\r\n\ndefendants-appellees Beaulieu Wielsbeke, N.V. and Dominiek De\r\n\nClerck.   The  second  issue, in  which  the  defendants  are\r\n\nappellants,  focuses on only  one question:   whether Scola's\r\n\nappeal  from  the  summary judgment  against  him  was timely\r\n\nfiled.\r\n\n          Because  we find that Scola's appeal was not timely\r\n\nfiled, we  dismiss the case  for lack of jurisdiction  and do\r\n\nnot  reach Scola's appeal  from the summary  judgment against\r\n\nhim.\r\n\n             Under Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a) and 28\r\n          U.S.C.    2107, a  notice of appeal  in a\r\n          civil case  must be filed within  30 days\r\n          of  entry of  the judgment or  order from\r\n          which the appeal  is taken.  This  30-day\r\n          time    limit    is     \"mandatory    and\r\n          jurisdictional.\"\r\n\nBrowder v. Director, Ill.

Hernandez,\r                                                                        \r\n\n22 F.3d 384, 387 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n          According to  the court docket, final  judgment was\r\n\nentered on  November 22, 1996.   Scola claims,  however, that\r\n\nthere was no final judgment (or Rule 54(b) certification) and\r\n\nthat as  a result,  his notice  of  appeal was  not late  but\r\n\npremature.   This rather astounding argument  is based on the\r\n\nprocedural history of  a counterclaim filed by  defendants in\r\n\ntheir answer to  Scola's complaint.  The  counterclaim sought\r\n\nthe  return of  certain documents  given to Scola  during the\r\n\nproceedings.     On  June   17,  1996,  defendants   filed  a\r\n\nstipulation   of  dismissal   of  the   counterclaim  without\r\n\nprejudice and withdrawal  of a jury trial demand.   By letter\r\n\nof July  30, 1996,  the clerk advised  all counsel  of record\r\n\nthat the court  had ruled that dismissal  of the counterclaim\r\n\nand  withdrawal of  the  jury  demand  were  ineffective  and\r\n\ntherefore denied.   The  court cited  Federal Rules of  Civil\r\n\nProcedure 41(a)  and  38(d).   The court's  reading of  these\r\n\nrules  was  correct.   There  is  nothing  further  about the\r\n\ncounterclaim  in the district court record.  The counterclaim\r\n\nargument was made by Scola for the first time in a  motion to\r\n\ndismiss the appeal filed in this court.  We note that Scola's\r\n\nnotice of appeal states that  he is appealing \"from the final\r\n\njudgment entered  in this action  on the 22 day  of November,\r\n\n1996.\"\r\n\n          Scola's   attempt  to   resuscitate  the   moribund\r\n\ncounterclaim  is precluded  by  the  final  sentence  of  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ndistrict   court's  order   granting  summary   judgment  for\r\n\ndefendants.   \"This conclusion  makes moot all  other pending\r\n\nmatters in  this case.\"    The counterclaim  obviously was  a\r\n\npending matter.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The second argument made by  Scola in his effort to\r\n\navoid the consequences  of filing an untimely  appeal invokes\r\n\nthe  doctrine of  \"unique circumstances.\"    He claims  that,\r\n\n\"[t]he  parties and the district court  made a mutual mistake\r\n\nabout the power of the court to  extend time for a Rule 59(e)\r\n\nmotion.\"  Scola's Brief at  2.  Our analysis starts  with the\r\n\ndate  of  final  judgment,  November  22,  1996;  this  makes\r\n\nDecember 23, 1996 the last day for filing a notice of appeal.\r\n\nIt also makes December 9, 1996 the last day for filing a Rule\r\n\n59(e) motion for a new trial.\r\n\n          Scola met neither  deadline.  The docket  shows the\r\n\nfollowing filings and response orders.\r\n\n          1.   On  November  27,  1996,  Scola\r\n               filed  a motion  to extend  the\r\n               time  to  file   a  Rule  59(e)\r\n               motion until December 18, 1996.\r\n\n          2.   On December 2, 1996, the motion\r\n               was granted by endorsement.\r\n\n          3.   On December 18, 1996, plaintiff\r\n               delivered the Rule 59(e) motion\r\n               to  the clerk's  office and  it\r\n               was date-stamped as received by\r\n               the  clerk on  the  18th.   The\r\n               motion  was   entered  on   the\r\n               docket on December 19, 1996.\r\n\n          4.   On   January   7,   1997,   the\r\n               district      court      denied\r\n               appellant's  Rule 59(e)  motion\r\n               by endorsement.\r\n\n          5.   On January 16,  1997, plaintiff\r\n               delivered  a  notice  of appeal\r\n               from  the  November   22,  1996\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n               final  judgment;   it was  date\r\n               stamped  as  received   on  the\r\n               16th, and entered on the docket\r\n               on January 17th.\r\n\n          6.   On  January  17,   1997,  Scola\r\n               filed a Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)\r\n               motion to  extend the  time for\r\n               filing  a notice  of appeal  to\r\n               January  15,  1997 --  one  day\r                                                          \r\n               after  he had  filed the  above\r                                                          \r\n               notice  of  appeal.   (Emphasis\r                                             \r\n               ours.)\r\n\n          7.   On   February   7,   1997,  the\r\n               district  court  judge  granted\r\n               Scola's FRAP 4(a)(5)  motion by\r\n               endorsement.\r\n\n          The \"unique circumstances\" doctrine had its genesis\r\n\nin Thompson v. I.N.S., 375 U.S. 384 (1964).  It was found not\r                                 \r\n\nto  apply in  Osterneck  v.  Ernst &amp;  Whinney,  489 U.S.  169\r                                                         \r\n\n(1989).  The Court restated the doctrine:\r\n\n          By its terms, Thompson applies only where\r                                            \r\n          a party  has performed  an act  which, if\r\n          properly   done,   would   postpone   the\r\n          deadline  for filing  his appeal  and has\r\n          received specific assurance by a judicial\r\n          officer that  this act has  been properly\r\n          done.\r\n\nId. at 179.  Our latest decision on the doctrine is stated in\r               \r\n\nAir Line Pilots  Ass'n v. Precision Valley Aviation, Inc., 26\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r\n\n             There  are  two preconditions  to  the\r\n          availability      of     the      \"unique\r\n          circumstances\"  exception.    First,  the\r\n          exception \"applies only where a party has\r\n          performed an act which, if properly done,\r\n          would  postpone the  deadline for  filing\r\n          his  appeal  and  has  received  specific\r\n          assurance by a judicial officer that this\r\n          act has been  properly done.\"   Osterneck\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n          v. Ernst  &amp; Whinney,  489 U.S.  169, 179,\r                                         \r\n          109 S. Ct.  987, 993, 103  L. Ed. 2d  146\r\n          (1989).   Second, the  court's action  or\r\n          statement must  have occurred at  a point\r\n          when, had the party not been  led astray,\r\n          it would have been able to file a timeous\r\n          notice  of appeal.    See Feinstein,  951\r                                                         \r\n          F.2d at 20.   Here, neither  precondition\r\n          is satisfied, for the district court  did\r\n          nothing    to    lull    appellant   into\r\n          inactivity.\r\n\nThe last sentence of the  quote is specifically pertinent  to\r\n\nthe case at bar.\r\n\n          The first question is  the effect of the  filing of\r\n\nthe  Rule 59(e)  motion.   A  timely-filed Rule  59(e) motion\r\n\ntolls the time to take an  appeal.  Fed. R. App. P.  4(a)(4).\r\n\nBut an untimely  Rule 59(e) motion is a  nullity and does not\r\n\nhave any tolling effect.  Feinstein v. Moses, 951 F.2d 16, 18\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1991).    Moreover, the  district  court \"may  not\r\n\nextend the  time for  taking any  action  under .  . .  [Rule\r\n\n59(b), (d) and (e)] . . . except  to the extent and under the\r\n\nconditions stated in [the rule].\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b).\r\n\n          We find  that the  \"unique circumstances\"  doctrine\r\n\ndoes not  apply.  For the  doctrine to apply Scola  must meet\r\n\nthe requirements  set forth  in Osterneck,  489 U.S.  at 179.\r                                                     \r\n\nScola  did  not  receive \"specific  assurance  by  a judicial\r\n\nofficer\"  that any  of his  late filings  had \"been  properly\r\n\ndone.\"   The court  did, on February  7, 1997,  grant Scola's\r\n\nmotion  under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)  to extend the time for\r\n\nfiling  a notice of  appeal to  January 15,  1997.   But even\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nmaking the  very dubious  assumption that the  court had  the\r\n\nauthority to extend the time for filing the appeal to January\r\n\n15, Scola failed to meet  the deadline he imposed on himself.\r\n\nThe notice of appeal  was filed on January 16,  one day after\r                                                                         \r\n\nScola's self-imposed deadline of January 15.  This is a truly\r\n\nunique  situation,  it  beggars   the  imagination,  but   it\r\n\ncertainly  does not  fall within  the \"unique  circumstances\"\r\n\ndoctrine.\r\n\n          Scola's brief also urges that the client should not\r\n\nbe penalized for his attorney's mistakes.

The first, in which the\r\n\nplaintiff Jere Scola,  Jr. is the appellant, is  an appeal by\r\n\nScola  on the  merits from  a  summary judgment  in favor  of\r\n\ndefendants-appellees Beaulieu Wielsbeke, N.V. and Dominiek De\r\n\nClerck.   The  second  issue, in  which  the  defendants  are\r\n\nappellants,  focuses on only  one question:   whether Scola's\r\n\nappeal  from  the  summary judgment  against  him  was timely\r\n\nfiled.\r\n\n          Because  we find that Scola's appeal was not timely\r\n\nfiled, we  dismiss the case  for lack of jurisdiction  and do\r\n\nnot  reach Scola's appeal  from the summary  judgment against\r\n\nhim.\r\n\n             Under Fed.

Scola claims,  however, that\r\n\nthere was no final judgment (or Rule 54(b) certification) and\r\n\nthat as  a result,  his notice  of  appeal was  not late  but\r\n\npremature.   This rather astounding argument  is based on the\r\n\nprocedural history of  a counterclaim filed by  defendants in\r\n\ntheir answer to  Scola's complaint.  The  counterclaim sought\r\n\nthe  return of  certain documents  given to Scola  during the\r\n\nproceedings.     On  June   17,  1996,  defendants   filed  a\r\n\nstipulation   of  dismissal   of  the   counterclaim  without\r\n\nprejudice and withdrawal  of a jury trial demand.   By letter\r\n\nof July  30, 1996,  the clerk advised  all counsel  of record\r\n\nthat the court  had ruled that dismissal  of the counterclaim\r\n\nand  withdrawal of  the  jury  demand  were  ineffective  and\r\n\ntherefore denied.   The  court cited  Federal Rules of  Civil\r\n\nProcedure 41(a)  and  38(d).   The court's  reading of  these\r\n\nrules  was  correct.   There  is  nothing  further  about the\r\n\ncounterclaim  in the district court record.  The counterclaim\r\n\nargument was made by Scola for the first time in a  motion to\r\n\ndismiss the appeal filed in this court.  We note that Scola's\r\n\nnotice of appeal states that  he is appealing \"from the final\r\n\njudgment entered  in this action  on the 22 day  of November,\r\n\n1996.\"\r\n\n          Scola's   attempt  to   resuscitate  the   moribund\r\n\ncounterclaim  is precluded  by  the  final  sentence  of  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ndistrict   court's  order   granting  summary   judgment  for\r\n\ndefendants.   \"This conclusion  makes moot all  other pending\r\n\nmatters in  this case.\"    The counterclaim  obviously was  a\r\n\npending matter.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The second argument made by  Scola in his effort to\r\n\navoid the consequences  of filing an untimely  appeal invokes\r\n\nthe  doctrine of  \"unique circumstances.\"    He claims  that,\r\n\n\"[t]he  parties and the district court  made a mutual mistake\r\n\nabout the power of the court to  extend time for a Rule 59(e)\r\n\nmotion.\"  Scola's Brief at  2.  Our analysis starts  with the\r\n\ndate  of  final  judgment,  November  22,  1996;  this  makes\r\n\nDecember 23, 1996 the last day for filing a notice of appeal.\r\n\nIt also makes December 9, 1996 the last day for filing a Rule\r\n\n59(e) motion for a new trial.\r\n\n          Scola met neither  deadline.  The docket  shows the\r\n\nfollowing filings and response orders.\r\n\n          1.   On  November  27,  1996,  Scola\r\n               filed  a motion  to extend  the\r\n               time  to  file   a  Rule  59(e)\r\n               motion until December 18, 1996.\r\n\n          2.   On December 2, 1996, the motion\r\n               was granted by endorsement.\r\n\n          3.   On December 18, 1996, plaintiff\r\n               delivered the Rule 59(e) motion\r\n               to  the clerk's  office and  it\r\n               was date-stamped as received by\r\n               the  clerk on  the  18th.   The\r\n               motion  was   entered  on   the\r\n               docket on December 19, 1996.\r\n\n          4.   On   January   7,   1997,   the\r\n               district      court      denied\r\n               appellant's  Rule 59(e)  motion\r\n               by endorsement.\r\n\n          5.

On  January  17,   1997,  Scola\r\n               filed a Fed. R.

Second, the  court's action  or\r\n          statement must  have occurred at  a point\r\n          when, had the party not been  led astray,\r\n          it would have been able to file a timeous\r\n          notice  of appeal.    See Feinstein,  951\r                                                         \r\n          F.2d at 20.   Here, neither  precondition\r\n          is satisfied, for the district court  did\r\n          nothing    to    lull    appellant   into\r\n          inactivity.\r\n\nThe last sentence of the  quote is specifically pertinent  to\r\n\nthe case at bar.\r\n\n          The first question is  the effect of the  filing of\r\n\nthe  Rule 59(e)  motion.   A  timely-filed Rule  59(e) motion\r\n\ntolls the time to take an  appeal.  Fed. R. App. P.  4(a)(4).\r\n\nBut an untimely  Rule 59(e) motion is a  nullity and does not\r\n\nhave any tolling effect.

Moreover, the  district  court \"may  not\r\n\nextend the  time for  taking any  action  under .  . .  [Rule\r\n\n59(b), (d) and (e)] . . . except  to the extent and under the\r\n\nconditions stated in [the rule].\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b).\r\n\n          We find  that the  \"unique circumstances\"  doctrine\r\n\ndoes not  apply.  For the  doctrine to apply Scola  must meet\r\n\nthe requirements  set forth  in Osterneck,  489 U.S.  at 179.\r                                                     \r\n\nScola  did  not  receive \"specific  assurance  by  a judicial\r\n\nofficer\"  that any  of his  late filings  had \"been  properly\r\n\ndone.\"   The court  did, on February  7, 1997,  grant Scola's\r\n\nmotion  under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)  to extend the time for\r\n\nfiling  a notice of  appeal to  January 15,  1997.   But even\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nmaking the  very dubious  assumption that the  court had  the\r\n\nauthority to extend the time for filing the appeal to January\r\n\n15, Scola failed to meet  the deadline he imposed on himself.\r\n\nThe notice of appeal  was filed on January 16,  one day after\r                                                                         \r\n\nScola's self-imposed deadline of January 15.  This is a truly\r\n\nunique  situation,  it  beggars   the  imagination,  but   it\r\n\ncertainly  does not  fall within  the \"unique  circumstances\"\r\n\ndoctrine.\r\n\n          Scola's brief also urges that the client should not\r\n\nbe penalized for his attorney's mistakes.
