Plácido Cabral was\n\nconvicted, following a jury trial, for attempting to re-enter the\n\nUnited States after having been previously arrested and deported, in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.     On appeal, Cabral argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in denying his motion for acquittal because he did\n\nnot attempt to re-enter the United States, and because he lacked a\n\nspecific intent to do so, as the statute allegedly requires. Cabral\n\nalso contends that the district court erred by failing to instruct the\n\njury on specific intent as an element of the offense.         We affirm.\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1988, Cabral was arrested and deported to the Dominican\n\nRepublic.    Prior to his deportation, the immigration authorities\n\nexplained to him the process by which he could seek permission to re-\n\nenter the United States, which included obtaining consent from the\n\nUnited States Attorney General before commencing travel to the United\n\nStates. When Cabral showed up at the detention facility prior to his\n\ndeportation, he did not have his alien resident card with him; thus, he\n\ndid not turn it over before returning to the Dominican Republic.\n\nFollowing his deportation, the INS revoked Cabral’s resident alien\n\nstatus, thereby invalidating his card, which had a 2002 expiration\n\ndate.\n\n            On May 19, 1999, Cabral arrived at the immigration booth at\n\nthe San Juan International Airport. Cabral handed the immigration\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\finspector his invalid alien resident card, a Dominican passport lacking\n\nany type of visa or other authorization to enter the United States, and\n\na Customs Declaration form featuring a Puerto Rico address as his\n\nalleged “Place of Residence.” Cabral did not advise the authorities\n\nabout his deportation status at that time.      When the immigration\n\ninspector entered Cabral’s information into the system, he learned that\n\na person with Cabral’s name and birthdate had been previously deported.\n\nAs a result, Cabral was taken to a secondary inspection area. Once\n\nthere, the immigration inspectors retrieved from him a one-way ticket\n\nfrom the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico, and $4.10 in cash. Cabral\n\ncarried no credit cards.\n\n          The inspector asked Cabral whether he had experienced any\n\nprevious problems with the authorities, particularly the immigration\n\nauthorities. Cabral replied he had not. After taking his fingerprints\n\nand advising him that a positive FBI match would be regarded as lying\n\nto a federal law enforcement officer, the inspector asked Cabral\n\nwhether he wished to reconsider his answer.        Cabral did so and\n\nacknowledged his prior deportation. Cabral also admitted that he had\n\nbeen advised about the need to obtain the express consent of the\n\nAttorney General prior to re-entering the United States.        Cabral\n\nadmitted that he had not yet sought a waiver, but said he wished to do\n\nso at that time.    Cabral was thereafter placed under arrest for\n\nillegally seeking re-entry into the United States.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          On September 2, 1999, after a two-day trial, the jury found\n\nCabral guilty of violating 8 U.S.C. § 1326.       The district court\n\nsentenced Cabral to a prison term of 96 months, with a three-year\n\nsupervised release term.\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, “we view the\n\nfacts and witness credibility determinations, as well as draw\n\nreasonable inferences, in favor of the government.” United States v.\n\nFreeman, 208 F.3d 332, 337 (1st Cir. 2000). As long as the evidence,\n\ntaken as a whole, warrants a judgment of conviction, the evidence is\n\nlegally sufficient. Id.; see United States v. Olbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970\n\n(1st Cir. 1995). Since Cabral timely objected to the district court’s\n\nfailure to instruct on specific intent as an element of the offense,\n\nhis challenge is subject to harmless error review. Scarfo v. Cabletron\n\nSys. Inc., 54 F.3d 931, 939 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          The government charged Cabral with a violation 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1326, which prohibits attempted re-entry into the United States by a\n\ndeported alien. In order to obtain a conviction for this offense, the\n\ngovernment was required to prove four elements:(1) that Cabral was an\n\nalien at the time of the alleged offense;(2) that he had previously\n\nbeen arrested and deported; (3) that he attempted to enter the United\n\nStates; (4) that he had not received the express consent of the\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fAttorney General of the United States to apply for readmission to the\n\nUnited States since the time of his previous arrest and deportation.\n\nSee United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, 987 F.2d 1129, 1131-32 (5th Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n          The principal question on appeal is whether the evidence\n\nsupports a finding that Cabral attempted to re-enter illegally into the\n\nUnited States. Cabral does not dispute that he was an alien at the\n\ntime of his arrest, that he had been previously arrested and deported\n\nto the Dominican Republic, and that he did not receive advance consent\n\nfrom the Attorney General of the United States prior to arriving at the\n\nport of entry. Nonetheless, Cabral contends that his intent was not to\n\nre-enter the United States but rather to request permission at the port\n\nof entry. Had the immigration inspectors informed him that he could\n\nnot obtain permission to enter at the port of entry, he argues, he\n\nwould have returned to the Dominican Republic.\n\n          The evidence presented at trial belies Cabral’s contention.\n\nUpon his arrival at the port of entry, Cabral made no immediate effort\n\nto inform the authorities about his deportation status. Instead, he\n\nhanded immigration authorities an invalid alien resident card (which\n\nappeared valid on its face and had a 2002 expiration date), a Dominican\n\npassport without a visa, and a Customs Declaration form with a Puerto\n\nRico address as his putative place of residence. At no point during\n\nthe time he spent at the initial inspection area did Cabral indicate\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat he was merely there to request a waiver from the Attorney General.\n\nIt was only at the secondary inspection point – and even then after\n\nsome prodding - that Cabral finally divulged his deportation status.\n\n           An alien who has been deported and, without prior\n\nauthorization, voluntarily approaches a port of entry and makes a false\n\nclaim of residency has attempted to re-enter the United States and,\n\ntherefore, has the required intent to support a conviction under §\n\n1326. See United States v. Gracidas-Ulibarry, 192 F.3d 926, 930 (9th\n\nCir. 1999); Cardenas-Alvarez, 987 F.2d at 1133. Here, the evidence\n\nsupports a finding that Cabral’s actions were designed to convince the\n\nimmigration authorities that he was entitled to enter the United\n\nStates.   Cabral sought to pass himself off as a legal resident by\n\nmaking a false claim of residency at the port of entry.1 Moreover,\n\nCabral’s suggestion that he merely intended to request a waiver from\n\nthe Attorney General and, if rebuffed, to return to the Dominican\n\nRepublic, is disingenuous. The evidence shows that Cabral had only a\n\none-way ticket from Santo Domingo to Puerto Rico and less than five\n\n\n\n\n     1    It should also be noted that, in light of Cabral’s\ndeportation status, he was required to obtain a visa from the\nDominican authorities, in addition to the Attorney General’s\nconsent, prior to departing to Puerto Rico. A visa would not\nhave been required, however, had Cabral shown his seemingly\nvalid alien resident card. Thus, it appears likely that he was\nable to depart from the Dominican Republic without a visa by\nusing his canceled alien resident card.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdollars in his possession – simply not enough to return, even if he\n\nwanted to do so.\n\n          Cabral’s actions at the port of entry show that he attempted\n\nto deceive the immigration authorities into allowing him to re-enter\n\nthe country. He knew that he was required to obtain permission from\n\nthe Attorney General prior to coming to the United States, but failed\n\nto do so. He knew (or should have known) that his alien resident card\n\nwas no longer valid, yet he tried to use it at the port of entry. In\n\nall likelihood, Cabral realized that the chances that he would obtain\n\npermission were slim, and he decided to take a calculated risk in order\n\nto meet with his family. Unfortunately, his strategy backfired. He\n\nnow must face the consequences of his actions. The evidence amply\n\nsupports the jury’s finding that Cabral attempted to re-enter the\n\nUnited States in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.\n\n          Cabral next contends that the government was required to\n\nprove that he had a specific intent to re-enter the United States, and,\n\nas a corollary, that the district court should have instructed the jury\n\non specific intent as an element of the offense. Cabral’s argument that\n\n§ 1326 contains a specific intent requirement has not been well\n\nreceived by the courts. Of the ten circuit courts that have considered\n\nwhether the government is required to prove that a defendant had a\n\nspecific intent to reenter the United States, nine have said it is not.\n\nSee United States v. Soto, 106 F.3d 1040, 1041 (1st Cir. 1997); see\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\falso United States v. Martus, 138 F.3d 95 (2d Cir. 1998)(per curiam);\n\nUnited States v. Espinoza-Leon, 873 F.2d 743 (4th Cir. 1989); United\n\nStates v. Guzman-Ocampo, 236 F.3d 233 (5th Cir. 2000); United States v.\n\nHussein, 675 F.2d 114 (6th Cir. 1982); United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nChavez, 122 F.3d 15 (8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Ayala, 35 F.3d\n\n423 (9th Cir. 1994); United States v. Hernandez, 693 F.2d 996 (10th\n\nCir. 1982); United States v. Henry, 111 F.3d 111 (11th Cir. 1997); cf.\n\nUnited   States   v.   Anton,   683    F.2d   1011   (7th   Cir.   1982)(2-1\n\ndecision)(Posner, J., dissenting).\n\n           We need go no further. Even if we decided to entertain the\n\nspecific intent issue (which appears to have been squarely rejected by\n\nthe Soto Court in any event), the evidence here is sufficiently strong\n\nto support a finding that Cabral specifically intended to re-enter the\n\nUnited States.\n\n           Accordingly, the district court’s denial of Cabral’s motion\n\nfor acquittal, and the decision not to instruct the jury on specific\n\nintent as an element of the offense, was proper.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Cabral sought to pass himself off as a legal resident by\n\nmaking a false claim of residency at the port of entry.1 Moreover,\n\nCabral’s suggestion that he merely intended to request a waiver from\n\nthe Attorney General and, if rebuffed, to return to the Dominican\n\nRepublic, is disingenuous. The evidence shows that Cabral had only a\n\none-way ticket from Santo Domingo to Puerto Rico and less than five\n\n\n\n\n     1    It should also be noted that, in light of Cabral’s\ndeportation status, he was required to obtain a visa from the\nDominican authorities, in addition to the Attorney General’s\nconsent, prior to departing to Puerto Rico. A visa would not\nhave been required, however, had Cabral shown his seemingly\nvalid alien resident card. Thus, it appears likely that he was\nable to depart from the Dominican Republic without a visa by\nusing his canceled alien resident card.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdollars in his possession – simply not enough to return, even if he\n\nwanted to do so.\n\n          Cabral’s actions at the port of entry show that he attempted\n\nto deceive the immigration authorities into allowing him to re-enter\n\nthe country. He knew that he was required to obtain permission from\n\nthe Attorney General prior to coming to the United States, but failed\n\nto do so. He knew (or should have known) that his alien resident card\n\nwas no longer valid, yet he tried to use it at the port of entry. In\n\nall likelihood, Cabral realized that the chances that he would obtain\n\npermission were slim, and he decided to take a calculated risk in order\n\nto meet with his family. Unfortunately, his strategy backfired. He\n\nnow must face the consequences of his actions. The evidence amply\n\nsupports the jury’s finding that Cabral attempted to re-enter the\n\nUnited States in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.\n\n          Cabral next contends that the government was required to\n\nprove that he had a specific intent to re-enter the United States, and,\n\nas a corollary, that the district court should have instructed the jury\n\non specific intent as an element of the offense. Cabral’s argument that\n\n§ 1326 contains a specific intent requirement has not been well\n\nreceived by the courts. Of the ten circuit courts that have considered\n\nwhether the government is required to prove that a defendant had a\n\nspecific intent to reenter the United States, nine have said it is not.\n\nSee United States v.
