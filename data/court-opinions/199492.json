This is a case of first\n\nimpression for this court as to the standards for awarding\n\nattorneys' fees against the United States for its initiation of\n\ncriminal proceedings, as provided for under the Hyde Amendment,\n\nPub.L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2519 (1997), reprinted in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3006A (statutory note).          The district court awarded\n\n$68,726.00 in fees to Riverdale Mills, which had been one\n\ndefendant in a criminal prosecution for violation of the Clean\n\nWater Act, and denied fees to James Knott, the other defendant.\n\nThe government voluntarily dismissed the action after the\n\ndistrict court suppressed some of the prosecution’s evidence.\n\nThe   district   court   awarded   fees   on   the   grounds   that   the\n\ngovernment’s prosecution was \"vexatious.\"        We reverse the award\n\nof fees to Riverdale Mills and affirm the denial of fees to\n\nKnott.\n\n                                   I.\n\n          Riverdale Mills Corporation and its principal owner,\n\nJames Knott, operate a plant in Northbridge, Massachusetts, that\n\nmanufactures plastic-coated steel wire mesh.            The production\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\finvolves two processes, one producing rather acidic wastewater,\n\nand   the   other     producing     quite     caustic    (i.e.,   alkaline)\n\nwastewater.         Riverdale     Mills     ultimately   discharges   this\n\nindustrial waste into the public sewer owned by the Town of\n\nNorthbridge.\n\n            The Clean Water Act prohibits the indirect discharge\n\nof pollutants into the waters of the United States through\n\npublicly owned treatment works.            33 U.S.C. § 1317(b)(1).     The\n\nimplementing regulations for the Act prohibit the discharge of\n\nwastewater with a pH below 5.0 standard units (\"s.u.\")1 into\n\npublicly owned sewer systems.             40 C.F.R. § 403.5(b)(2).     Any\n\nperson who \"knowingly\" violates these standards is subject to\n\nfelony prosecution.      33 U.S.C. § 1319(c)(2)(A).\n\n            Riverdale Mills's state permit for discharging its\n\nwaste into the public sewer states that Riverdale Mills will\n\nensure that the wastewater falls within acceptable limits by\n\n\n      1   The term pH stands for a measure of acidity and\nalkalinity on a logarithmic scale from 0 to 14, with 7.0\nrepresenting neutrality, numbers below 7 representing increasing\ndegrees of acidity, and numbers above 7 representing increasing\nalkalinity. Each whole number step away from 7 represents a\nten-fold increase in acidity or alkalinity, such that a sample\nwith a pH of 4.0 s.u. is ten times more acidic than a sample\nwith a pH of 5.0 s.u., and so forth.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcombining the two streams inside the plant so that the caustic\n\nwater   neutralizes   the   acidic   water,   and   then   further\n\nneutralizing the waste by adding a caustic soda. Following this\n\npretreatment, on the design in the permit, the now-combined\n\nwastewaters would flow intermittently through an effluent pipe\n\nto a manhole outside the building on Riverdale Street (Manhole\n\n#1), where it joins a sewer pipe.    The discharge then would flow\n\nthrough that sewer pipe approximately 100 yards to a second\n\nmanhole (Manhole #2), where the pipe joins the public sewer\n\nline.\n\n          Acting on an anonymous tip that this pretreatment\n\nsystem was not in operation, two EPA civil inspectors went to\n\nRiverdale Mills for an unannounced inspection on October 21,\n\n1997. The district court determined that Knott consented to the\n\ninspection, but determined on disputed facts that his consent\n\nwas qualified by the express condition that the EPA inspectors\n\nbe accompanied by Riverdale Mills representatives during the\n\nentire course of their inspection.     Knott then accompanied the\n\ninspectors to Manhole #1, where they took two initial samples\n\n(neither below pH 5.0 s.u.) and observed only an intermittent\n\ndischarge.   Because of the intermittent nature of the discharge\n\n                               -4-\n\fflow, the inspectors then allegedly informed Knott that they\n\nwould have to conduct periodic sampling throughout the day. The\n\ngroup then embarked on a tour of the facility, during which the\n\nEPA inspectors discovered that, contrary to Knott's alleged\n\nstatement that morning, the wastewater treatment facility at\n\nRiverdale Mills was not in operation.                 Apparently, the two\n\nwastewater   streams     were   not    being    mixed   in   the     treatment\n\nfacility as intended because a valve was turned to the wrong\n\nposition, and also the tank where caustic soda was to be added\n\nto the wastewater was being bypassed.\n\n           In the early afternoon, the inspectors returned to\n\nManhole #1, on the street in front of the plant and in the plain\n\nview of Riverdale Mills employees.            There they took a series of\n\nsamples,   and   those   additional         samples   yielded   pH   readings\n\nranging from 2.19 to 7.48 s.u., with thirteen of the fourteen\n\nsamples showing extremely low pH readings (between 2.19 and 2.59\n\ns.u.).2    The district court determined that the EPA inspectors\n\nwere not accompanied by a Riverdale Mills representative for\n\n\n     2    Riverdale Mills disputes the log of these samples,\narguing that the readings were actually in the \"7\" range, but\nthat the number \"7\" originally written in the log was\nsubsequently altered to appear to be a \"2.\"\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthis sampling.   The inspectors then returned to the plant and a\n\nRiverdale Mills employee completed their tour of the facilities.\n\nThe EPA inspectors also gave a split sample from one of their\n\nafternoon samples to the employee, who signed the chain of\n\ncustody form for it.     At the EPA’s closing conference with\n\nKnott, they discussed the low pH discharges, and Knott informed\n\nthe EPA inspectors that he owned Riverdale Street and he claimed\n\nownership of the sewer line under the street.\n\n          After leaving the plant, the EPA inspectors went to\n\nManhole #2.   This is where the \"private\" sewer line joined the\n\nmunicipal line, according to Knott's statement at the meeting.\n\nThere the inspectors noted a second residential sewer line also\n\njoined at the manhole, seven feet below the Riverdale Mills\n\nline.   Accordingly, they took three different samples at this\n\nsite. One was from the discharge of the residential line, which\n\nthe EPA says yielded a pH of approximately 7 s.u.   One was from\n\nwater standing in a trough at the manhole, which the EPA says\n\nyielded a pH around 7 s.u.   The last one was from the discharge\n\nflowing from the Riverdale Mills line, which the EPA says\n\nyielded a pH of around 4 s.u.     In their field log, the number\n\n\"4\" for this final measurement appears to be written over a \"7.\"\n\n                                -6-\n\f(The district court later concluded that the recorded entry for\n\nthat sample had been altered from its actual reading of 7 s.u.)\n\n            Based on this information, the EPA criminal division\n\nobtained    a    federal   search   warrant    and   conducted   a   second\n\ninspection on November 7, 1997.           A large number of samples were\n\ntaken at Manhole #1.         Most had a pH below 5.0 s.u. and the\n\nsamples worsened -- that is, became even more acidic -- as the\n\nday progressed.       EPA agents also took seven samples in the\n\nmorning at Manhole #2, and all had pH readings around 5.0 or 6.0\n\ns.u.   Again, the agents observed that the required pretreatment\n\nsystem at the Riverdale Mills plant was largely not operational;\n\nalthough on that day the two wastewater streams were mixing in\n\nthe plant, the process adding caustic soda was still being\n\nbypassed.       Plant employees told the EPA that the pretreatment\n\nsystem had not been in operation since sometime in the spring of\n\n1997, and that Knott was aware that wastewater was being\n\ndischarged without pretreatment.\n\n            In July 1998, the EPA executed a second search warrant\n\nto measure the effects of groundwater infiltration between\n\nManhole #1 and Manhole #2.      This was done in response to Knott's\n\nclaim that he owned the intervening sewer line and that by the\n\n                                    -7-\n\ftime the wastewater reached the public sewer at Manhole #2,\n\ngroundwater infiltration inevitably brought it within the legal\n\nlimit.   The EPA's expert concluded that even making assumptions\n\nfavorable to Knott, any wastewater with a pH below 3.0 s.u. at\n\nthe first manhole would reach the sewer line at the second\n\nmanhole with a pH below 5.0 s.u.\n\n          On August 12, 1998, a federal grand jury indicted Knott and\n\nRiverdale Mills on two counts of violating the Clean Water Act by\n\nknowingly discharging industrial wastewater with a pH below 5.0 s.u.\n\ninto a publicly owned treatment works on October 21 and November 7,\n\n1997. Following the indictment, both the U.S. Attorney's office and\n\nthe regional EPA issued standard press releases announcing the\n\nindictment and its allegations.\n\n          On October 14, 1998, Knott and Riverdale Mills moved to\n\nsuppress evidence from the afternoon sampling on October 21, 1997 as\n\nthe result of an unlawful search, and also to suppress the sampling\n\nobtained through the November 7 search warrant, as the fruit of the\n\nOctober 21 sampling.     On February 16, 1999, the district court\n\nsuppressed the sampling results from the afternoon of October 21, 1997,\n\nfinding that the EPA inspectors exceeded the scope of Knott's consent\n\nwhen they sampled the wastewater stream without a Riverdale Mills\n\nrepresentative present.    However, the district court declined to\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fsuppress the evidence obtained on November 7, reasoning that even\n\nthough the basis of the warrant was in part the October 21 afternoon\n\nsampling, the agents acted in good faith executing the warrant.\n\n          The government sought leave of court to dismiss the\n\nindictment without prejudice on April 23, 1999, because in the course\n\nof preparing for trial, it determined that the suppression had\n\nsubstantially weakened its case and raised a question as to whether it\n\ncould make a sufficiently compelling case to the jury to meet its\n\nburden of proof on the remaining evidence.      Leave of the court to\n\ndismiss the indictment without prejudice was granted by the district\n\ncourt on May 6, 1999.\n\n          Following the dismissal of the indictment, Knott and\n\nRiverdale Mills filed a motion to recover reasonable attorneys' fees\n\nunder the Hyde Amendment. The district court awarded attorneys' fees\n\nto Riverdale Mills as a prevailing party3 because, in the view of the\n\ncourt, while the prosecution was neither frivolous nor in bad faith, it\n\nwas \"clearly vexatious\" within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment.\n\nUnited States v. Knott, 106 F. Supp. 2d 174, 180 (D. Mass. 2000). The\n\ndistrict court, relying in part on the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n\nUnited States v. Gilbert, 198 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir. 1999), held that a\n\n\n     3    In the district court, the government contested whether\nthe defendants were properly considered \"prevailing parties\"\nwithin the meaning of the Hyde Amendment, as the indictment was\ndismissed without prejudice.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdefendant seeking fees under the Hyde Amendment must show that the\n\ngovernment's legal position was asserted \"in bad faith or without any\n\nfoundation or basis for belief that it might prevail\" and thus amounted\n\nto \"prosecutorial misconduct.\"4 See 106 F.Supp.2d at 179 (quoting\n\nGilbert, 198 F.3d at 1303-04).       The district court rested its\n\nconclusion that the prosecution here was \"vexatious\" on the court’s\n\nbelief that the government did not have \"any credible evidence\" to\n\nsupport the accusation that the defendants discharged waste with a pH\n\nbelow 5.0 s.u. into the public sewer. Id. To the contrary, the court\n\nconcluded, the samples taken at the second manhole, \"the point of\n\ndischarge into the public sewer,\" showed that Riverdale Mills \"was not\n\nin violation of the Clean Water Act.\" Id. The district court did not,\n\nhowever, find that the agents or prosecutors in this case acted\n\nmaliciously, or with any particular personal motive to vex the\n\ndefendants. The court rested instead simply on the purported absence\n\nof credible evidence, though it also discussed some alleged misconduct\n\nin the collection of samples and the conduct of searches. Accordingly,\n\nthe court awarded fees in the sum of $68,726.00 to the company against\n\nthe United States under the Hyde Amendment. Id. at 181. The court\n\n\n     4    The district court also cited to two different\ndefinitions of \"vexatious\" from Black's Law Dictionary: one\ndefining vexatious as \"without reasonable or probable cause,\"\nthe other defining a \"vexatious\" charge as one that is\ncalculated to \"harass, disquiet, or annoy.\" 106 F. Supp. 2d at\n179 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 1565 (6th ed. 1990)).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdenied fees to Knott because his net worth exceeded $2 million,\n\nreasoning that the limitations of 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) apply to the Hyde\n\nAmendment.   Id. at 178.\n\n          The government appeals this fee award, arguing (1) that the\n\ncourt applied the wrong legal standard in defining vexatiousness, as it\n\ndid not find any malice or intent to harass in the prosecution, but\n\nrather found only that the prosecution lacked foundation; (2) that the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the prosecution lacked foundation was\n\nin clear error, as the government had ample evidence to prove the\n\nviolations prior to the suppression ruling, and indeed it could have\n\npursued the charges even on the evidence that remained after the\n\ncourt's suppression order; and (3) that the court erred in identifying\n\ncertain   isolated   acts   of   government   agents   as   evidence   of\n\nvexatiousness.\n\n          Knott, in turn, challenges the district court's ruling\n\nagainst him, arguing that he could seek an award under the Hyde\n\nAmendment pursuant to the procedures and limitations of 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2412(b) instead of § 2412(d), thereby eliminating the net worth\n\nlimitation and entitling him to recovery.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          We initially determine the legal issue raised in\n\nKnott's cross-appeal from the district court's dismissal of his\n\nclaim for fees under the Hyde Amendment on the ground that his\n\n                                  -11-\n\fnet worth renders him ineligible for an award of fees.        At issue\n\nis whether the Hyde Amendment's incorporation of the \"procedures\n\nand limitations\" of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2412, encompasses all of the avenues to relief contained in §\n\n2412, or simply refers to the procedures and limitations imposed\n\nin § 2412(d).\n\n          The Hyde Amendment provides that fee awards \"shall be\n\ngranted pursuant to the procedures and limitations (but not the burden\n\nof proof) provided for an award under section 2412 of [the Equal Access\n\nto Justice Act] . . . .\"    111 Stat. at 2519.   Section 2412 of the\n\nEAJA, however, provides for the award of attorneys' fees in two\n\nseparate subsections, each containing different procedures and\n\nlimitations.\n\n          EAJA Subsection 2412(b) provides for the recovery of\n\nattorneys' fees against the United States, not by supplying an\n\nindependent basis for recovering fees, but instead by subjecting\n\nthe United States to other existing provisions which allow\n\nrecovery of fees against private parties in the civil context.\n\nIt provides that \"a court may award reasonable fees and expenses\n\nof attorneys, in addition to [costs], to the prevailing party in\n\nany civil action brought by or against the United States . . .\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f. The United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses\n\nto the same extent that any other party would be liable under\n\nthe    common   law    or    under     the   terms    of    any    statute     which\n\nspecifically provides for such an award.\"                  28 U.S.C. § 2412(b).\n\nAwards under § 2412(b) are limited, of course, by the standards\n\nof the common law or the terms of the incorporated statutory\n\nprovision upon which the award is based, just as an award\n\nagainst a private party would be, but § 2412(b) itself does not\n\notherwise provide procedures for or limitations upon fee awards\n\nunder the EAJA.\n\n             EAJA     Subsection       2412(d)     supplies        an   additional\n\nsubstantive basis for a civil party to recover fees against the\n\nUnited States.        It provides that \"a court shall award [fees and\n\nexpenses] to a prevailing party . . . unless the court finds\n\nthat   the   position       of   the   United      States    was     substantially\n\njustified.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).                 Unlike § 2412(b), §\n\n2412(d) itself subjects fee awards to certain procedures and\n\nlimitations.          An    individual       may   not     recover      fees   under\n\nsubsection (d) if his individual net worth exceeds $2 million\n\n(nor can a corporation, if its net worth exceeds $7 million and\n\nit has more than 500 employees). See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(B).\n\n                                        -13-\n\fIn addition, subsection (d) caps the hourly rate at which an\n\naward may be granted at $125.       28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(2)(A).           Knott\n\nconcedes that he would be ineligible under the $2 million net\n\nworth limitation, but contests its applicability.\n\n           The district court rejected Knott's argument that he\n\nis not subject to the net worth limitation or the cap on hourly\n\nrates because defendants may elect to proceed under either 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2412(b) or (d).    The district court concluded that the\n\nprocedures    and   limitations   of     EAJA    §   2412(d)    applied    to\n\napplications for fees under the Hyde Amendment for two main\n\nreasons.     First, the district court reasoned that allowing\n\ndefendants to elect to proceed under § 2412(b) would effectively\n\nread the clause \"under the procedures and limitations of section\n\n2412\" out of the Hyde Amendment.             Second, the district court,\n\nconfronted with two interpretations of the statute, construed it\n\nnarrowly in accord with the principle that waivers of sovereign\n\nimmunity are to be construed narrowly.            See 106 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n177-78.\n\n           The   district   court      was     correct   to    require    fee\n\napplicants to meet the eligibility requirements of EAJA §\n\n2412(d).     The Hyde Amendment expressly adopts \"procedures and\n\n                                  -14-\n\flimitations\" from the EAJA.                 We hold that this reference\n\nincorporates the \"procedures and limitations\" contained in EAJA\n\n§ 2412(d).    Accord United States v Ranger Elec. Communications,\n\nInc., 210 F.3d 627, 632-33 (6th Cir. 2000).\n\n            Knott's      suggested    reading      of   the    Hyde   Amendment\n\nundercuts the language of the provision and policy concerns\n\nunderlying     the       incorporation       of     these      procedures   and\n\nlimitations.        If defendants could elect to proceed under §\n\n2412(b), as Knott argues, it is not clear that the Hyde\n\nAmendment's incorporation of \"procedures and limitations\" from\n\nthe EAJA would have any practical effect.                     In order to give\n\nmeaningful effect to the plain language of the Hyde Amendment,\n\nthen, the incorporation is best read to refer to the limitations\n\ncontained in EAJA § 2412(d).\n\n            This is particularly so given that, unlike EAJA §\n\n2412(d),     EAJA    §   2412(b)     does    not    supply     an   independent\n\nsubstantive ground upon which to recover fees, instead directing\n\napplicants to other bases providing a remedy of attorneys' fees,\n\nincluding     their      procedures     and       limitations,      and   simply\n\nsubjecting the United States to the same obligations regarding\n\nattorneys' fees as private parties. Because EAJA § 2412(b) does\n\n                                      -15-\n\fnot provide a complete and independent ground for a fee award\n\nbut instead affords relief only by reference to otherwise\n\nexisting avenues to recover fees, it would create a peculiar\n\ncircularity to allow a defendant relying on the Hyde Amendment\n\nas the substantive basis of a request for attorneys' fees to\n\nelect to proceed through EAJA § 2412(b) in order to avoid the\n\nlimitations imposed in EAJA § 2412(d), given that the Hyde\n\nAmendment itself incorporates the procedures and limitations of\n\nthe EAJA.    See Ranger Elec. Communications, 210 F.3d at 633.\n\n            Finally, the fact that the Hyde Amendment waives\n\nsovereign immunity and the policy concerns regarding the impact\n\nof awarding fees in the criminal context, as reflected in the\n\nlegislative history of the Amendment, both counsel in favor of\n\nnarrowly construing the Amendment, and therefore incorporating\n\nthe procedures and limitations of EAJA § 2412(d).        In order to\n\nmake best sense of the language of the statute, then, we\n\nconclude that the procedures and limitations referenced are\n\nthose laid out in § 2412(d).\n\n                                 III.\n\n            We next address the government's appeal from the award of\n\nattorneys' fees in favor of Riverdale Mills.\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fA.   The Hyde Amendment Legal Standard\n\n           Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment in 1997 in response to\n\nperceived instances of prosecutorial abuse by the United States. See\n\nUnited States v. Gilbert, 198 F.3d 1293, 1299-1303 (11th Cir. 1999)\n\n(reviewing legislative history). The purpose of the Amendment was to\n\nallow defendants to recover attorney's fees and costs in cases of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. Id. The provision provides that a district\n\ncourt may award attorneys' fees and other costs to a prevailing\n\ndefendant \"where the court finds that the position of the United States\n\nwas vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith, unless the court finds that\n\nspecial circumstances make such an award unjust. Such awards shall be\n\ngranted pursuant to the procedures and limitations (but not the burden\n\nof proof) provided for an award under [the Equal Access to Justice Act]\n\n. . . .\"    111 Stat. at 2519.\n\n           The Hyde Amendment was patterned after the Equal Access to\n\nJustice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412, which provides for an award of\n\nattorney's fees against the United States in civil cases. The Hyde\n\nAmendment differs in at least two important respects. First, it raises\n\nthe standard for awarding fees. The Hyde Amendment allows recovery by\n\nprevailing criminal defendants only where the position of the United\n\nStates was \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith,\" in contrast to the\n\nEAJA, which authorizes an award to a prevailing civil party in any case\n\nwhere the position of the United States was not \"substantially\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fjustified,\" see 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A). Indeed, the legislative\n\nhistory of the Hyde Amendment shows that in drafting the provision,\n\nCongress considered and rejected as too easily met both the \"not\n\nsubstantially justified\" standard of the EAJA and a standard (modeled\n\nafter the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(d)(2)(B)) which would have awarded fees, inter alia, where the\n\nUnited States' position was \"without foundation.\" See Gilbert, 198\n\nF.3d at 1301-02. Second, unlike the EAJA, the Hyde Amendment places\n\nthe burden of proof on the defendant to demonstrate that the\n\ngovernment's position was \"vexatious,\" \"frivolous,\" or \"in bad faith.\"\n\nSee id.\n\n          In construing and applying statutory terms, we begin by\n\nexamining the language of the statute itself. See, e.g., Bailey v.\n\nUnited States, 516 U.S. 137, 144 (1995).      The words \"vexatious,\n\nfrivolous, or in bad faith\" are not defined in the statute. In such\n\ncircumstances, courts typically read statutory terms to convey their\n\nordinary meaning, see, e.g., Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1298 (citing Chapman\n\nv. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 462 (1991)), including as reflected in\n\ndictionary definitions, see, e.g., Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v.\n\nWest Virginia Dep't of Health & Human Servs., --- U.S. ---, 121 S. Ct.\n\n1835, 1839 (2001) (relying on definition of \"prevailing party\" in\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary); id. at 1846 (Scalia, J., concurring). Black's\n\nLaw Dictionary defines the term \"vexatious\" -- the term at issue in\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fthis case -- to mean \"without reasonable or probable cause or excuse;\n\nharassing; annoying.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1559 (7th ed. 1999). It\n\nfurther defines \"vexatious suit\" to mean a \"lawsuit instituted\n\nmaliciously and without good cause.\" Id. Standard English-language\n\ndictionaries give the term similar meaning. See, e.g., Webster's Third\n\nNew Int'l Dictionary 2548 (3d ed. 1961) (defining \"vexatious\" to mean,\n\ninter alia, \"lacking justification and intended to harass\"); 19 Oxford\n\nEnglish Dictionary 596 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"vexatious\" for legal\n\npurposes as \"[i]nstituted without sufficient grounds for the purpose of\n\ncausing trouble or annoyance to the defendant\").\n\n          Circuit courts construing the Hyde Amendment have varied in\n\ninterpreting the term \"vexatious.\" The Gilbert court, for instance,\n\nrelies on a definition of \"vexatious\" as \"without reasonable or\n\nprobable cause or excuse.\" See 198 F.3d at 1298-99; accord In re 1997\n\nGrand Jury, 215 F.3d 430, 436 (4th Cir. 2000). By contrast, the Ninth\n\nCircuit, in United States v. Sherburne, 249 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 2001),\n\nheld that a finding of vexatiousness under the Hyde Amendment requires\n\nboth a determination that the prosecution was \"objectively deficient\"\n\nin that it \"lack[ed] merit\" and a finding that the prosecution\n\npossessed \"an element of maliciousness, or an intent to harass.\" Id.\n\nat 1126. The Sherburne court referred to the finding that the suit\n\nlacked merit as an \"objective\" component of vexatiousness and the\n\nfinding that the suit was prosecuted with some subjective malice or\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fintent to harass or annoy as a \"subjective\" component. Id. at 1127.\n\nOther courts have utilized a standard more amenable to the party\n\nseeking fees. See United States v. Holland, 34 F. Supp. 2d 346 (E.D.\n\nVa. 1999) (framing the inquiry as \"whether a reasonable prosecutor\n\nshould have concluded that the applicable law and the available\n\nevidence were insufficient to prove the defendants' guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and, if so, was the continuation of the prosecution\n\nvexatious\").\n\n          We hold that a determination that a prosecution was\n\n\"vexatious\" for the purposes of the Hyde Amendment requires both a\n\nshowing that the criminal case was objectively deficient, in that it\n\nlacked either legal merit or factual foundation, and a showing that the\n\ngovernment's conduct, when viewed objectively, manifests maliciousness\n\nor an intent to harass or annoy. Such a reading best comports with the\n\nlanguage employed by Congress in the Amendment. This is especially so\n\nwhen considered in the context of Congress's concern to protect against\n\nprosecutorial misconduct while at the same time providing a\n\nsufficiently stringent standard to avoid undermining appropriate\n\nprosecutorial zeal.\n\n          The standard implied by the district court and advanced\n\nby the defendants -- that \"vexatious\" conduct can be shown\n\nsimply by showing that the charges brought by the United States\n\nwere ultimately determined to be without either evidentiary or\n\n                                 -20-\n\flegal foundation -- does not adequately account for Congress's\n\nefforts to limit Hyde Amendment awards to cases of affirmative\n\nprosecutorial misconduct rather than simply any prosecution\n\nwhich failed.     As the Gilbert court notes, \"[i]n prosecuting\n\ncrime, government attorneys are entitled to be zealous advocates\n\nof the law on behalf of their client, the people of the United\n\nStates.    While a prosecutor is not at liberty to strike foul\n\nblows, he may strike hard ones, and '[h]e may prosecute with\n\nearnestness and vigor -- indeed, he should do so.'\"          198 F.3d at\n\n1303 (quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935)).\n\n           The structure of the statute also militates against\n\nresting vexatiousness simply upon a finding that the prosecution\n\nlacked    \"any   credible   evidence.\"      It   may   be   that   if     the\n\ngovernment   pursued   a    position   so   obviously   wrong      that    no\n\nreasonable prosecutor could have supported it, the defendant\n\nwould be entitled to a fee award under the Hyde Amendment.\n\nWithout a finding of bad faith or improper motive, however, if\n\nthe government pursues a prosecution without any foundation or\n\nbasis for belief that it might prevail, such a prosecution would\n\nmore appropriately be deemed \"frivolous\" than \"vexatious.\"\n\nReading \"vexatious\" to encompass such a case would render it\n\n                                 -21-\n\fsynonymous with \"frivolous,\" thus improperly rendering the term\n\nmere surplusage.\n\n         Finally, awarding fees upon a determination that the\n\nprosecution lacked sufficient evidence does not accord with the\n\nlegislative history of the Hyde Amendment.      In rejecting the\n\n\"not substantially justified\" formulation of the EAJA and the\n\n\"without foundation\" formulation of the Firearms Act, Congress\n\nsought   narrow    language   \"meant   to   sanction   and   deter\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, not prosecutorial zealousness per se.\"\n\nGilbert, 198 F.3d at 1304.5 The Hyde Amendment's shifting of the\n\nburden of proof also reflects this concern.      The alternative\n\nconstruction urged by the defendants would burden the United\n\nStates with the threat of a large number of fee applications\n\narising from circumstances quite different than those against\n\nwhich Congress sought to protect.\n\n\n\n\n    5     Indeed, though the Gilbert court provides a definition\nfor \"vexatious\" that does not explicitly require improper\nmotive, it assesses the government's conduct in light of all\nthree elements that would support a Hyde Amendment award\nsimultaneously, so it is not entirely clear how the court would\napply \"vexatious\" in isolation. The court does note that the\nHyde Amendment was \"targeted at prosecutorial misconduct, not\nprosecutorial mistake.\" 198 F.3d at 1304.\n\n                               -22-\n\f           To make best sense of the statutory language and in\n\nlight of the purposes embodied in the Hyde Amendment, we\n\nconclude   that   something    more     than   simply   an   inadequate\n\nevidentiary foundation is required to demonstrate that the\n\nprosecution was \"vexatious\" within the meaning of the Hyde\n\nAmendment -- that is, some finding of malice or improper\n\nmotivation is required.6 After all, there is an alternate ground\n\n\n     6    In requiring this element of malice or improper motive,\nwe recognize that our construction of \"vexatious\" here differs\nfrom the way the term is construed in the Title VII context.\nSee Tang v. Rhode Island Dep't of Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 13 (1st\nCir. 1998) (\"A district court may in its discretion award attorney's\nfees to a prevailing defendant . . . upon a finding that the\nplaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation,\neven though not brought in subjective bad faith.\") (quoting\nChristiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421 (1978)). Like\nthe Sherburne court, we conclude that the context differs in\nmaterial ways, most importantly in that, because the Hyde\nAmendment addresses fees in the criminal context, Congress\nenacted it against a background in which courts have no inherent\npower to award fees. See Sherburne, 249 F.3d at 1127 n.5.\n     Defendants also point to common law awards of attorneys'\nfees, where \"vexatious\" litigation need not always require subjective\nbad faith in order to justify a fee award. See Local 285 v. Nonotuck\nRes. Assocs., 64 F.3d 735, 737-38 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that\nsubjective bad faith is not a prerequisite to a fee award under the\ncommon law); but cf. Rivera Morales v. Benitez de Rexach, 541 F.2d 882\n(1st Cir. 1976) (overturning common law fee award where there was no\nfinding that defendants acted in bad faith). This reliance on\noccasional cases from a civil context which did not require subjective\nbad faith ignores the peculiar concern, unique to the criminal context,\nthat the drafters of the Hyde Amendment had to avoid chilling\nlegitimate prosecutions. In addition, common law fee awards involve a\nfull-blown equitable analysis and depend on the discretion of the\ncourt, a requirement overlooked in the attempt to draw a parallel to\n\n                                 -23-\n\fin the statute to award fees where an action is frivolous.         In\n\nrequiring that the government's conduct manifest malice or an\n\nintent to harass or annoy in order to be \"vexatious,\" however, we do\n\nnot intend an inquiry into subjective intent, and we reject the\n\napproach of Sherburne to the extent it suggests that such attention to\n\nsubjective motivations is required. Rather, the issue is whether the\n\ngovernment's conduct, when viewed objectively, manifests, or is\n\ntantamount to, malice or an intent to harass or annoy. Cf. Braley v.\n\nCampbell, 832 F.2d 1504, 1512 (10th Cir. 1987) (en banc) (rejecting\n\nsubjective intent standard \"as virtually impossible to apply\" for fee\n\nawards under 28 U.S.C. § 1927).7\n\nB.   Evidence of Malice or Intent to Harass or Annoy\n\n          The district court here did not make any express\n\nfindings that the government's actions in this case manifested\n\nmalice or an intent to harass or annoy, resting its fee award\n\n\nthe Hyde Amendment awards at issue here.\n     7    The Supreme Court has expressly rejected an inquiry\ninto subjective intent in deciding questions of official\nimmunity in the law enforcement context, replacing it with an\nobjective inquiry into the legal reasonableness of the official\naction. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815-20 (1982);\nsee also Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 811-13 (1996)\n(rejecting subjective intent test in Fourth Amendment context).\nIt would be odd if against this background Congress intended an\ninquiry into the subjective motivations of prosecutors under the\nvexatiousness standard of the Hyde Amendment. We do not address\nwhether the \"bad faith\" test requires a subjective inquiry.\n\n                                -24-\n\finstead on the purported absence of credible evidence to support\n\nthe charges.    Under the standard articulated here, the absence\n\nof objective evidence of such improper motive renders the fee\n\naward inappropriate.       The district court did, however, identify\n\nand criticize isolated conduct of the EPA and prosecution, and\n\ndefendants     suggest   that   this     conduct   suffices      to     prove\n\nvexatiousness and support the award in any event.\n\n         Defendants point to an array of government conduct both\n\nbefore the indictment and during litigation in an effort to\n\ndemonstrate that the prosecution was indeed vexatious. As\n\ndefendants contend, it is permissible for courts to consider the\n\nconduct of the investigation in order to provide a context in\n\nwhich to assess whether a prosecution was \"vexatious\" within the\n\nterms of the Hyde Amendment.          However, the alleged conduct in\n\nthis case, whether taken independently or collectively, either\n\nlacks sufficient record support or fails to rise to the level of\n\nconduct required to find vexatiousness.            Therefore this tacit\n\nargument that the government proceeded with improper purposes\n\ndoes not succeed.    We address the contentions in turn.\n\n         First,     defendants    point    to    the     district     court's\n\nconclusion   that   some    samples    taken    during    the   October    21\n\n                                  -25-\n\finspection of the site exceeded the scope of the permission\n\ngiven by Knott.     The validity of the order suppressing the\n\nafternoon samples is not before us, but the issue was close and\n\nthe ultimate decision to suppress the evidence was by no means\n\na foregone conclusion.    In any event, the mere fact that EPA\n\ninspectors took samples exceeding the scope of permission hardly\n\nwarrants an inference that their conduct was vexatious; their\n\nconduct could just as well have rested on an honest mistake of\n\nfact or misapprehension of the authority they had been granted,\n\na possibility suggested by the fact that they subsequently\n\nprovided a split sample from that afternoon to the defendants.\n\n          Second,   defendants   seize   on   the   district   court's\n\ndetermination that there was \"credible evidence\" that the\n\nannotation of some of the sampling results had been altered;\n\nthey contend that such alteration is evidence of governmental\n\nabuse.   As an initial matter, there is little evidence in the\n\nrecord that any of the annotations were altered apart from the\n\n4 pH reading at Manhole #2 on October 21.           Putting aside the\n\nquestion of support in the record, even assuming dubitante that\n\nsome of the sample readings were deliberately and erroneously\n\nre-recorded, that alone would not necessarily be enough to\n\n                                 -26-\n\festablish vexatious prosecution where properly recorded samples\n\nshowed a violation.   But here the district court did not render\n\nany findings as to the reasons why annotations were changed,\n\njust that there was \"credible evidence\" that they may have been.\n\nThe annotations in the log may have been written over for any\n\nnumber of reasons, some as benign as the correction of a\n\nmistake.    Nor is there any record evidence suggesting any\n\nimproper conduct in recording the sample results. Even assuming\n\nthat the fact of some alterations is supported in the record,\n\nsince the existence of the purported alterations is equally open\n\nto benign and malign interpretations on the present record, it\n\nhardly provides sufficient evidence of vexatious conduct.\n\n           Third, defendants charge that the EPA agents continued\n\nto take readings at Manhole #1 despite their awareness of\n\nKnott's claim to ownership of the sewer line under Riverdale\n\nStreet, and subsequently prosecuted them largely on the basis of\n\npH readings taken at Manhole #1.      This charge does not support\n\nany determination of vexatiousness.     The question of ownership\n\nof the sewer under Riverdale Street, as discussed further below,\n\nwas open to reasonable dispute, and the EPA was entitled to\n\npursue charges based on discharges at the first manhole so long\n\n                               -27-\n\fas it had a legal argument that the public sewer began there.\n\nMore importantly, as discussed below, the pH level of discharges\n\nat Manhole #1 provides relevant evidence of violations even if\n\nthe public sewer begins at Manhole #2, regardless of ownership.\n\n         Next, defendants contend that the fact that the EPA and\n\nthe U.S. Attorney issued press releases following the indictment\n\nreveals malice.    The press releases simply state that the\n\ndefendants were indicted and describe the charges for which the\n\nindictments were issued.     Such standard press releases do not\n\nsuggest any intent to vex.\n\n         Defendants also contend that vexatiousness is shown by\n\nthe government's failure to produce automatically some evidence\n\nthe court deemed exculpatory, where such production is required\n\nby a local court rule.     The court deemed a certain log to be\n\nexculpatory because it showed a series of pH readings at Manhole\n\n#2 above 5.0 s.u. on the morning of November 7.        While the\n\ngovernment is correct that the existence of some discharges\n\nwithin the legal limit is not clearly exculpatory, the better\n\npractice would have been for the government to produce the logs\n\nas part of automatic discovery given the local rule.    However,\n\nin this case, the logs were turned over in a timely fashion upon\n\n                               -28-\n\fa discovery request from the defendants, and the short delay did\n\nnot prejudice the defendants.            In these circumstances, given\n\nthat the exculpatory nature of the evidence is questionable, the\n\nfailure to produce the evidence automatically does not amount to\n\nvexatious behavior within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment.\n\n            Defendants    also   claim    that   the   government   unduly\n\ndelayed dismissing the case following the district court's\n\nsuppression order.       The district court ruled on the suppression\n\nmotion on February 16, 1999; the government moved to dismiss the\n\ncase on April 23, 1999.      Such a delay does not suggest vexatious\n\nconduct.    The government is entitled to weigh carefully whether\n\nor not to appeal the exclusion of evidence and to assess\n\ncarefully whether or not to continue the case in the absence of\n\nthe excluded evidence.      In doing so, the government is engaging\n\nin precisely the sort of prosecutorial decisionmaking that is\n\nits business, and assessing the strength of the remaining case\n\nrequires some consideration.       Indeed, the decision here to move\n\nfor a dismissal of the indictment was by no means preordained by\n\nthe suppression order, as the government had evidence with which\n\nit might have pressed its case even without the excluded\n\nevidence.    We would not want the Hyde Amendment to deter the\n\n                                   -29-\n\fprosecution from exercising its discretion to dismiss cases\n\nwhere it concludes that prosecution is no longer warranted.\n\n            Finally, defendants contend that the manner in which\n\nthe   EPA   executed   the   November   7   search   warrant   evinces\n\nvexatiousness.    The district court stated that the EPA brought\n\n\"a virtual 'SWAT team'\" to conduct the search and that the\n\nagents involved engaged in \"humiliating\" conduct.         (The search\n\ninvolved the presence of 21 agents, some armed, who interviewed\n\nand videotaped employees.)      106 F. Supp. 2d at 180.        However,\n\nany conclusion that the EPA agents engaged in unwarranted\n\nbehavior in executing the search is not supported by the record.\n\nThe affidavits of Knott and Agent Creavin contain conflicting\n\nstatements regarding the search.        But even crediting all of\n\nKnott's sworn allegations regarding the search, the conduct of\n\nthe search does not amount to vexatious conduct.        Knott alleges\n\nthat the EPA brought 21 agents, some armed, that they engaged in\n\n\"outrageous and disruptive\" behavior in conducting the search,\n\nand that some of the seized documents were outside the scope of\n\nthe search warrant.    In an unsworn letter to the assistant U.S.\n\nattorney, Knott supplemented these charges, contending that the\n\nEPA did not show him the search warrant until the premises were\n\n                                 -30-\n\fsecured, that they interviewed Riverdale Mills employees both\n\nduring the search and later in the day at their homes, that\n\nthese interviews were videotaped, and that in one instance the\n\nagent holding the video camera held it too close to the face of\n\nthe interviewee until another agent asked him to back up.\n\n         None of these contentions -- apart from the conclusory\n\ncharacterization of the conduct as \"outrageous\" -- set forth\n\nconduct that is properly deemed vexatious, at least absent more\n\nspecific facts.    There is nothing untoward about criminal\n\ninvestigative agents of the EPA wearing holstered firearms while\n\nin the field, nor about securing premises before showing the\n\nsearch warrant.   That the EPA wanted to interview Riverdale\n\nMills employees is also hardly surprising, as is the fact that\n\nthe EPA wanted to record the interviews.   It was, after all, a\n\ntip from an employee which started the whole investigation, and\n\nit appears that the employees knew the pretreatment system was\n\nnot operating as required, and that Knott was aware of this.\n\nThe record does not reflect any misconduct in the manner in\n\nwhich the interviews were carried out, or even provide any\n\nreason to suspect it, and the defendants opted not to provide\n\naffidavits from the interviewed employees. On the record before\n\n                              -31-\n\fthe court, there was no basis to find that the EPA engaged in\n\nsuch unwarranted conduct in executing the warrant as to render\n\nits behavior vexatious within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment.8\n\n          The record simply does not reflect the sort of malice\n\nor prosecutorial misconduct toward which the Hyde Amendment was\n\ndirected. While the government might have handled itself better\n\nin some of these instances, that does not render its conduct\n\n\"vexatious.\"     Rather,   an   award   of   fees   for   \"vexatious\"\n\nprosecution under the Hyde Amendment requires some evidence upon\n\nwhich a reasonable observer can conclude that the prosecution\n\nwas based in malice or an intent to harass or annoy.             The\n\ndistrict court erred as a matter of law in applying a legal\n\nstandard that would award fees under the Hyde Amendment in any\n\ncase where the prosecution is ultimately deemed to have been\n\nwithout sufficient foundation.\n\nC.   Evidence to Support Prosecution\n\n          Of equal importance is that the district court's\n\nfinding that there was no \"credible evidence\" upon which to\n\npursue charges was clear error. The government had ample reason\n\n\n\n     8    We bypass the question of whether one vexatious raid\nwould render the pursuit of a criminal case \"vexatious.\"\n\n                                -32-\n\fto investigate and pursue charges against the defendants, and\n\nindeed still had adequate cause to prosecute even after the\n\nsuppression of evidence. Thus an award of attorneys' fees under\n\nthe Hyde Amendment is clearly not warranted, given the failure\n\nto meet the first part of the test of vexatiousness: that the\n\ngovernment's    suit    lacked    either     legal    merit    or     factual\n\nfoundation.\n\n         The EPA had ample reason to initiate an investigation\n\nof Knott and Riverdale Mills.          In the summer of 1997, the EPA\n\nreceived an anonymous letter from an employee of the company\n\nindicating    that   the    company    was   not     complying      with    the\n\npretreatment requirements set out in its agreement with the\n\nstate, as embodied in its state permit to discharge industrial\n\nwastewater into the public sewer.         Upon arriving to investigate\n\nthis allegation on October 21, the EPA inspectors observed that,\n\ncontrary to Knott's alleged representation that morning, the\n\npretreatment system at the plant was not in operation.                Indeed,\n\nalthough at the closing conference on the afternoon of October\n\n21, the EPA inspectors discussed with Knott the fact that the\n\npretreatment   system      was   not   operational     and    that    low    pH\n\ndischarges into the public sewer were occurring as a result,\n\n                                   -33-\n\fwhen the EPA returned to conduct the November 7 search, the\n\npretreatment   system    was   still   not   operating   properly.\n\nInterviews with Riverdale Mills employees that day confirmed\n\nthat the pretreatment system had been out of operation for\n\nseveral months and that Knott was aware that it was not\n\nfunctioning.      Defendants do not contest the fact that the\n\npretreatment system was not in operation on either day but\n\nrather resort to arguments that other processes would dilute the\n\nwastewater before it reached the public sewer.\n\n         In addition, there was considerable direct evidence of\n\na Clean Water Act violation.       As defendants acknowledge, a\n\nsingle knowing discharge of wastewater with pH below 5.0 s.u.\n\ninto the public sewer is sufficient to prosecute as a Clean\n\nWater Act violation.    Here, at the time the government sought\n\nthe indictment, it had over fifty samples that it considered\n\ndirect evidence of discharges below pH 5.0 s.u.     For the first\n\ncount, covering October 21, the EPA had 13 samples from Manhole\n\n#1 below pH 3.0 s.u. and one disputed sample at Manhole #2 at pH\n\naround 4.0 s.u.    For the second count, covering November 7, the\n\nEPA had over 40 samples below pH 5.0 s.u., including three below\n\npH 3.0 s.u., all taken at Manhole #1.\n\n                               -34-\n\f           The district court discounted much of this evidence as\n\nimmaterial, giving two reasons: first, much of it resulted from\n\nsamples taken at Manhole #1; and second, much of it was later\n\nsuppressed.    The decision not to consider the government's\n\nevidence taken at Manhole #1 is flawed, in two respects. First,\n\nat the time the government sought the indictment, the ownership\n\nof the street where Manhole #1 is located remained in dispute,\n\nand the government had a good faith legal argument that the\n\nrelevant point of discharge into the public sewers was the first\n\nmanhole.   Therefore it was entitled to pursue charges based on\n\ndischarges at Manhole #1.\n\n           More importantly, the district court's decision to\n\ndisregard the sampling results at Manhole #1 misapprehends or\n\nignores the relationship between sampling data collected at the\n\nfirst manhole and the acidity of Riverdale Mills's discharges\n\ninto the public sewer, even if the public sewer begins only at\n\nthe second manhole. The prosecution had ample evidence that the\n\ndefendant discharged highly acidic water at the first manhole on\n\nboth days.    Even if the relevant public sewer does not begin\n\nuntil the second manhole 100 yards away, these samples still\n\nprovide evidence that the water ultimately discharged by the\n\n                               -35-\n\fdefendants at the second manhole had a highly acidic content.\n\nThat   is    particularly     so   in    light   of    the    EPA   expert's\n\nconclusions.      The EPA was not required to accept Knott's lay\n\ntheory, not even advanced on appeal, that the slope of the pipes\n\nover that 100 yard distance ensured that pulses of highly acidic\n\nwater would inevitably be neutralized by mixing with pulses of\n\nhighly caustic water before they both hit Manhole #2.                Nor was\n\nthe EPA required to accept the later-advanced theory that the\n\npipes were subject to so much groundwater infiltration that the\n\ngroundwater would dilute the effluent down to an acceptable\n\nlevel over the short distance of 100 yards.            By overlooking the\n\nbearing which the pH readings at the first manhole have on the\n\nacidity     of   discharges   at   the    second,     the    district   court\n\ncommitted clear error.\n\n            The defendants argue that the district court is free\n\nto accept or reject the conclusions of the EPA expert who stated\n\nthat the groundwater infiltration rate would not sufficiently\n\ndilute highly acidic water within the 100 yard span of the sewer\n\nline under Riverdale Street.        While this assertion may be true\n\nas to the ultimate factual determination, it misses the issue at\n\nstake in the application for fees under the Hyde Amendment,\n\n                                   -36-\n\fwhich is whether the EPA was vexatious in deciding to proceed in\n\nits prosecution.      Even if the court or jury did not ultimately\n\ncredit the EPA expert's conclusions, there is no evidence in the\n\nrecord to suggest that that expert was so wantonly and obviously\n\nwrong    that   the   EPA   was   not   entitled   to   rely   upon   his\n\ndeterminations in proceeding. Indeed his determination may well\n\nbe correct. For these reasons, the evidence of samples below pH\n\n3.0 s.u. at Manhole #1 remains credible evidence upon which the\n\nEPA was entitled to pursue charges.\n\n            Second, in concluding that the prosecution lacked \"any\n\ncredible evidence,\" the district court erroneously discounted\n\nall     the evidence that it had suppressed.       For Hyde Amendment\n\npurposes, however, the court must assess the basis for pursuing\n\ncharges from the perspective of the government at the time.\n\nInstead, the district court required undue prescience on the\n\npart of the government. The government was entitled, ab initio,\n\nto rely on the evidence subsequently suppressed in making its\n\nprosecutorial decision, provided it could articulate, in good\n\nfaith, a reasonable position on the suppression issue.\n\n            There were genuine factual disputes regarding what\n\nhappened on October 21, and the conditions which were imposed\n\n                                   -37-\n\fupon the consent to the EPA inspection were, at the very least,\n\nambiguous.    The government was entitled to rely on its evidence\n\nso long as it had a good-faith basis for contending that the\n\nevidence was admissible.        The suppression issue presented here\n\nwas not so clear cut as to deprive the prosecution of a\n\nreasonable basis for believing that its evidence was admissible.\n\nAn interpretation of the Hyde Amendment which effectively\n\nrequires     the   government     precisely    to    anticipate    later\n\nevidentiary rulings, where reasonable grounds for disagreement\n\nexist, is untenable in light of the language and purposes of the\n\nHyde Amendment.\n\n           Indeed,   even   after    the   suppression   ruling,   there\n\nremained an adequate evidentiary foundation for the prosecution,\n\nat least as concerns the second count.               There were three\n\nreadings below pH 3.0 at the first manhole on November 7, each\n\nof which, in conjunction with the testimony of the EPA expert,\n\ncould provide an adequate foundation for a Clean Water Act\n\ncharge.      In addition, the EPA directly observed that the\n\npretreatment system was not in operation on either day, as\n\ncorroborated through employee interviews.           Moreover, there was\n\nevidence the system had not been in operation for some time,\n\n                                    -38-\n\fwhich Knott well knew.     Although the EPA ultimately concluded\n\nthat it would not proceed, there remained credible evidence to\n\nsupport a prosecution.    Weighing the strength of the evidence\n\nand determining whether or not to prosecute are precisely the\n\nsorts of choices the government is entitled to make, based on\n\ninformation it has acquired through due diligence.\n\n         Since the EPA had a reasonably sufficient evidentiary\n\nbasis upon which to pursue charges against the defendants, both\n\nbefore and even after the suppression ruling, and absent any\n\nfinding or reason to believe that the government acted either\n\nout of malice or with any intent to harass or annoy, the fee\n\naward to Riverdale Mills constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n                                IV.\n\n         For these reasons, we affirm the denial of fees to\n\nKnott, reverse the grant of fees to Riverdale Mills, and remand\n\nthe application for fees under the Hyde Amendment to the\n\ndistrict court for dismissal, with prejudice.\n\n         So ordered.     No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                               -39-\n\f",

No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2519 (1997), reprinted in 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3006A (statutory note). The district court awarded $68,726.00 in fees to Riverdale Mills, which had been one defendant in a criminal prosecution for violation of the Clean Water Act, and denied fees to James Knott, the other defendant. The government voluntarily dismissed the action after the district court suppressed some of the prosecution's evidence. The district court awarded fees on the grounds that the government's prosecution was \"vexatious.\" We reverse the award of fees to Riverdale Mills and affirm the denial of fees to Knott.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale Mills Corporation and its principal owner, James Knott, operate a plant in Northbridge, Massachusetts, that manufactures plastic-coated steel wire mesh. The production involves two processes, one producing rather acidic wastewater, and the other producing quite caustic (i.e., alkaline) wastewater. Riverdale Mills ultimately discharges this industrial waste into the public sewer owned by the Town of Northbridge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clean Water Act prohibits the indirect discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States through publicly owned treatment works. 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1317(b)(1). The implementing regulations for the Act prohibit the discharge of wastewater with a pH below 5.0 standard units (\"s.u.\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> into publicly owned sewer systems. 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 403.5(b)(2). Any person who \"knowingly\" violates these standards is subject to felony prosecution. 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1319(c)(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale Mills's state permit for discharging its waste into the public sewer states that Riverdale Mills will ensure that the wastewater falls within acceptable limits by combining the two streams inside the plant so that the caustic water neutralizes the acidic water, and then further neutralizing the waste by adding a caustic soda. Following this pretreatment, on the design in the permit, the now- combined wastewaters would flow intermittently through an effluent pipe to a manhole outside the building on Riverdale Street (Manhole #1), where it joins a sewer pipe. The discharge then would flow through that sewer pipe approximately 100 yards to a second manhole (Manhole #2), where the pipe joins the public sewer line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on an anonymous tip that this pretreatment system was not in operation, two EPA civil inspectors went to Riverdale Mills for an unannounced inspection on October 21, 1997. The district court determined that Knott consented to the inspection, but determined on disputed facts that his consent was qualified by the express condition that the EPA inspectors be accompanied by Riverdale Mills representatives during the entire course of their inspection. Knott then accompanied the inspectors to Manhole #1, where they took two initial samples (neither below pH 5.0 s.u.) and observed only an intermittent discharge. Because of the intermittent nature of the discharge flow, the inspectors then allegedly informed Knott that they would have to conduct periodic sampling throughout the day. The group then embarked on a tour of the facility, during which the EPA inspectors discovered that, contrary to Knott's alleged statement that morning, the wastewater treatment facility at Riverdale Mills was not in operation. Apparently, the two wastewater streams were not being mixed in the treatment facility as intended because a valve was turned to the wrong position, and also the tank where caustic soda was to be added to the wastewater was being bypassed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early afternoon, the inspectors returned to Manhole #1, on the street in front of the plant and in the plain view of Riverdale Mills employees. There they took a series of samples, and those additional samples yielded pH readings ranging from 2.19 to 7.48 s.u., with thirteen of the fourteen samples showing extremely low pH readings (between 2.19 and 2.59 s.u.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court determined that the EPA inspectors were not accompanied by a Riverdale Mills representative for this sampling. The inspectors then returned to the plant and a Riverdale Mills employee completed their tour of the facilities. The EPA inspectors also gave a split sample from one of their afternoon samples to the employee, who signed the chain of custody form for it. At the EPA's closing conference with Knott, they discussed the low pH discharges, and Knott informed the EPA inspectors that he owned Riverdale Street and he claimed ownership of the sewer line under the street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving the plant, the EPA inspectors went to Manhole #2. This is where the \"private\" sewer line joined the municipal line, according to Knott's statement at the meeting. There the inspectors noted a second residential sewer line also joined at the manhole, seven feet below the Riverdale Mills line. Accordingly, they took three different samples at this site. One was from the discharge of the residential line, which the EPA says yielded a pH of approximately 7 s.u. One was from water standing in a trough at the manhole, which the EPA says yielded a pH around 7 s.u. The last one was from the discharge flowing from the Riverdale Mills line, which the EPA says yielded a pH of around 4 s.u. In their field log, the number \"4\" for this final measurement appears to be written over a \"7.\" (The district court later concluded that the recorded entry for that sample had been altered from its actual reading of 7 s.u.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this information, the EPA criminal division obtained a federal search warrant and conducted a second inspection on November 7, 1997. A large number of samples were taken at Manhole #1. Most had a pH below 5.0 s.u. and the samples worsened -- that is, became even more acidic -- as the day progressed. EPA agents also took seven samples in the morning at Manhole #2, and all had pH readings around 5.0 or 6.0 s.u. Again, the agents observed that the required pretreatment system at the Riverdale Mills plant was largely not operational; although on that day the two wastewater streams were mixing in the plant, the process adding caustic soda was still being bypassed. Plant employees told the EPA that the pretreatment system had not been in operation since sometime in the spring of 1997, and that Knott was aware that wastewater was being discharged without pretreatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1998, the EPA executed a second search warrant to measure the effects of groundwater infiltration between Manhole #1 and Manhole #2. This was done in response to Knott's claim that he owned the intervening sewer line and that by the time the wastewater reached the public sewer at Manhole #2, groundwater infiltration inevitably brought it within the legal limit. The EPA's expert concluded that even making assumptions favorable to Knott, any wastewater with a pH below 3.0 s.u. at the first manhole would reach the sewer line at the second manhole with a pH below 5.0 s.u.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 12, 1998, a federal grand jury indicted Knott and Riverdale Mills on two counts of violating the Clean Water Act by knowingly discharging industrial wastewater with a pH below 5.0 s.u. into a publicly owned treatment works on October 21 and November 7, 1997. Following the indictment, both the U.S. Attorney's office and the regional EPA issued standard press releases announcing the indictment and its allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 1998, Knott and Riverdale Mills moved to suppress evidence from the afternoon sampling on October 21, 1997 as the result of an unlawful search, and also to suppress the sampling obtained through the November 7 search warrant, as the fruit of the October 21 sampling. On February 16, 1999, the district court suppressed the sampling results from the afternoon of October 21, 1997, finding that the EPA inspectors exceeded the scope of Knott's consent when they sampled the wastewater stream without a Riverdale Mills representative present. However, the district court declined to suppress the evidence obtained on November 7, reasoning that even though the basis of the warrant was in part the October 21 afternoon sampling, the agents acted in good faith executing the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government sought leave of court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice on April 23, 1999, because in the course of preparing for trial, it determined that the suppression had substantially weakened its case and raised a question as to whether it could make a sufficiently compelling case to the jury to meet its burden of proof on the remaining evidence. Leave of the court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice was granted by the district court on May 6, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the dismissal of the indictment, Knott and Riverdale Mills filed a motion to recover reasonable attorneys' fees under the Hyde Amendment. The district court awarded attorneys' fees to Riverdale Mills as a prevailing party<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> because, in the view of the court, while the prosecution was neither frivolous nor in bad faith, it was \"clearly vexatious\" within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment. United States v. Knott, 106 F. Supp. 2d 174, 180 (D. Mass. 2000). The district court, relying in part on the Eleventh Circuit's decision in United States v. Gilbert, 198 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir. 1999), held that a defendant seeking fees under the Hyde Amendment must show that the government's legal position was asserted \"in bad faith or without any foundation or basis for belief that it might prevail\" and thus amounted to \"prosecutorial misconduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See 106 F.Supp.2d at 179 (quoting Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1303-04). The district court rested its conclusion that the prosecution here was \"vexatious\" on the court's belief that the government did not have \"any credible evidence\" to support the accusation that the defendants discharged waste with a pH below 5.0 s.u. into the public sewer. Id. To the contrary, the court concluded, the samples taken at the second manhole, \"the point of discharge into the public sewer,\" showed that Riverdale Mills \"was not in violation of the Clean Water Act.\" Id. The district court did not, however, find that the agents or prosecutors in this case acted maliciously, or with any particular personal motive to vex the defendants. The court rested instead simply on the purported absence of credible evidence, though it also discussed some alleged misconduct in the collection of samples and the conduct of searches. Accordingly, the court awarded fees in the sum of $68,726.00 to the company against the United States under the Hyde Amendment. Id. at 181. The court denied fees to Knott because his net worth exceeded $2 million, reasoning that the limitations of 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d) apply to the Hyde Amendment. Id. at 178.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals this fee award, arguing (1) that the court applied the wrong legal standard in defining vexatiousness, as it did not find any malice or intent to harass in the prosecution, but rather found only that the prosecution lacked foundation; (2) that the district court's conclusion that the prosecution lacked foundation was in clear error, as the government had ample evidence to prove the violations prior to the suppression ruling, and indeed it could have pursued the charges even on the evidence that remained after the court's suppression order; and (3) that the court erred in identifying certain isolated acts of government agents as evidence of vexatiousness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knott, in turn, challenges the district court's ruling against him, arguing that he could seek an award under the Hyde Amendment pursuant to the procedures and limitations of 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(b) instead of &#167;&#167; 2412(d), thereby eliminating the net worth limitation and entitling him to recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We initially determine the legal issue raised in Knott's cross-appeal from the district court's dismissal of his claim for fees under the Hyde Amendment on the ground that his net worth renders him ineligible for an award of fees. At issue is whether the Hyde Amendment's incorporation of the \"procedures and limitations\" of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412, encompasses all of the avenues to relief contained in &#167;&#167; 2412, or simply refers to the procedures and limitations imposed in &#167;&#167; 2412(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hyde Amendment provides that fee awards \"shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations (but not the burden of proof) provided for an award under section 2412 of [the Equal Access to Justice Act] . . . .\" 111 Stat. at 2519. Section 2412 of the EAJA, however, provides for the award of attorneys' fees in two separate subsections, each containing different procedures and limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EAJA Subsection 2412(b) provides for the recovery of attorneys' fees against the United States, not by supplying an independent basis for recovering fees, but instead by subjecting the United States to other existing provisions which allow recovery of fees against private parties in the civil context. It provides that \"a court may award reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, in addition to [costs], to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States . . . . The United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(b). Awards under &#167;&#167; 2412(b) are limited, of course, by the standards of the common law or the terms of the incorporated statutory provision upon which the award is based, just as an award against a private party would be, but &#167;&#167; 2412(b) itself does not otherwise provide procedures for or limitations upon fee awards under the EAJA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EAJA Subsection 2412(d) supplies an additional substantive basis for a civil party to recover fees against the United States. It provides that \"a court shall award [fees and expenses] to a prevailing party . . . unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d)(1)(A). Unlike &#167;&#167; 2412(b), &#167;&#167; 2412(d) itself subjects fee awards to certain procedures and limitations. An individual may not recover fees under subsection (d) if his individual net worth exceeds $2 million (nor can a corporation, if its net worth exceeds $7 million and it has more than 500 employees). See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d)(2)(B). In addition, subsection (d) caps the hourly rate at which an award may be granted at $125. 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d)(2)(A). Knott concedes that he would be ineligible under the $2 million net worth limitation, but contests its applicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Knott's argument that he is not subject to the net worth limitation or the cap on hourly rates because defendants may elect to proceed under either 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(b) or (d). The district court concluded that the procedures and limitations of EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d) applied to applications for fees under the Hyde Amendment for two main reasons. First, the district court reasoned that allowing defendants to elect to proceed under &#167;&#167; 2412(b) would effectively read the clause \"under the procedures and limitations of section 2412\" out of the Hyde Amendment. Second, the district court, confronted with two interpretations of the statute, construed it narrowly in accord with the principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly. See 106 F. Supp. 2d at 177-78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was correct to require fee applicants to meet the eligibility requirements of EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d). The Hyde Amendment expressly adopts \"procedures and limitations\" from the EAJA. We hold that this reference incorporates the \"procedures and limitations\" contained in EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d). Accord United States v Ranger Elec. Communications, Inc., 210 F.3d 627, 632-33 (6th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knott's suggested reading of the Hyde Amendment undercuts the language of the provision and policy concerns underlying the incorporation of these procedures and limitations. If defendants could elect to proceed under &#167;&#167; 2412(b), as Knott argues, it is not clear that the Hyde Amendment's incorporation of \"procedures and limitations\" from the EAJA would have any practical effect. In order to give meaningful effect to the plain language of the Hyde Amendment, then, the incorporation is best read to refer to the limitations contained in EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is particularly so given that, unlike EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d), EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(b) does not supply an independent substantive ground upon which to recover fees, instead directing applicants to other bases providing a remedy of attorneys' fees, including their procedures and limitations, and simply subjecting the United States to the same obligations regarding attorneys' fees as private parties. Because EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(b) does not provide a complete and independent ground for a fee award but instead affords relief only by reference to otherwise existing avenues to recover fees, it would create a peculiar circularity to allow a defendant relying on the Hyde Amendment as the substantive basis of a request for attorneys' fees to elect to proceed through EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(b) in order to avoid the limitations imposed in EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d), given that the Hyde Amendment itself incorporates the procedures and limitations of the EAJA.

In order to make best sense of the language of the statute, then, we conclude that the procedures and limitations referenced are those laid out in &#167;&#167; 2412(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next address the government's appeal from the award of attorneys' fees in favor of Riverdale Mills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Hyde Amendment Legal Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment in 1997 in response to perceived instances of prosecutorial abuse by the United States. See United States v. Gilbert, 198 F.3d 1293, 1299-1303 (11th Cir. 1999) (reviewing legislative history). The purpose of the Amendment was to allow defendants to recover attorney's fees and costs in cases of prosecutorial misconduct. Id. The provision provides that a district court may award attorneys' fees and other costs to a prevailing defendant \"where the court finds that the position of the United States was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith, unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust. Such awards shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations (but not the burden of proof) provided for an award under [the Equal Access to Justice Act] . . . .\" 111 Stat. at 2519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hyde Amendment was patterned after the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412, which provides for an award of attorney's fees against the United States in civil cases. The Hyde Amendment differs in at least two important respects. First, it raises the standard for awarding fees. The Hyde Amendment allows recovery by prevailing criminal defendants only where the position of the United States was \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith,\" in contrast to the EAJA, which authorizes an award to a prevailing civil party in any case where the position of the United States was not \"substantially justified,\" see 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d)(1)(A). Indeed, the legislative history of the Hyde Amendment shows that in drafting the provision, Congress considered and rejected as too easily met both the \"not substantially justified\" standard of the EAJA and a standard (modeled after the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(d)(2)(B)) which would have awarded fees, inter alia, where the United States' position was \"without foundation.\" See Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1301-02. Second, unlike the EAJA, the Hyde Amendment places the burden of proof on the defendant to demonstrate that the government's position was \"vexatious,\" \"frivolous,\" or \"in bad faith.\" See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In construing and applying statutory terms, we begin by examining the language of the statute itself. See, e.g., Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 144 (1995). The words \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith\" are not defined in the statute. In such circumstances, courts typically read statutory terms to convey their ordinary meaning, see, e.g., Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1298 (citing Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 462 (1991)), including as reflected in dictionary definitions, see, e.g., Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., U.S. ---, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 1839 (2001) (relying on definition of \"prevailing party\" in Black's Law Dictionary); id. at 1846 (Scalia, J., concurring). Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"vexatious\" -- the term at issue in this case -- to mean \"without reasonable or probable cause or excuse; harassing; annoying.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1559 (7th ed. 1999). It further defines \"vexatious suit\" to mean a \"lawsuit instituted maliciously and without good cause.\" Id. Standard English-language dictionaries give the term similar meaning. See, e.g., Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 2548 (3d ed. 1961) (defining \"vexatious\" to mean, inter alia, \"lacking justification and intended to harass\"); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 596 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"vexatious\" for legal purposes as \"[i]nstituted without sufficient grounds for the purpose of causing trouble or annoyance to the defendant\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Circuit courts construing the Hyde Amendment have varied in interpreting the term \"vexatious.\" The Gilbert court, for instance, relies on a definition of \"vexatious\" as \"without reasonable or probable cause or excuse.\" See 198 F.3d at 1298-99; accord In re 1997 Grand Jury, 215 F.3d 430, 436 (4th Cir. 2000). By contrast, the Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Sherburne, 249 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 2001), held that a finding of vexatiousness under the Hyde Amendment requires both a determination that the prosecution was \"objectively deficient\" in that it \"lack[ed] merit\" and a finding that the prosecution possessed \"an element of maliciousness, or an intent to harass.\" Id. at 1126. The Sherburne court referred to the finding that the suit lacked merit as an \"objective\" component of vexatiousness and the finding that the suit was prosecuted with some subjective malice or intent to harass or annoy as a \"subjective\" component. Id. at 1127. Other courts have utilized a standard more amenable to the party seeking fees. See United States v. Holland, 34 F. Supp. 2d 346 (E.D. Va. 1999) (framing the inquiry as \"whether a reasonable prosecutor should have concluded that the applicable law and the available evidence were insufficient to prove the defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and, if so, was the continuation of the prosecution vexatious\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that a determination that a prosecution was \"vexatious\" for the purposes of the Hyde Amendment requires both a showing that the criminal case was objectively deficient, in that it lacked either legal merit or factual foundation, and a showing that the government's conduct, when viewed objectively, manifests maliciousness or an intent to harass or annoy. Such a reading best comports with the language employed by Congress in the Amendment. This is especially so when considered in the context of Congress's concern to protect against prosecutorial misconduct while at the same time providing a sufficiently stringent standard to avoid undermining appropriate prosecutorial zeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard implied by the district court and advanced by the defendants -- that \"vexatious\" conduct can be shown simply by showing that the charges brought by the United States were ultimately determined to be without either evidentiary or legal foundation -- does not adequately account for Congress's efforts to limit Hyde Amendment awards to cases of affirmative prosecutorial misconduct rather than simply any prosecution which failed. As the Gilbert court notes, \"[i]n prosecuting crime, government attorneys are entitled to be zealous advocates of the law on behalf of their client, the people of the United States. While a prosecutor is not at liberty to strike foul blows, he may strike hard ones, and '[h]e may prosecute with earnestness and vigor -- indeed, he should do so.'\" 198 F.3d at 1303 (quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The structure of the statute also militates against resting vexatiousness simply upon a finding that the prosecution lacked \"any credible evidence.\" It may be that if the government pursued a position so obviously wrong that no reasonable prosecutor could have supported it, the defendant would be entitled to a fee award under the Hyde Amendment. Without a finding of bad faith or improper motive, however, if the government pursues a prosecution without any foundation or basis for belief that it might prevail, such a prosecution would more appropriately be deemed \"frivolous\" than \"vexatious.\" Reading \"vexatious\" to encompass such a case would render it synonymous with \"frivolous,\" thus improperly rendering the term mere surplusage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, awarding fees upon a determination that the prosecution lacked sufficient evidence does not accord with the legislative history of the Hyde Amendment. In rejecting the \"not substantially justified\" formulation of the EAJA and the \"without foundation\" formulation of the Firearms Act, Congress sought narrow language \"meant to sanction and deter prosecutorial misconduct, not prosecutorial zealousness per se.\" Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1304.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Hyde Amendment's shifting of the burden of proof also reflects this concern. The alternative construction urged by the defendants would burden the United States with the threat of a large number of fee applications arising from circumstances quite different than those against which Congress sought to protect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make best sense of the statutory language and in light of the purposes embodied in the Hyde Amendment, we conclude that something more than simply an inadequate evidentiary foundation is required to demonstrate that the prosecution was \"vexatious\" within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment -- that is, some finding of malice or improper motivation is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> After all, there is an alternate ground in the statute to award fees where an action is frivolous. In requiring that the government's conduct manifest malice or an intent to harass or annoy in order to be \"vexatious,\" however, we do not intend an inquiry into subjective intent, and we reject the approach of Sherburne to the extent it suggests that such attention to subjective motivations is required. Rather, the issue is whether the government's conduct, when viewed objectively, manifests, or is tantamount to, malice or an intent to harass or annoy. Cf. Braley v. Campbell, 832 F.2d 1504, 1512 (10th Cir. 1987) (en banc) (rejecting subjective intent standard \"as virtually impossible to apply\" for fee awards under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1927).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Evidence of Malice or Intent to Harass or Annoy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court here did not make any express findings that the government's actions in this case manifested malice or an intent to harass or annoy, resting its fee award instead on the purported absence of credible evidence to support the charges. Under the standard articulated here, the absence of objective evidence of such improper motive renders the fee award inappropriate. The district court did, however, identify and criticize isolated conduct of the EPA and prosecution, and defendants suggest that this conduct suffices to prove vexatiousness and support the award in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants point to an array of government conduct both before the indictment and during litigation in an effort to demonstrate that the prosecution was indeed vexatious. As defendants contend, it is permissible for courts to consider the conduct of the investigation in order to provide a context in which to assess whether a prosecution was \"vexatious\" within the terms of the Hyde Amendment. However, the alleged conduct in this case, whether taken independently or collectively, either lacks sufficient record support or fails to rise to the level of conduct required to find vexatiousness. Therefore this tacit argument that the government proceeded with improper purposes does not succeed. We address the contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, defendants point to the district court's conclusion that some samples taken during the October 21 inspection of the site exceeded the scope of the permission given by Knott. The validity of the order suppressing the afternoon samples is not before us, but the issue was close and the ultimate decision to suppress the evidence was by no means a foregone conclusion. In any event, the mere fact that EPA inspectors took samples exceeding the scope of permission hardly warrants an inference that their conduct was vexatious; their conduct could just as well have rested on an honest mistake of fact or misapprehension of the authority they had been granted, a possibility suggested by the fact that they subsequently provided a split sample from that afternoon to the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendants seize on the district court's determination that there was \"credible evidence\" that the annotation of some of the sampling results had been altered; they contend that such alteration is evidence of governmental abuse. As an initial matter, there is little evidence in the record that any of the annotations were altered apart from the 4 pH reading at Manhole #2 on October 21. Putting aside the question of support in the record, even assuming dubitante that some of the sample readings were deliberately and erroneously re-recorded, that alone would not necessarily be enough to establish vexatious prosecution where properly recorded samples showed a violation. But here the district court did not render any findings as to the reasons why annotations were changed, just that there was \"credible evidence\" that they may have been. The annotations in the log may have been written over for any number of reasons, some as benign as the correction of a mistake. Nor is there any record evidence suggesting any improper conduct in recording the sample results. Even assuming that the fact of some alterations is supported in the record, since the existence of the purported alterations is equally open to benign and malign interpretations on the present record, it hardly provides sufficient evidence of vexatious conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, defendants charge that the EPA agents continued to take readings at Manhole #1 despite their awareness of Knott's claim to ownership of the sewer line under Riverdale Street, and subsequently prosecuted them largely on the basis of pH readings taken at Manhole #1. This charge does not support any determination of vexatiousness. The question of ownership of the sewer under Riverdale Street, as discussed further below, was open to reasonable dispute, and the EPA was entitled to pursue charges based on discharges at the first manhole so long as it had a legal argument that the public sewer began there. More importantly, as discussed below, the pH level of discharges at Manhole #1 provides relevant evidence of violations even if the public sewer begins at Manhole #2, regardless of ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, defendants contend that the fact that the EPA and the U.S. Attorney issued press releases following the indictment reveals malice. The press releases simply state that the defendants were indicted and describe the charges for which the indictments were issued. Such standard press releases do not suggest any intent to vex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also contend that vexatiousness is shown by the government's failure to produce automatically some evidence the court deemed exculpatory, where such production is required by a local court rule. The court deemed a certain log to be exculpatory because it showed a series of pH readings at Manhole #2 above 5.0 s.u. on the morning of November 7. While the government is correct that the existence of some discharges within the legal limit is not clearly exculpatory, the better practice would have been for the government to produce the logs as part of automatic discovery given the local rule. However, in this case, the logs were turned over in a timely fashion upon a discovery request from the defendants, and the short delay did not prejudice the defendants. In these circumstances, given that the exculpatory nature of the evidence is questionable, the failure to produce the evidence automatically does not amount to vexatious behavior within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also claim that the government unduly delayed dismissing the case following the district court's suppression order. The district court ruled on the suppression motion on February 16, 1999; the government moved to dismiss the case on April 23, 1999. Such a delay does not suggest vexatious conduct. The government is entitled to weigh carefully whether or not to appeal the exclusion of evidence and to assess carefully whether or not to continue the case in the absence of the excluded evidence. In doing so, the government is engaging in precisely the sort of prosecutorial decision making that is its business, and assessing the strength of the remaining case requires some consideration. Indeed, the decision here to move for a dismissal of the indictment was by no means preordained by the suppression order, as the government had evidence with which it might have pressed its case even without the excluded evidence. We would not want the Hyde Amendment to deter the prosecution from exercising its discretion to dismiss cases where it concludes that prosecution is no longer warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendants contend that the manner in which the EPA executed the November 7 search warrant evinces vexatiousness. The district court stated that the EPA brought \"a virtual 'SWAT team'\" to conduct the search and that the agents involved engaged in \"humiliating\" conduct. (The search involved the presence of 21 agents, some armed, who interviewed and videotaped employees.) 106 F. Supp. 2d at 180. However, any conclusion that the EPA agents engaged in unwarranted behavior in executing the search is not supported by the record. The affidavits of Knott and Agent Creavin contain conflicting statements regarding the search. But even crediting all of Knott's sworn allegations regarding the search, the conduct of the search does not amount to vexatious conduct. Knott alleges that the EPA brought 21 agents, some armed, that they engaged in \"outrageous and disruptive\" behavior in conducting the search, and that some of the seized documents were outside the scope of the search warrant. In an unsworn letter to the assistant U.S. attorney, Knott supplemented these charges, contending that the EPA did not show him the search warrant until the premises were secured, that they interviewed Riverdale Mills employees both during the search and later in the day at their homes, that these interviews were videotaped, and that in one instance the agent holding the video camera held it too close to the face of the interviewee until another agent asked him to back up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these contentions -- apart from the conclusory characterization of the conduct as \"outrageous\" -- set forth conduct that is properly deemed vexatious, at least absent more specific facts. There is nothing untoward about criminal investigative agents of the EPA wearing holstered firearms while in the field, nor about securing premises before showing the search warrant. That the EPA wanted to interview Riverdale Mills employees is also hardly surprising, as is the fact that the EPA wanted to record the interviews. It was, after all, a tip from an employee which started the whole investigation, and it appears that the employees knew the pretreatment system was not operating as required, and that Knott was aware of this. The record does not reflect any misconduct in the manner in which the interviews were carried out, or even provide any reason to suspect it, and the defendants opted not to provide affidavits from the interviewed employees. On the record before the court, there was no basis to find that the EPA engaged in such unwarranted conduct in executing the warrant as to render its behavior vexatious within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record simply does not reflect the sort of malice or prosecutorial misconduct toward which the Hyde Amendment was directed. While the government might have handled itself better in some of these instances, that does not render its conduct \"vexatious.\" Rather, an award of fees for \"vexatious\" prosecution under the Hyde Amendment requires some evidence upon which a reasonable observer can conclude that the prosecution was based in malice or an intent to harass or annoy. The district court erred as a matter of law in applying a legal standard that would award fees under the Hyde Amendment in any case where the prosecution is ultimately deemed to have been without sufficient foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence to Support Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of equal importance is that the district court's finding that there was no \"credible evidence\" upon which to pursue charges was clear error. The government had ample reason to investigate and pursue charges against the defendants, and indeed still had adequate cause to prosecute even after the suppression of evidence. Thus an award of attorneys' fees under the Hyde Amendment is clearly not warranted, given the failure to meet the first part of the test of vexatiousness: that the government's suit lacked either legal merit or factual foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA had ample reason to initiate an investigation of Knott and Riverdale Mills. In the summer of 1997, the EPA received an anonymous letter from an employee of the company indicating that the company was not complying with the pretreatment requirements set out in its agreement with the state, as embodied in its state permit to discharge industrial wastewater into the public sewer. Upon arriving to investigate this allegation on October 21, the EPA inspectors observed that, contrary to Knott's alleged representation that morning, the pretreatment system at the plant was not in operation. Indeed, although at the closing conference on the afternoon of October 21, the EPA inspectors discussed with Knott the fact that the pretreatment system was not operational and that low pH discharges into the public sewer were occurring as a result, when the EPA returned to conduct the November 7 search, the pretreatment system was still not operating properly. Interviews with Riverdale Mills employees that day confirmed that the pretreatment system had been out of operation for several months and that Knott was aware that it was not functioning. Defendants do not contest the fact that the pretreatment system was not in operation on either day but rather resort to arguments that other processes would dilute the wastewater before it reached the public sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, there was considerable direct evidence of a Clean Water Act violation. As defendants acknowledge, a single knowing discharge of wastewater with pH below 5.0 s.u. into the public sewer is sufficient to prosecute as a Clean Water Act violation. Here, at the time the government sought the indictment, it had over fifty samples that it considered direct evidence of discharges below pH 5.0 s.u. For the first count, covering October 21, the EPA had 13 samples from Manhole #1 below pH 3.0 s.u. and one disputed sample at Manhole #2 at pH around 4.0 s.u. For the second count, covering November 7, the EPA had over 40 samples below pH 5.0 s.u., including three below pH 3.0 s.u., all taken at Manhole #1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court discounted much of this evidence as immaterial, giving two reasons: first, much of it resulted from samples taken at Manhole #1; and second, much of it was later suppressed. The decision not to consider the government's evidence taken at Manhole #1 is flawed, in two respects. First, at the time the government sought the indictment, the ownership of the street where Manhole #1 is located remained in dispute, and the government had a good faith legal argument that the relevant point of discharge into the public sewers was the first manhole. Therefore it was entitled to pursue charges based on discharges at Manhole #1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the district court's decision to disregard the sampling results at Manhole #1 misapprehends or ignores the relationship between sampling data collected at the first manhole and the acidity of Riverdale Mills's discharges into the public sewer, even if the public sewer begins only at the second manhole. The prosecution had ample evidence that the defendant discharged highly acidic water at the first manhole on both days. Even if the relevant public sewer does not begin until the second manhole 100 yards away, these samples still provide evidence that the water ultimately discharged by the defendants at the second manhole had a highly acidic content. That is particularly so in light of the EPA expert's conclusions. The EPA was not required to accept Knott's lay theory, not even advanced on appeal, that the slope of the pipes over that 100 yard distance ensured that pulses of highly acidic water would inevitably be neutralized by mixing with pulses of highly caustic water before they both hit Manhole #2. Nor was the EPA required to accept the later-advanced theory that the pipes were subject to so much groundwater infiltration that the groundwater would dilute the effluent down to an acceptable level over the short distance of 100 yards. By overlooking the bearing which the pH readings at the first manhole have on the acidity of discharges at the second, the district court committed clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the district court is free to accept or reject the conclusions of the EPA expert who stated that the groundwater infiltration rate would not sufficiently dilute highly acidic water within the 100 yard span of the sewer line under Riverdale Street. While this assertion may be true as to the ultimate factual determination, it misses the issue at stake in the application for fees under the Hyde Amendment, which is whether the EPA was vexatious in deciding to proceed in its prosecution. Even if the court or jury did not ultimately credit the EPA expert's conclusions, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that that expert was so wantonly and obviously wrong that the EPA was not entitled to rely upon his determinations in proceeding. Indeed his determination may well be correct. For these reasons, the evidence of samples below pH 3.0 s.u. at Manhole #1 remains credible evidence upon which the EPA was entitled to pursue charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in concluding that the prosecution lacked \"any credible evidence,\" the district court erroneously discounted all the evidence that it had suppressed. For Hyde Amendment purposes, however, the court must assess the basis for pursuing charges from the perspective of the government at the time. Instead, the district court required undue prescience on the part of the government. The government was entitled, ab initio, to rely on the evidence subsequently suppressed in making its prosecutorial decision, provided it could articulate, in good faith, a reasonable position on the suppression issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were genuine factual disputes regarding what happened on October 21, and the conditions which were imposed upon the consent to the EPA inspection were, at the very least, ambiguous. The government was entitled to rely on its evidence so long as it had a good-faith basis for contending that the evidence was admissible. The suppression issue presented here was not so clear cut as to deprive the prosecution of a reasonable basis for believing that its evidence was admissible. An interpretation of the Hyde Amendment which effectively requires the government precisely to anticipate later evidentiary rulings, where reasonable grounds for disagreement exist, is untenable in light of the language and purposes of the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, even after the suppression ruling, there remained an adequate evidentiary foundation for the prosecution, at least as concerns the second count. There were three readings below pH 3.0 at the first manhole on November 7, each of which, in conjunction with the testimony of the EPA expert, could provide an adequate foundation for a Clean Water Act charge. In addition, the EPA directly observed that the pretreatment system was not in operation on either day, as corroborated through employee interviews. Moreover, there was evidence the system had not been in operation for some time, which Knott well knew. Although the EPA ultimately concluded that it would not proceed, there remained credible evidence to support a prosecution. Weighing the strength of the evidence and determining whether or not to prosecute are precisely the sorts of choices the government is entitled to make, based on information it has acquired through due diligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the EPA had a reasonably sufficient evidentiary basis upon which to pursue charges against the defendants, both before and even after the suppression ruling, and absent any finding or reason to believe that the government acted either out of malice or with any intent to harass or annoy, the fee award to Riverdale Mills constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we affirm the denial of fees to Knott, reverse the grant of fees to Riverdale Mills, and remand the application for fees under the Hyde Amendment to the district court for dismissal, with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.

The court does note that the Hyde Amendment was \"targeted at prosecutorial misconduct, not prosecutorial mistake.\" 198 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In requiring this element of malice or improper motive, we recognize that our construction of \"vexatious\" here differs from the way the term is construed in the Title VII context. See Tang v. Rhode Island Dep't of Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant . . . upon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\") (quoting Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421 (1978)). Like the Sherburne court, we conclude that the context differs in material ways, most importantly in that, because the Hyde Amendment addresses fees in the criminal context, Congress enacted it against a background in which courts have no inherent power to award fees. See Sherburne, 249 F.3d at 1127 n.5.</p>\n        <p>Defendants also point to common law awards of attorneys' fees, where \"vexatious\" litigation need not always require subjective bad faith in order to justify a fee award. See Local 285 v. Nonotuck Res. Assocs., 64 F.3d 735, 737-38 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that subjective bad faith is not a prerequisite to a fee award under the common law); but cf. Rivera Morales v. Benitez de Rexach, 541 F.2d 882 (1st Cir. 1976) (overturning common law fee award where there was no finding that defendants acted in bad faith). This reliance on occasional cases from a civil context which did not require subjective bad faith ignores the peculiar concern, unique to the criminal context, that the drafters of the Hyde Amendment had to avoid chilling legitimate prosecutions. In addition, common law fee awards involve a full-blown equitable analysis and depend on the discretion of the court, a requirement overlooked in the attempt to draw a parallel to the Hyde Amendment awards at issue here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court has expressly rejected an inquiry into subjective intent in deciding questions of official immunity in the law enforcement context, replacing it with an objective inquiry into the legal reasonableness of the official action. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815-20 (1982); see also Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 811-13 (1996) (rejecting subjective intent test in Fourth Amendment context). It would be odd if against this background Congress intended an inquiry into the subjective motivations of prosecutors under the vexatiousness standard of the Hyde Amendment.

No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2519 (1997), reprinted in 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3006A (statutory note). The district court awarded $68,726.00 in fees to Riverdale Mills, which had been one defendant in a criminal prosecution for violation of the Clean Water Act, and denied fees to James Knott, the other defendant. The government voluntarily dismissed the action after the district court suppressed some of the prosecution's evidence. The district court awarded fees on the grounds that the government's prosecution was \"vexatious.\" We reverse the award of fees to Riverdale Mills and affirm the denial of fees to Knott.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale Mills Corporation and its principal owner, James Knott, operate a plant in Northbridge, Massachusetts, that manufactures plastic-coated steel wire mesh. The production involves two processes, one producing rather acidic wastewater, and the other producing quite caustic (i.e., alkaline) wastewater. Riverdale Mills ultimately discharges this industrial waste into the public sewer owned by the Town of Northbridge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Clean Water Act prohibits the indirect discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States through publicly owned treatment works. 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1317(b)(1). The implementing regulations for the Act prohibit the discharge of wastewater with a pH below 5.0 standard units (\"s.u.\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> into publicly owned sewer systems. 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 403.5(b)(2). Any person who \"knowingly\" violates these standards is subject to felony prosecution. 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1319(c)(2)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riverdale Mills's state permit for discharging its waste into the public sewer states that Riverdale Mills will ensure that the wastewater falls within acceptable limits by combining the two streams inside the plant so that the caustic water neutralizes the acidic water, and then further neutralizing the waste by adding a caustic soda. Following this pretreatment, on the design in the permit, the now- combined wastewaters would flow intermittently through an effluent pipe to a manhole outside the building on Riverdale Street (Manhole #1), where it joins a sewer pipe. The discharge then would flow through that sewer pipe approximately 100 yards to a second manhole (Manhole #2), where the pipe joins the public sewer line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on an anonymous tip that this pretreatment system was not in operation, two EPA civil inspectors went to Riverdale Mills for an unannounced inspection on October 21, 1997. The district court determined that Knott consented to the inspection, but determined on disputed facts that his consent was qualified by the express condition that the EPA inspectors be accompanied by Riverdale Mills representatives during the entire course of their inspection. Knott then accompanied the inspectors to Manhole #1, where they took two initial samples (neither below pH 5.0 s.u.) and observed only an intermittent discharge. Because of the intermittent nature of the discharge flow, the inspectors then allegedly informed Knott that they would have to conduct periodic sampling throughout the day. The group then embarked on a tour of the facility, during which the EPA inspectors discovered that, contrary to Knott's alleged statement that morning, the wastewater treatment facility at Riverdale Mills was not in operation. Apparently, the two wastewater streams were not being mixed in the treatment facility as intended because a valve was turned to the wrong position, and also the tank where caustic soda was to be added to the wastewater was being bypassed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early afternoon, the inspectors returned to Manhole #1, on the street in front of the plant and in the plain view of Riverdale Mills employees. There they took a series of samples, and those additional samples yielded pH readings ranging from 2.19 to 7.48 s.u., with thirteen of the fourteen samples showing extremely low pH readings (between 2.19 and 2.59 s.u.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court determined that the EPA inspectors were not accompanied by a Riverdale Mills representative for this sampling. The inspectors then returned to the plant and a Riverdale Mills employee completed their tour of the facilities. The EPA inspectors also gave a split sample from one of their afternoon samples to the employee, who signed the chain of custody form for it. At the EPA's closing conference with Knott, they discussed the low pH discharges, and Knott informed the EPA inspectors that he owned Riverdale Street and he claimed ownership of the sewer line under the street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving the plant, the EPA inspectors went to Manhole #2. This is where the \"private\" sewer line joined the municipal line, according to Knott's statement at the meeting. There the inspectors noted a second residential sewer line also joined at the manhole, seven feet below the Riverdale Mills line. Accordingly, they took three different samples at this site. One was from the discharge of the residential line, which the EPA says yielded a pH of approximately 7 s.u. One was from water standing in a trough at the manhole, which the EPA says yielded a pH around 7 s.u. The last one was from the discharge flowing from the Riverdale Mills line, which the EPA says yielded a pH of around 4 s.u. In their field log, the number \"4\" for this final measurement appears to be written over a \"7.\" (The district court later concluded that the recorded entry for that sample had been altered from its actual reading of 7 s.u.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this information, the EPA criminal division obtained a federal search warrant and conducted a second inspection on November 7, 1997. A large number of samples were taken at Manhole #1. Most had a pH below 5.0 s.u. and the samples worsened -- that is, became even more acidic -- as the day progressed. EPA agents also took seven samples in the morning at Manhole #2, and all had pH readings around 5.0 or 6.0 s.u. Again, the agents observed that the required pretreatment system at the Riverdale Mills plant was largely not operational; although on that day the two wastewater streams were mixing in the plant, the process adding caustic soda was still being bypassed. Plant employees told the EPA that the pretreatment system had not been in operation since sometime in the spring of 1997, and that Knott was aware that wastewater was being discharged without pretreatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1998, the EPA executed a second search warrant to measure the effects of groundwater infiltration between Manhole #1 and Manhole #2. This was done in response to Knott's claim that he owned the intervening sewer line and that by the time the wastewater reached the public sewer at Manhole #2, groundwater infiltration inevitably brought it within the legal limit. The EPA's expert concluded that even making assumptions favorable to Knott, any wastewater with a pH below 3.0 s.u. at the first manhole would reach the sewer line at the second manhole with a pH below 5.0 s.u.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 12, 1998, a federal grand jury indicted Knott and Riverdale Mills on two counts of violating the Clean Water Act by knowingly discharging industrial wastewater with a pH below 5.0 s.u. into a publicly owned treatment works on October 21 and November 7, 1997. Following the indictment, both the U.S. Attorney's office and the regional EPA issued standard press releases announcing the indictment and its allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 1998, Knott and Riverdale Mills moved to suppress evidence from the afternoon sampling on October 21, 1997 as the result of an unlawful search, and also to suppress the sampling obtained through the November 7 search warrant, as the fruit of the October 21 sampling. On February 16, 1999, the district court suppressed the sampling results from the afternoon of October 21, 1997, finding that the EPA inspectors exceeded the scope of Knott's consent when they sampled the wastewater stream without a Riverdale Mills representative present. However, the district court declined to suppress the evidence obtained on November 7, reasoning that even though the basis of the warrant was in part the October 21 afternoon sampling, the agents acted in good faith executing the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government sought leave of court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice on April 23, 1999, because in the course of preparing for trial, it determined that the suppression had substantially weakened its case and raised a question as to whether it could make a sufficiently compelling case to the jury to meet its burden of proof on the remaining evidence. Leave of the court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice was granted by the district court on May 6, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the dismissal of the indictment, Knott and Riverdale Mills filed a motion to recover reasonable attorneys' fees under the Hyde Amendment. The district court awarded attorneys' fees to Riverdale Mills as a prevailing party<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> because, in the view of the court, while the prosecution was neither frivolous nor in bad faith, it was \"clearly vexatious\" within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment. United States v. Knott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510677\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510677/united-states-v-knott/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></a></span>, 180 (D. Mass. 2000). The district court, relying in part on the Eleventh Circuit's decision in United States v. Gilbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74209\"><a href=\"/opinion/74209/united-states-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1293</span></a></span> (11th Cir. 1999), held that a defendant seeking fees under the Hyde Amendment must show that the government's legal position was asserted \"in bad faith or without any foundation or basis for belief that it might prevail\" and thus amounted to \"prosecutorial misconduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See 106 F.Supp.2d at 179 (quoting Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1303-04). The district court rested its conclusion that the prosecution here was \"vexatious\" on the court's belief that the government did not have \"any credible evidence\" to support the accusation that the defendants discharged waste with a pH below 5.0 s.u. into the public sewer. Id. To the contrary, the court concluded, the samples taken at the second manhole, \"the point of discharge into the public sewer,\" showed that Riverdale Mills \"was not in violation of the Clean Water Act.\" Id. The district court did not, however, find that the agents or prosecutors in this case acted maliciously, or with any particular personal motive to vex the defendants. The court rested instead simply on the purported absence of credible evidence, though it also discussed some alleged misconduct in the collection of samples and the conduct of searches. Accordingly, the court awarded fees in the sum of $68,726.00 to the company against the United States under the Hyde Amendment. Id. at 181. The court denied fees to Knott because his net worth exceeded $2 million, reasoning that the limitations of 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d) apply to the Hyde Amendment. Id. at 178.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals this fee award, arguing (1) that the court applied the wrong legal standard in defining vexatiousness, as it did not find any malice or intent to harass in the prosecution, but rather found only that the prosecution lacked foundation; (2) that the district court's conclusion that the prosecution lacked foundation was in clear error, as the government had ample evidence to prove the violations prior to the suppression ruling, and indeed it could have pursued the charges even on the evidence that remained after the court's suppression order; and (3) that the court erred in identifying certain isolated acts of government agents as evidence of vexatiousness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knott, in turn, challenges the district court's ruling against him, arguing that he could seek an award under the Hyde Amendment pursuant to the procedures and limitations of 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(b) instead of &#167;&#167; 2412(d), thereby eliminating the net worth limitation and entitling him to recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We initially determine the legal issue raised in Knott's cross-appeal from the district court's dismissal of his claim for fees under the Hyde Amendment on the ground that his net worth renders him ineligible for an award of fees. At issue is whether the Hyde Amendment's incorporation of the \"procedures and limitations\" of the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412, encompasses all of the avenues to relief contained in &#167;&#167; 2412, or simply refers to the procedures and limitations imposed in &#167;&#167; 2412(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hyde Amendment provides that fee awards \"shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations (but not the burden of proof) provided for an award under section 2412 of [the Equal Access to Justice Act] . . . .\" 111 Stat. at 2519. Section 2412 of the EAJA, however, provides for the award of attorneys' fees in two separate subsections, each containing different procedures and limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EAJA Subsection 2412(b) provides for the recovery of attorneys' fees against the United States, not by supplying an independent basis for recovering fees, but instead by subjecting the United States to other existing provisions which allow recovery of fees against private parties in the civil context.

Awards under &#167;&#167; 2412(b) are limited, of course, by the standards of the common law or the terms of the incorporated statutory provision upon which the award is based, just as an award against a private party would be, but &#167;&#167; 2412(b) itself does not otherwise provide procedures for or limitations upon fee awards under the EAJA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EAJA Subsection 2412(d) supplies an additional substantive basis for a civil party to recover fees against the United States.

Unlike &#167;&#167; 2412(b), &#167;&#167; 2412(d) itself subjects fee awards to certain procedures and limitations. An individual may not recover fees under subsection (d) if his individual net worth exceeds $2 million (nor can a corporation, if its net worth exceeds $7 million and it has more than 500 employees). See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d)(2)(B). In addition, subsection (d) caps the hourly rate at which an award may be granted at $125. 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d)(2)(A).

The district court concluded that the procedures and limitations of EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d) applied to applications for fees under the Hyde Amendment for two main reasons. First, the district court reasoned that allowing defendants to elect to proceed under &#167;&#167; 2412(b) would effectively read the clause \"under the procedures and limitations of section 2412\" out of the Hyde Amendment. Second, the district court, confronted with two interpretations of the statute, construed it narrowly in accord with the principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly.

In order to give meaningful effect to the plain language of the Hyde Amendment, then, the incorporation is best read to refer to the limitations contained in EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is particularly so given that, unlike EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d), EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(b) does not supply an independent substantive ground upon which to recover fees, instead directing applicants to other bases providing a remedy of attorneys' fees, including their procedures and limitations, and simply subjecting the United States to the same obligations regarding attorneys' fees as private parties. Because EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(b) does not provide a complete and independent ground for a fee award but instead affords relief only by reference to otherwise existing avenues to recover fees, it would create a peculiar circularity to allow a defendant relying on the Hyde Amendment as the substantive basis of a request for attorneys' fees to elect to proceed through EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(b) in order to avoid the limitations imposed in EAJA &#167;&#167; 2412(d), given that the Hyde Amendment itself incorporates the procedures and limitations of the EAJA.

The Hyde Amendment Legal Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment in 1997 in response to perceived instances of prosecutorial abuse by the United States. See United States v. Gilbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74209\"><a href=\"/opinion/74209/united-states-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1293</span></a></span>, 1299-1303 (11th Cir. 1999) (reviewing legislative history). The purpose of the Amendment was to allow defendants to recover attorney's fees and costs in cases of prosecutorial misconduct. Id. The provision provides that a district court may award attorneys' fees and other costs to a prevailing defendant \"where the court finds that the position of the United States was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith, unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust. Such awards shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations (but not the burden of proof) provided for an award under [the Equal Access to Justice Act] . . . .\" 111 Stat. at 2519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hyde Amendment was patterned after the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412, which provides for an award of attorney's fees against the United States in civil cases. The Hyde Amendment differs in at least two important respects. First, it raises the standard for awarding fees. The Hyde Amendment allows recovery by prevailing criminal defendants only where the position of the United States was \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith,\" in contrast to the EAJA, which authorizes an award to a prevailing civil party in any case where the position of the United States was not \"substantially justified,\" see 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2412(d)(1)(A). Indeed, the legislative history of the Hyde Amendment shows that in drafting the provision, Congress considered and rejected as too easily met both the \"not substantially justified\" standard of the EAJA and a standard (modeled after the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(d)(2)(B)) which would have awarded fees, inter alia, where the United States' position was \"without foundation.\" See Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1301-02. Second, unlike the EAJA, the Hyde Amendment places the burden of proof on the defendant to demonstrate that the government's position was \"vexatious,\" \"frivolous,\" or \"in bad faith.\" See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In construing and applying statutory terms, we begin by examining the language of the statute itself. See, e.g., Bailey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 144 (1995). The words \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith\" are not defined in the statute. In such circumstances, courts typically read statutory terms to convey their ordinary meaning, see, e.g., Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1298 (citing Chapman v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112605\"><a href=\"/opinion/112605/chapman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 462 (1991)), including as reflected in dictionary definitions, see, e.g., Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., U.S. ---, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118430\"><a href=\"/opinion/118430/buckhannon-board-care-home-inc-v-west-virginia-dept-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"vexatious\" -- the term at issue in this case -- to mean \"without reasonable or probable cause or excuse; harassing; annoying.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1559 (7th ed. 1999). It further defines \"vexatious suit\" to mean a \"lawsuit instituted maliciously and without good cause.\" Id. Standard English-language dictionaries give the term similar meaning. See, e.g., Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 2548 (3d ed. 1961) (defining \"vexatious\" to mean, inter alia, \"lacking justification and intended to harass\"); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 596 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"vexatious\" for legal purposes as \"[i]nstituted without sufficient grounds for the purpose of causing trouble or annoyance to the defendant\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Circuit courts construing the Hyde Amendment have varied in interpreting the term \"vexatious.\" The Gilbert court, for instance, relies on a definition of \"vexatious\" as \"without reasonable or probable cause or excuse.\" See 198 F.3d at 1298-99; accord In re 1997 Grand Jury, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span>, 436 (4th Cir. 2000). By contrast, the Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Sherburne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773225\"><a href=\"/opinion/773225/united-states-v-scott-f-sherburne-joseph-j-mckay-blaze-construction/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 2001), held that a finding of vexatiousness under the Hyde Amendment requires both a determination that the prosecution was \"objectively deficient\" in that it \"lack[ed] merit\" and a finding that the prosecution possessed \"an element of maliciousness, or an intent to harass.\" Id. at 1126. The Sherburne court referred to the finding that the suit lacked merit as an \"objective\" component of vexatiousness and the finding that the suit was prosecuted with some subjective malice or intent to harass or annoy as a \"subjective\" component. Id. at 1127. Other courts have utilized a standard more amenable to the party seeking fees. See United States v. Holland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462591\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462591/united-states-v-holland/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span> (E.D. Va. 1999) (framing the inquiry as \"whether a reasonable prosecutor should have concluded that the applicable law and the available evidence were insufficient to prove the defendants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and, if so, was the continuation of the prosecution vexatious\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that a determination that a prosecution was \"vexatious\" for the purposes of the Hyde Amendment requires both a showing that the criminal case was objectively deficient, in that it lacked either legal merit or factual foundation, and a showing that the government's conduct, when viewed objectively, manifests maliciousness or an intent to harass or annoy. Such a reading best comports with the language employed by Congress in the Amendment. This is especially so when considered in the context of Congress's concern to protect against prosecutorial misconduct while at the same time providing a sufficiently stringent standard to avoid undermining appropriate prosecutorial zeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard implied by the district court and advanced by the defendants -- that \"vexatious\" conduct can be shown simply by showing that the charges brought by the United States were ultimately determined to be without either evidentiary or legal foundation -- does not adequately account for Congress's efforts to limit Hyde Amendment awards to cases of affirmative prosecutorial misconduct rather than simply any prosecution which failed. As the Gilbert court notes, \"[i]n prosecuting crime, government attorneys are entitled to be zealous advocates of the law on behalf of their client, the people of the United States. While a prosecutor is not at liberty to strike foul blows, he may strike hard ones, and '[h]e may prosecute with earnestness and vigor -- indeed, he should do so.'\" 198 F.3d at 1303 (quoting Berger v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102436\"><a href=\"/opinion/102436/berger-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 88 (1935)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The structure of the statute also militates against resting vexatiousness simply upon a finding that the prosecution lacked \"any credible evidence.\" It may be that if the government pursued a position so obviously wrong that no reasonable prosecutor could have supported it, the defendant would be entitled to a fee award under the Hyde Amendment. Without a finding of bad faith or improper motive, however, if the government pursues a prosecution without any foundation or basis for belief that it might prevail, such a prosecution would more appropriately be deemed \"frivolous\" than \"vexatious.\" Reading \"vexatious\" to encompass such a case would render it synonymous with \"frivolous,\" thus improperly rendering the term mere surplusage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, awarding fees upon a determination that the prosecution lacked sufficient evidence does not accord with the legislative history of the Hyde Amendment. In rejecting the \"not substantially justified\" formulation of the EAJA and the \"without foundation\" formulation of the Firearms Act, Congress sought narrow language \"meant to sanction and deter prosecutorial misconduct, not prosecutorial zealousness per se.\" Gilbert, 198 F.3d at 1304.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Hyde Amendment's shifting of the burden of proof also reflects this concern. The alternative construction urged by the defendants would burden the United States with the threat of a large number of fee applications arising from circumstances quite different than those against which Congress sought to protect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make best sense of the statutory language and in light of the purposes embodied in the Hyde Amendment, we conclude that something more than simply an inadequate evidentiary foundation is required to demonstrate that the prosecution was \"vexatious\" within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment -- that is, some finding of malice or improper motivation is required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> After all, there is an alternate ground in the statute to award fees where an action is frivolous. In requiring that the government's conduct manifest malice or an intent to harass or annoy in order to be \"vexatious,\" however, we do not intend an inquiry into subjective intent, and we reject the approach of Sherburne to the extent it suggests that such attention to subjective motivations is required. Rather, the issue is whether the government's conduct, when viewed objectively, manifests, or is tantamount to, malice or an intent to harass or annoy. Cf. Braley v. Campbell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497006\"><a href=\"/opinion/497006/jack-a-braley-do-v-garland-campbell-md-bruce-g-smith-md-stephen/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1504</span></a></span>, 1512 (10th Cir. 1987) (en banc) (rejecting subjective intent standard \"as virtually impossible to apply\" for fee awards under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1927).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Under the standard articulated here, the absence of objective evidence of such improper motive renders the fee award inappropriate. The district court did, however, identify and criticize isolated conduct of the EPA and prosecution, and defendants suggest that this conduct suffices to prove vexatiousness and support the award in any event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants point to an array of government conduct both before the indictment and during litigation in an effort to demonstrate that the prosecution was indeed vexatious. As defendants contend, it is permissible for courts to consider the conduct of the investigation in order to provide a context in which to assess whether a prosecution was \"vexatious\" within the terms of the Hyde Amendment. However, the alleged conduct in this case, whether taken independently or collectively, either lacks sufficient record support or fails to rise to the level of conduct required to find vexatiousness. Therefore this tacit argument that the government proceeded with improper purposes does not succeed. We address the contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, defendants point to the district court's conclusion that some samples taken during the October 21 inspection of the site exceeded the scope of the permission given by Knott. The validity of the order suppressing the afternoon samples is not before us, but the issue was close and the ultimate decision to suppress the evidence was by no means a foregone conclusion. In any event, the mere fact that EPA inspectors took samples exceeding the scope of permission hardly warrants an inference that their conduct was vexatious; their conduct could just as well have rested on an honest mistake of fact or misapprehension of the authority they had been granted, a possibility suggested by the fact that they subsequently provided a split sample from that afternoon to the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendants seize on the district court's determination that there was \"credible evidence\" that the annotation of some of the sampling results had been altered; they contend that such alteration is evidence of governmental abuse. As an initial matter, there is little evidence in the record that any of the annotations were altered apart from the 4 pH reading at Manhole #2 on October 21. Putting aside the question of support in the record, even assuming dubitante that some of the sample readings were deliberately and erroneously re-recorded, that alone would not necessarily be enough to establish vexatious prosecution where properly recorded samples showed a violation. But here the district court did not render any findings as to the reasons why annotations were changed, just that there was \"credible evidence\" that they may have been. The annotations in the log may have been written over for any number of reasons, some as benign as the correction of a mistake. Nor is there any record evidence suggesting any improper conduct in recording the sample results. Even assuming that the fact of some alterations is supported in the record, since the existence of the purported alterations is equally open to benign and malign interpretations on the present record, it hardly provides sufficient evidence of vexatious conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, defendants charge that the EPA agents continued to take readings at Manhole #1 despite their awareness of Knott's claim to ownership of the sewer line under Riverdale Street, and subsequently prosecuted them largely on the basis of pH readings taken at Manhole #1. This charge does not support any determination of vexatiousness. The question of ownership of the sewer under Riverdale Street, as discussed further below, was open to reasonable dispute, and the EPA was entitled to pursue charges based on discharges at the first manhole so long as it had a legal argument that the public sewer began there. More importantly, as discussed below, the pH level of discharges at Manhole #1 provides relevant evidence of violations even if the public sewer begins at Manhole #2, regardless of ownership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, defendants contend that the fact that the EPA and the U.S. Attorney issued press releases following the indictment reveals malice. The press releases simply state that the defendants were indicted and describe the charges for which the indictments were issued. Such standard press releases do not suggest any intent to vex.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also contend that vexatiousness is shown by the government's failure to produce automatically some evidence the court deemed exculpatory, where such production is required by a local court rule. The court deemed a certain log to be exculpatory because it showed a series of pH readings at Manhole #2 above 5.0 s.u. on the morning of November 7. While the government is correct that the existence of some discharges within the legal limit is not clearly exculpatory, the better practice would have been for the government to produce the logs as part of automatic discovery given the local rule. However, in this case, the logs were turned over in a timely fashion upon a discovery request from the defendants, and the short delay did not prejudice the defendants. In these circumstances, given that the exculpatory nature of the evidence is questionable, the failure to produce the evidence automatically does not amount to vexatious behavior within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also claim that the government unduly delayed dismissing the case following the district court's suppression order. The district court ruled on the suppression motion on February 16, 1999; the government moved to dismiss the case on April 23, 1999. Such a delay does not suggest vexatious conduct. The government is entitled to weigh carefully whether or not to appeal the exclusion of evidence and to assess carefully whether or not to continue the case in the absence of the excluded evidence. In doing so, the government is engaging in precisely the sort of prosecutorial decision making that is its business, and assessing the strength of the remaining case requires some consideration. Indeed, the decision here to move for a dismissal of the indictment was by no means preordained by the suppression order, as the government had evidence with which it might have pressed its case even without the excluded evidence. We would not want the Hyde Amendment to deter the prosecution from exercising its discretion to dismiss cases where it concludes that prosecution is no longer warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, defendants contend that the manner in which the EPA executed the November 7 search warrant evinces vexatiousness. The district court stated that the EPA brought \"a virtual 'SWAT team'\" to conduct the search and that the agents involved engaged in \"humiliating\" conduct. (The search involved the presence of 21 agents, some armed, who interviewed and videotaped employees.) 106 F. Supp. 2d at 180. However, any conclusion that the EPA agents engaged in unwarranted behavior in executing the search is not supported by the record. The affidavits of Knott and Agent Creavin contain conflicting statements regarding the search. But even crediting all of Knott's sworn allegations regarding the search, the conduct of the search does not amount to vexatious conduct. Knott alleges that the EPA brought 21 agents, some armed, that they engaged in \"outrageous and disruptive\" behavior in conducting the search, and that some of the seized documents were outside the scope of the search warrant. In an unsworn letter to the assistant U.S. attorney, Knott supplemented these charges, contending that the EPA did not show him the search warrant until the premises were secured, that they interviewed Riverdale Mills employees both during the search and later in the day at their homes, that these interviews were videotaped, and that in one instance the agent holding the video camera held it too close to the face of the interviewee until another agent asked him to back up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of these contentions -- apart from the conclusory characterization of the conduct as \"outrageous\" -- set forth conduct that is properly deemed vexatious, at least absent more specific facts. There is nothing untoward about criminal investigative agents of the EPA wearing holstered firearms while in the field, nor about securing premises before showing the search warrant. That the EPA wanted to interview Riverdale Mills employees is also hardly surprising, as is the fact that the EPA wanted to record the interviews. It was, after all, a tip from an employee which started the whole investigation, and it appears that the employees knew the pretreatment system was not operating as required, and that Knott was aware of this. The record does not reflect any misconduct in the manner in which the interviews were carried out, or even provide any reason to suspect it, and the defendants opted not to provide affidavits from the interviewed employees. On the record before the court, there was no basis to find that the EPA engaged in such unwarranted conduct in executing the warrant as to render its behavior vexatious within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record simply does not reflect the sort of malice or prosecutorial misconduct toward which the Hyde Amendment was directed. While the government might have handled itself better in some of these instances, that does not render its conduct \"vexatious.\" Rather, an award of fees for \"vexatious\" prosecution under the Hyde Amendment requires some evidence upon which a reasonable observer can conclude that the prosecution was based in malice or an intent to harass or annoy. The district court erred as a matter of law in applying a legal standard that would award fees under the Hyde Amendment in any case where the prosecution is ultimately deemed to have been without sufficient foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence to Support Prosecution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of equal importance is that the district court's finding that there was no \"credible evidence\" upon which to pursue charges was clear error. The government had ample reason to investigate and pursue charges against the defendants, and indeed still had adequate cause to prosecute even after the suppression of evidence. Thus an award of attorneys' fees under the Hyde Amendment is clearly not warranted, given the failure to meet the first part of the test of vexatiousness: that the government's suit lacked either legal merit or factual foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EPA had ample reason to initiate an investigation of Knott and Riverdale Mills. In the summer of 1997, the EPA received an anonymous letter from an employee of the company indicating that the company was not complying with the pretreatment requirements set out in its agreement with the state, as embodied in its state permit to discharge industrial wastewater into the public sewer. Upon arriving to investigate this allegation on October 21, the EPA inspectors observed that, contrary to Knott's alleged representation that morning, the pretreatment system at the plant was not in operation. Indeed, although at the closing conference on the afternoon of October 21, the EPA inspectors discussed with Knott the fact that the pretreatment system was not operational and that low pH discharges into the public sewer were occurring as a result, when the EPA returned to conduct the November 7 search, the pretreatment system was still not operating properly. Interviews with Riverdale Mills employees that day confirmed that the pretreatment system had been out of operation for several months and that Knott was aware that it was not functioning. Defendants do not contest the fact that the pretreatment system was not in operation on either day but rather resort to arguments that other processes would dilute the wastewater before it reached the public sewer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, there was considerable direct evidence of a Clean Water Act violation. As defendants acknowledge, a single knowing discharge of wastewater with pH below 5.0 s.u. into the public sewer is sufficient to prosecute as a Clean Water Act violation. Here, at the time the government sought the indictment, it had over fifty samples that it considered direct evidence of discharges below pH 5.0 s.u. For the first count, covering October 21, the EPA had 13 samples from Manhole #1 below pH 3.0 s.u. and one disputed sample at Manhole #2 at pH around 4.0 s.u. For the second count, covering November 7, the EPA had over 40 samples below pH 5.0 s.u., including three below pH 3.0 s.u., all taken at Manhole #1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court discounted much of this evidence as immaterial, giving two reasons: first, much of it resulted from samples taken at Manhole #1; and second, much of it was later suppressed. The decision not to consider the government's evidence taken at Manhole #1 is flawed, in two respects. First, at the time the government sought the indictment, the ownership of the street where Manhole #1 is located remained in dispute, and the government had a good faith legal argument that the relevant point of discharge into the public sewers was the first manhole. Therefore it was entitled to pursue charges based on discharges at Manhole #1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the district court's decision to disregard the sampling results at Manhole #1 misapprehends or ignores the relationship between sampling data collected at the first manhole and the acidity of Riverdale Mills's discharges into the public sewer, even if the public sewer begins only at the second manhole. The prosecution had ample evidence that the defendant discharged highly acidic water at the first manhole on both days. Even if the relevant public sewer does not begin until the second manhole 100 yards away, these samples still provide evidence that the water ultimately discharged by the defendants at the second manhole had a highly acidic content. That is particularly so in light of the EPA expert's conclusions. The EPA was not required to accept Knott's lay theory, not even advanced on appeal, that the slope of the pipes over that 100 yard distance ensured that pulses of highly acidic water would inevitably be neutralized by mixing with pulses of highly caustic water before they both hit Manhole #2. Nor was the EPA required to accept the later-advanced theory that the pipes were subject to so much groundwater infiltration that the groundwater would dilute the effluent down to an acceptable level over the short distance of 100 yards. By overlooking the bearing which the pH readings at the first manhole have on the acidity of discharges at the second, the district court committed clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that the district court is free to accept or reject the conclusions of the EPA expert who stated that the groundwater infiltration rate would not sufficiently dilute highly acidic water within the 100 yard span of the sewer line under Riverdale Street. While this assertion may be true as to the ultimate factual determination, it misses the issue at stake in the application for fees under the Hyde Amendment, which is whether the EPA was vexatious in deciding to proceed in its prosecution. Even if the court or jury did not ultimately credit the EPA expert's conclusions, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that that expert was so wantonly and obviously wrong that the EPA was not entitled to rely upon his determinations in proceeding. Indeed his determination may well be correct. For these reasons, the evidence of samples below pH 3.0 s.u. at Manhole #1 remains credible evidence upon which the EPA was entitled to pursue charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in concluding that the prosecution lacked \"any credible evidence,\" the district court erroneously discounted all the evidence that it had suppressed. For Hyde Amendment purposes, however, the court must assess the basis for pursuing charges from the perspective of the government at the time. Instead, the district court required undue prescience on the part of the government. The government was entitled, ab initio, to rely on the evidence subsequently suppressed in making its prosecutorial decision, provided it could articulate, in good faith, a reasonable position on the suppression issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were genuine factual disputes regarding what happened on October 21, and the conditions which were imposed upon the consent to the EPA inspection were, at the very least, ambiguous. The government was entitled to rely on its evidence so long as it had a good-faith basis for contending that the evidence was admissible. The suppression issue presented here was not so clear cut as to deprive the prosecution of a reasonable basis for believing that its evidence was admissible. An interpretation of the Hyde Amendment which effectively requires the government precisely to anticipate later evidentiary rulings, where reasonable grounds for disagreement exist, is untenable in light of the language and purposes of the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, even after the suppression ruling, there remained an adequate evidentiary foundation for the prosecution, at least as concerns the second count. There were three readings below pH 3.0 at the first manhole on November 7, each of which, in conjunction with the testimony of the EPA expert, could provide an adequate foundation for a Clean Water Act charge. In addition, the EPA directly observed that the pretreatment system was not in operation on either day, as corroborated through employee interviews. Moreover, there was evidence the system had not been in operation for some time, which Knott well knew. Although the EPA ultimately concluded that it would not proceed, there remained credible evidence to support a prosecution. Weighing the strength of the evidence and determining whether or not to prosecute are precisely the sorts of choices the government is entitled to make, based on information it has acquired through due diligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the EPA had a reasonably sufficient evidentiary basis upon which to pursue charges against the defendants, both before and even after the suppression ruling, and absent any finding or reason to believe that the government acted either out of malice or with any intent to harass or annoy, the fee award to Riverdale Mills constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we affirm the denial of fees to Knott, reverse the grant of fees to Riverdale Mills, and remand the application for fees under the Hyde Amendment to the district court for dismissal, with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.

Each whole number step away from 7 represents a ten-fold increase in acidity or alkalinity, such that a sample with a pH of 4.0 s.u. is ten times more acidic than a sample with a pH of 5.0 s.u., and so forth.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Riverdale Mills disputes the log of these samples, arguing that the readings were actually in the \"7\" range, but that the number \"7\" originally written in the log was subsequently altered to appear to be a \"2.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In the district court, the government contested whether the defendants were properly considered \"prevailing parties\" within the meaning of the Hyde Amendment, as the indictment was dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court also cited to two different definitions of \"vexatious\" from Black's Law Dictionary: one defining vexatious as \"without reasonable or probable cause,\" the other defining a \"vexatious\" charge as one that is calculated to \"harass, disquiet, or annoy.\" 106 F. Supp. 2d at 179 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 1565 (6th ed. 1990)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Indeed, though the Gilbert court provides a definition for \"vexatious\" that does not explicitly require improper motive, it assesses the government's conduct in light of all three elements that would support a Hyde Amendment award simultaneously, so it is not entirely clear how the court would apply \"vexatious\" in isolation. The court does note that the Hyde Amendment was \"targeted at prosecutorial misconduct, not prosecutorial mistake.\" 198 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In requiring this element of malice or improper motive, we recognize that our construction of \"vexatious\" here differs from the way the term is construed in the Title VII context. See Tang v. Rhode Island Dep't of Elderly Affairs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198242\"><a href=\"/opinion/198242/tang-v-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant . . . upon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\") (quoting Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109769\"><a href=\"/opinion/109769/christiansburg-garment-co-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span>, 421 (1978)). Like the Sherburne court, we conclude that the context differs in material ways, most importantly in that, because the Hyde Amendment addresses fees in the criminal context, Congress enacted it against a background in which courts have no inherent power to award fees. See Sherburne, 249 F.3d at 1127 n.5.</p>\n        <p>Defendants also point to common law awards of attorneys' fees, where \"vexatious\" litigation need not always require subjective bad faith in order to justify a fee award. See Local 285 v. Nonotuck Res. Assocs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703156\"><a href=\"/opinion/703156/local-285-service-employees-international-union-afl-cio-v-nonotuck/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, 737-38 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that subjective bad faith is not a prerequisite to a fee award under the common law); but cf. Rivera Morales v. Benitez de Rexach, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339047\"><a href=\"/opinion/339047/victor-rivera-morales-v-celeste-benitez-de-rexach-esther-pedroza-gabriel/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1976) (overturning common law fee award where there was no finding that defendants acted in bad faith). This reliance on occasional cases from a civil context which did not require subjective bad faith ignores the peculiar concern, unique to the criminal context, that the drafters of the Hyde Amendment had to avoid chilling legitimate prosecutions. In addition, common law fee awards involve a full-blown equitable analysis and depend on the discretion of the court, a requirement overlooked in the attempt to draw a parallel to the Hyde Amendment awards at issue here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court has expressly rejected an inquiry into subjective intent in deciding questions of official immunity in the law enforcement context, replacing it with an objective inquiry into the legal reasonableness of the official action. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 815-20 (1982); see also Whren v.

It would be odd if against this background Congress intended an inquiry into the subjective motivations of prosecutors under the vexatiousness standard of the Hyde Amendment. We do not address whether the \"bad faith\" test requires a subjective inquiry.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We bypass the question of whether one vexatious raid would render the pursuit of a criminal case \"vexatious.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
