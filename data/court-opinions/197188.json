See United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n12,  14 (1st Cir. 1992); United States  v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          While  incarcerated  at   the  Hampshire  County  Jail,\r\n\nNorthampton, Massachusetts,  Fontaine led  a group of  inmates in\r\n\nsubmitting  false  income tax  returns  to  the Internal  Revenue\r\n\nService (IRS) in order to secure refunds not actually due.  After\r\n\nthe authorities uncovered the scheme, Fontaine pled guilty to one\r\n\ncount of aiding  in the filing of a  false refund claim.   He was\r\n\nbeing held  at the  North Central Correctional  Institute (NCCI),\r\n\nGardner, Massachusetts,  awaiting the  imposition of  sentence on\r\n\nthis charge, when a further epidemic of false claims erupted.\r\n\n          According to the  government, Fontaine  put together  a\r\n\nnew ring at  NCCI and assisted  in the filing  of at least  eight\r\n\nfraudulent refund claims from October 12, 1993 to April 15, 1994.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nThe government charged that Fontaine recruited fellow inmates and\r\n\nhelped them complete apocryphal IRS-1040s, using bogus W-2 forms.\r\n\nWhen  the government became cognizant of  what had transpired, it\r\n\nlodged an  eight-count information in the  United States District\r\n\nCourt  for the District of Massachusetts.  Each count charged the\r\n\nappellant with aiding and abetting the making of a separate false\r\n\nclaim  against the Treasury.  See 18  U.S.C.    2, 287.  Pursuant\r                                           \r\n\nto  a non-binding  plea agreement,  Fontaine  pled guilty  to one\r\n\ncount  of the  information.   The  other  counts eventually  were\r\n\ndismissed.\r\n\n          When the probation officer distributed the  PSI Report,\r\n\nFontaine objected to two of its conclusions (involving the degree\r\n\nof planning that the enterprise required and his role in it).  He\r\n\nalso requested  an evidentiary  hearing at which  the prosecutors\r\n\nwould be \"compelled to  produce witnesses to establish the  basis\r\n\nfor their  allegation[s]\".  The district  court afforded Fontaine\r\n\nan  evidentiary hearing on March 18,  1996, but the court did not\r\n\nforce the government to proffer any particular witnesses.  At the\r\n\nhearing, Fontaine asked  that the court  order the government  to\r\n\nsummon the eight other inmates  who allegedly participated in the\r\n\nscheme so that he  could cross-examine them.  The  district court\r\n\nrefused to issue such  an order.  However, the  government called\r\n\nthe  agent who  investigated the  matter, and  Fontaine's counsel\r\n\nvigorously cross-examined him.\r\n\n          Following the  hearing  the district  court  imposed  a\r\n\nforty-one  month incarcerative sentence.  This appeal ensued.  In\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nit, Fontaine  challenges his  sentence on three  grounds, namely,\r\n\n(1)  the  district  court's  handling   of  his  request  for  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing, (2) the court's enlargement of the GSR based\r\n\non a determination  that his criminal activity involved more than\r\n\nminimal planning,  and  (3) the  court's enlargement  of the  GSR\r\n\npredicated on  his supposed role  as an organizer or  leader of a\r\n\ncriminal  enterprise.   We  treat the  first assignment  of error\r\n\nseparately and then group the latter two.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                     The Evidentiary Hearing\r                               The Evidentiary Hearing\r                                                      \r\n\n          Fontaine berates what he characterizes as  the district\r\n\ncourt's \"refusal to allow the defendant to confront the witnesses\r\n\nagainst him,  and  to  test the  accuracy  of  their  allegations\r\n\nthrough  cross-examination.\"  This boils down to a claim that the\r\n\ndistrict  court should  have ordered  the government to  call the\r\n\neight  persons  alleged to  have  participated in  the  tax fraud\r\n\nscheme  (all of whom were state  prison inmates) so that he could\r\n\nexplore  alleged  inconsistencies  in  their  statements  through\r\n\ncross-examination.\r\n\n          Neither the  Confrontation  Clause  nor  the  rules  of\r\n\nevidence  apply  during  the   sentencing  phase  of  a  criminal\r\n\nproceeding, see  United States  v. Tardiff,  969 F.2d 1283,  1287\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), and evidentiary  hearings at sentencing are  the\r\n\nexception  rather than  the  rule.    The  decision  to  hold  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing at the  time of sentencing or, alternatively,\r\n\nto  eschew  such a  hearing, lies  within  the discretion  of the\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsentencing court.  See United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 310-\r                                                       \r\n\n11  (1st Cir. 1992); Tardiff, 969 F.2d  at 1286; Garcia, 954 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 19.   By  the  same token,  if the  court  deigns to  grant  a\r\n\nhearing,  the shape  and form  of the  proceeding lie  within the\r\n\nencincture  of this  discretion.   See  Lilly,  983 F.2d  at  311\r                                                       \r\n\n(finding no  abuse of discretion  when the defendant  \"received a\r\n\nhearing,  albeit  not  precisely  the  kind of  hearing  that  he\r\n\npreferred\").\r\n\n          We  see   nothing  remotely  resembling  an   abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion  in  this instance.   For  one  thing, the  inmates in\r\n\nquestion  were in  the  custody of  the  state, not  the  federal\r\n\ngovernment,  and there is no evidence that the appellant made any\r\n\neffort  to subpoena them.  For another thing, the appellant never\r\n\ntendered  a  meaningful  offer  of  proof,  prior to  the  actual\r\n\nhearing,  in  an effort  to demonstrate  why  he needed  the live\r\n\ntestimony  of  the  eight  prospective witnesses.    Given  these\r\n\nprocedural  infirmities, it  is difficult  to fault  the district\r\n\ncourt for not being more receptive to Fontaine's entreaty.\r\n\n          Leaving   procedural   weaknesses   aside,   Fontaine's\r\n\nassignment of error lacks substance.  At the disposition hearing,\r\n\nthe government called Anthony Sibilia, an IRS agent who had taken\r\n\nstatements  from  the eight  inmates  allegedly  involved in  the\r\n\nscheme.  Agent Sibilia testified in excruciating detail as to the\r\n\nresults  of his  investigation.   The appellant's  counsel cross-\r\n\nexamined him  at  length, pointing  out possible  inconsistencies\r\n\nbetween  the  statements  of  various  witnesses  and  variations\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nbetween the proof  presented and the  government's theory of  the\r\n\ncase.  While Fontaine calumnizes Sibilia's testimony as \"unsworn,\r\n\nuntested hearsay,\" it is settled beyond peradventure that hearsay\r\n\nevidence is admissible at  sentencing.  See Tardiff, 969  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1287.  The baseline criterion is trustworthiness:  at sentencing,\r\n\nthe trial court \"may consider relevant information without regard\r\n\nto its admissibility  under the rules  of evidence applicable  at\r\n\ntrial, provided  that the  information has sufficient  indicia of\r\n\nreliability  to support  its  probable accuracy.\"   Id.  (quoting\r                                                                 \r\n\nU.S.S.G.  6A1.3(a)).\r\n\n          Here, the  sentencing court  did not deviate  from this\r\n\nbaseline.     Sibilia's  testimony   was  premised  on   his  own\r\n\ninvestigation,  supported by  reports  that he  had compiled  and\r\n\nwitness  statements that he had obtained.  The court afforded the\r\n\nappellant  access   to  the  underlying  documents   and  a  full\r\n\nopportunity  to cross-examine the witness.  In the course of this\r\n\ncross-examination, the appellant's  counsel pointed out not  only\r\n\ninconsistencies   between   witnesses'   statements    but   also\r\n\ninconsistencies between the modus operandi attributed to Fontaine\r\n\nand  the returns  actually  filed  by  the  eight  inmates.    In\r\n\naddition,  the  court permitted  the  appellant  to explore  what\r\n\ninterest  the  inmates  may  have  had  either  in  pleasing  the\r\n\nprosecution or in falsely implicating Fontaine.   To this extent,\r\n\nthen,  Sibilia's  testimony,   though  based   on  hearsay,   was\r\n\nthoroughly tested.\r\n\n          Moreover,  the  testimony  had  sufficient  indicia  of\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nreliability  to   pass  muster.    The   reliability  of  hearsay\r\n\nstatements used  at sentencing  sometimes can be  demonstrated by\r\n\nreference  to  other evidence  in the  case.   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 261-62 (1st Cir. 1996).  So it is\r                           \r\n\nhere.   For instance,  in the plea  agreement Fontaine stipulated\r\n\nthat  the   fraud  loss  exceeded  $10,000,   a  figure  strongly\r\n\nsuggesting that  he considered himself responsible  for all eight\r\n\nof the false claims described in the information.  Then, too, the\r\n\ncourt  heard evidence  of  striking similarities  in the  various\r\n\nfilings    similarities that would  suggest a common  plan to all\r\n\nbut the most fervent  worshipper of coincidence.  The  court also\r\n\nhad at hand evidence of incriminating statements made by Fontaine\r\n\nin letters to a  friend, Christine Pond.  These, and other, items\r\n\nbolstered  Sibilia's   testimony  and   tended  to  confirm   its\r\n\nreliability.   Against this backdrop,  we can detect  no abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion in the sentencing  court's denial of Fontaine's demand\r\n\nthat the government be  ordered to produce the eight  inmates for\r\n\ncross-questioning.\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                       Calculating the GSR\r                                 Calculating the GSR\r                                                    \r\n\n          The district court found  that the appellant's  offense\r\n\ninvolved more than minimal planning and therefore raised the base\r\n\noffense level (BOL) by two  levels.  See U.S.S.G.   2F1.1(b)(2).1\r                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1All  references to  the  sentencing guidelines  are to  the\r\nNovember 1995 edition, in effect on the date of sentencing.

See U.S.S.G.  3B1.1(a).   The appellant\r                                       \r\n\nchallenges both findings.  We review for clear error.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Fontaine, Jr. challenges both the manner in which the district court conducted the disposition hearing in his case and the computations that the court essayed in establishing the applicable guideline sentencing range (GSR).  Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellant's conviction resulted from a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the plea colloquy, the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.  See United States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While incarcerated at the Hampshire County Jail, Northampton, Massachusetts, Fontaine led a group of inmates in submitting false income tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in order to secure refunds not actually due.  After the authorities uncovered the scheme, Fontaine pled guilty to one count of aiding in the filing of a false refund claim.  He was being held at the North Central Correctional Institute (NCCI), Gardner, Massachusetts, awaiting the imposition of sentence on this charge, when a further epidemic of false claims erupted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government, Fontaine put together a new ring at NCCI and assisted in the filing of at least eight fraudulent refund claims from October 12, 1993 to April 15, 1994.  The government charged that Fontaine recruited fellow inmates and helped them complete apocryphal IRS-1040s, using bogus W-2 forms.  When the government became cognizant of what had transpired, it lodged an eight-count information in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Each count charged the appellant with aiding and abetting the making of a separate false claim against the Treasury.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 287.  Pursuant to a non-binding plea agreement, Fontaine pled guilty to one count of the information.  The other counts eventually were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the probation officer distributed the PSI Report, Fontaine objected to two of its conclusions (involving the degree of planning that the enterprise required and his role in it).  He also requested an evidentiary hearing at which the prosecutors would be \"compelled to produce witnesses to establish the basis for their allegation[s]\".  The district court afforded Fontaine an evidentiary hearing on March 18, 1996, but the court did not force the government to proffer any particular witnesses.  At the hearing, Fontaine asked that the court order the government to summon the eight other inmates who allegedly participated in the scheme so that he could cross-examine them.  The district court refused to issue such an order.  However, the government called the agent who investigated the matter, and Fontaine's counsel vigorously cross-examined him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the hearing the district court imposed a forty-one month incarcerative sentence.  This appeal ensued.  In it, Fontaine challenges his sentence on three grounds, namely, (1) the district court's handling of his request for an evidentiary hearing, (2) the court's enlargement of the GSR based on a determination that his criminal activity involved more than minimal planning, and (3) the court's enlargement of the GSR predicated on his supposed role as an organizer or leader of a criminal enterprise.  We treat the first assignment of error separately and then group the latter two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fontaine berates what he characterizes as the district court's \"refusal to allow the defendant to confront the witnesses against him, and to test the accuracy of their allegations through cross-examination.\"   This boils down to a claim that the district court should have ordered the government to call the eight persons alleged to have participated in the tax fraud scheme (all of whom were state prison inmates) so that he could explore alleged inconsistencies in their statements through cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the Confrontation Clause nor the rules of evidence apply during the sentencing phase of a criminal proceeding, see United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992), and evidentiary hearings at sentencing are the exception rather than the rule.  The decision to hold an evidentiary hearing at the time of sentencing or, alternatively, to eschew such a hearing, lies within the discretion of the sentencing court.  See United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 310-11 (1st Cir.1992);  Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1286;  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 19.   By the same token, if the court deigns to grant a hearing, the shape and form of the proceeding lie within the encincture of this discretion.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 311 (finding no abuse of discretion when the defendant \"received a hearing, albeit not precisely the kind of hearing that he preferred\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see nothing remotely resembling an abuse of discretion in this instance.  For one thing, the inmates in question were in the custody of the state, not the federal government, and there is no evidence that the appellant made any effort to subpoena them.  For another thing, the appellant never tendered a meaningful offer of proof, prior to the actual hearing, in an effort to demonstrate why he needed the live testimony of the eight prospective witnesses.  Given these procedural infirmities, it is difficult to fault the district court for not being more receptive to Fontaine's entreaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving procedural weaknesses aside, Fontaine's assignment of error lacks substance.  At the disposition hearing, the government called Anthony Sibilia, an IRS agent who had taken statements from the eight inmates allegedly involved in the scheme.  Agent Sibilia testified in excruciating detail as to the results of his investigation.  The appellant's counsel cross-examined him at length, pointing out possible inconsistencies between the statements of various witnesses and variations between the proof presented and the government's theory of the case.  While Fontaine calumnizes Sibilia's testimony as \"unsworn, untested hearsay,\" it is settled beyond peradventure that hearsay evidence is admissible at sentencing.  See Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287.   The baseline criterion is trustworthiness:  at sentencing, the trial court \"may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the sentencing court did not deviate from this baseline.  Sibilia's testimony was premised on his own investigation, supported by reports that he had compiled and witness statements that he had obtained.  The court afforded the appellant access to the underlying documents and a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness.  In the course of this cross-examination, the appellant's counsel pointed out not only inconsistencies between witnesses' statements but also inconsistencies between the modus operandi attributed to Fontaine and the returns actually filed by the eight inmates.  In addition, the court permitted the appellant to explore what interest the inmates may have had either in pleasing the prosecution or in falsely implicating Fontaine.  To this extent, then, Sibilia's testimony, though based on hearsay, was thoroughly tested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the testimony had sufficient indicia of reliability to pass muster.  The reliability of hearsay statements used at sentencing sometimes can be demonstrated by reference to other evidence in the case.  See, e.g., United States v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 261-62 (1st Cir.1996).  So it is here.  For instance, in the plea agreement Fontaine stipulated that the fraud loss exceeded $10,000, a figure strongly suggesting that he considered himself responsible for all eight of the false claims described in the information.  Then, too, the court heard evidence of striking similarities in the various filings--similarities that would suggest a common plan to all but the most fervent worshipper of coincidence.  The court also had at hand evidence of incriminating statements made by Fontaine in letters to a friend, Christine Pond.  These, and other, items bolstered Sibilia's testimony and tended to confirm its reliability.  Against this backdrop, we can detect no abuse of discretion in the sentencing court's denial of Fontaine's demand that the government be ordered to produce the eight inmates for cross-questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Calculating the GSR</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the appellant's offense involved more than minimal planning and therefore raised the base offense level (BOL) by two levels.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court further found that the appellant had organized an extensive criminal activity and enhanced the BOL by four more levels on that account.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a).  The appellant challenges both findings.  We review for clear error.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992);  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52.   Under that test, \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>More than Minimal Planning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that the appellant aided in the preparation of all eight ersatz tax returns and that these \"repeated acts,\" carried out over an extended period of time (approximately six months), involved appreciable planning and forethought.  The appellant questions the reliability of the evidence underpinning this finding and further asserts that, even if the evidence can be deemed reliable, it does not prove more than minimal planning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the sentencing guidelines, an enhancement for more than minimal planning is appropriate when a defendant's course of relevant criminal conduct includes \"repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.1, comment.  (n.1(f)).  The government has the burden of proving the applicability of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2) in any given case.  See United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 112 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"the government must prove facts central to increasing a defendant's offense level\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not tarry.  As the foregoing review of the record indicates, the lower court had before it ample evidence of adequate trustworthiness, including the PSI Report, Agent Sibilia's testimony, the striking similarities among the eight false claims, and the details of the earlier scheme at the Hampshire County Jail, to justify a finding that Fontaine engaged in a studied course of conduct that required (and received) more than minimal planning.  Given this evidence and given the serial preparation and filing of multiple tax returns and refund claims, there was no error in the imposition of the upward adjustment.  See Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1288-89 (finding that a defendant's \"carefully orchestrated series of mailings designed to create a false impression\" satisfied the criteria for the planning adjustment);  United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341, 343-44 (1st Cir.1992) (holding \"repeated preparation and submission of false statements\" sufficient to warrant the enhancement);  see generally United States v. Fox, 889 F.2d 357, 361 (1st Cir.1989) (\"We cannot conceive of how obtaining even one fraudulent loan would not require more than minimal planning.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that Fontaine \"organized the [criminal] scheme,\" that he \"had decision making authority over his accomplices,\" and that the scheme \"involved five or more participants.\"   The appellant challenges these imbricated findings and the four-level upward adjustment that they produced.  Under the sentencing guidelines, a four-level enhancement for a defendant's role in the offense obtains if the government shows that the defendant \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a);  see also United States v. Rostoff, 53 F.3d 398, 412-14 (1st Cir.1995);  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52-54.   As with other upward adjustments to the GSR, the government has the burden of proving the applicability of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a) in a particular case.  See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government carried its burden here.  A fair-minded factfinder, drawing reasonable inferences, could conclude--as, indeed, Judge Freedman did--that the eight false claims were part of an integrated course of conduct, and that Fontaine (who had orchestrated a similar plot at an earlier time) was the mastermind of it.  We have observed before that battles over a defendant's role in the offense will most frequently be won or lost in the district court, see United States v.

Fontaine, Jr. challenges both the manner in which the district court conducted the disposition hearing in his case and the computations that the court essayed in establishing the applicable guideline sentencing range (GSR).  Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the appellant's conviction resulted from a guilty plea, we draw the facts from the plea colloquy, the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI Report), and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.  See United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576213\"><a href=\"/opinion/576213/united-states-v-hector-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While incarcerated at the Hampshire County Jail, Northampton, Massachusetts, Fontaine led a group of inmates in submitting false income tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in order to secure refunds not actually due.  After the authorities uncovered the scheme, Fontaine pled guilty to one count of aiding in the filing of a false refund claim.  He was being held at the North Central Correctional Institute (NCCI), Gardner, Massachusetts, awaiting the imposition of sentence on this charge, when a further epidemic of false claims erupted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the government, Fontaine put together a new ring at NCCI and assisted in the filing of at least eight fraudulent refund claims from October 12, 1993 to April 15, 1994.  The government charged that Fontaine recruited fellow inmates and helped them complete apocryphal IRS-1040s, using bogus W-2 forms.  When the government became cognizant of what had transpired, it lodged an eight-count information in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Each count charged the appellant with aiding and abetting the making of a separate false claim against the Treasury.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 287.  Pursuant to a non-binding plea agreement, Fontaine pled guilty to one count of the information.  The other counts eventually were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the probation officer distributed the PSI Report, Fontaine objected to two of its conclusions (involving the degree of planning that the enterprise required and his role in it).  He also requested an evidentiary hearing at which the prosecutors would be \"compelled to produce witnesses to establish the basis for their allegation[s]\".  The district court afforded Fontaine an evidentiary hearing on March 18, 1996, but the court did not force the government to proffer any particular witnesses.  At the hearing, Fontaine asked that the court order the government to summon the eight other inmates who allegedly participated in the scheme so that he could cross-examine them.  The district court refused to issue such an order.  However, the government called the agent who investigated the matter, and Fontaine's counsel vigorously cross-examined him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the hearing the district court imposed a forty-one month incarcerative sentence.  This appeal ensued.  In it, Fontaine challenges his sentence on three grounds, namely, (1) the district court's handling of his request for an evidentiary hearing, (2) the court's enlargement of the GSR based on a determination that his criminal activity involved more than minimal planning, and (3) the court's enlargement of the GSR predicated on his supposed role as an organizer or leader of a criminal enterprise.  We treat the first assignment of error separately and then group the latter two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>The Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fontaine berates what he characterizes as the district court's \"refusal to allow the defendant to confront the witnesses against him, and to test the accuracy of their allegations through cross-examination.\"   This boils down to a claim that the district court should have ordered the government to call the eight persons alleged to have participated in the tax fraud scheme (all of whom were state prison inmates) so that he could explore alleged inconsistencies in their statements through cross-examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the Confrontation Clause nor the rules of evidence apply during the sentencing phase of a criminal proceeding, see United States v. Tardiff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1992), and evidentiary hearings at sentencing are the exception rather than the rule.  The decision to hold an evidentiary hearing at the time of sentencing or, alternatively, to eschew such a hearing, lies within the discretion of the sentencing court.  See United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 310-11 (1st Cir.1992);  Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1286;  Garcia, 954 F.2d at 19.   By the same token, if the court deigns to grant a hearing, the shape and form of the proceeding lie within the encincture of this discretion.  See Lilly, 983 F.2d at 311 (finding no abuse of discretion when the defendant \"received a hearing, albeit not precisely the kind of hearing that he preferred\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see nothing remotely resembling an abuse of discretion in this instance.  For one thing, the inmates in question were in the custody of the state, not the federal government, and there is no evidence that the appellant made any effort to subpoena them.  For another thing, the appellant never tendered a meaningful offer of proof, prior to the actual hearing, in an effort to demonstrate why he needed the live testimony of the eight prospective witnesses.  Given these procedural infirmities, it is difficult to fault the district court for not being more receptive to Fontaine's entreaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving procedural weaknesses aside, Fontaine's assignment of error lacks substance.  At the disposition hearing, the government called Anthony Sibilia, an IRS agent who had taken statements from the eight inmates allegedly involved in the scheme.  Agent Sibilia testified in excruciating detail as to the results of his investigation.  The appellant's counsel cross-examined him at length, pointing out possible inconsistencies between the statements of various witnesses and variations between the proof presented and the government's theory of the case.  While Fontaine calumnizes Sibilia's testimony as \"unsworn, untested hearsay,\" it is settled beyond peradventure that hearsay evidence is admissible at sentencing.  See Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287.   The baseline criterion is trustworthiness:  at sentencing, the trial court \"may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the sentencing court did not deviate from this baseline.  Sibilia's testimony was premised on his own investigation, supported by reports that he had compiled and witness statements that he had obtained.  The court afforded the appellant access to the underlying documents and a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness.  In the course of this cross-examination, the appellant's counsel pointed out not only inconsistencies between witnesses' statements but also inconsistencies between the modus operandi attributed to Fontaine and the returns actually filed by the eight inmates.  In addition, the court permitted the appellant to explore what interest the inmates may have had either in pleasing the prosecution or in falsely implicating Fontaine.  To this extent, then, Sibilia's testimony, though based on hearsay, was thoroughly tested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the testimony had sufficient indicia of reliability to pass muster.  The reliability of hearsay statements used at sentencing sometimes can be demonstrated by reference to other evidence in the case.  See, e.g., United States v. Phaneuf, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196902\"><a href=\"/opinion/196902/united-states-v-phaneuf/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 261-62 (1st Cir.1996).  So it is here.  For instance, in the plea agreement Fontaine stipulated that the fraud loss exceeded $10,000, a figure strongly suggesting that he considered himself responsible for all eight of the false claims described in the information.  Then, too, the court heard evidence of striking similarities in the various filings--similarities that would suggest a common plan to all but the most fervent worshipper of coincidence.  The court also had at hand evidence of incriminating statements made by Fontaine in letters to a friend, Christine Pond.  These, and other, items bolstered Sibilia's testimony and tended to confirm its reliability.  Against this backdrop, we can detect no abuse of discretion in the sentencing court's denial of Fontaine's demand that the government be ordered to produce the eight inmates for cross-questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Calculating the GSR</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the appellant's offense involved more than minimal planning and therefore raised the base offense level (BOL) by two levels.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court further found that the appellant had organized an extensive criminal activity and enhanced the BOL by four more levels on that account.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a).  The appellant challenges both findings.  We review for clear error.  See United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 701 (1st Cir.1992);  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52.   Under that test, \"where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing court's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly erroneous.\"  United States v. Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543063\"><a href=\"/opinion/543063/united-states-v-fausto-d-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 508 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>More than Minimal Planning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that the appellant aided in the preparation of all eight ersatz tax returns and that these \"repeated acts,\" carried out over an extended period of time (approximately six months), involved appreciable planning and forethought.  The appellant questions the reliability of the evidence underpinning this finding and further asserts that, even if the evidence can be deemed reliable, it does not prove more than minimal planning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the sentencing guidelines, an enhancement for more than minimal planning is appropriate when a defendant's course of relevant criminal conduct includes \"repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.1, comment.  (n.1(f)).  The government has the burden of proving the applicability of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2) in any given case.  See United States v. Sklar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that \"the government must prove facts central to increasing a defendant's offense level\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not tarry.  As the foregoing review of the record indicates, the lower court had before it ample evidence of adequate trustworthiness, including the PSI Report, Agent Sibilia's testimony, the striking similarities among the eight false claims, and the details of the earlier scheme at the Hampshire County Jail, to justify a finding that Fontaine engaged in a studied course of conduct that required (and received) more than minimal planning.  Given this evidence and given the serial preparation and filing of multiple tax returns and refund claims, there was no error in the imposition of the upward adjustment.  See Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1288-89 (finding that a defendant's \"carefully orchestrated series of mailings designed to create a false impression\" satisfied the criteria for the planning adjustment);  United States v. Gregorio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577673\"><a href=\"/opinion/577673/united-states-v-william-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 343-44 (1st Cir.1992) (holding \"repeated preparation and submission of false statements\" sufficient to warrant the enhancement);  see generally United States v. Fox, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532028\"><a href=\"/opinion/532028/united-states-v-carolyn-l-fox/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 361 (1st Cir.1989) (\"We cannot conceive of how obtaining even one fraudulent loan would not require more than minimal planning.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Role in the Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that Fontaine \"organized the [criminal] scheme,\" that he \"had decision making authority over his accomplices,\" and that the scheme \"involved five or more participants.\"   The appellant challenges these imbricated findings and the four-level upward adjustment that they produced.  Under the sentencing guidelines, a four-level enhancement for a defendant's role in the offense obtains if the government shows that the defendant \"was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a);  see also United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 412-14 (1st Cir.1995);  Dietz, 950 F.2d at 52-54.   As with other upward adjustments to the GSR, the government has the burden of proving the applicability of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a) in a particular case.  See United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 872 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government carried its burden here.  A fair-minded factfinder, drawing reasonable inferences, could conclude--as, indeed, Judge Freedman did--that the eight false claims were part of an integrated course of conduct, and that Fontaine (who had orchestrated a similar plot at an earlier time) was the mastermind of it.  We have observed before that battles over a defendant's role in the offense will most frequently be won or lost in the district court, see United States v. Graciani, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196199\"><a href=\"/opinion/196199/united-states-v-graciani/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.1995), and that observation holds true in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
