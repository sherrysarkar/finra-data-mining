Defendants-appellants  Edward\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nKalp and  Richard Kayne were  charged with twenty-nine  counts of\r\n\nmail  fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.    1341.  After a six week\r\n\ntrial, a  jury convicted  both defendants  on fifteen counts  and\r\n\nacquitted  them on four; the judge granted a motion for acquittal\r\n\non one; and  the government  dropped the remaining  counts.   The\r\n\ndefendants were  sentenced to 36-months imprisonment, and ordered\r\n\nto pay $339,466 in restitution.   On appeal, Kayne and Kalp argue\r\n\n(1) that jeopardy had attached  in a prior government proceeding;\r\n\n(2) that  certain evidence was improperly admitted;  (3) that the\r\n\nevidence  submitted  below  was  not sufficient  to  sustain  the\r\n\nconvictions; and (4) that Kalp received ineffective assistance of\r\n\ncounsel at trial.  For the reasons laid out below, we affirm.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r                                                  \r\n\n          In  the  late 1970s,  many  new  investors entered  the\r\n\nmarket for rare coins.  Unlike  knowledgeable hobbyists and \"vest\r\n\npocket\" dealers, these  newcomers had  no specialized  expertise,\r\n\nand  were just  looking  for a  stable  investment.   Seeking  to\r\n\ncapitalize  on this  booming market,  defendants Edward  Kalp and\r\n\nRichard  Kayne left  a  distinguished Boston  coin brokerage  and\r\n\nestablished  the Rare Coin Galleries of  America (\"RCGA\") in July\r\n\n1982.   Kalp, the President  of RCGA, functioned  as the in-house\r\n\nnumismatist,  examining  and  valuing  coins  for  purchase  from\r\n\nwholesalers,  and pricing  them  for resale.    Kayne, as  RCGA's\r\n\nmarketing  director,  recruited  financial planners and solicited\r\n\ncustomers.  For four years RCGA operated successfully, generating\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmillions  of   dollars  in  revenues  from   approximately  3,000\r\n\ncustomers.\r\n\n          A typical RCGA investor paid between $5,000 and $25,000\r\n\nfor a portfolio of coins.  In the  rare coin market, the value of\r\n\na  coin  is dependent  upon its  \"grade,\"  which is  a numismatic\r\n\nmeasure  of  comparative  wear  on  a  70  point  scale.    Small\r\n\ndistinctions in grade can yield large differences in the value of\r\n\na  coin.   For example,  among relatively  pristine, uncirculated\r\n\n\"mint state\"  (\"MS\") coins, an MS65 coin  can fetch ten times the\r\n\nprice of an  MS63.  For \"certified\" coins, grade is determined by\r\n\na  certification  service  which  typically employs  a  panel  of\r\n\nnumismatists.    Prior  to  1986, the  only  independent  grading\r\n\nservice  was  the American  Numismatic  Association Certification\r\n\nService  (\"ANACS\").    For  \"raw\"  coins  (which  have  not  been\r\n\ncertified),  grade  and  value  may be  established  between  two\r\n\nknowledgeable  collectors,   or  an  amateur  may   rely  on  the\r\n\nrepresentation of a respected  numismatist.  Most of the  raw and\r\n\ncertified coins which RCGA  supplied its customers were purported\r\n\nto be MS65 coins.\r\n\n          By mid-1986, at least two federal agencies had received\r\n\nmany complaints from RCGA customers asserting that the coins sold\r\n\nby RCGA  were  of  substantially lower  quality  and  value  than\r\n\nrepresented.  After a preliminary investigation in July 1986, the\r\n\nUnited  States  Postal  Service   applied  for  and  was  granted\r\n\nauthority  by the late Chief Judge Andrew Caffrey of the District\r\n\nof Massachusetts to intercept RCGA's mail.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          At the same time,  the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\")\r\n\nwas conducting  a parallel  nationwide investigation of  the rare\r\n\ncoin  investment market.   The  investigation quickly  focused on\r\n\nRCGA,  among others.  On September 16, 1986, the FTC instituted a\r\n\ncivil  action  alleging  that  RCGA  was  engaged in  unfair  and\r\n\ndeceptive  business practices under 15 U.S.C.   45(a).  This case\r\n\nwas  also  assigned to  Judge  Caffrey, who  forthwith  entered a\r\n\ntemporary restraining order \"freezing\"  not only the business but\r\n\nthe  personal assets  owned by Kayne  and Kalp.   On  October 14,\r\n\nRCGA filed  a Chapter 11 petition  for bankruptcy reorganization,\r\n\nwhich was removed to the district court and consolidated with the\r\n\nPostal Service  and  FTC  actions.   The  following  week,  Judge\r\n\nCaffrey granted preliminary  injunctions requested by  the Postal\r\n\nService and  the  FTC, and  appointed a  Bankruptcy Trustee,  who\r\n\ninitiated adverse proceedings against Kayne and Kalp.\r\n\n          The  conclusion  of  the   civil  litigation  came  the\r\n\nfollowing  spring, when  the FTC,  the  Trustee, Kayne,  and Kalp\r\n\nentered into a  settlement agreement requiring Kayne  and Kalp to\r\n\nsurrender $2.2  million in  personal  assets to  the Trustee  and\r\n\nnever to market coins to the public again.  Also pursuant to this\r\n\nagreement,  the  FTC's  claim   for  $11.9  million  in  consumer\r\n\nrestitution was given priority status for payment of the Trustee.\r\n\n          On January  11, 1991,  an indictment charging  Kalp and\r\n\nKayne  with  29 counts  of mail  fraud  was filed,  based  on the\r\n\ncorrespondence intercepted the summer of 1986.  The prosecution's\r\n\nevidence  consisted  of  testimony  from  former  RCGA employees,\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nfinancial  planners, suppliers,  and customers,  as well  as coin\r\n\ndealers  and  numismatic experts.     After  almost six  weeks of\r\n\ntestimony,  the jury  convicted Kayne  and Kalp  of 15  counts of\r\n\nfraud.   The  prosecution  dropped nine  counts  prior  to  their\r\n\nsubmission  to the jury, the  jury acquitted on  four counts, and\r\n\nthe  district judge acquitted on one count.  Defendants have been\r\n\nsentenced to 36 months' imprisonment and  ordered to pay $339,466\r\n\nin  restitution.  The sentence has been stayed pending resolution\r\n\nof this appeal.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r                                                  \r\n\n                       A.  Double Jeopardy\r                                 A.  Double Jeopardy\r\n\n          Both defendants have asserted that jeopardy attached to\r\n\nthe  1986 civil litigation and should bar this prosecution.  This\r\n\ndefense has surfaced for the  first time on appeal.  Even  though\r\n\nthe fundamental  constitutional issue of double  jeopardy was not\r\n\nraised  at trial, we will  entertain the appeal,  but review only\r\n\nfor  plain error.1  See, e.g.,  United States v. Rivera, 872 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n507, 509 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 818 (1989).\r                                           \r\n\n          The Double Jeopardy  clause protects against  \"multiple\r\n\npunishments for the same offense,\" even if one of the proceedings\r\n\nis  civil and one criminal,  regardless of the  sequence.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The government argues  that the defendants' appendix  consists\r\nalmost  entirely of documents which  were not part  of the record\r\nbelow  and which the district  court declined to  certify to this\r\ncourt, and therefore  they should be stricken  from the appendix.\r\nSee Massachusetts v. United States Veterans Admin., 541 F.2d 119,\r                                                            \r\n123 n.5  (striking portions of an appendix  that were not part of\r\nthe record in the district court).  Even assuming these documents\r\nare properly before us, defendants cannot prevail.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nStates  v.  Halper, 490  U.S. 435,  439  (1989).   In determining\r                            \r\n\nwhether  the  protections  of  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause  are\r\n\nimplicated, our  first  line  of  inquiry is  whether  the  civil\r\n\nsanction constituted \"punishment,\" see United States  v. Stoller,\r                                                                          \r\n\n78 F.3d  710, 720-21 (1st Cir.  1996); our second is  whether the\r\n\npurported punishments  are for the same offense, Halper, 490 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 439.  Because we conclude that the civil sanction in this case\r\n\ndid not constitute punishment, we discern no plain error.\r\n\n          Defendants  argue that  the  civil proceedings  against\r\n\nthem  were the  equivalent  of civil  forfeiture proceedings  and\r\n\nimposed punishment for the  same offense in two or  more separate\r\n\nproceedings.    In  characterizing  their  settlement  with   the\r\n\nBankruptcy Trustee  and the  FTC as  a punitive forfeiture,  they\r\n\ncite two  expansive double jeopardy opinions  from other circuits\r\n\nwhich,  since oral  argument, have  been reversed by  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt.  See United States v. Ursery, 59 F.3d 568 (6th Cir. 1995),\r                                             \r\n\nrev'd       U.S.    ,  1996 WL  340815  (1996); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n$405,089.23 U.S.  Currency, 33 F.3d  1210 (9th Cir.  1994), rev'd\r                                                                           \r\n\nsub nom.

Ursery,     U.S. at    , 1996 WL 340815, *9.  In  that\r                           \r\n\ncase, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its \"traditional understanding\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthat  civil forfeiture  does  not constitute  punishment for  the\r\n\npurpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\"  Id.\r                                                      \r\n\n          Furthermore, even to  the extent that defendants'  1986\r\n\ncivil proceeding was not a civil forfeiture proceeding, it was by\r\n\nnature  remedial.    The  monetary  sanction  was  exacted  in  a\r\n\nbankruptcy case, and  the $2.5  million paid to  the trustee  was\r\n\nused  to pay a portion of claims against the defendants totalling\r\n\n$11.8 million resulting  from their  sale of coins.   A  monetary\r\n\nsanction which  has no  punitive function,  i.e., has  no purpose\r                                                          \r\n\nother than restitution or compensation for the loss engendered by\r\n\nthe defendants' conduct is not punishment within the ambit of the\r\n\ndouble jeopardy clause.   Halper, 490 U.S. at 446-49.   This is a\r                                          \r\n\nnear-perfect  exemplar of  compensation  for loss,  and does  not\r\n\nconstitute   punishment   for   purposes   of   double  jeopardy,\r\n\nnotwithstanding its financial impact on the defendants.\r\n\n          In view of our conclusion that there was no duplication\r\n\nof punishment, it is  unnecessary to consider the second  part of\r\n\nthe double jeopardy analysis:   whether the purported punishments\r\n\nwere  for  the same  offense.   In  any  case, we  note  that the\r\n\noffenses charged in this indictment contain crucial elements that\r\n\nby no stretch  of the imagination could be part of the resolution\r\n\nof  the bankruptcy  case  or of  the  underlying FTC  and  Postal\r\n\nService  cases; e.g., criminal  intent to defraud  and devising a\r\n\nscheme to  defraud.   Hence there  was no  double jeopardy.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nBlockburger v.

Appraisals and valuations by dealers of \"raw\" coins supplied\r\nby      RCGA \r          by      RCGA \r\n\n          The  defendants argue that evidence of the value of the\r\n\ncoins  sold by  the  defendants was  erroneously  admitted.   The\r\n\ngovernment offered, and the district court admitted, testimony of\r\n\neight  coin dealers that the  coins bought by  the RCGA customers\r\n\nwere of substantially lower quality and value than represented in\r\n\nthe accompanying documentation.   On appeal, the defendants argue\r\n\nthat  this  testimony  was  not properly  the  subject  of expert\r\n\ntestimony  and  was irrelevant,  neither  of  which grounds  were\r\n\nargued  to  the district  judge.   As  neither ground  was argued\r\n\nbelow, we  review only for plain error.  See, e.g., United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Ct.\r                                                              \r\n\n1986 (1995).\r\n\n          The value  of the coins  involved in a  prosecution for\r\n\ntheir fraudulent  sale is indisputably  relevant.  The  fact that\r\n\nthe subject matter is not \"scientific\" is no bar to admissibility\r\n\nof expert testimony.  Federal Rule of Evidence 702 specifies that\r\n\nexpert  testimony  covering   \"scientific,  technical,  or  other\r\n\nspecialized knowledge [which]  will assist the  trier of fact  to\r\n\nunderstand  the  evidence or  to determine  a  fact in  issue\" is\r\n\nadmissible.   See Daubert  v. Merrell Dow  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,\r                                                                           \r\n\n509  U.S.  579, 589  (1993) (emphasis  omitted).   A  trial judge\r\n\n\"enjoys  broad  discretion  in determining  the  admissibility of\r\n\nexpert testimony.\"   Montas, 41 F.3d  at 783.  Opinions  of value\r                                     \r\n\nare a traditional  subject of  expert testimony, and  it is  well\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nwithin the discretion  of the district judge to  admit them.  One\r\n\ncould hardly expect a  lay jury to form conclusions about such an\r\n\nesoteric subject as the value  of rare coins without the help  of\r\n\nexperts.   The  defendants complain,  however, that  the opinions\r\n\nwere not  based  on consistent  standards,  and were  subject  to\r\n\nfactors  of  taste and  assessment of  the  market, and  that the\r\n\nexperts  often disagreed  among themselves.  This is not unusual.\r\n\nThese  matters  are  properly  the subject  of  searching  cross-\r\n\nexamination.  See Daubert, 113 S. Ct. at 2798.   Defendants argue\r                                   \r\n\nfurther that this testimony should have been excluded under  Fed.\r\n\nR.  Evid.  403, because  its  prejudicial  effect outweighed  its\r\n\nprobative value.   This determination  is committed to  the sound\r\n\ndiscretion of the  trial court,  and will be  overturned only  in\r\n\n\"extraordinarily compelling circumstances,\"   Montas, 41 F.3d  at\r                                                              \r\n\n783,  which we do not detect in this case.  Review of  the record\r\n\nreveals that the experts were experienced,  the chains of custody\r\n\nof  the coins  were carefully  established, the  experts' methods\r\n\nwere  explained,  and  the  appraisals  were reasonably  current.\r\n\nThorough cross-examination  was permitted  on all of  the issues,\r\n\nsuch as  subjective judgments  and variable markets,  which might\r\n\nimpeach the expert  testimony.  We perceive  no error,   plain or\r\n\notherwise.\r\n\n2.  Purchasers' evidence of resale\r          2.  Purchasers' evidence of resale\r\n\n          Defendants  complain   further  that  several   of  the\r\n\npurchasers from RCGA  were permitted to  testify about the  price\r\n\nthey realized  on resale  of the  coins.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nDiMarzo, 80 F.3d  656, 659-60  (1st Cir. 1996).   Their  argument\r                 \r\n\nthat this testimony  was outside the competence  of lay witnesses\r\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 701 is far off the mark.   This testimony was\r\n\nnot  opinion  testimony at  all, but  a  simple recitation  of an\r\n\nobserved  phenomenon:   the price  paid for  the coins.   A  more\r\n\ncogent argument  is that  these may  have  been distress  prices,\r\n\nrather than  fair market prices.   This might have  been a ground\r\n\nfor exclusion  in a clear  case of  a distress sale,  but whether\r\n\nthey were  distress sales or not, in  the context of the evidence\r\n\nin  this case,  was a  question of  fact properly left  to cross-\r\n\nexamination and ultimately to the jury.    This was the procedure\r\n\ncorrectly permitted by the district judge.\r\n\n3.  ANACS' evaluations of RCGA raw coins\r          3.  ANACS' evaluations of RCGA raw coins\r\n\n          Defendants   challenge   the  admission   of  testimony\r\n\nconcerning  the   grades  the  American   Numismatic  Association\r\n\nCertification Service  (ANACS) assigned to certain  coins sold by\r\n\nRCGA.  Throughout the trial the government attempted to introduce\r\n\nANACS certificates  of value obtained after  RCGA's bankruptcy by\r\n\ntwo dissatisfied customers, Dr. Anthony Scapicchio (\"Scapicchio\")\r\n\nand Caleb Morgan (\"Morgan\").   While Morgan's coins were  not the\r\n\nsubject of  any count of  the indictment,  Scapicchio's were  the\r\n\nsubject  of Count  VIII.   The ANACS  graders who  prepared these\r\n\ncertificates  were  not  available  for  cross-examination,  and,\r\n\nindeed, were not even identified.\r\n\n          On  the  fourth  day   of  trial,  the  district  judge\r\n\nconditionally admitted  the certificates, based  on the testimony\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nof  Richard  Montgomery, director  of  ANACS from  1980  to 1987,\r\n\nconcerning ANACS' valuation  procedure.  The next  day, the judge\r\n\nallowed  Morgan to read  his certificates to  the jury.   The day\r\n\nafter that, the  judge excluded a  similar reading by  Scapicchio\r\n\nand struck the Morgan  testimony.  Finally, on the  sixteenth day\r\n\nof trial, the court ruled that \"the jury is fully informed and is\r\n\nin  a  position  to  make  a discriminating  judgment  about  how\r\n\nreliable, if at all, the ANACS determinations are,\" and permitted\r\n\na postal inspector to read the Morgan and Scapicchio certificates\r\n\nto  the  jury at  the  close  of the  government's  case.   Since\r\n\nspecific  objections   were  made  to  the   admission  of  these\r\n\ncertificates,  we review  for  abuse of  discretion.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nCameron  v. Otto Bock Orthopedic  Industry, Inc., 43  F.3d 14, 16\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          We find no such abuse here.  The     foundation     for\r\n\nadmission  of  a  business  record  under Fed.  R.  Evid.  803(6)\r\n\nrequires  both the testimony of a qualified custodial witness and\r\n\na showing that the  declarant was a person with  knowledge acting\r\n\nin the course of  a regularly conducted business activity.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,  Petrocelli v.

See, e.g., Wallace Motor\r                                                                           \r\n\nSales  v. American Motors Sales  Corp., 780 F.2d  1049, 1061 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1985)  (noting that  the qualifying  witness  need not  have\r\n\nactually  prepared the record, but \"is simply one who can explain\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nand be cross-examined concerning the manner in which the  records\r\n\nare made and kept\").  \r\n\n          Further, we do not find that the \"source of information\r\n\nof the method  or circumstances of  preparation indicate lack  of\r\n\ntrustworthiness\"  in  the certificates.    Fed.  R. Evid.  803(6)\r\n\n(excluding business  records on that basis);  see Petrocelli, 679\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  at  291  (excluding  business record  testimony  where  the\r\n\nrecords  were \"so  cryptic  that pure  guesswork and  speculation\r\n\n[was] required to  divine the source of  the cited information\").\r\n\nIt  was not  for the  trial  judge, but  the  jury, to  determine\r\n\nwhether the opinions in the certificates reliably assigned values\r\n\nto the coins.  Indeed, the district court allowed the defense  to\r\n\nconduct liberal (if not excessive) inquiry into the unreliability\r\n\nof the ANACS certificates.  \r\n\n          Defendants  also challenge  the  admissibility of  this\r\n\nevidence  on  constitutional  grounds, claiming  that  they  were\r\n\ndenied  their Sixth Amendment  right of confrontation.2   We find\r\n\nManocchio v.

We  specifically\r\n\nstated  that  the  reasoning  in  Inadi  which  led  us  to  that\r                                                 \r\n\nconclusion  would  apply  equally   to  other  types  of  hearsay\r\n\nexceptions  -- including business records.

Our review of  the record  here\r                                         \r\n\npersuades  us  that  the   evidence  was  sufficient  to  warrant\r\n\nconviction beyond a reasonable doubt.   \r\n\n          First, the government  presented extensive evidence  of\r\n\nsystematic overgrading.   Ten customers testified  that they sold\r\n\ntheir portfolios for a small fraction of the purchase price.  Two\r\n\nexperts indicated that the  coin market did not account  for this\r\n\nprecipitous drop.  Two suppliers  of RCGA's coins indicated  that\r\n\nKalp  only purchased  MS63 coins.   An expert  witness correlated\r\n\nRCGA's records with  pricing data and  determined that RCGA  only\r\n\npaid MS63  prices for the  coins it sold  to consumers.   Several\r\n\nformer  RCGA  employees  testified  inter  alia that  coins  were\r                                                         \r\n\nroutinely upgraded.   One  employee testified that  Kayne ordered\r\n\nher to alter an ANACS certificate.\r\n\n          As  for the  ANACS  certificates, as  noted above,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court allowed  the defense  liberal inquiry  into their\r\n\nunreliability.  Indeed, defense counsel was repeatedly allowed to\r\n\ncross-examine coin dealers on  subjects well beyond the scope  of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthis  circuit, which has been informed by the later Supreme Court\r\ndecisions.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ndirect examination.   Although the court  invited the defense  to\r\n\npropose a limiting instruction, this offer was not accepted.  The\r\n\ntestimony about the certificates  came into evidence after eleven\r\n\nseparate  appraisals were  presented to  the jury.    Neither the\r\n\nANACS documents  nor  the appraisals  were allowed  to come  into\r\n\nevidence,  and the  district  judge required  the prosecution  to\r\n\nstructure the  presentation of  the certificates to  be virtually\r\n\nidentical to the appraisals. \r\n\n          Third, systematic  overgrading was  only a part  of the\r\n\ngovernment's demonstration of fraud.  Several employees indicated\r\n\nthat statements in RCGA's promotional literature  were misleading\r\n\nby  stating that RCGA  had achieved $90  million in sales,  had a\r\n\nmulti-million dollar inventory,  and had a Paris affiliate.  Five\r\n\ncustomers whom  RCGA  cited as  making substantial  profits on  a\r\n\n\"liquidation\" report sent to prospective investors testified that\r\n\nthey never received payment, or were  paid only after instituting\r\n\ncivil litigation.  There was evidence of a $1 million discrepancy\r\n\nin  RCGA's books,  that  Kayne encouraged  financial planners  to\r\n\nconduct transactions  in cash, and that Kayne  and Kalp routinely\r\n\nskimmed cash from office accounts.  \r\n\n              D.

The defendants were sentenced to 36-months imprisonment, and ordered to pay $339,466 in restitution.  On appeal, Kayne and Kalp argue (1) that jeopardy had attached in a prior government proceeding;  (2) that certain evidence was improperly admitted;  (3) that the evidence submitted below was not sufficient to sustain the convictions;  and (4) that Kalp received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.  For the reasons laid out below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1970s, many new investors entered the market for rare coins.  Unlike knowledgeable hobbyists and \"vest pocket\" dealers, these newcomers had no specialized expertise, and were just looking for a stable investment.  Seeking to capitalize on this booming market, defendants Edward Kalp and Richard Kayne left a distinguished Boston coin brokerage and established the Rare Coin Galleries of America (\"RCGA\") in July 1982.  Kalp, the President of RCGA, functioned as the in-house numismatist, examining and valuing coins for purchase from wholesalers, and pricing them for resale.  Kayne, as RCGA's marketing director, recruited financial planners and solicited customers.  For four years RCGA operated successfully, generating millions of dollars in revenues from approximately 3,000 customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A typical RCGA investor paid between $5,000 and $25,000 for a portfolio of coins.  In the rare coin market, the value of a coin is dependent upon its \"grade,\" which is a numismatic measure of comparative wear on a 70 point scale.  Small distinctions in grade can yield large differences in the value of a coin.  For example, among relatively pristine, uncirculated \"mint state\" (\"MS\") coins, an MS65 coin can fetch ten times the price of an MS63.  For \"certified\" coins, grade is determined by a certification service which typically employs a panel of numismatists.  Prior to 1986, the only independent grading service was the American Numismatic Association Certification Service (\"ANACS\").  For \"raw\" coins (which have not been certified), grade and value may be established between two knowledgeable collectors, or an amateur may rely on the representation of a respected numismatist.  Most of the raw and certified coins which RCGA supplied its customers were purported to be MS65 coins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By mid-1986, at least two federal agencies had received many complaints from RCGA customers asserting that the coins sold by RCGA were of substantially lower quality and value than represented.  After a preliminary investigation in July 1986, the United States Postal Service applied for and was granted authority by the late Chief Judge Andrew Caffrey of the District of Massachusetts to intercept RCGA's mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") was conducting a parallel nationwide investigation of the rare coin investment market.  The investigation quickly focused on RCGA, among others.  On September 16, 1986, the FTC instituted a civil action alleging that RCGA was engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices under 15 U.S.C. &#167; 45(a).  This case was also assigned to Judge Caffrey, who forthwith entered a temporary restraining order \"freezing\" not only the business but the personal assets owned by Kayne and Kalp.  On October 14, RCGA filed a Chapter 11 petition for bankruptcy reorganization, which was removed to the district court and consolidated with the Postal Service and FTC actions.  The following week, Judge Caffrey granted preliminary injunctions requested by the Postal Service and the FTC, and appointed a Bankruptcy Trustee, who initiated adverse proceedings against Kayne and Kalp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion of the civil litigation came the following spring, when the FTC, the Trustee, Kayne, and Kalp entered into a settlement agreement requiring Kayne and Kalp to surrender $2.2 million in personal assets to the Trustee and never to market coins to the public again.  Also pursuant to this agreement, the FTC's claim for $11.9 million in consumer restitution was given priority status for payment of the Trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, 1991, an indictment charging Kalp and Kayne with 29 counts of mail fraud was filed, based on the correspondence intercepted the summer of 1986.  The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony from former RCGA employees, financial planners, suppliers, and customers, as well as coin dealers and numismatic experts.  After almost six weeks of testimony, the jury convicted Kayne and Kalp of 15 counts of fraud.  The prosecution dropped nine counts prior to their submission to the jury, the jury acquitted on four counts, and the district judge acquitted on one count.  Defendants have been sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment and ordered to pay $339,466 in restitution.  The sentence has been stayed pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both defendants have asserted that jeopardy attached to the 1986 civil litigation and should bar this prosecution.  This defense has surfaced for the first time on appeal.  Even though the fundamental constitutional issue of double jeopardy was not raised at trial, we will entertain the appeal, but review only for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Rivera, 872 F.2d 507, 509 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 818, 110 S.Ct. 71, 107 L.Ed.2d 38 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy clause protects against \"multiple punishments for the same offense,\" even if one of the proceedings is civil and one criminal, regardless of the sequence.  United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 439, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1896-97, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989).  In determining whether the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated, our first line of inquiry is whether the civil sanction constituted \"punishment,\" see United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 720-21 (1st Cir.1996);  our second is whether the purported punishments are for the same offense, Halper, 490 U.S. at 439, 109 S.Ct. at 1896-97 .  Because we conclude that the civil sanction in this case did not constitute punishment, we discern no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the civil proceedings against them were the equivalent of civil forfeiture proceedings and imposed punishment for the same offense in two or more separate proceedings.  In characterizing their settlement with the Bankruptcy Trustee and the FTC as a punitive forfeiture, they cite two expansive double jeopardy opinions from other circuits which, since oral argument, have been reversed by the Supreme Court.  See United States v. Ursery, 59 F.3d 568 (6th Cir.1995), rev'd --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996);  United States v. $405,089.23 U.S. Currency, 33 F.3d 1210 (9th Cir.1994), rev'd sub nom.  Ursery, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming, arguendo, that the civil proceeding against defendants is the equivalent of a civil forfeiture proceeding, the Supreme Court's opinion in Ursery makes it clear that the 1986 civil proceeding was not \"punishment\" for double jeopardy purposes.  Ursery, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2143.   In that case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its \"traditional understanding that civil forfeiture does not constitute punishment for the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even to the extent that defendants' 1986 civil proceeding was not a civil forfeiture proceeding, it was by nature remedial.  The monetary sanction was exacted in a bankruptcy case, and the $2.5 million paid to the trustee was used to pay a portion of claims against the defendants totalling $11.8 million resulting from their sale of coins.  A monetary sanction which has no punitive function, i.e., has no purpose other than restitution or compensation for the loss engendered by the defendants' conduct is not punishment within the ambit of the double jeopardy clause.  Halper, 490 U.S. at 446-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1900-02.   This is a near-perfect exemplar of compensation for loss, and does not constitute punishment for purposes of double jeopardy, notwithstanding its financial impact on the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of our conclusion that there was no duplication of punishment, it is unnecessary to consider the second part of the double jeopardy analysis:  whether the purported punishments were for the same offense.  In any case, we note that the offenses charged in this indictment contain crucial elements that by no stretch of the imagination could be part of the resolution of the bankruptcy case or of the underlying FTC and Postal Service cases;  e.g., criminal intent to defraud and devising a scheme to defraud.  Hence there was no double jeopardy.  See Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Evidentiary Challenges</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>1. Appraisals and valuations by dealers of \"raw\" coins supplied by RCGA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants argue that evidence of the value of the coins sold by the defendants was erroneously admitted.  The government offered, and the district court admitted, testimony of eight coin dealers that the coins bought by the RCGA customers were of substantially lower quality and value than represented in the accompanying documentation.  On appeal, the defendants argue that this testimony was not properly the subject of expert testimony and was irrelevant, neither of which grounds were argued to the district judge.  As neither ground was argued below, we review only for plain error.  See, e.g., United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1986, 131 L.Ed.2d 873 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The value of the coins involved in a prosecution for their fraudulent sale is indisputably relevant.  The fact that the subject matter is not \"scientific\" is no bar to admissibility of expert testimony.  Federal Rule of Evidence 702 specifies that expert testimony covering \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [which] will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\" is admissible.  See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2794-95, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) (emphasis omitted).  A trial judge \"enjoys broad discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony.\"  Montas, 41 F.3d at 783.   Opinions of value are a traditional subject of expert testimony, and it is well within the discretion of the district judge to admit them.  One could hardly expect a lay jury to form conclusions about such an esoteric subject as the value of rare coins without the help of experts.  The defendants complain, however, that the opinions were not based on consistent standards, and were subject to factors of taste and assessment of the market, and that the experts often disagreed among themselves.  This is not unusual.  These matters are properly the subject of searching cross-examination.  See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. at 2798.   Defendants argue further that this testimony should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403, because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.  This determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and will be overturned only in \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances,\" Montas, 41 F.3d at 783, which we do not detect in this case.  Review of the record reveals that the experts were experienced, the chains of custody of the coins were carefully established, the experts' methods were explained, and the appraisals were reasonably current.  Thorough cross-examination was permitted on all of the issues, such as subjective judgments and variable markets, which might impeach the expert testimony.  We perceive no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Purchasers' evidence of resale</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants complain further that several of the purchasers from RCGA were permitted to testify about the price they realized on resale of the coins.  See United States v. DiMarzo, 80 F.3d 656, 659-60 (1st Cir.1996).  Their argument that this testimony was outside the competence of lay witnesses under Fed.R.Evid. 701 is far off the mark.  This testimony was not opinion testimony at all, but a simple recitation of an observed phenomenon:  the price paid for the coins.  A more cogent argument is that these may have been distress prices, rather than fair market prices.  This might have been a ground for exclusion in a clear case of a distress sale, but whether they were distress sales or not, in the context of the evidence in this case, was a question of fact properly left to cross-examination and ultimately to the jury.  This was the procedure correctly permitted by the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. ANACS' evaluations of RCGA raw coins</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge the admission of testimony concerning the grades the American Numismatic Association Certification Service (ANACS) assigned to certain coins sold by RCGA.  Throughout the trial the government attempted to introduce ANACS certificates of value obtained after RCGA's bankruptcy by two dissatisfied customers, Dr. Anthony Scapicchio (\"Scapicchio\") and Caleb Morgan (\"Morgan\").  While Morgan's coins were not the subject of any count of the indictment, Scapicchio's were the subject of Count VIII.  The ANACS graders who prepared these certificates were not available for cross-examination, and, indeed, were not even identified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fourth day of trial, the district judge conditionally admitted the certificates, based on the testimony of Richard Montgomery, director of ANACS from 1980 to 1987, concerning ANACS' valuation procedure.  The next day, the judge allowed Morgan to read his certificates to the jury.  The day after that, the judge excluded a similar reading by Scapicchio and struck the Morgan testimony.  Finally, on the sixteenth day of trial, the court ruled that \"the jury is fully informed and is in a position to make a discriminating judgment about how reliable, if at all, the ANACS determinations are,\" and permitted a postal inspector to read the Morgan and Scapicchio certificates to the jury at the close of the government's case.  Since specific objections were made to the admission of these certificates, we review for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Cameron v. Otto Bock Orthopedic Industry, Inc., 43 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no such abuse here.  The foundation for admission of a business record under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) requires both the testimony of a qualified custodial witness and a showing that the declarant was a person with knowledge acting in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.  See, e.g., Petrocelli v. Gallison, 679 F.2d 286, 290 (1st Cir.1982).  Montgomery's evaluation adequately established the genesis of the records and their subsequent custody.  See, e.g., Wallace Motor Sales v. American Motors Sales Corp., 780 F.2d 1049, 1061 (1st Cir.1985) (noting that the qualifying witness need not have actually prepared the record, but \"is simply one who can explain and be cross-examined concerning the manner in which the records are made and kept\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we do not find that the \"source of information of the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness\" in the certificates.  Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) (excluding business records on that basis);  see Petrocelli, 679 F.2d at 291 (excluding business record testimony where the records were \"so cryptic that pure guesswork and speculation [was] required to divine the source of the cited information\").  It was not for the trial judge, but the jury, to determine whether the opinions in the certificates reliably assigned values to the coins.  Indeed, the district court allowed the defense to conduct liberal (if not excessive) inquiry into the unreliability of the ANACS certificates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also challenge the admissibility of this evidence on constitutional grounds, claiming that they were denied their Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We find Manocchio v. Moran, 919 F.2d 770 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 910, 111 S.Ct. 1695, 114 L.Ed.2d 89 (1991), controls our analysis in this matter.  There, the government sought to enter an autopsy report about an autopsy performed by a forensic pathologist who had since moved to Israel.  The testimony of another signatory to the report, the keeper of the records, was offered in order to lay the foundation for admission.  Id. at 772.   Relying on United States v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 394, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 1125-26, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986), we found that the government was not required to demonstrate the examining pathologist's unavailability in order to enter the report.  We specifically stated that the reasoning in Inadi which led us to that conclusion would apply equally to other types of hearsay exceptions--including business records.  Id. at 774;  see White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 354, 112 S.Ct. 736, 741-42, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (\"[U]navailability analysis is a necessary part of the Confrontation Clause inquiry only when the challenged out-of-court statements were made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding.\").  Having determined that, our decision in Manocchio noted that it was \"left ... with reliability as the determining factor for the admissibility of the autopsy report under the Confrontation Clause.\"  Manocchio, 919 F.2d at 776.   However, we specifically noted that reliability could be shown by \"showing that the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"  Id.;  see White, 502 U.S. at 356, n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 742-43 n. 8 (noting that \" 'firmly rooted' exceptions carry sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy the reliability requirement posed by the Confrontation Clause\");  United States v. Trenkler, 61 F.3d 45, 64 (1st Cir.1995) (Torruella, C.J., dissenting on other grounds).  Since we have already shown that to be true in the present case, we need not address this argument further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next challenge the sufficiency of the evidence marshalled against them.  We review such challenges to \"determine whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 323 (1st Cir.1995), viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, id.   Our review of the record here persuades us that the evidence was sufficient to warrant conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the government presented extensive evidence of systematic overgrading.  Ten customers testified that they sold their portfolios for a small fraction of the purchase price.  Two experts indicated that the coin market did not account for this precipitous drop.  Two suppliers of RCGA's coins indicated that Kalp only purchased MS63 coins.  An expert witness correlated RCGA's records with pricing data and determined that RCGA only paid MS63 prices for the coins it sold to consumers.  Several former RCGA employees testified inter alia that coins were routinely upgraded.  One employee testified that Kayne ordered her to alter an ANACS certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the ANACS certificates, as noted above, the district court allowed the defense liberal inquiry into their unreliability.  Indeed, defense counsel was repeatedly allowed to cross-examine coin dealers on subjects well beyond the scope of direct examination.  Although the court invited the defense to propose a limiting instruction, this offer was not accepted.  The testimony about the certificates came into evidence after eleven separate appraisals were presented to the jury.  Neither the ANACS documents nor the appraisals were allowed to come into evidence, and the district judge required the prosecution to structure the presentation of the certificates to be virtually identical to the appraisals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, systematic overgrading was only a part of the government's demonstration of fraud.  Several employees indicated that statements in RCGA's promotional literature were misleading by stating that RCGA had achieved $90 million in sales, had a multi-million dollar inventory, and had a Paris affiliate.  Five customers whom RCGA cited as making substantial profits on a \"liquidation\" report sent to prospective investors testified that they never received payment, or were paid only after instituting civil litigation.  There was evidence of a $1 million discrepancy in RCGA's books, that Kayne encouraged financial planners to conduct transactions in cash, and that Kayne and Kalp routinely skimmed cash from office accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We trumpet the message for the umpteenth time that allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel must be raised initially before the district court, typically by a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.  See, e.g., United States v. Costa, 890 F.2d 480, 482-83 (1st Cir.1989) (discussing rationale behind rule).  Moreover, the asserted ineffective assistance of counsel consisted of counsel's failure to raise the issue of Double Jeopardy;  in view of our ruling on that claim, it may simply be that trial counsel was quite perceptive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the opinion of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Judge Skinner, of the District of Massachusetts, sat by designation, heard oral argument in this matter and thereafter recused himself.

See Massachusetts v. United States Veterans Admin., 541 F.2d 119, 123 n. 5 (striking portions of an appendix that were not part of the record in the district court).  Even assuming these documents are properly before us, defendants cannot prevail</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Government argues that defendants have waived this issue by failing to object on Confrontation Clause grounds below.

Rather than look to McClintock for guidance, therefore, we will apply the case law of this circuit, which has been informed by the later Supreme Court decisions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

After a six week trial, a jury convicted both defendants on fifteen counts and acquitted them on four;  the judge granted a motion for acquittal on one;  and the government dropped the remaining counts.  The defendants were sentenced to 36-months imprisonment, and ordered to pay $339,466 in restitution.  On appeal, Kayne and Kalp argue (1) that jeopardy had attached in a prior government proceeding;  (2) that certain evidence was improperly admitted;  (3) that the evidence submitted below was not sufficient to sustain the convictions;  and (4) that Kalp received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.  For the reasons laid out below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1970s, many new investors entered the market for rare coins.  Unlike knowledgeable hobbyists and \"vest pocket\" dealers, these newcomers had no specialized expertise, and were just looking for a stable investment.  Seeking to capitalize on this booming market, defendants Edward Kalp and Richard Kayne left a distinguished Boston coin brokerage and established the Rare Coin Galleries of America (\"RCGA\") in July 1982.  Kalp, the President of RCGA, functioned as the in-house numismatist, examining and valuing coins for purchase from wholesalers, and pricing them for resale.  Kayne, as RCGA's marketing director, recruited financial planners and solicited customers.  For four years RCGA operated successfully, generating millions of dollars in revenues from approximately 3,000 customers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A typical RCGA investor paid between $5,000 and $25,000 for a portfolio of coins.  In the rare coin market, the value of a coin is dependent upon its \"grade,\" which is a numismatic measure of comparative wear on a 70 point scale.  Small distinctions in grade can yield large differences in the value of a coin.  For example, among relatively pristine, uncirculated \"mint state\" (\"MS\") coins, an MS65 coin can fetch ten times the price of an MS63.  For \"certified\" coins, grade is determined by a certification service which typically employs a panel of numismatists.  Prior to 1986, the only independent grading service was the American Numismatic Association Certification Service (\"ANACS\").  For \"raw\" coins (which have not been certified), grade and value may be established between two knowledgeable collectors, or an amateur may rely on the representation of a respected numismatist.  Most of the raw and certified coins which RCGA supplied its customers were purported to be MS65 coins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By mid-1986, at least two federal agencies had received many complaints from RCGA customers asserting that the coins sold by RCGA were of substantially lower quality and value than represented.  After a preliminary investigation in July 1986, the United States Postal Service applied for and was granted authority by the late Chief Judge Andrew Caffrey of the District of Massachusetts to intercept RCGA's mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") was conducting a parallel nationwide investigation of the rare coin investment market.  The investigation quickly focused on RCGA, among others.  On September 16, 1986, the FTC instituted a civil action alleging that RCGA was engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices under 15 U.S.C. &#167; 45(a).  This case was also assigned to Judge Caffrey, who forthwith entered a temporary restraining order \"freezing\" not only the business but the personal assets owned by Kayne and Kalp.  On October 14, RCGA filed a Chapter 11 petition for bankruptcy reorganization, which was removed to the district court and consolidated with the Postal Service and FTC actions.  The following week, Judge Caffrey granted preliminary injunctions requested by the Postal Service and the FTC, and appointed a Bankruptcy Trustee, who initiated adverse proceedings against Kayne and Kalp.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion of the civil litigation came the following spring, when the FTC, the Trustee, Kayne, and Kalp entered into a settlement agreement requiring Kayne and Kalp to surrender $2.2 million in personal assets to the Trustee and never to market coins to the public again.  Also pursuant to this agreement, the FTC's claim for $11.9 million in consumer restitution was given priority status for payment of the Trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 11, 1991, an indictment charging Kalp and Kayne with 29 counts of mail fraud was filed, based on the correspondence intercepted the summer of 1986.  The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony from former RCGA employees, financial planners, suppliers, and customers, as well as coin dealers and numismatic experts.  After almost six weeks of testimony, the jury convicted Kayne and Kalp of 15 counts of fraud.  The prosecution dropped nine counts prior to their submission to the jury, the jury acquitted on four counts, and the district judge acquitted on one count.  Defendants have been sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment and ordered to pay $339,466 in restitution.  The sentence has been stayed pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both defendants have asserted that jeopardy attached to the 1986 civil litigation and should bar this prosecution.  This defense has surfaced for the first time on appeal.  Even though the fundamental constitutional issue of double jeopardy was not raised at trial, we will entertain the appeal, but review only for plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  See, e.g., United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span> (1989).  In determining whether the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated, our first line of inquiry is whether the civil sanction constituted \"punishment,\" see United States v. Stoller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714794\"><a href=\"/opinion/714794/united-states-v-robert-s-stoller/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 720-21 (1st Cir.1996);  our second is whether the purported punishments are for the same offense, Halper, 490 U.S. at 439, 109 S.Ct. at 1896-97 .  Because we conclude that the civil sanction in this case did not constitute punishment, we discern no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the civil proceedings against them were the equivalent of civil forfeiture proceedings and imposed punishment for the same offense in two or more separate proceedings.  In characterizing their settlement with the Bankruptcy Trustee and the FTC as a punitive forfeiture, they cite two expansive double jeopardy opinions from other circuits which, since oral argument, have been reversed by the Supreme Court.

Ursery, --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 2143.   In that case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its \"traditional understanding that civil forfeiture does not constitute punishment for the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even to the extent that defendants' 1986 civil proceeding was not a civil forfeiture proceeding, it was by nature remedial.  The monetary sanction was exacted in a bankruptcy case, and the $2.5 million paid to the trustee was used to pay a portion of claims against the defendants totalling $11.8 million resulting from their sale of coins.  A monetary sanction which has no punitive function, i.e., has no purpose other than restitution or compensation for the loss engendered by the defendants' conduct is not punishment within the ambit of the double jeopardy clause.  Halper, 490 U.S. at 446-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1900-02.   This is a near-perfect exemplar of compensation for loss, and does not constitute punishment for purposes of double jeopardy, notwithstanding its financial impact on the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of our conclusion that there was no duplication of punishment, it is unnecessary to consider the second part of the double jeopardy analysis:  whether the purported punishments were for the same offense.  In any case, we note that the offenses charged in this indictment contain crucial elements that by no stretch of the imagination could be part of the resolution of the bankruptcy case or of the underlying FTC and Postal Service cases;  e.g., criminal intent to defraud and devising a scheme to defraud.  Hence there was no double jeopardy.  See Blockburger v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government offered, and the district court admitted, testimony of eight coin dealers that the coins bought by the RCGA customers were of substantially lower quality and value than represented in the accompanying documentation.  On appeal, the defendants argue that this testimony was not properly the subject of expert testimony and was irrelevant, neither of which grounds were argued to the district judge.  As neither ground was argued below, we review only for plain error.  See, e.g., United States v. Montas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195767\"><a href=\"/opinion/195767/united-states-v-felix-montas/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The fact that the subject matter is not \"scientific\" is no bar to admissibility of expert testimony.  Federal Rule of Evidence 702 specifies that expert testimony covering \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [which] will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\" is admissible.  See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 589, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112903\"><a href=\"/opinion/112903/daubert-v-merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span> (1993) (emphasis omitted).  A trial judge \"enjoys broad discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony.\"  Montas, 41 F.3d at 783.   Opinions of value are a traditional subject of expert testimony, and it is well within the discretion of the district judge to admit them.  One could hardly expect a lay jury to form conclusions about such an esoteric subject as the value of rare coins without the help of experts.  The defendants complain, however, that the opinions were not based on consistent standards, and were subject to factors of taste and assessment of the market, and that the experts often disagreed among themselves.  This is not unusual.  These matters are properly the subject of searching cross-examination.  See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. at 2798.   Defendants argue further that this testimony should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403, because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.  This determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and will be overturned only in \"extraordinarily compelling circumstances,\" Montas, 41 F.3d at 783, which we do not detect in this case.  Review of the record reveals that the experts were experienced, the chains of custody of the coins were carefully established, the experts' methods were explained, and the appraisals were reasonably current.  Thorough cross-examination was permitted on all of the issues, such as subjective judgments and variable markets, which might impeach the expert testimony.  We perceive no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Purchasers' evidence of resale</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants complain further that several of the purchasers from RCGA were permitted to testify about the price they realized on resale of the coins.  See United States v. DiMarzo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715774\"><a href=\"/opinion/715774/united-states-v-miguel-dimarzo-aka-michael-dimarzo-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 659-60 (1st Cir.1996).  Their argument that this testimony was outside the competence of lay witnesses under Fed.R.Evid. 701 is far off the mark.  This testimony was not opinion testimony at all, but a simple recitation of an observed phenomenon:  the price paid for the coins.  A more cogent argument is that these may have been distress prices, rather than fair market prices.  This might have been a ground for exclusion in a clear case of a distress sale, but whether they were distress sales or not, in the context of the evidence in this case, was a question of fact properly left to cross-examination and ultimately to the jury.  This was the procedure correctly permitted by the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. ANACS' evaluations of RCGA raw coins</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenge the admission of testimony concerning the grades the American Numismatic Association Certification Service (ANACS) assigned to certain coins sold by RCGA.  Throughout the trial the government attempted to introduce ANACS certificates of value obtained after RCGA's bankruptcy by two dissatisfied customers, Dr. Anthony Scapicchio (\"Scapicchio\") and Caleb Morgan (\"Morgan\").  While Morgan's coins were not the subject of any count of the indictment, Scapicchio's were the subject of Count VIII.  The ANACS graders who prepared these certificates were not available for cross-examination, and, indeed, were not even identified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the fourth day of trial, the district judge conditionally admitted the certificates, based on the testimony of Richard Montgomery, director of ANACS from 1980 to 1987, concerning ANACS' valuation procedure.  The next day, the judge allowed Morgan to read his certificates to the jury.  The day after that, the judge excluded a similar reading by Scapicchio and struck the Morgan testimony.  Finally, on the sixteenth day of trial, the court ruled that \"the jury is fully informed and is in a position to make a discriminating judgment about how reliable, if at all, the ANACS determinations are,\" and permitted a postal inspector to read the Morgan and Scapicchio certificates to the jury at the close of the government's case.  Since specific objections were made to the admission of these certificates, we review for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Cameron v. Otto Bock Orthopedic Industry, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195813\"><a href=\"/opinion/195813/cameron-v-otto-bock-orthopedic/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no such abuse here.  The foundation for admission of a business record under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) requires both the testimony of a qualified custodial witness and a showing that the declarant was a person with knowledge acting in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.  See, e.g., Petrocelli v. Gallison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"404116\"><a href=\"/opinion/404116/james-e-petrocelli-sr-v-davis-t-gallison-md/\"><span class=\"volume\">679</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 290 (1st Cir.1982).  Montgomery's evaluation adequately established the genesis of the records and their subsequent custody.  See, e.g., Wallace Motor Sales v. American Motors Sales Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463159\"><a href=\"/opinion/463159/wallace-motor-sales-inc-ralph-e-wallace-and-third-party-v-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span>, 1061 (1st Cir.1985) (noting that the qualifying witness need not have actually prepared the record, but \"is simply one who can explain and be cross-examined concerning the manner in which the records are made and kept\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, we do not find that the \"source of information of the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness\" in the certificates.  Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) (excluding business records on that basis);  see Petrocelli, 679 F.2d at 291 (excluding business record testimony where the records were \"so cryptic that pure guesswork and speculation [was] required to divine the source of the cited information\").  It was not for the trial judge, but the jury, to determine whether the opinions in the certificates reliably assigned values to the coins.  Indeed, the district court allowed the defense to conduct liberal (if not excessive) inquiry into the unreliability of the ANACS certificates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also challenge the admissibility of this evidence on constitutional grounds, claiming that they were denied their Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We find Manocchio v.

Having determined that, our decision in Manocchio noted that it was \"left ... with reliability as the determining factor for the admissibility of the autopsy report under the Confrontation Clause.\"  Manocchio, 919 F.2d at 776.   However, we specifically noted that reliability could be shown by \"showing that the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"  Id.;  see White, 502 U.S. at 356, n. 8, 112 S.Ct. at 742-43 n. 8 (noting that \" 'firmly rooted' exceptions carry sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy the reliability requirement posed by the Confrontation Clause\");  United States v.

Since we have already shown that to be true in the present case, we need not address this argument further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next challenge the sufficiency of the evidence marshalled against them.  We review such challenges to \"determine whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" United States v. Flores-Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 323 (1st Cir.1995), viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, id.   Our review of the record here persuades us that the evidence was sufficient to warrant conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the government presented extensive evidence of systematic overgrading.  Ten customers testified that they sold their portfolios for a small fraction of the purchase price.  Two experts indicated that the coin market did not account for this precipitous drop.  Two suppliers of RCGA's coins indicated that Kalp only purchased MS63 coins.  An expert witness correlated RCGA's records with pricing data and determined that RCGA only paid MS63 prices for the coins it sold to consumers.  Several former RCGA employees testified inter alia that coins were routinely upgraded.  One employee testified that Kayne ordered her to alter an ANACS certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the ANACS certificates, as noted above, the district court allowed the defense liberal inquiry into their unreliability.  Indeed, defense counsel was repeatedly allowed to cross-examine coin dealers on subjects well beyond the scope of direct examination.  Although the court invited the defense to propose a limiting instruction, this offer was not accepted.  The testimony about the certificates came into evidence after eleven separate appraisals were presented to the jury.  Neither the ANACS documents nor the appraisals were allowed to come into evidence, and the district judge required the prosecution to structure the presentation of the certificates to be virtually identical to the appraisals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, systematic overgrading was only a part of the government's demonstration of fraud.  Several employees indicated that statements in RCGA's promotional literature were misleading by stating that RCGA had achieved $90 million in sales, had a multi-million dollar inventory, and had a Paris affiliate.  Five customers whom RCGA cited as making substantial profits on a \"liquidation\" report sent to prospective investors testified that they never received payment, or were paid only after instituting civil litigation.  There was evidence of a $1 million discrepancy in RCGA's books, that Kayne encouraged financial planners to conduct transactions in cash, and that Kayne and Kalp routinely skimmed cash from office accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We trumpet the message for the umpteenth time that allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel must be raised initially before the district court, typically by a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.  See, e.g., United States v. Costa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532745\"><a href=\"/opinion/532745/united-states-v-robert-costa-united-states-of-america-v-john-t-durand/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 482-83 (1st Cir.1989) (discussing rationale behind rule).  Moreover, the asserted ineffective assistance of counsel consisted of counsel's failure to raise the issue of Double Jeopardy;  in view of our ruling on that claim, it may simply be that trial counsel was quite perceptive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the opinion of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Judge Skinner, of the District of Massachusetts, sat by designation, heard oral argument in this matter and thereafter recused himself.

Even assuming these documents are properly before us, defendants cannot prevail</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Government argues that defendants have waived this issue by failing to object on Confrontation Clause grounds below.

Rather than look to McClintock for guidance, therefore, we will apply the case law of this circuit, which has been informed by the later Supreme Court decisions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
