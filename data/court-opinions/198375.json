Whitney and\r\nRoach &amp; Wise were on brief for appellee Quint.\r\n\n                 March 15, 1999\r\n\nCYR, Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendant A.E. Staley\r\nManufacturing Company (\"Staley\") appeals from a district court\r\njudgment awarding Jacquelyn Quint $300,000 in damages for having\r\ndischarged her in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\r\n(ADA).  Quint in turn cross-appeals from the judgment insofar as it\r\ndisallowed all but $8,019 in back pay and rejected her request for\r\nreinstatement.\r\n                      I\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\nIn December 1991 Quint went to work at Staley's potato-\r\nstarch processing plant in Houlton, Maine, initially as a warehouse\r\nworker and later as a press operator.  In the latter position she\r\nmanually lifted objects weighing from 70 to 100 pounds (e.g., bags\r\nof starch, propane tanks), manipulated heavy machinery parts (e.g.,\r\nmetal covers), and performed a variety of repetitive manual or\r\noverhead tasks (e.g., stenciling bags, sweeping, shoveling, and\r\nadjusting spigots).  Staley's automated manipulators, designed to\r\nrelieve workers from heavy manual lifting, either functioned\r\nhaphazardly or in some instances were inoperable.  The work area\r\nwas unheated and open to the outdoors both in winter and summer.  \r\nQuint consulted Dr. Hassan Abouleish in February 1993,\r\ncomplaining of wrist pain.  Dr. Abouleish referred her to a\r\nneurologist, Dr. Jose Tungol, who performed nerve-conduction tests\r\nand diagnosed Quint with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). \r\nCTS is a condition in which the median nerves and nerve tendons\r\nwhich pass through the carpal tunnel  a narrow, finger-width\r\npassageway through the wrist bone  become compressed and\r\ninflamed, causing numbness or pain.  Commonly, CTS is caused by\r\nrepetitive, vibratory, or forceful use of the hands, or by exposure\r\nof the hands to prolonged elevation or extreme cold.  Dr. Abouleish\r\nand Dr. Tungol recommended that Quint wear supportive wrist splints\r\nat night and that she be relieved from work tasks which would\r\naggravate her condition, such as lifting objects weighing more than\r\nfive or ten pounds.\r\nOn May 21, 1993, Quint notified Staley of the medical\r\ndiagnosis and restrictions recommended by Dr. Abouleish.  Staley\r\ndirected Quint to see Dr. Richard Blum, a general practitioner whom\r\nStaley employed as its company physician.  After interviewing\r\nQuint, but without performing a physical examination, Dr. Blum\r\nrecommended a less restrictive lifting limit of from 20 to 25\r\npounds, as well as continued nighttime use of wrist splints. \r\nNotwithstanding Dr. Blum's medical advice, Staley continued to\r\nrequire Quint to perform all regular work duties during the next\r\ntwo months.    \r\nIn July 1993, Staley arranged for a neurologist and CTS\r\nspecialist, Dr. Bruce Sigsbee, to examine Quint.  Dr. Sigsbee\r\nconfirmed that Quint did indeed have work-related CTS, and\r\nrecommended that Staley reduce her repetitive work tasks and abide\r\nby a maximum ten-pound lifting restriction.  When Plant Manager\r\nKevin Baker read the Sigsbee report he became \"very upset.\"  Fearing\r\nthat Quint would spoil Staley's spotless workplace-safety record\r\nwere she to file a workers' compensation claim, Baker ordered the\r\nproduction of a videotape purportedly depicting the work tasks\r\ntypically performed by a press operator, but seriously downplaying\r\nthe physical demands of the position.  Baker then unsuccessfully\r\nlobbied Dr. Sigsbee to alter his report, and made what Dr. Sigsbee\r\ncharacterized as \"strident\" accusations that Quint was malingering. \r\nFor her part, Quint balked at Baker's suggestion that she go on\r\nsick leave.\r\nFollowing the Sigsbee report, Staley adjusted Quint's job\r\ndescription so as to require her to perform only \"lighter\" duties\r\non the processing line.  Because processing-line operators normally\r\nworked in teams of three or four, Staley ordered other members of\r\nQuint's team to take up the heavier or more repetitive tasks. \r\nWithout consulting Quint's doctors, Baker ordered her to wear her\r\nwrist splints on the job, which caused the metal brace in the\r\nsplints to bruise her wrists and ultimately to radiate pain into\r\nher elbows and shoulders.\r\nAfter Dr. Blum saw Quint again in September 1993, he\r\nannounced his intention to visit the job site to determine how best\r\nto accommodate her CTS.  Keith Saunders, Staley's operations\r\nmanager, rejected Quint's request that she be allowed to accompany\r\nDr. Blum on the job-site visit.  Around the same time, Staley's\r\ninsurer retained an ergonomist to study the press-operator position\r\nand recommend suitable accommodations.  As a consequence, Staley\r\nultimately modified some of its procedures and equipment.  For\r\nexample, it altered the design of the so-called \"cane\" used to\r\nadjust spigots, and installed electric winches to lift heavy\r\nmachinery covers.  At the same time, it decided against heating the\r\nwork area, realigning the conveyor belts or repairing the automated\r\nmanipulators.    \r\nIn October 1993, Dr. Sigsbee again examined Quint. \r\nWithout conducting new nerve-conduction tests, he opined that her\r\nCTS was \"substantially improved,\" and increased her weightlifting\r\nrestriction to thirty pounds.  Gradually, Staley began to increase\r\nQuint's job functions, reinstating her \"bagging\" duties (i.e.,\r\nlifting and handling 100-pound bags of starch).  When Quint\r\nreported increased wrist pain, Saunders told her that only Dr. Blum\r\ncould order her back to \"light\" duty.\r\nIn December 1993, Dr. Tungol performed new nerve-\r\nconduction tests and reported overall improvement in Quint's\r\ncondition, but warned that \"[a] return to this activity [i.e., her\r\nregular duties] will make her vulnerable to reoccurrence of her\r\nsymptoms.\"  At year's end, Quint informed Saunders that her wrist\r\npain had increased since November, when he had reinstituted her\r\n\"bagging\" responsibilities.\r\nIn early January 1994, Quint consulted Dr. David\r\nStarbuck, who notified Staley that Quint's CTS had flared up and\r\nthat she should not work until further notice.  At 3:15 p.m. on\r\nJanuary 7, Baker ordered Quint to travel to Dr. Blum's office  \r\nlocated some 30 miles from her home   for a 3:30 p.m. appointment. \r\nSaying that she needed \"reasonable notice,\" Quint declined to do so. \r\nUltimately, Dr. Blum concluded that Quint could continue to perform\r\nthe light-duty job, and Baker denied her request for sick leave,\r\ninstead stating that Quint could either return to work or be fired. \r\nQuint complied and returned to her light-duty job.\r\nBy February 1994, however, Staley again reinstituted her\r\n\"bagging\" duties and Quint soon complained to Baker of worsening\r\nwrist pain and numbness.  Baker nonetheless declined to consult\r\nfurther with Dr. Blum.  On February 28, Quint consulted Dr. Jean\r\nLaBelle, a hand surgeon.  After conducting tests, Dr. LaBelle\r\nreported that Quint's CTS was worsening, and recommended to Staley\r\nthat she take at least six weeks off from work.  \r\nOn Friday, March 4, after four days without any attempt\r\nto contact Quint, Baker ordered Saunders to send Quint a certified\r\nletter pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A,  207, notifying\r\nher that she must submit to a medical examination by Dr. Blum on\r\nMonday, March 7, and then report to Baker's office the following\r\nday to discuss the results of Dr. Blum's report.  Quint did not\r\nreceive the certified letter until Saturday afternoon.  Although\r\nthe letter informed Quint that she had the statutory right to\r\nrequire Staley to pay her physician to attend the Blum examination,\r\nBaker and Saunders knew before the letter was mailed that Dr.\r\nLaBelle was away on vacation and unable to attend.  In addition,\r\nthe letter failed to advise Quint that she had the right to\r\nreschedule the appointment.\r\nPlant Manager Baker conceded at trial that he had given\r\nno thought to whether the certified-letter notice was unreasonably\r\nshort and that he had simply not expected that Quint might wish to\r\nexercise her legal right to have her own doctor accompany her, even\r\nthough Baker knew from past experience that Quint mistrusted Dr.\r\nBlum.  For his part, however, Operations Manager Saunders\r\nacknowledged that the timing of the notice was unreasonable.  \r\nOn Monday, March 7, Quint called Dr. Blum's office to\r\ncancel the appointment.  The doctor's office promptly notified\r\nBaker the same day, adding that Quint had seemed \"quite upset.\" \r\nSince the certified letter had stated that the purpose of the March\r\n8 meeting at Baker's office had been to discuss the Blum medical\r\nreport, Quint did not attend.  Finally, on Wednesday, March 9,\r\nBaker fired Quint for failing to notify Staley of the reason for\r\ncanceling the Blum appointment and for failing to attend the\r\nTuesday follow-up meeting at Baker's office.\r\nIn due course Quint brought suit against Staley in\r\nfederal district court, claiming inter alia that her discharge\r\nviolated the ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq., the Family Medical\r\nLeave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C.  2611 et seq., and the Maine Human\r\nRights Act (MHRA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,  4551.  Following\r\na five-day trial, the jury found that Staley had discharged Quint\r\nbecause of her disability, and awarded her $300,000 in compensatory\r\ndamages and $420,000 in punitive damages.  The district court\r\nreduced the damages award to $300,000 pursuant to the statutory\r\ncap.  See 42 U.S.C.  1981a(b)(3).\r\nFollowing a hearing on equitable relief, the district\r\ncourt disallowed all but $8,019 of Quint's $125,580 back-pay claim,\r\nlargely because she admittedly failed to apply for other jobs after\r\nher discharge.  Thus, the court held that she had not exercised\r\nreasonable diligence to mitigate her back-pay damages.  See id. \r\n2000e-5(g)(1).  Concluding that with due diligence Quint could have\r\nobtained another job by August 1995, the court awarded $45,917 in\r\nback pay for the initial 18-month period only  dating from March\r\n1994 through August 1995  and disallowed all back pay for the\r\nperiod from August 1995 to the date of judgment ($79,663).  It then\r\nreduced the $45,917 back-pay award by $37,898, representing the\r\ntotal amount Quint had received following her discharge in the form\r\nof disability insurance, AFDC benefits and food stamps.\r\nThe district court further found that it would be\r\nimpracticable to reinstate Quint to her former job because there\r\nwere no currently available \"light-duty\" positions for which she\r\ncould qualify, and because ill feelings persisted between Quint and\r\nher former coworkers.  The court denied a front-pay award, on the\r\nground that the $308,019 awarded in damages and back pay afforded\r\nample compensation.  Finally, it awarded Quint $1,000 on her MHRA\r\nclaim.  Staley now appeals the $300,000 damages award and Quint\r\ncross-appeals from the order denying her request for full back pay\r\nand reinstatement.\r\n\n                     II\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nA.   The Staley Appeal (No. 98-1300)\r\n1.   Exhaustion of Arbitral Remedies\r\nFirst, Staley claims that the district court should have\r\ndismissed the complaint because Quint disregarded the requirement\r\nin the governing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that\r\nemployees submit all employment disputes to arbitration.  See CBA,\r\nArt. 5 &amp; 6 (June 15, 1991); Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane\r\nCorp., 500 U.S. 20, 35 (1991) (holding that employee who\r\nvoluntarily executed an employment contract containing broad\r\narbitration clause waived right to bring employment-discrimination\r\nlawsuit); supra note 2. \r\nFollowing oral argument in the case presently before us,\r\nthe United States Supreme Court definitively rejected the very\r\ncontention here advanced by Staley, thereby resolving a circuit\r\nsplit.  See Wright v. Universal Maritime Serv. Corp., 119 S. Ct.\r\n391, 397 (1998) (holding that CBA arbitration clause which did not\r\nclearly and unmistakably waive employees' rights under federal\r\nanti-discrimination statute did not waive employee's right to sue). \r\nThus, in the present case, CBA Articles 5 &amp; 6, neither of which\r\nexplicitly mentions employee rights under the ADA or any other\r\nfederal anti-discrimination statute, pose no bar to the instant\r\naction.\r\n2.    The Rule 50(b) Motion\r\nStaley contends that it was entitled to judgment as a\r\nmatter of law because Quint did not establish that bilateral CTS is\r\na cognizable \"disability\" under the ADA.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). \r\nWe review the denial of the Rule 50(b) motion de novo, viewing all\r\nevidence and resolving all credibility questions in the light most\r\nfavorable to Quint.  See Ansin v. River Oaks Furniture, Inc., 105\r\nF.3d 745, 753 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 70 (1997).  We\r\nwill not reverse unless it is determined that no rational jury\r\ncould have returned such a verdict.\r\nThe ADA prohibits employers from discriminating \"against\r\na qualified individual with a disability because of the disability\r\nof such individual.\"  42 U.S.C.  12112(a).  A \"disability\" is\r\ndefined as, inter alia, \"a physical . . . impairment that\r\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of\r\nsuch individual.\"  Id.  12102(2)(A) (emphasis added).  The EEOC\r\nregulations themselves define \"physical impairment\" as \"[a]ny\r\nphysiological disorder, or condition . . . affecting one or more of\r\nthe following body systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, [etc.].\" \r\n29 C.F.R.  1630.2(h)(1) (emphasis added).\r\nQuint's medical expert testified that she suffered, interalia, from bilateral CTS, irritated ulnar nerves, and arm/shoulder\r\nsyndrome, all of which readily qualify as \"physical impairments.\" \r\nQuint alleged that her physical impairment adversely affected three\r\nmajor life activities:  lifting, caring for herself, and working. \r\nAs we conclude that she adduced sufficient evidence that her\r\nphysical impairments substantially affected her ability to work,\r\nsee infra; 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(1) (\"Major life activities\" means\r\n\"functions such as . . . working\"), we need not consider her further\r\nclaims that lifting may constitute a distinctly cognizable \"major\r\nlife activity,\" compare Brief for Appellant at 12 n.11, with 29\r\nC.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.  1630.2(i) (expressly identifying \"lifting\"\r\nas a distinct \"major life activit[y]\"), and that she adduced\r\nsufficient evidence regarding the effect her CTS had on her\r\nnonoccupational capacities to care for herself and to lift.\r\nThe principal dispute on appeal relates to the\r\n\"substantial limitation\" element.  EEOC regulations define\r\n\"substantially limits\" as \"(i) [u]nable to perform a major life\r\nactivity that the average person in the general population can\r\nperform; or (ii) [s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition,\r\nmanner or duration under which an individual can perform a\r\nparticular major life activity as compared to the condition,\r\nmanner, or duration under which the average person in the general\r\npopulation can perform that same major life activity.\"  29 C.F.R.\r\n1630.2(j)(1).  Among the considerations pertinent to the\r\n\"substantial limitation\" element are \"(i) [t]he nature and severity\r\nof the [physical] impairment; (ii) [t]he duration or expected\r\nduration of the impairment; and (iii) [t]he permanent or long term\r\nimpact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or\r\nresulting from the impairment.\"  Id.  1630.2(j)(2).\r\nStaley insists that Quint failed to establish an existing\"substantial limitation,\" because at best her medical doctors'\r\nforecasts that she could not lift more than ten pounds were\r\nevidence of a predisposition to future serious injury.  See 29\r\nC.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.  1630.2(h) (mere \"predisposition to illness\"\r\ncannot be an ADA disability).  At bottom, then, Staley faults\r\nQuint's medical experts for failing to perform actual weightlifting\r\ntests by requiring her to lift progressively heavier objects. \r\nStaley neither cites apposite authority for its position\r\nnor to our knowledge has any court held that ADA plaintiffs mustundergo actual physical assessments of their respective capacities\r\nto engage in particular major life activities in order to establish\r\nthat their ability to do so is limited.  On the contrary, through\r\ncompetent medical testimony an ADA plaintiff may demonstrate that\r\nher own preemptive decision to limit or refrain from a major life\r\nactivity was necessary to avoid placing herself or others at\r\nimminent risk of physical injury.  See, e.g., Bragdon v. Abbott,\r\n118 S. Ct. 2196, 2206 (1998) (\"The Act addresses substantial\r\nlimitations on major life activities, not utter inabilities. \r\nConception and childbirth are not impossible for an HIV victim but,\r\nwithout doubt, are dangerous.\") (emphasis added).\r\nTellingly, Staley's own medical expert actually relied on\r\nthis predictive methodology in assessing Quint's condition. \r\nLikewise, commonsense dictates that an ADA claimant may rely on the\r\npreemptive risk assessments made by her medical experts, subject of\r\ncourse to later cross-examination regarding their methodology and\r\ntheir personal knowledge of the relevant medical history.  In that\r\nvery vein the jury found the assessments offered by Quint's expert\r\nwitnesses to be creditworthy.  See Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d\r\n437, 440-41 (1st Cir. 1998) (on Rule 50(b) motion, all credibility\r\nissues are resolved in nonmovant's favor).\r\nStaley further argues that Quint simply showed that her\r\nCTS resulted from a temporarily \"irritated\" median nerve, rather\r\nthan from permanent nerve \"damage.\"  Thus, she failed to show that\r\nher impairment entailed any \"permanent or long term impact.\"  See\r\nsupra note 5.  Once again, we cannot agree.\r\nQuint adduced competent evidence that her carpal nerve\r\nirritation was both recurrent and permanent.  Dr. LaBelle testified\r\nthat \"the moment [Quint] starts using her hands [] the [seriousness\r\nof her CTS] will rise right up immediately like that . . . . It's\r\nvery seldom that a tendinitis that occurs that flares up to a level\r\nthat she had it will ever revert back to normal.\"  Similarly, Dr.\r\nSigsbee testified that in July 1993 he concluded that Quint\r\n\"probably would not be able to perform that kind of [heavy-duty]\r\nwork ever again in the future.\"  In December 1993, Dr. Tungol\r\nlikewise warned that \"[a] return to this activity [i.e., her former\r\nduties, such as \"bagging,\"] will make [Quint] vulnerable to\r\nreoccurrence of her symptoms.\"  Moreover, no medical doctor, except\r\nnon-CTS-specialist Dr. Blum, ever cleared Quint to return to her\r\nregular duties.  Cf. Wilmarth v. City of Santa Rosa, 945 F. Supp.\r\n1271, 1276 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (finding plaintiff's CTS \"temporary,\"\r\nhence not an ADA disability, where she \"was cleared by her doctors\r\nto return to full clerical duties\"); Fink v. Kitzman, 881 F. Supp.\r\n1347, 1377 (N.D. Iowa 1995) (no ADA disability where plaintiff\r\n\"offered no evidence whatsoever as to whether her [CTS] can be\r\nexpected to improve, continue, or deteriorate\").  Thus, credited by\r\nthe jury as we must deem it to have been, see Criado, 145 F.3d at\r\n440-41, the medical evidence presented by Quint provided ample\r\nsupport for a factual finding that her impairment was not merely\r\ntransitory.  Cf. id. (rejecting defendant's contention that jury\r\nwas compelled to find that plaintiff's impairment was \"a temporary\r\nmental condition\").\r\nAn ADA claimant assumes a more fact-specific burden of\r\nproof in attempting to demonstrate that her impairment\r\n\"substantially limits\" the major life activity of \"working.\"  In the\r\ncontext of the major life activity of working, the term\r\n\"substantially limits\" means \"significantly restricted in the\r\nability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs\r\nin various classes as compared to the average person having\r\ncomparable training, skills and abilities.  The inability to\r\nperform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial\r\nlimitation in the major life activity of working.\"  29 C.F.R. \r\n1630.2(j)(3)(i) (emphasis added).  Other relevant factors include:\r\n\"(A) [t]he geographical area to which the individual has reasonable\r\naccess; (B) [t]he job from which the individual has been\r\ndisqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of\r\njobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities,\r\nwithin that geographical area, from which the individual is also\r\ndisqualified because of the impairment (class of jobs); and/or (C)\r\n[t]he job from which the individual has been disqualified because\r\nof an impairment, and the number and types of other jobs not\r\nutilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within\r\nthat geographical area, from which the individual is also\r\ndisqualified because of the impairment (broad range of jobs in\r\nvarious classes).\"  Id.  1630.2(j)(3)(ii) (emphasis added).\r\nIn regard to the geographical/job class element, Quint\r\nestablished that her CTS restrictions did more than merely\r\ndisqualify her for a particular job at Staley.  Cf., e.g., Dutcherv. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 727 (5th Cir. 1995) (no ADA\r\ndisability where arm injury prevented plaintiff from performing\r\nonly the small subset of welding assignments requiring her to\r\nclimb); Heilweil v. Mount Sinai Hosp., 32 F.3d 718, 723 (2d Cir.\r\n1994) (no ADA disability where asthma merely prevented plaintiff\r\nfrom working in hospital blood bank); Shpargel v. Stage &amp; Co., 914\r\nF. Supp. 1468, 1474 (E.D. Mich. 1996) (no ADA disability where CTS\r\nsimply prevented plaintiff from working more than eight hours a\r\nday).  The inability to lift heavy objects and perform repetitive\r\nmanual tasks can translate across a broad spectrum of physically\r\ndemanding jobs.  See, e.g., Cochrum v. Old Ben Coal Co., 102 F.3d\r\n908, 911 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"The physical restrictions Cochrum's\r\nphysician placed upon him  no overhead work, heavy lifting, or\r\npulling and pushing out from his body  might apply to a broad\r\nrange of jobs, and are more than job specific.\").  Moreover, in the\r\ngeographical area where Quint resides, physically demanding jobs\r\nare an economic mainstay.  In this vein, Quint testified without\r\ncontradiction that she had held a variety of jobs entailing manual\r\nlabor prior to her employment at Staley, ranging from potato\r\nharvesting in twelve-hour shifts, to house cleaning and house\r\npainting.\r\nMoreover, she adduced corroborative expert testimony. \r\nCf. Helfter v. UPS, Inc., 115 F.3d 613, 617-18 (8th Cir. 1997)\r\n(plaintiff with CTS adduced no evidence concerning \"various classes\r\n[of jobs] within a geographical area to which she has reasonable\r\naccess,\" other than her own conclusory statements about her job\r\nprospects); Crumpton v. St. Vincent's Hosp., 963 F. Supp. 1104,\r\n1113 (N.D. Ala. 1997) (plaintiff adduced only her conclusory\r\ndeposition testimony that she was disabled from all institutional-\r\ncooking jobs in her geographical area).  Thus, on cross-examination\r\nDr. Sigsbee acknowledged that Quint's CTS and the attendant lifting\r\nrestrictions \"probably preclude a lot of physical jobs,\" and that\r\n\"there are a lot of physical jobs in Maine.\"  Nor did Staley raise\r\ncontemporaneous objection to Dr. Sigsbee's expert qualifications\r\nregarding Maine vocations.  Furthermore, Dr. Sigsbee's\r\ndeficiencies in this subject matter area are far from self-evident,\r\nsince he had practiced in northern and southern Maine for\r\napproximately seventeen years, and his specialization in CTS\r\npresumably afforded him adequate exposure to the impact of CTS upon\r\nin-state job prospects.\r\nNor is the burden of proof incumbent upon an ADA\r\nplaintiff in relation to this element particularly formidable.  See29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.  1630.2(j) (\"The terms 'numbers and types\r\nof jobs' and 'number and types of other jobs,' as used in the\r\nfactors discussed above, are not intended to require an onerous\r\nevidentiary showing.  Rather, the terms only require the\r\npresentation of evidence of general employment demographics and/or\r\nof recognized occupational classifications that indicate the\r\napproximate number of jobs (e.g., 'few,' 'many,' 'most') from which\r\nan individual would be excluded because of an impairment.\"); supranote 4.  Since all genuine credibility issues must be resolved in\r\nplaintiff's favor, see Ansin, 105 F.3d at 753, Dr. Sigsbee's\r\ntestimony alone, which came in without objection, sufficed to\r\ngenerate a triable issue of fact.\r\nIn addition, Quint adduced competent evidence that her\r\ntraining, knowledge, skills  a high school education and a work\r\nhistory of heavy physical labor  likely would restrict her to\r\nsuch jobs, which were also the most prevalent in her geographical\r\narea.  Compare Garza v. Abbott Lab., 940 F. Supp. 1227, 1236 (N.D.\r\nIll. 1996) (plaintiff proved that her \"education, skills, and work\r\nexperience qualify her for clerical, secretarial, and retail\r\npositions,\" and that CTS disabled her from doing \"a wide variety of\r\nwork related activities,\" including typing), with McKay v. Toyota\r\nMotor Mfg., U.S.A., 110 F.3d 369, 371 (6th Cir. 1997) (finding no\r\nADA \"disability\" where CTS-afflicted plaintiff was fired from an\r\nassembly-line job, but she was a college graduate who was pursuing\r\nher teaching certificate at the time of her discharge). \r\nFinally, Staley cites several decisions purportedly\r\nholding that \"mild\" CTS cannot, as a matter of law, qualify as an\r\nADA \"disability\".  On close inspection, however, these authorities\r\nsimply hold that the respective ADA claimants had not established\r\nthat CTS substantially limited their particularized job prospects. \r\nThe ADA explicitly contemplates that the \"disability\" determination\r\nis to be made by the factfinder on an individualized, case-by-case\r\nbasis.  See 42 U.S.C.  12102(2)(A) (defining \"disability\" as \"a\r\nphysical . . . impairment that substantially limits one or more of\r\nthe major life activities of such individual\") (emphasis added).\r\nOn appeal from a judgment entered pursuant to Rule 50(b),\r\nwe do not consider which party put forth the more convincing case,\r\nbut whether the party with the burden of proof adduced enough\r\nevidence to enable a rational jury to return a verdict in her\r\nfavor.  As Quint met the required evidentiary threshold, we must\r\naffirm the liability verdict.\r\n3.   Damages\r\nStaley next contends that the compensatory and punitive\r\ndamages awards were excessive.  The jury awarded Quint $300,000 in\r\ncompensatory damages, see McKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, 83 F.3d\r\n498, 506-07 (1st Cir. 1996) (amended ADA makes emotional harm\r\ncompensable), and, based on Staley's annual net income of $65-85\r\nmillion, $420,000 in exemplary damages.  The district court reduced\r\nthe combined award to $300,000 pursuant to the statutory cap in 42\r\nU.S.C.  1981a(b)(3)(D).  Staley argues that the jury rationally\r\ncould not have awarded Quint $300,000 in compensatory damages since\r\nshe established no serious emotional injuries stemming from her\r\ndischarge.  Be that as it may, since we find the punitive damages\r\naward itself proper, and it alone exceeded the $300,000 statutory\r\ncap, there is no need to revisit the compensatory-damages issue. \r\nSee Hogan v. Bangor and Aroostook R.R. Co., 61 F.3d 1034, 1037 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).\r\nAn ADA plaintiff may recover punitive damages provided\r\nshe establishes, inter alia, that the defendant engaged in a\r\ndiscriminatory practice \"with reckless indifference to the\r\n[plaintiff's]  federally protected rights.\"  42 U.S.C. \r\n1981a(b)(1)(emphasis added).  Staley contends that the only\r\nevidence of reckless indifference was its short notification of the\r\nMarch 7, 1994 appointment with Dr. Blum and of Quint's right to\r\nrequire Staley to compensate her doctor for attending the\r\nappointment.  Staley argues that since these rights arise under\r\nMaine law, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A,  207, supra note 1,\r\nrather than the ADA, Staley's belated notification cannot as a\r\nmatter of law establish its reckless indifference to a \"federallyprotected right[].\"  We reject its claim, since the ADA accorded\r\nQuint the right to be free from discharge on account of her\r\ndisability and there was ample evidence that Staley discharged her\r\nwith reckless indifference to that \"federally protected right[]. \r\nIn July 1993, Plant Manager Baker became \"upset\" about Dr.\r\nSigsbee's diagnosis of Quint's disability and its potential adverse\r\neffect on Staley's spotless workers' compensation record.  Baker\r\n\"strident[ly]\" asserted that Quint was malingering, exerted pressure\r\non Dr. Sigsbee to alter his diagnosis, and produced a videotape\r\nwhich misleadingly understated the job-duty requirements of a\r\npress-operator.\r\nIn early January 1994, when Quint's physician recommended\r\nthat she not work at all, Baker made the decision to refer Quint to\r\nDr. Blum, who had consistently downplayed her impairment.  Yet\r\nBaker gave Quint a mere fifteen minutes' notice of the appointment\r\nand rejected her physician's recommendation that she cease work\r\nuntil further notice.\r\nMoreover, Operations Manager Saunders testified that the\r\ncertified-mail notice Baker had given Quint of the later March 7,\r\n1994 appointment with Dr. Blum, see supra Section I, was\r\nunreasonably short.  Importantly, Baker himself conceded at trial\r\nthat he had given no thought to whether the notice was reasonable,\r\nwhich itself fairly may be considered a clear acknowledgment of\r\nreckless indifference.  Baker also knew that Dr. LaBelle, Quint's\r\nphysician, could not be available on March 7 because he was away on\r\nvacation.  Nevertheless, after learning that Quint was \"upset\" and\r\nthat she had canceled the March 7 appointment, Baker reacted by\r\nterminating her employment for failing to comply with the\r\nunreasonable certified-mail notice she had been given.\r\nIn addition, contrary to Staley's contention the fact\r\nthat the March 5, 1994 notice violated Maine law in no sense\r\nprecluded a punitive damages award under the ADA.  Section\r\n1981a(b)(1) does not state \"with reckless indifference to the\r\n[plaintiff's] federally protected rights, and only those federallyprotected rights.\"  Thus, the jury rationally could conclude that\r\nBaker recklessly utilized Quint's alleged \"insubordination\" as an\r\nexcuse for discharging her by reason of her disability.\r\nFinally, Staley neither suggests another rationale which\r\nwould preclude a finding that the totality of Staley's conduct was\r\n\"outrageous,\" nor challenges the punitive damages calculation\r\nitself.  Accordingly, the $420,000 punitive damages award alone\r\nafforded ample support for the $300,000 damages award approved by\r\nthe district court.\r\nB.   The Quint Cross-Appeal (No. 98-1342)\r\n1.   The Back-Pay Award\r\na)   The Failure to Mitigate Damages\r\nQuint contends that the district court erred in reducing\r\nher back-pay claim from $125,580 to $45,917, representing 18\r\nmonths' lost wages.  The court reasoned that Quint had not\r\nattempted to mitigate damages by seeking suitable alternative\r\nemployment following her discharge.  Quint responds that Staley\r\nfailed to prove, inter alia, that there were substantially\r\nequivalent jobs available in the relevant geographic area.  We\r\nreview the back-pay award for abuse of discretion.  See Carey v.\r\nMount Desert Island Hosp., 156 F.3d 31, 40 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nA prevailing ADA claimant is presumptively entitled to\r\nall back pay which would have accrued from the termination date to\r\nthe entry of judgment, see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Halifax Local No.\r\n425, United Papermakers and Paperworkers, AFL-CIO, 422 U.S. 405,\r\n421-22 (1975); Lussier v. Runyon, 50 F.3d 1103, 1109 n.7 (1st Cir.\r\n1995), provided it is made to appear that \"reasonable diligence\r\n[was exercised in the effort to secure] other suitable employment,\"\r\nFord Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 231-32 (1982).  As long as\r\nthe claimant has made some effort to secure other employment, the\r\nburden to prove failure to mitigate normally resides with the\r\ndefendant-employer, see Carey, 156 F.3d at 41; Odima v. Westin\r\nTucson Hotel, 53 F.3d 1484, 1497 (9th Cir. 1995), which then must\r\nshow that (i) though substantially equivalent jobs were available\r\nin the relevant geographic area, (ii) the claimant failed to use\r\nreasonable diligence to secure suitable employment.  See id.\r\nStaley did not attempt to prove that substantially\r\nequivalent jobs existed during the relevant time period, nor did\r\nQuint attempt to obtain a job during the forty-plus months\r\nfollowing her discharge.  In the relatively rare case where an\r\nemployee has remained completely idle following her discharge, some\r\ncourts of appeals have required that the defendant-employer\r\nnonetheless demonstrate the same two elements: (1) the availability\r\nof substantially equivalent jobs and (2) the absence of reasonable\r\ndiligence by the former employee.  See, e.g., Booker v. Taylor Milk\r\nCo., 64 F.3d 860, 866 (3d Cir. 1995); Odima, 53 F.3d at 1497;\r\nHutchison v. Amateur Elec. Supply, Inc., 42 F.3d 1037, 1044 (7th\r\nCir. 1994); accord Rasimas v. Michigan Dep't of Mental Health, 714\r\nF.2d 614, 624 (6th Cir. 1983).  Yet, in none of these cases did the\r\nemployer squarely urge the court to adopt the exception advocated\r\nby Staley; namely, that once an employer has shown that the\r\nclaimant sought no jobs, it should be relieved of any burden to\r\nprove the existence of substantially equivalent positions.\r\nOther courts of appeals, squarely confronted with the\r\npresent contention, uniformly have relieved the defendant-employer\r\nof the burden to prove the availability of substantially equivalent\r\njobs in the relevant geographic area once it has been shown that\r\nthe former employee made no effort to secure suitable employment. \r\nSee, e.g., Greenway v. Buffalo Hilton Hotel, 143 F.3d 47, 54 (2d\r\nCir. 1998); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1527\r\n(11th Cir. 1991); Sellers v. Delgado College, 902 F.2d 1189, 1193\r\n(5th Cir. 1990).  We likewise opt for the mitigation-defense\r\nexception adopted in these cases.\r\nWhere an ADA claimant refrains from pursuing alternative\r\nemployment, we consider it reasonable to presume at the outset that\r\nshe did so for an articulable reason, perhaps because she possessed\r\ninformation which suggested that a job search would have been\r\nfutile.  Since it is the claimant who would possess any such\r\ninformation, however, she is likely to be in the better position to\r\nexplain her preemptive decision to take no action to obtain\r\nemployment.  We believe it will be the extraordinary case in which\r\nan ADA claimant's decision to withdraw from the job market can be\r\nfound to have been justifiable, given that virtually all\r\nreemployment prospects are plainly precluded absent some effort to\r\nreenter the job market.  Thus, we believe the mitigation policy\r\nfostered by the ADA will be better served by the approach we adopt\r\ntoday, since it affords reasonable inducements for ADA claimants to\r\nattempt to secure alternative employment.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court correctly ruled that Quint's utter failure to\r\nmitigate warranted the $79,663 reduction in the back-pay award.\r\nb)   Collateral-Source Benefits\r\nQuint next contends that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in reducing her back-pay award by the aggregate amount\r\nof the disability insurance proceeds and the AFDC and food-stamp\r\nbenefits received following her termination.  We agree.\r\nUnder the Maine Human Rights Act the court would lack\r\ndiscretion to deduct from a back-pay award any post-termination\r\ncollateral-source payments received by the discharged employee. \r\nSee Maine Human Rights Comm'n v. Department of Corrections, 474\r\nA.2d 860, 869-70 (Me. 1984) (\"MHRC\").  Consequently, even if the\r\ndistrict court could reduce the ADA back-pay award by the amount of\r\nthe collateral benefits Quint received, it could not reduce the\r\nMHRA back-pay award to which the jury verdict simultaneously\r\nentitled her.\r\nStaley argues that MHRC is inapposite, for two reasons. \r\nFirst, it notes that MHRC is predicated on equitable principles and\r\nthat the plaintiff in MHRC \"rightfully\" received unemployment\r\nbenefits whereas Quint \"manipulated\" the welfare system.  Even\r\nassuming these characterizations of the respective claimant's\r\nconduct were meritorious, however, MHRC makes very clear that the\r\ncollateral-source rule permits no judicial discretion.  See MHRC,\r\n474 A.2d at 870 (\"'[A] consistent approach to this legal question\r\nseems preferable to a virtually unreviewable discretion which may\r\nproduce arbitrary and inconsistent results.'\") (citation omitted).\r\nSecond, Staley argues that incorporation of the\r\ncollateral-source rule into the MHRA discrimination case law by the\r\nMaine Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") in MHRC is called into question\r\nby Winston v. Maine Technical College Sys., 631 A.2d 70, 74 (Me.\r\n1993), where the SJC noted that the MHRA \"generally tracks federal\r\nanti-discrimination statutes, [so] it is appropriate to look to\r\nfederal precedent for guidance in interpreting the MHRA.\"  Once\r\nagain, however, assuming the quoted statement is correct as a\r\ngeneral principle, it avails Staley nothing.\r\nThe generalization to which Staley alludes in Winstondoes not permit a federal court to presume that all prior SJC\r\ndecisions which announced MHRA standards in conflict with emerging\r\nfederal standards were thereby overruled.  Absent conspicuous\r\nevidence that a state's highest court has abandoned a previously-\r\nannounced rule, it is not for the federal courts to presume as\r\nmuch.  See Carlton v. Worcester Ins. Co., 923 F.2d 1, 3 n.5 (1st\r\nCir. 1991) (\"While it is not necessary that a state case be\r\nexplicitly overruled by the state court in order to lose its\r\npersuasive force, there must at least be footprints pointing\r\nconspicuously in that direction.\") (citation omitted); Caraccioliv. KFC Mfg. Corp., 761 F. Supp. 119, 120 (M.D. Fla. 1991) (\"Unlike\r\na state court, the federal courts, in diversity cases, 'are not free\r\nto overrule existing state precedent or chart the future course of\r\nstate law in such manner as we may see fit.'\") (citation omitted). \r\nMoreover, MHRC could not have been more emphatic.  After\r\nsurveying the divergent collateral-source rules in other\r\njurisdictions, and addressing the difficult policy choices\r\npresented, the SJC definitively and categorically opted for a clear\r\nrule excluding collateral-source payments from the back-pay\r\nequation.  MHRC, 474 A.2d at 870 (\"If either the victim of the\r\ndiscrimination or the discriminating employer is going to receive\r\na windfall because part of the victim's loss has been paid for by\r\na third party, it is more just that the windfall should inure to\r\nthe injured party than to the wrongdoer.\"); see Pine v. Cole's\r\nExpress, Inc., 523 A.2d 1001, 1002 (Me. 1987) (expressly refusing\r\nto reexamine MHRC collateral-source rule).\r\nMoreover, even if Winston were deemed adequate license\r\nfor us to forecast what the SJC might do upon revisiting MHRC, the\r\nprinciple enunciated in Winston would provide useful guidance only\r\nif a consensus existed on the collateral-source issue among the\r\nfederal courts.  Yet the courts of appeals are in disagreement\r\nregarding the collateral-source issue as it relates to\r\ndiscrimination claims under federal law, and the United States\r\nSupreme Court has yet to address the issue.  Thus, there is no\r\n\"federal precedent\" consensus upon which the SJC might \"piggy-back\"\r\nits state rule.\r\nAccordingly, Quint is entitled to an MHRA back-pay award\r\nfree of reductions attributable to collateral-source payments. \r\nThus, the final back-pay award must be increased from $8,019 to\r\n$45,917.\r\n2.   Reinstatement\r\nThe district court ruled that reinstatement would be\r\nimpracticable because there were no available \"light-duty\" jobs\r\nQuint could perform, and the \"tensions\" between Quint and her former\r\ncoworkers would create an intolerable work environment.  We review\r\nits decision only for abuse of discretion, Kelley v. Airborne\r\nFreight Corp., 140 F.3d 335, 353 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S.\r\nCt. 341 (1998), and will reverse only for \"'a meaningful error in\r\njudgment,'\" Lussier, 50 F.3d at 1111 &amp; n.9 (citation omitted). \r\nAlthough the district court has considerable equitable discretion\r\nto deny reinstatement, the two grounds it ultimately relied upon\r\nafford an insufficient basis for affirming its ruling. \r\nAccordingly, we must remand for further proceedings.  See, e.g.,\r\nid. at 1115.\r\nStaley points to evidence that no \"light-duty\" jobs are\r\ncurrently available, and argues that the ADA does not require that\r\na \"new\" job be created for Quint.  See Shea v. Tisch, 870 F.2d 786,\r\n788-90 (1st Cir. 1989).  Be that as it may, Staley has yet to\r\nconfront the appropriate inquiry:  whether it can and should\r\nreinstate Quint to her former position as a press operator. \r\nAlthough the district court possesses the requisite\r\ndiscretion to refuse reinstatement if an ADA claimant's former\r\nposition no longer exists, see, e.g., Ray v. Iuka Special Mun.\r\nSeparate Sch. Dist., 51 F.3d 1246, 1254 (5th Cir. 1995); Cassino v.\r\nReichhold Chems., Inc., 817 F.2d 1338, 1346 (9th Cir. 1987); Eldredv. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Del., 907 F. Supp. 26, 28 (D.\r\nMass. 1995), we can discern no record evidence that there are no\r\npress-operator positions for which Quint could qualify.  Staley\r\noffered Operations Manager Saunders as its sole witness at the\r\nequitable-remedy hearing.  Saunders testified that no \"light-duty\"\r\npositions currently existed at Staley.  According to Saunders, a\r\n\"light-duty\" position meant one which was \"not makeshift\" and which\r\nthe employee could \"do within [her] physical restrictions.\"  Asked\r\nto define what physical restrictions were accommodated within the\r\nterm \"light-duty,\" Saunders testified: \"I'm saying just about   it\r\nwould depend on the restrictions the individual has.\"  Although he\r\nstated that he did not know Quint's current restrictions, he\r\ntestified that no available jobs could accommodate a ten-pound\r\nweightlifting restriction.\r\nMoreover, according to Saunders a post-March 1994\r\nreduction-in-force further frustrated any such accommodation\r\nbecause employees thereafter \"worked harder and did more work.\" \r\nFurthermore, two or three people had left the process department in\r\nthe past year, either on disability or retirement, and Staley had\r\nhired two temporary part-time replacements.  Saunders declined to\r\nclassify the lighter-duty position Quint held prior to her 1994\r\ndischarge as a \"light-duty\" position, because Staley had intended\r\nthose accommodations to be temporary only, not permanent.  Thus, he\r\nsaid, a permanent accommodation for Quint's disability was simply\r\n\"impossible.\"  The conclusory and unelaborated testimony by Saunders\r\nprovided inadequate support for denying reinstatement.\r\nIn the first place, reinstatement is the \"overarching\r\npreference\" among all equitable remedies under the ADA, as it most\r\nefficiently furthers \"the dual goals of providing full coverage for\r\nthe plaintiff and of deterring such conduct by employers in the\r\nfuture.\"  Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 104 F.3d 9, 12\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  Secondly, the unmistakable import of the Saunders\r\ntestimony is that Staley did have currently available press-\r\noperator positions, but that it chose not to reinstate even the\r\nreasonable accommodations afforded Quint in 1993-94.\r\nThus, Quint testified:  \"If they would let [her] do the\r\nlighter-duty position . . . [she held previously],\" she would have\r\nbeen \"physically . . . able to work at Staley.\"  Moreover, Saunders\r\nagreed that Staley \"believed [Quint] could do the job\" at the time\r\nshe was fired, and that \"the company thought that her inability to\r\nlift was something you could work around with respect to that\r\nparticular job.\"  Based on this evidence, the jury reasonably found\r\nthat Quint was \"qualified\"; that is, capable of performing the\r\n\"essential functions\" of the press-operator position with or without\r\nreasonable accommodation.  See supra note 3.\r\nIn determining appropriate equitable relief, the district\r\ncourt was strictly constrained by these jury findings.  See, e.g.,\r\nUnited States EEOC v. Century Broad. Corp., 957 F.2d 1446, 1463\r\n(7th Cir. 1992); Song v. Ives Lab., Inc., 957 F.2d 1041, 1048 (2d\r\nCir. 1992); Harvis v. Roadway Express, Inc., 923 F.2d 59, 61 (6th\r\nCir. 1991).  Thus, were it to appear that a press-operator position\r\nis available at Staley, the district court would be required to\r\nassume that Quint could perform it, with reasonable accommodation.\r\nSaunders suggested that Quint would not be returned to\r\nthe \"same\" press-operator position because an alleged post-March\r\n1994 \"reduction in force\" had required employees to \"work[] harder.\" \r\nAbsent some further evidentiary development, however, there is no\r\nreliable way to determine the degree, if any, to which the alleged\r\nreduction-in-force may have altered press-operator responsibilities\r\nso as to aggravate Quint's CTS.  Furthermore, even if it were to be\r\nassumed that the alleged reduction-in-force resulted in increased\r\npress-operator duties, the question would remain whether Staley\r\nreasonably could have accommodated Quint's disability within the\r\nmodified press-operator position.  After all, the jury found\r\nnothing more than that, as of the date Quint was discharged, Staley\r\nhad not failed to make reasonable accommodations for her\r\ndisability.  Because the jury was never instructed that Staley\r\ncould meet its ADA obligation merely by making a temporaryaccommodation, this finding may simply reflect the jury's\r\nrecognition that the parties were engaged in ongoing negotiation\r\nand consultation over what measures would achieve an appropriate\r\naccommodation.\r\nMoreover, since Staley illegally discharged Quint in\r\nMarch 1994 it was not necessary for the jury to determine what\r\nfurther accommodations Staley would have been obligated to make as\r\nfuture conditions might warrant.  For example, Saunders conceded\r\nthat \"several employees at Staley other than [plaintiff] have been\r\ngiven permanent light-duty jobs,\" some when they \"got hurt.\" At\r\ntrial, Baker acknowledged that the quest for reasonable\r\naccommodation was an ongoing, wait-and-see process. See Criado, 145\r\nF.3d at 445 (\"The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is a\r\ncontinuing one, however, and not exhausted by one effort.\")\r\n(quoting Ralph v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 135 F.3d 166, 172 (1st Cir.\r\n1998)); 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(o)(3) (\"[I]t may be necessary for the\r\ncovered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process\" with\r\nthe disabled employee.). \r\nSignificantly, Saunders acknowledged that Staley nevercontended that its accommodation of Quint's disability would cause\r\nit \"undue [financial] hardship.\" See 42 U.S.C.  12112(b)(5)(A)\r\n(employer must make reasonable accommodation \"unless [it] can\r\ndemonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship\r\non the operation of the business of such covered entity\"). \r\nMoreover, the trial record amply documented other possible\r\naccommodations as well.\r\nThe ergonomist hired by Staley's insurer made several\r\nrecommendations which Staley elected not to adopt, including one\r\nwhich would have excused Quint from overtime work.  See id. \r\n12111(9)(B) (reasonable accommodation may include \"modified work\r\nschedules\").  In addition, Staley could have elected to heat the\r\nwarehouse and/or the processing areas and to repair the air system\r\nwhich powered the automatic manipulators' suction devices.  The\r\nlatter accommodation would have relieved press operators from\r\nlifting heavy bags by hand.  Finally, since process operators work\r\nin teams, with each person performing discrete assembly-line\r\nfunctions, Staley might have assigned Quint permanently to a team\r\nposition which minimized stress on her wrists, arms and shoulders. \r\nThus, to deny reinstatement on the present record would reward\r\nStaley for terminating prematurely the required effort to reach a\r\nreasonable accommodation.\r\nWere it made to appear on remand that a press-operator\r\nposition is available, Quint presumably would be entitled to\r\nreinstatement by virtue of the jury verdict in this case, at leaston the same terms allowed by Staley prior to March 1994.  Should\r\nadditional accommodations be required, Staley would need to\r\ndetermine in the first instance whether any such accommodations are\r\n\"reasonable\" under the ADA.  Of course, should it refuse further\r\nreasonable accommodation as appropriate, it would expose itself\r\nonce again to ADA liability.\r\nThe district court finding that \"tensions\" continued\r\nbetween Quint and her former coworkers presents a different\r\nproblem.  Although Staley's brief below represented that coworker\r\ntensions existed, statements by counsel are not competent evidence. \r\nSee Fernandez v. Chardon, 681 F.2d 42, 56 n.10 (1st Cir. 1982)\r\n(statements by counsel are no substitute for admissible evidence),\r\naff'd, 462 U.S. 650 (1983).  The record on appeal is devoid of any\r\ntestimony or other evidence from any current Staley employee that\r\nworking with Quint would be intolerable.  See Lussier, 50 F.3d at\r\n1113 (vacating front-pay award and noting that \"[i]t is a\r\nfundamental principle of our jurisprudence that a factfinder may\r\nnot consider extra-record evidence concerning disputed adjudicative\r\nfacts\").  Thus, the only suggestion of coworker tensions in the\r\nappellate record consists of conclusory assertions by Staley's\r\ncounsel.\r\nThese assertions are infirm for other reasons as well. \r\nFirst, the only clear-cut evidence at trial showed no antagonism\r\namong Quint's coworkers in 1993-94.  When asked:  \"Do you remember\r\nthat a lot of coworkers complained about the accommodations being\r\nmade for Jackie Quint?,\" coworker Arnold Gonya answered:  \"No, I\r\ndon't.\"  On the other hand, Baker testified in vague and tentative\r\nterms: \"I believe there had been some friction with some of the\r\nworkers around how much [Quint] was doing . . . some feelings of\r\ninequities perhaps by her coworkers.\" (Emphasis added.)  Baker\r\nneither related any specific coworker complaint nor identified a\r\nparticular complainant.  Saunders testified to having heard ofcomplaints, but when asked to confirm complaints by any particular\r\nemployee, stated:  \"I can't remember for sure.\"\r\nMoreover, given the four-year lifespan of the present\r\nlitigation, it is not even clear that any former coworker is still\r\nemployed at Staley.  Nor can we presume, as Staley does without a\r\nshred of evidence, that Quint's forty or more coworkers must be\r\nintolerably envious because she won $300,000 in damages, while they\r\nare considerably less well off.  The factual assumptions underlying\r\nthis presumption (e.g., coworkers' empathy for management rather\r\nthan their coworker) amount to little more than rank speculation.\r\nFinally, we state the obvious.  While it may be that\r\nStaley's unsubstantiated reference to \"coworker tensions\" cloaks\r\nStaley management's antagonism toward Quint, rarely could an ADA\r\nclaimant be reinstated were any such employer antagonism considered\r\nan adequate ground for denying reinstatement, see Century Broad.,\r\n957 F.2d at 1462, and the legislative aims of the ADA surely would\r\nbe ill served.\r\nWe do not state that coworker hostility, adequately\r\nproven real and intolerable, may not provide an appropriate ground\r\nfor refusing reinstatement.  See, e.g., Deloach v. Delchamps, Inc.,\r\n897 F.2d 815, 822 (5th Cir. 1990) (determining reinstatement\r\nimpracticable where it would cause morale problems and disrupt\r\nother individuals' employment).  Given the current record and the\r\nprominence of the reinstatement remedy under the ADA scheme,\r\nhowever, adequate review of the district court's denial of\r\nreinstatement is impracticable.\r\n                     III\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we remand to the district court for such\r\nfurther proceedings as it deems necessary and appropriate to inform\r\nthe further exercise of its discretion relating to reinstatement. \r\nSee Lussier, 50 F.3d at 1115 (vacating front-pay award due to\r\ncourt's reliance on extra-record evidence, and noting that court on\r\nremand may opt between another evidentiary hearing or \"hold[ing]\r\nthe parties to their proof at trial [and] . . . the existing\r\nrecord\"); see also Kerr-Selgas, 104 F.3d at 15 (vacating\r\nreinstatement ruling on same grounds).  Should a further\r\nevidentiary hearing appear appropriate, the parties should adduce\r\nspecific evidence relating to the availability of current press-\r\noperator positions at Staley, and any current coworker hostility\r\ntoward Quint which might make reinstatement impracticable.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the $300,000 damages award is\r\naffirmed; the back-pay award is increased from $8,019 to $45,917;\r\nthe district court ruling denying reinstatement is vacated and the\r\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith. \r\nCosts to appellant.\r\nSO ORDERED.\n",

Staley\r\nManufacturing Company (\"Staley\") appeals from a district court\r\njudgment awarding Jacquelyn Quint $300,000 in damages for having\r\ndischarged her in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\r\n(ADA).  Quint in turn cross-appeals from the judgment insofar as it\r\ndisallowed all but $8,019 in back pay and rejected her request for\r\nreinstatement.\r\n                      I\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\nIn December 1991 Quint went to work at Staley's potato-\r\nstarch processing plant in Houlton, Maine, initially as a warehouse\r\nworker and later as a press operator.  In the latter position she\r\nmanually lifted objects weighing from 70 to 100 pounds (e.g., bags\r\nof starch, propane tanks), manipulated heavy machinery parts (e.g.,\r\nmetal covers), and performed a variety of repetitive manual or\r\noverhead tasks (e.g., stenciling bags, sweeping, shoveling, and\r\nadjusting spigots).  Staley's automated manipulators, designed to\r\nrelieve workers from heavy manual lifting, either functioned\r\nhaphazardly or in some instances were inoperable.  The work area\r\nwas unheated and open to the outdoors both in winter and summer.  \r\nQuint consulted Dr. Hassan Abouleish in February 1993,\r\ncomplaining of wrist pain.  Dr. Abouleish referred her to a\r\nneurologist, Dr. Jose Tungol, who performed nerve-conduction tests\r\nand diagnosed Quint with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). \r\nCTS is a condition in which the median nerves and nerve tendons\r\nwhich pass through the carpal tunnel  a narrow, finger-width\r\npassageway through the wrist bone  become compressed and\r\ninflamed, causing numbness or pain.  Commonly, CTS is caused by\r\nrepetitive, vibratory, or forceful use of the hands, or by exposure\r\nof the hands to prolonged elevation or extreme cold.  Dr. Abouleish\r\nand Dr. Tungol recommended that Quint wear supportive wrist splints\r\nat night and that she be relieved from work tasks which would\r\naggravate her condition, such as lifting objects weighing more than\r\nfive or ten pounds.\r\nOn May 21, 1993, Quint notified Staley of the medical\r\ndiagnosis and restrictions recommended by Dr. Abouleish.  Staley\r\ndirected Quint to see Dr. Richard Blum, a general practitioner whom\r\nStaley employed as its company physician.  After interviewing\r\nQuint, but without performing a physical examination, Dr. Blum\r\nrecommended a less restrictive lifting limit of from 20 to 25\r\npounds, as well as continued nighttime use of wrist splints. \r\nNotwithstanding Dr. Blum's medical advice, Staley continued to\r\nrequire Quint to perform all regular work duties during the next\r\ntwo months.    \r\nIn July 1993, Staley arranged for a neurologist and CTS\r\nspecialist, Dr. Bruce Sigsbee, to examine Quint.  Dr. Sigsbee\r\nconfirmed that Quint did indeed have work-related CTS, and\r\nrecommended that Staley reduce her repetitive work tasks and abide\r\nby a maximum ten-pound lifting restriction.  When Plant Manager\r\nKevin Baker read the Sigsbee report he became \"very upset.\"  Fearing\r\nthat Quint would spoil Staley's spotless workplace-safety record\r\nwere she to file a workers' compensation claim, Baker ordered the\r\nproduction of a videotape purportedly depicting the work tasks\r\ntypically performed by a press operator, but seriously downplaying\r\nthe physical demands of the position.  Baker then unsuccessfully\r\nlobbied Dr. Sigsbee to alter his report, and made what Dr. Sigsbee\r\ncharacterized as \"strident\" accusations that Quint was malingering. \r\nFor her part, Quint balked at Baker's suggestion that she go on\r\nsick leave.\r\nFollowing the Sigsbee report, Staley adjusted Quint's job\r\ndescription so as to require her to perform only \"lighter\" duties\r\non the processing line.  Because processing-line operators normally\r\nworked in teams of three or four, Staley ordered other members of\r\nQuint's team to take up the heavier or more repetitive tasks. \r\nWithout consulting Quint's doctors, Baker ordered her to wear her\r\nwrist splints on the job, which caused the metal brace in the\r\nsplints to bruise her wrists and ultimately to radiate pain into\r\nher elbows and shoulders.\r\nAfter Dr. Blum saw Quint again in September 1993, he\r\nannounced his intention to visit the job site to determine how best\r\nto accommodate her CTS.  Keith Saunders, Staley's operations\r\nmanager, rejected Quint's request that she be allowed to accompany\r\nDr. Blum on the job-site visit.  Around the same time, Staley's\r\ninsurer retained an ergonomist to study the press-operator position\r\nand recommend suitable accommodations.  As a consequence, Staley\r\nultimately modified some of its procedures and equipment.  For\r\nexample, it altered the design of the so-called \"cane\" used to\r\nadjust spigots, and installed electric winches to lift heavy\r\nmachinery covers.  At the same time, it decided against heating the\r\nwork area, realigning the conveyor belts or repairing the automated\r\nmanipulators.    \r\nIn October 1993, Dr. Sigsbee again examined Quint. \r\nWithout conducting new nerve-conduction tests, he opined that her\r\nCTS was \"substantially improved,\" and increased her weightlifting\r\nrestriction to thirty pounds.  Gradually, Staley began to increase\r\nQuint's job functions, reinstating her \"bagging\" duties (i.e.,\r\nlifting and handling 100-pound bags of starch).  When Quint\r\nreported increased wrist pain, Saunders told her that only Dr. Blum\r\ncould order her back to \"light\" duty.\r\nIn December 1993, Dr. Tungol performed new nerve-\r\nconduction tests and reported overall improvement in Quint's\r\ncondition, but warned that \"[a] return to this activity [i.e., her\r\nregular duties] will make her vulnerable to reoccurrence of her\r\nsymptoms.\"  At year's end, Quint informed Saunders that her wrist\r\npain had increased since November, when he had reinstituted her\r\n\"bagging\" responsibilities.\r\nIn early January 1994, Quint consulted Dr. David\r\nStarbuck, who notified Staley that Quint's CTS had flared up and\r\nthat she should not work until further notice.  At 3:15 p.m. on\r\nJanuary 7, Baker ordered Quint to travel to Dr. Blum's office  \r\nlocated some 30 miles from her home   for a 3:30 p.m. appointment. \r\nSaying that she needed \"reasonable notice,\" Quint declined to do so. \r\nUltimately, Dr. Blum concluded that Quint could continue to perform\r\nthe light-duty job, and Baker denied her request for sick leave,\r\ninstead stating that Quint could either return to work or be fired. \r\nQuint complied and returned to her light-duty job.\r\nBy February 1994, however, Staley again reinstituted her\r\n\"bagging\" duties and Quint soon complained to Baker of worsening\r\nwrist pain and numbness.  Baker nonetheless declined to consult\r\nfurther with Dr. Blum.  On February 28, Quint consulted Dr. Jean\r\nLaBelle, a hand surgeon.  After conducting tests, Dr. LaBelle\r\nreported that Quint's CTS was worsening, and recommended to Staley\r\nthat she take at least six weeks off from work.  \r\nOn Friday, March 4, after four days without any attempt\r\nto contact Quint, Baker ordered Saunders to send Quint a certified\r\nletter pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A,  207, notifying\r\nher that she must submit to a medical examination by Dr. Blum on\r\nMonday, March 7, and then report to Baker's office the following\r\nday to discuss the results of Dr. Blum's report.  Quint did not\r\nreceive the certified letter until Saturday afternoon.  Although\r\nthe letter informed Quint that she had the statutory right to\r\nrequire Staley to pay her physician to attend the Blum examination,\r\nBaker and Saunders knew before the letter was mailed that Dr.\r\nLaBelle was away on vacation and unable to attend.  In addition,\r\nthe letter failed to advise Quint that she had the right to\r\nreschedule the appointment.\r\nPlant Manager Baker conceded at trial that he had given\r\nno thought to whether the certified-letter notice was unreasonably\r\nshort and that he had simply not expected that Quint might wish to\r\nexercise her legal right to have her own doctor accompany her, even\r\nthough Baker knew from past experience that Quint mistrusted Dr.\r\nBlum.  For his part, however, Operations Manager Saunders\r\nacknowledged that the timing of the notice was unreasonable.  \r\nOn Monday, March 7, Quint called Dr. Blum's office to\r\ncancel the appointment.  The doctor's office promptly notified\r\nBaker the same day, adding that Quint had seemed \"quite upset.\" \r\nSince the certified letter had stated that the purpose of the March\r\n8 meeting at Baker's office had been to discuss the Blum medical\r\nreport, Quint did not attend.  Finally, on Wednesday, March 9,\r\nBaker fired Quint for failing to notify Staley of the reason for\r\ncanceling the Blum appointment and for failing to attend the\r\nTuesday follow-up meeting at Baker's office.\r\nIn due course Quint brought suit against Staley in\r\nfederal district court, claiming inter alia that her discharge\r\nviolated the ADA, 42 U.S.C.  12101 et seq., the Family Medical\r\nLeave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C.  2611 et seq., and the Maine Human\r\nRights Act (MHRA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5,  4551.  Following\r\na five-day trial, the jury found that Staley had discharged Quint\r\nbecause of her disability, and awarded her $300,000 in compensatory\r\ndamages and $420,000 in punitive damages.  The district court\r\nreduced the damages award to $300,000 pursuant to the statutory\r\ncap.  See 42 U.S.C.  1981a(b)(3).\r\nFollowing a hearing on equitable relief, the district\r\ncourt disallowed all but $8,019 of Quint's $125,580 back-pay claim,\r\nlargely because she admittedly failed to apply for other jobs after\r\nher discharge.  Thus, the court held that she had not exercised\r\nreasonable diligence to mitigate her back-pay damages.  See id. \r\n2000e-5(g)(1).  Concluding that with due diligence Quint could have\r\nobtained another job by August 1995, the court awarded $45,917 in\r\nback pay for the initial 18-month period only  dating from March\r\n1994 through August 1995  and disallowed all back pay for the\r\nperiod from August 1995 to the date of judgment ($79,663).  It then\r\nreduced the $45,917 back-pay award by $37,898, representing the\r\ntotal amount Quint had received following her discharge in the form\r\nof disability insurance, AFDC benefits and food stamps.\r\nThe district court further found that it would be\r\nimpracticable to reinstate Quint to her former job because there\r\nwere no currently available \"light-duty\" positions for which she\r\ncould qualify, and because ill feelings persisted between Quint and\r\nher former coworkers.  The court denied a front-pay award, on the\r\nground that the $308,019 awarded in damages and back pay afforded\r\nample compensation.  Finally, it awarded Quint $1,000 on her MHRA\r\nclaim.  Staley now appeals the $300,000 damages award and Quint\r\ncross-appeals from the order denying her request for full back pay\r\nand reinstatement.\r\n\n                     II\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nA.   The Staley Appeal (No. 98-1300)\r\n1.   Exhaustion of Arbitral Remedies\r\nFirst, Staley claims that the district court should have\r\ndismissed the complaint because Quint disregarded the requirement\r\nin the governing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that\r\nemployees submit all employment disputes to arbitration.  See CBA,\r\nArt. 5 &amp; 6 (June 15, 1991); Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane\r\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1991) (holding that employee who\r\nvoluntarily executed an employment contract containing broad\r\narbitration clause waived right to bring employment-discrimination\r\nlawsuit); supra note 2. \r\nFollowing oral argument in the case presently before us,\r\nthe United States Supreme Court definitively rejected the very\r\ncontention here advanced by Staley, thereby resolving a circuit\r\nsplit.  See Wright v. Universal Maritime Serv. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">391</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 397 (1998) (holding that CBA arbitration clause which did not\r\nclearly and unmistakably waive employees' rights under federal\r\nanti-discrimination statute did not waive employee's right to sue). \r\nThus, in the present case, CBA Articles 5 &amp; 6, neither of which\r\nexplicitly mentions employee rights under the ADA or any other\r\nfederal anti-discrimination statute, pose no bar to the instant\r\naction.\r\n2.    The Rule 50(b) Motion\r\nStaley contends that it was entitled to judgment as a\r\nmatter of law because Quint did not establish that bilateral CTS is\r\na cognizable \"disability\" under the ADA.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). \r\nWe review the denial of the Rule 50(b) motion de novo, viewing all\r\nevidence and resolving all credibility questions in the light most\r\nfavorable to Quint.  See Ansin v. River Oaks Furniture, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197195\"><a href=\"/opinion/197195/ansin-v-river-oaks-furniture/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 753 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997).  We\r\nwill not reverse unless it is determined that no rational jury\r\ncould have returned such a verdict.\r\nThe ADA prohibits employers from discriminating \"against\r\na qualified individual with a disability because of the disability\r\nof such individual.\"  42 U.S.C.  12112(a).  A \"disability\" is\r\ndefined as, inter alia, \"a physical . . . impairment that\r\nsubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of\r\nsuch individual.\"  Id.  12102(2)(A) (emphasis added).  The EEOC\r\nregulations themselves define \"physical impairment\" as \"[a]ny\r\nphysiological disorder, or condition . . . affecting one or more of\r\nthe following body systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, [etc.].\" \r\n29 C.F.R.  1630.2(h)(1) (emphasis added).\r\nQuint's medical expert testified that she suffered, interalia, from bilateral CTS, irritated ulnar nerves, and arm/shoulder\r\nsyndrome, all of which readily qualify as \"physical impairments.\" \r\nQuint alleged that her physical impairment adversely affected three\r\nmajor life activities:  lifting, caring for herself, and working. \r\nAs we conclude that she adduced sufficient evidence that her\r\nphysical impairments substantially affected her ability to work,\r\nsee infra; 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(1) (\"Major life activities\" means\r\n\"functions such as . . . working\"), we need not consider her further\r\nclaims that lifting may constitute a distinctly cognizable \"major\r\nlife activity,\" compare Brief for Appellant at 12 n.11, with 29\r\nC.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.  1630.2(i) (expressly identifying \"lifting\"\r\nas a distinct \"major life activit[y]\"), and that she adduced\r\nsufficient evidence regarding the effect her CTS had on her\r\nnonoccupational capacities to care for herself and to lift.\r\nThe principal dispute on appeal relates to the\r\n\"substantial limitation\" element.  EEOC regulations define\r\n\"substantially limits\" as \"(i) [u]nable to perform a major life\r\nactivity that the average person in the general population can\r\nperform; or (ii) [s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition,\r\nmanner or duration under which an individual can perform a\r\nparticular major life activity as compared to the condition,\r\nmanner, or duration under which the average person in the general\r\npopulation can perform that same major life activity.\"  29 C.F.R.\r\n1630.2(j)(1).  Among the considerations pertinent to the\r\n\"substantial limitation\" element are \"(i) [t]he nature and severity\r\nof the [physical] impairment; (ii) [t]he duration or expected\r\nduration of the impairment; and (iii) [t]he permanent or long term\r\nimpact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or\r\nresulting from the impairment.\"  Id.  1630.2(j)(2).\r\nStaley insists that Quint failed to establish an existing\"substantial limitation,\" because at best her medical doctors'\r\nforecasts that she could not lift more than ten pounds were\r\nevidence of a predisposition to future serious injury.  See 29\r\nC.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.  1630.2(h) (mere \"predisposition to illness\"\r\ncannot be an ADA disability).  At bottom, then, Staley faults\r\nQuint's medical experts for failing to perform actual weightlifting\r\ntests by requiring her to lift progressively heavier objects. \r\nStaley neither cites apposite authority for its position\r\nnor to our knowledge has any court held that ADA plaintiffs mustundergo actual physical assessments of their respective capacities\r\nto engage in particular major life activities in order to establish\r\nthat their ability to do so is limited.  On the contrary, through\r\ncompetent medical testimony an ADA plaintiff may demonstrate that\r\nher own preemptive decision to limit or refrain from a major life\r\nactivity was necessary to avoid placing herself or others at\r\nimminent risk of physical injury.  See, e.g., Bragdon v. Abbott,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118241\"><a href=\"/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2206 (1998) (\"The Act addresses substantial\r\nlimitations on major life activities, not utter inabilities. \r\nConception and childbirth are not impossible for an HIV victim but,\r\nwithout doubt, are dangerous.\") (emphasis added).\r\nTellingly, Staley's own medical expert actually relied on\r\nthis predictive methodology in assessing Quint's condition. \r\nLikewise, commonsense dictates that an ADA claimant may rely on the\r\npreemptive risk assessments made by her medical experts, subject of\r\ncourse to later cross-examination regarding their methodology and\r\ntheir personal knowledge of the relevant medical history.  In that\r\nvery vein the jury found the assessments offered by Quint's expert\r\nwitnesses to be creditworthy.  See Criado v. IBM Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197991\"><a href=\"/opinion/197991/criado-v-ibm-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440-41 (1st Cir. 1998) (on Rule 50(b) motion, all credibility\r\nissues are resolved in nonmovant's favor).\r\nStaley further argues that Quint simply showed that her\r\nCTS resulted from a temporarily \"irritated\" median nerve, rather\r\nthan from permanent nerve \"damage.\"  Thus, she failed to show that\r\nher impairment entailed any \"permanent or long term impact.\"  See\r\nsupra note 5.  Once again, we cannot agree.\r\nQuint adduced competent evidence that her carpal nerve\r\nirritation was both recurrent and permanent.  Dr. LaBelle testified\r\nthat \"the moment [Quint] starts using her hands [] the [seriousness\r\nof her CTS] will rise right up immediately like that . . . . It's\r\nvery seldom that a tendinitis that occurs that flares up to a level\r\nthat she had it will ever revert back to normal.\"  Similarly, Dr.\r\nSigsbee testified that in July 1993 he concluded that Quint\r\n\"probably would not be able to perform that kind of [heavy-duty]\r\nwork ever again in the future.\"  In December 1993, Dr. Tungol\r\nlikewise warned that \"[a] return to this activity [i.e., her former\r\nduties, such as \"bagging,\"] will make [Quint] vulnerable to\r\nreoccurrence of her symptoms.\"  Moreover, no medical doctor, except\r\nnon-CTS-specialist Dr. Blum, ever cleared Quint to return to her\r\nregular duties.  Cf. Wilmarth v. City of Santa Rosa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457840\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457840/wilmarth-v-city-of-santa-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Thus, credited by\r\nthe jury as we must deem it to have been, see Criado, 145 F.3d at\r\n440-41, the medical evidence presented by Quint provided ample\r\nsupport for a factual finding that her impairment was not merely\r\ntransitory.  Cf. id. (rejecting defendant's contention that jury\r\nwas compelled to find that plaintiff's impairment was \"a temporary\r\nmental condition\").\r\nAn ADA claimant assumes a more fact-specific burden of\r\nproof in attempting to demonstrate that her impairment\r\n\"substantially limits\" the major life activity of \"working.\"  In the\r\ncontext of the major life activity of working, the term\r\n\"substantially limits\" means \"significantly restricted in the\r\nability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs\r\nin various classes as compared to the average person having\r\ncomparable training, skills and abilities.  The inability to\r\nperform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial\r\nlimitation in the major life activity of working.\"  29 C.F.R. \r\n1630.2(j)(3)(i) (emphasis added).  Other relevant factors include:\r\n\"(A) [t]he geographical area to which the individual has reasonable\r\naccess; (B) [t]he job from which the individual has been\r\ndisqualified because of an impairment, and the number and types of\r\njobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities,\r\nwithin that geographical area, from which the individual is also\r\ndisqualified because of the impairment (class of jobs); and/or (C)\r\n[t]he job from which the individual has been disqualified because\r\nof an impairment, and the number and types of other jobs not\r\nutilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within\r\nthat geographical area, from which the individual is also\r\ndisqualified because of the impairment (broad range of jobs in\r\nvarious classes).\"  Id.  1630.2(j)(3)(ii) (emphasis added).\r\nIn regard to the geographical/job class element, Quint\r\nestablished that her CTS restrictions did more than merely\r\ndisqualify her for a particular job at Staley.

Furthermore, Dr. Sigsbee's\r\ndeficiencies in this subject matter area are far from self-evident,\r\nsince he had practiced in northern and southern Maine for\r\napproximately seventeen years, and his specialization in CTS\r\npresumably afforded him adequate exposure to the impact of CTS upon\r\nin-state job prospects.\r\nNor is the burden of proof incumbent upon an ADA\r\nplaintiff in relation to this element particularly formidable.  See29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.  1630.2(j) (\"The terms 'numbers and types\r\nof jobs' and 'number and types of other jobs,' as used in the\r\nfactors discussed above, are not intended to require an onerous\r\nevidentiary showing.  Rather, the terms only require the\r\npresentation of evidence of general employment demographics and/or\r\nof recognized occupational classifications that indicate the\r\napproximate number of jobs (e.g., 'few,' 'many,' 'most') from which\r\nan individual would be excluded because of an impairment.\"); supranote 4.  Since all genuine credibility issues must be resolved in\r\nplaintiff's favor, see Ansin, 105 F.3d at 753, Dr. Sigsbee's\r\ntestimony alone, which came in without objection, sufficed to\r\ngenerate a triable issue of fact.\r\nIn addition, Quint adduced competent evidence that her\r\ntraining, knowledge, skills  a high school education and a work\r\nhistory of heavy physical labor  likely would restrict her to\r\nsuch jobs, which were also the most prevalent in her geographical\r\narea.

On close inspection, however, these authorities\r\nsimply hold that the respective ADA claimants had not established\r\nthat CTS substantially limited their particularized job prospects. \r\nThe ADA explicitly contemplates that the \"disability\" determination\r\nis to be made by the factfinder on an individualized, case-by-case\r\nbasis.  See 42 U.S.C.  12102(2)(A) (defining \"disability\" as \"a\r\nphysical . . . impairment that substantially limits one or more of\r\nthe major life activities of such individual\") (emphasis added).\r\nOn appeal from a judgment entered pursuant to Rule 50(b),\r\nwe do not consider which party put forth the more convincing case,\r\nbut whether the party with the burden of proof adduced enough\r\nevidence to enable a rational jury to return a verdict in her\r\nfavor.

The jury awarded Quint $300,000 in\r\ncompensatory damages, see McKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196739\"><a href=\"/opinion/196739/mckinnon-v-kwong-wah/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-07 (1st Cir. 1996) (amended ADA makes emotional harm\r\ncompensable), and, based on Staley's annual net income of $65-85\r\nmillion, $420,000 in exemplary damages.  The district court reduced\r\nthe combined award to $300,000 pursuant to the statutory cap in 42\r\nU.S.C.  1981a(b)(3)(D).  Staley argues that the jury rationally\r\ncould not have awarded Quint $300,000 in compensatory damages since\r\nshe established no serious emotional injuries stemming from her\r\ndischarge.  Be that as it may, since we find the punitive damages\r\naward itself proper, and it alone exceeded the $300,000 statutory\r\ncap, there is no need to revisit the compensatory-damages issue. \r\nSee Hogan v. Bangor and Aroostook R.R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).\r\nAn ADA plaintiff may recover punitive damages provided\r\nshe establishes, inter alia, that the defendant engaged in a\r\ndiscriminatory practice \"with reckless indifference to the\r\n[plaintiff's]  federally protected rights.\"  42 U.S.C. \r\n1981a(b)(1)(emphasis added).  Staley contends that the only\r\nevidence of reckless indifference was its short notification of the\r\nMarch 7, 1994 appointment with Dr. Blum and of Quint's right to\r\nrequire Staley to compensate her doctor for attending the\r\nappointment.  Staley argues that since these rights arise under\r\nMaine law, see Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 39-A,  207, supra note 1,\r\nrather than the ADA, Staley's belated notification cannot as a\r\nmatter of law establish its reckless indifference to a \"federallyprotected right[].\"  We reject its claim, since the ADA accorded\r\nQuint the right to be free from discharge on account of her\r\ndisability and there was ample evidence that Staley discharged her\r\nwith reckless indifference to that \"federally protected right[]. \r\nIn July 1993, Plant Manager Baker became \"upset\" about Dr.\r\nSigsbee's diagnosis of Quint's disability and its potential adverse\r\neffect on Staley's spotless workers' compensation record.  Baker\r\n\"strident[ly]\" asserted that Quint was malingering, exerted pressure\r\non Dr. Sigsbee to alter his diagnosis, and produced a videotape\r\nwhich misleadingly understated the job-duty requirements of a\r\npress-operator.\r\nIn early January 1994, when Quint's physician recommended\r\nthat she not work at all, Baker made the decision to refer Quint to\r\nDr. Blum, who had consistently downplayed her impairment.  Yet\r\nBaker gave Quint a mere fifteen minutes' notice of the appointment\r\nand rejected her physician's recommendation that she cease work\r\nuntil further notice.\r\nMoreover, Operations Manager Saunders testified that the\r\ncertified-mail notice Baker had given Quint of the later March 7,\r\n1994 appointment with Dr. Blum, see supra Section I, was\r\nunreasonably short.  Importantly, Baker himself conceded at trial\r\nthat he had given no thought to whether the notice was reasonable,\r\nwhich itself fairly may be considered a clear acknowledgment of\r\nreckless indifference.  Baker also knew that Dr. LaBelle, Quint's\r\nphysician, could not be available on March 7 because he was away on\r\nvacation.  Nevertheless, after learning that Quint was \"upset\" and\r\nthat she had canceled the March 7 appointment, Baker reacted by\r\nterminating her employment for failing to comply with the\r\nunreasonable certified-mail notice she had been given.\r\nIn addition, contrary to Staley's contention the fact\r\nthat the March 5, 1994 notice violated Maine law in no sense\r\nprecluded a punitive damages award under the ADA.  Section\r\n1981a(b)(1) does not state \"with reckless indifference to the\r\n[plaintiff's] federally protected rights, and only those federallyprotected rights.\"  Thus, the jury rationally could conclude that\r\nBaker recklessly utilized Quint's alleged \"insubordination\" as an\r\nexcuse for discharging her by reason of her disability.\r\nFinally, Staley neither suggests another rationale which\r\nwould preclude a finding that the totality of Staley's conduct was\r\n\"outrageous,\" nor challenges the punitive damages calculation\r\nitself.  Accordingly, the $420,000 punitive damages award alone\r\nafforded ample support for the $300,000 damages award approved by\r\nthe district court.\r\nB.   The Quint Cross-Appeal (No. 98-1342)\r\n1.   The Back-Pay Award\r\na)   The Failure to Mitigate Damages\r\nQuint contends that the district court erred in reducing\r\nher back-pay claim from $125,580 to $45,917, representing 18\r\nmonths' lost wages.  The court reasoned that Quint had not\r\nattempted to mitigate damages by seeking suitable alternative\r\nemployment following her discharge.  Quint responds that Staley\r\nfailed to prove, inter alia, that there were substantially\r\nequivalent jobs available in the relevant geographic area.

We likewise opt for the mitigation-defense\r\nexception adopted in these cases.\r\nWhere an ADA claimant refrains from pursuing alternative\r\nemployment, we consider it reasonable to presume at the outset that\r\nshe did so for an articulable reason, perhaps because she possessed\r\ninformation which suggested that a job search would have been\r\nfutile.  Since it is the claimant who would possess any such\r\ninformation, however, she is likely to be in the better position to\r\nexplain her preemptive decision to take no action to obtain\r\nemployment.  We believe it will be the extraordinary case in which\r\nan ADA claimant's decision to withdraw from the job market can be\r\nfound to have been justifiable, given that virtually all\r\nreemployment prospects are plainly precluded absent some effort to\r\nreenter the job market.  Thus, we believe the mitigation policy\r\nfostered by the ADA will be better served by the approach we adopt\r\ntoday, since it affords reasonable inducements for ADA claimants to\r\nattempt to secure alternative employment.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court correctly ruled that Quint's utter failure to\r\nmitigate warranted the $79,663 reduction in the back-pay award.\r\nb)   Collateral-Source Benefits\r\nQuint next contends that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in reducing her back-pay award by the aggregate amount\r\nof the disability insurance proceeds and the AFDC and food-stamp\r\nbenefits received following her termination.  We agree.\r\nUnder the Maine Human Rights Act the court would lack\r\ndiscretion to deduct from a back-pay award any post-termination\r\ncollateral-source payments received by the discharged employee. \r\nSee Maine Human Rights Comm'n v. Department of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 869-70 (Me. 1984) (\"MHRC\").  Consequently, even if the\r\ndistrict court could reduce the ADA back-pay award by the amount of\r\nthe collateral benefits Quint received, it could not reduce the\r\nMHRA back-pay award to which the jury verdict simultaneously\r\nentitled her.\r\nStaley argues that MHRC is inapposite, for two reasons. \r\nFirst, it notes that MHRC is predicated on equitable principles and\r\nthat the plaintiff in MHRC \"rightfully\" received unemployment\r\nbenefits whereas Quint \"manipulated\" the welfare system.  Even\r\nassuming these characterizations of the respective claimant's\r\nconduct were meritorious, however, MHRC makes very clear that the\r\ncollateral-source rule permits no judicial discretion.  See MHRC,\r\n474 A.2d at 870 (\"'[A] consistent approach to this legal question\r\nseems preferable to a virtually unreviewable discretion which may\r\nproduce arbitrary and inconsistent results.'\") (citation omitted).\r\nSecond, Staley argues that incorporation of the\r\ncollateral-source rule into the MHRA discrimination case law by the\r\nMaine Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") in MHRC is called into question\r\nby Winston v. Maine Technical College Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (Me.\r\n1993), where the SJC noted that the MHRA \"generally tracks federal\r\nanti-discrimination statutes, [so] it is appropriate to look to\r\nfederal precedent for guidance in interpreting the MHRA.\"  Once\r\nagain, however, assuming the quoted statement is correct as a\r\ngeneral principle, it avails Staley nothing.\r\nThe generalization to which Staley alludes in Winstondoes not permit a federal court to presume that all prior SJC\r\ndecisions which announced MHRA standards in conflict with emerging\r\nfederal standards were thereby overruled.  Absent conspicuous\r\nevidence that a state's highest court has abandoned a previously-\r\nannounced rule, it is not for the federal courts to presume as\r\nmuch.  See Carlton v. Worcester Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553911\"><a href=\"/opinion/553911/gerald-r-carlton-etc-v-worcester-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 n.5 (1st\r\nCir. 1991) (\"While it is not necessary that a state case be\r\nexplicitly overruled by the state court in order to lose its\r\npersuasive force, there must at least be footprints pointing\r\nconspicuously in that direction.\") (citation omitted); Caraccioliv.

After\r\nsurveying the divergent collateral-source rules in other\r\njurisdictions, and addressing the difficult policy choices\r\npresented, the SJC definitively and categorically opted for a clear\r\nrule excluding collateral-source payments from the back-pay\r\nequation.  MHRC, 474 A.2d at 870 (\"If either the victim of the\r\ndiscrimination or the discriminating employer is going to receive\r\na windfall because part of the victim's loss has been paid for by\r\na third party, it is more just that the windfall should inure to\r\nthe injured party than to the wrongdoer.\"); see Pine v. Cole's\r\nExpress, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1002 (Me. 1987) (expressly refusing\r\nto reexamine MHRC collateral-source rule).\r\nMoreover, even if Winston were deemed adequate license\r\nfor us to forecast what the SJC might do upon revisiting MHRC, the\r\nprinciple enunciated in Winston would provide useful guidance only\r\nif a consensus existed on the collateral-source issue among the\r\nfederal courts.  Yet the courts of appeals are in disagreement\r\nregarding the collateral-source issue as it relates to\r\ndiscrimination claims under federal law, and the United States\r\nSupreme Court has yet to address the issue.  Thus, there is no\r\n\"federal precedent\" consensus upon which the SJC might \"piggy-back\"\r\nits state rule.\r\nAccordingly, Quint is entitled to an MHRA back-pay award\r\nfree of reductions attributable to collateral-source payments. \r\nThus, the final back-pay award must be increased from $8,019 to\r\n$45,917.\r\n2.   Reinstatement\r\nThe district court ruled that reinstatement would be\r\nimpracticable because there were no available \"light-duty\" jobs\r\nQuint could perform, and the \"tensions\" between Quint and her former\r\ncoworkers would create an intolerable work environment.

See, e.g.,\r\nid. at 1115.\r\nStaley points to evidence that no \"light-duty\" jobs are\r\ncurrently available, and argues that the ADA does not require that\r\na \"new\" job be created for Quint.  See Shea v.

Be that as it may, Staley has yet to\r\nconfront the appropriate inquiry:  whether it can and should\r\nreinstate Quint to her former position as a press operator. \r\nAlthough the district court possesses the requisite\r\ndiscretion to refuse reinstatement if an ADA claimant's former\r\nposition no longer exists, see, e.g., Ray v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 (D.\r\nMass. 1995), we can discern no record evidence that there are no\r\npress-operator positions for which Quint could qualify.  Staley\r\noffered Operations Manager Saunders as its sole witness at the\r\nequitable-remedy hearing.  Saunders testified that no \"light-duty\"\r\npositions currently existed at Staley.  According to Saunders, a\r\n\"light-duty\" position meant one which was \"not makeshift\" and which\r\nthe employee could \"do within [her] physical restrictions.\"  Asked\r\nto define what physical restrictions were accommodated within the\r\nterm \"light-duty,\" Saunders testified: \"I'm saying just about   it\r\nwould depend on the restrictions the individual has.\"  Although he\r\nstated that he did not know Quint's current restrictions, he\r\ntestified that no available jobs could accommodate a ten-pound\r\nweightlifting restriction.\r\nMoreover, according to Saunders a post-March 1994\r\nreduction-in-force further frustrated any such accommodation\r\nbecause employees thereafter \"worked harder and did more work.\" \r\nFurthermore, two or three people had left the process department in\r\nthe past year, either on disability or retirement, and Staley had\r\nhired two temporary part-time replacements.  Saunders declined to\r\nclassify the lighter-duty position Quint held prior to her 1994\r\ndischarge as a \"light-duty\" position, because Staley had intended\r\nthose accommodations to be temporary only, not permanent.  Thus, he\r\nsaid, a permanent accommodation for Quint's disability was simply\r\n\"impossible.\"  The conclusory and unelaborated testimony by Saunders\r\nprovided inadequate support for denying reinstatement.\r\nIn the first place, reinstatement is the \"overarching\r\npreference\" among all equitable remedies under the ADA, as it most\r\nefficiently furthers \"the dual goals of providing full coverage for\r\nthe plaintiff and of deterring such conduct by employers in the\r\nfuture.\"  Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732463\"><a href=\"/opinion/732463/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1457-69-empl-prac-dec-p-44463-mary-jane/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  Secondly, the unmistakable import of the Saunders\r\ntestimony is that Staley did have currently available press-\r\noperator positions, but that it chose not to reinstate even the\r\nreasonable accommodations afforded Quint in 1993-94.\r\nThus, Quint testified:  \"If they would let [her] do the\r\nlighter-duty position . . . [she held previously],\" she would have\r\nbeen \"physically . . . able to work at Staley.\"  Moreover, Saunders\r\nagreed that Staley \"believed [Quint] could do the job\" at the time\r\nshe was fired, and that \"the company thought that her inability to\r\nlift was something you could work around with respect to that\r\nparticular job.\"  Based on this evidence, the jury reasonably found\r\nthat Quint was \"qualified\"; that is, capable of performing the\r\n\"essential functions\" of the press-operator position with or without\r\nreasonable accommodation.  See supra note 3.\r\nIn determining appropriate equitable relief, the district\r\ncourt was strictly constrained by these jury findings.  See, e.g.,\r\nUnited States EEOC v. Century Broad. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578655\"><a href=\"/opinion/578655/58-fair-emplpraccas-bna-696-58-empl-prac-dec-p-41370-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1463\r\n(7th Cir. 1992); Song v.

Roadway Express, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553932\"><a href=\"/opinion/553932/james-t-harvis-jr-maurice-rivers-and-robert-c-davison-v-roadway/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61 (6th\r\nCir. 1991).  Thus, were it to appear that a press-operator position\r\nis available at Staley, the district court would be required to\r\nassume that Quint could perform it, with reasonable accommodation.\r\nSaunders suggested that Quint would not be returned to\r\nthe \"same\" press-operator position because an alleged post-March\r\n1994 \"reduction in force\" had required employees to \"work[] harder.\" \r\nAbsent some further evidentiary development, however, there is no\r\nreliable way to determine the degree, if any, to which the alleged\r\nreduction-in-force may have altered press-operator responsibilities\r\nso as to aggravate Quint's CTS.  Furthermore, even if it were to be\r\nassumed that the alleged reduction-in-force resulted in increased\r\npress-operator duties, the question would remain whether Staley\r\nreasonably could have accommodated Quint's disability within the\r\nmodified press-operator position.  After all, the jury found\r\nnothing more than that, as of the date Quint was discharged, Staley\r\nhad not failed to make reasonable accommodations for her\r\ndisability.  Because the jury was never instructed that Staley\r\ncould meet its ADA obligation merely by making a temporaryaccommodation, this finding may simply reflect the jury's\r\nrecognition that the parties were engaged in ongoing negotiation\r\nand consultation over what measures would achieve an appropriate\r\naccommodation.\r\nMoreover, since Staley illegally discharged Quint in\r\nMarch 1994 it was not necessary for the jury to determine what\r\nfurther accommodations Staley would have been obligated to make as\r\nfuture conditions might warrant.  For example, Saunders conceded\r\nthat \"several employees at Staley other than [plaintiff] have been\r\ngiven permanent light-duty jobs,\" some when they \"got hurt.\" At\r\ntrial, Baker acknowledged that the quest for reasonable\r\naccommodation was an ongoing, wait-and-see process. See Criado, 145\r\nF.3d at 445 (\"The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is a\r\ncontinuing one, however, and not exhausted by one effort.\")\r\n(quoting Ralph v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751342\"><a href=\"/opinion/751342/franklin-ralph-v-lucent-technologies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 (1st Cir.\r\n1998)); 29 C.F.R.  1630.2(o)(3) (\"[I]t may be necessary for the\r\ncovered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process\" with\r\nthe disabled employee.). \r\nSignificantly, Saunders acknowledged that Staley nevercontended that its accommodation of Quint's disability would cause\r\nit \"undue [financial] hardship.\" See 42 U.S.C.  12112(b)(5)(A)\r\n(employer must make reasonable accommodation \"unless [it] can\r\ndemonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship\r\non the operation of the business of such covered entity\"). \r\nMoreover, the trial record amply documented other possible\r\naccommodations as well.\r\nThe ergonomist hired by Staley's insurer made several\r\nrecommendations which Staley elected not to adopt, including one\r\nwhich would have excused Quint from overtime work.  See id. \r\n12111(9)(B) (reasonable accommodation may include \"modified work\r\nschedules\").  In addition, Staley could have elected to heat the\r\nwarehouse and/or the processing areas and to repair the air system\r\nwhich powered the automatic manipulators' suction devices.  The\r\nlatter accommodation would have relieved press operators from\r\nlifting heavy bags by hand.  Finally, since process operators work\r\nin teams, with each person performing discrete assembly-line\r\nfunctions, Staley might have assigned Quint permanently to a team\r\nposition which minimized stress on her wrists, arms and shoulders. \r\nThus, to deny reinstatement on the present record would reward\r\nStaley for terminating prematurely the required effort to reach a\r\nreasonable accommodation.\r\nWere it made to appear on remand that a press-operator\r\nposition is available, Quint presumably would be entitled to\r\nreinstatement by virtue of the jury verdict in this case, at leaston the same terms allowed by Staley prior to March 1994.  Should\r\nadditional accommodations be required, Staley would need to\r\ndetermine in the first instance whether any such accommodations are\r\n\"reasonable\" under the ADA.  Of course, should it refuse further\r\nreasonable accommodation as appropriate, it would expose itself\r\nonce again to ADA liability.\r\nThe district court finding that \"tensions\" continued\r\nbetween Quint and her former coworkers presents a different\r\nproblem.  Although Staley's brief below represented that coworker\r\ntensions existed, statements by counsel are not competent evidence. \r\nSee Fernandez v. Chardon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405331\"><a href=\"/opinion/405331/rafael-rivera-fernandez-v-carlos-chardon-etc-juan-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 n.10 (1st Cir. 1982)\r\n(statements by counsel are no substitute for admissible evidence),\r\naff'd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110977\"><a href=\"/opinion/110977/chardon-v-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983).  The record on appeal is devoid of any\r\ntestimony or other evidence from any current Staley employee that\r\nworking with Quint would be intolerable.  See Lussier, 50 F.3d at\r\n1113 (vacating front-pay award and noting that \"[i]t is a\r\nfundamental principle of our jurisprudence that a factfinder may\r\nnot consider extra-record evidence concerning disputed adjudicative\r\nfacts\").  Thus, the only suggestion of coworker tensions in the\r\nappellate record consists of conclusory assertions by Staley's\r\ncounsel.\r\nThese assertions are infirm for other reasons as well. \r\nFirst, the only clear-cut evidence at trial showed no antagonism\r\namong Quint's coworkers in 1993-94.  When asked:  \"Do you remember\r\nthat a lot of coworkers complained about the accommodations being\r\nmade for Jackie Quint?,\" coworker Arnold Gonya answered:  \"No, I\r\ndon't.\"  On the other hand, Baker testified in vague and tentative\r\nterms: \"I believe there had been some friction with some of the\r\nworkers around how much [Quint] was doing . . . some feelings of\r\ninequities perhaps by her coworkers.\" (Emphasis added.)  Baker\r\nneither related any specific coworker complaint nor identified a\r\nparticular complainant.  Saunders testified to having heard ofcomplaints, but when asked to confirm complaints by any particular\r\nemployee, stated:  \"I can't remember for sure.\"\r\nMoreover, given the four-year lifespan of the present\r\nlitigation, it is not even clear that any former coworker is still\r\nemployed at Staley.  Nor can we presume, as Staley does without a\r\nshred of evidence, that Quint's forty or more coworkers must be\r\nintolerably envious because she won $300,000 in damages, while they\r\nare considerably less well off.  The factual assumptions underlying\r\nthis presumption (e.g., coworkers' empathy for management rather\r\nthan their coworker) amount to little more than rank speculation.\r\nFinally, we state the obvious.  While it may be that\r\nStaley's unsubstantiated reference to \"coworker tensions\" cloaks\r\nStaley management's antagonism toward Quint, rarely could an ADA\r\nclaimant be reinstated were any such employer antagonism considered\r\nan adequate ground for denying reinstatement, see Century Broad.,\r\n957 F.2d at 1462, and the legislative aims of the ADA surely would\r\nbe ill served.\r\nWe do not state that coworker hostility, adequately\r\nproven real and intolerable, may not provide an appropriate ground\r\nfor refusing reinstatement.  See, e.g., Deloach v. Delchamps, Inc.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537652\"><a href=\"/opinion/537652/richard-deloach-cross-appellant-v-delchamps-inc-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (5th Cir. 1990) (determining reinstatement\r\nimpracticable where it would cause morale problems and disrupt\r\nother individuals' employment).  Given the current record and the\r\nprominence of the reinstatement remedy under the ADA scheme,\r\nhowever, adequate review of the district court's denial of\r\nreinstatement is impracticable.\r\n                     III\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we remand to the district court for such\r\nfurther proceedings as it deems necessary and appropriate to inform\r\nthe further exercise of its discretion relating to reinstatement. \r\nSee Lussier, 50 F.3d at 1115 (vacating front-pay award due to\r\ncourt's reliance on extra-record evidence, and noting that court on\r\nremand may opt between another evidentiary hearing or \"hold[ing]\r\nthe parties to their proof at trial [and] . . . the existing\r\nrecord\"); see also Kerr-Selgas, 104 F.3d at 15 (vacating\r\nreinstatement ruling on same grounds).  Should a further\r\nevidentiary hearing appear appropriate, the parties should adduce\r\nspecific evidence relating to the availability of current press-\r\noperator positions at Staley, and any current coworker hostility\r\ntoward Quint which might make reinstatement impracticable.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the $300,000 damages award is\r\naffirmed; the back-pay award is increased from $8,019 to $45,917;\r\nthe district court ruling denying reinstatement is vacated and the\r\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith. \r\nCosts to appellant.\r\nSO ORDERED.\n</pre>",
