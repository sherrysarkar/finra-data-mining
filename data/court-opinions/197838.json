Phillip D. Champagne sued his\r\nformer employer Servistar Corporation under the Americans with\r\nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.  12101-12213.  Champagne,\r\na truck driver, alleged that Servistar unlawfully terminated\r\nhis employment because he was disabled.  His disability, he\r\nsaid, was that he suffered from emotional disorders which\r\nrequired him to drive only familiar routes, avoid high bridges,\r\nand not rotate truck routes as did other Servistar drivers. \r\nChampagne also alleged that his termination was in retaliation\r\nfor his filing disability discrimination charges and that\r\nServistar threatened to withdraw the workplace accommodation it\r\nhad earlier given him.  The district court rejected these\r\nclaims in a carefully reasoned opinion granting summary\r\njudgment.  We affirm.\r\n                             I                As summary judgment has been granted, we review the\r\nfacts in the light most favorable to Champagne and will draw\r\nall reasonable inferences in his favor.  See Soileau v.\r\nGuilford of Maine, 105 F.3d 12, 13 (1st Cir. 1997).  Because\r\nthe issue of causation as to the termination of Champagne's\r\nemployment is largely dispositive of the case, we focus\r\nparticularly on those facts.\r\n    Servistar is a cooperative engaged in the\r\ndistribution of hardware, lumber, and building materials to\r\napproximately 3,700 owner-member stores nationwide.  In June\r\n1974, Servistar hired Champagne as a truck driver at its\r\nWestfield, Massachusetts distribution center (\"Westfield\r\nterminal\").  Champagne, one of approximately twenty regular\r\ntruck drivers at the Westfield terminal, operated a tractor-\r\ntrailer and delivered merchandise to stores throughout New\r\nEngland and eastern New York.\r\n    At the time of Champagne's hiring, Servistar had a\r\nlong-standing policy of requiring drivers to rotate their\r\nroutes on a periodic basis.  The object of this policy was to\r\nbetter monitor driver productivity by comparing different\r\ndrivers on the same route, obtain better feedback on customers'\r\nneeds by gaining the perspective of numerous drivers, and\r\nequalize pay, work load, and overall driver responsibilities. \r\nChampagne, like all Servistar drivers, was subject to this\r\npolicy.  \r\n    In the mid-1980's, Champagne began to develop\r\nemotional problems which increasingly interfered with his\r\nability to rotate routes.  These problems included general\r\nanxiety, feelings of despair, suicidal tendencies, and a\r\nspecific phobia of crossing bridges.  Champagne told his\r\npsychiatrist, Dr. Carl Saviano, that he sought to avoid bridges\r\nwith which he was unfamiliar or thought unsafe (Champagne\r\nespecially feared high bridges with low railings) for fear that\r\nhe would commit suicide by driving off the bridge.  Champagne\r\ndid not inform Servistar of his condition.  In 1988, Champagne\r\nasked his supervisor at the Westfield terminal to exempt him\r\nfrom route-rotation and to allow him to drive a set route. \r\nChampagne's supervisor granted this request.  In 1990,\r\nChampagne fell into a major depression and was hospitalized for\r\ntwo weeks in the psychiatric unit at the Cooley-Dickinson\r\nHospital in Northampton, Massachusetts.\r\n    When other drivers at the Westfield terminal began to\r\ncomplain about Champagne's exemption from the route rotation\r\nsystem, Servistar's Vice President of Human Resources, Russell\r\nThomas, asked Champagne to supply a medical reason for driving\r\na set route.  In November 1990, Champagne produced a note from\r\nDr. Saviano stating: \"It is most important for Mr. Champagne's\r\nhealth that he have very regular work hours and a very regular,\r\npredictable schedule.\"  Because the note did not explain the\r\nnature of Champagne's problems, Thomas called Dr. Saviano for\r\nfurther explanation.  Dr. Saviano did not reveal Champagne's\r\ncondition, but simply repeated that it would be in Champagne's\r\nbest interest for him to continue driving the set route.  On\r\nthis advice, Thomas asked Champagne's supervisor to leave\r\nChampagne on the set route, and the supervisor agreed. \r\nChampagne continued to work without incident.  Indeed,\r\nChampagne's evaluations for 1991 through 1993 show that his\r\nperformance was exemplary.\r\n    In mid-1992, Servistar made managerial changes\r\naffecting the Westfield terminal.  Phil Hammonds became the new\r\nwarehouse manager at the Westfield terminal, thus becoming\r\nChampagne's new supervisor, and Tom Brennan became Servistar's\r\nnew Vice President of Operations.  Hammonds discovered that\r\ndrivers at the Westfield terminal were switching routes on\r\ntheir own initiative and that three drivers, including\r\nChampagne, were driving set routes.  Hammonds, based on the\r\nmedical information before him, did not believe that Champagne\r\nand the other individuals driving set routes suffered from\r\nmedical disabilities preventing them from complying with the\r\nroute-rotation requirement.  \r\n    In early 1993, Brennan and Hammonds reinstated strict\r\nroute rotation across the board at the Westfield terminal. \r\nRoutes were organized into groups of four or five routes and\r\ndrivers were required to rotate within these groups.  On June\r\n14, 1993, Champagne produced another short note from Dr.\r\nSaviano recommending that Champagne continue to drive a set\r\nroute.  No explanation was given nor was a claim made that\r\nChampagne was disabled:  \"Mr. Champagne requires regular\r\npsychotherapy sessions.  It is essential that Mr. Champagne's\r\ntreatment be augmented and supported by a very regular work\r\nschedule.\"  On June 17, 1993, Hammonds told Champagne by phone\r\nthat Champagne would have to meet normal route-rotation\r\nrequirements or go to work in the warehouse until he was able\r\nto do so.  On June 21, 1993, Hammonds sent written notice to\r\nall drivers on set routes, including Champagne, that Servistar\r\nexpected them to drive according to rotating schedules and\r\nthat, if they were unable to rotate routes within 30 days for\r\nmedical reasons, they would, as an accommodation, be placed on\r\nlight duty status and transferred to the warehouse.    Transfer\r\nto the warehouse would have entailed a loss of pay for\r\nChampagne.\r\n    Champagne regarded his regular route as an\r\naccommodation to his mental condition, and he believed that the\r\nnotice from Servistar constituted a threatened withdrawal of\r\nreasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA.  On July 15,\r\n1993, Champagne filed a disability discrimination complaint\r\nwith the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and\r\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  He filed a civil\r\naction in Massachusetts state court seeking to enjoin Servistar\r\nfrom removing him from his regular route.  The state court\r\ngranted a temporary restraining order against Servistar. \r\nServistar complied with the TRO and, before the hearing on a\r\npreliminary injunction, voluntarily agreed to leave Champagne\r\non the set route pending receipt of more specific information\r\non Champagne's condition. \r\n    Champagne did not release his medical records to\r\nServistar, apparently on the advice of his attorney.  Dr.\r\nSaviano, however, responded to Servistar's inquiries about\r\nChampagne's condition in a letter dated October 20, 1993.  Dr.\r\nSaviano informed Servistar that Champagne suffered from anxiety\r\ndisorders caused by previous emotional injuries, and he\r\nreiterated his view that Champagne needed \"a fixed regular\r\nschedule in which he travels the same route, sees the same\r\npeople and performs the same activities routinely.\"  Dr.\r\nSaviano said that such a schedule would permit Champagne to\r\ncontrol his anxieties.  \"Even changes known well in advance\r\ncould be very hurtful to his therapy and his well being.\"\r\n                             II     In the meantime, other events were unfolding.  In the\r\nfall of 1993, two items of information came to Hammonds'\r\nattention suggesting that at least some Servistar drivers were\r\nfalsifying travel logs they are required to keep by the federal\r\nDepartment of Transportation (\"DOT\").  DOT regulations require\r\ninterstate truckers to record their driving time, non-driving\r\nbut on-duty time, and off-duty time.\r\n    The first item of information was that a Servistar\r\ntruck had been observed parked on a residential street for a\r\nperiod of time.  Hammonds checked the logs, which indicated the\r\ndriver had been on duty at the time the truck was parked on the\r\nstreet.  Hammonds prepared a recommendation to fire the driver,\r\nbelieving the facts indicated that the driver was basically\r\n\"stealing\" time, and therefore pay.    When Hammonds met with\r\nthe driver, the driver indicated he had \"carried over\" time\r\nfrom the prior day in order to comply with DOT regulations, but\r\nthat he put the time in.  Hammonds decided not to fire the\r\ndriver, but still gave the driver a written reprimand for\r\nfalsifying the logs.\r\n    The second item of information was the discovery that\r\nChampagne was making excessive use of the company telephone\r\ncredit card that had been issued to him.  Servistar issues\r\nphone cards to all drivers and drivers are allowed one fifteen\r\nminute call per day.  Supervisor Jim Atwater noticed that\r\nChampagne's phone bill for September 1993 listed more than\r\nsixty calls, some lasting more than an hour.  Atwater brought\r\nthe phone bill to Hammonds' attention.  Hammonds decided to\r\ntake no action against Champagne on the excessive phone use. \r\nHammonds also noticed that many of the calls had been made\r\nduring the middle of the day when Champagne would ordinarily be\r\ndriving.  Hammonds called the number from which Champagne had\r\nmade these mid-day calls and learned that the source was a\r\nHoliday Inn in Ronkonkoma, New York.  Hammonds cross-checked\r\nthe phone records against Champagne's logs.  He discovered that\r\nChampagne had recorded that he had been driving or was\r\notherwise on-duty during those times when phone records showed\r\nhe was making calls.  By recording more driving time than he\r\nhad actually performed, Champagne had been paid money he was\r\nnot properly owed.\r\n    Upon learning this, Servistar consulted legal counsel\r\nand decided to audit the logs and phone records of all\r\nWestfield terminal drivers when the following month's phone\r\nrecords came in, as well as to audit drivers in other locations\r\nrandomly.  Servistar realized that the phone card records gave\r\nit a way to test the accuracy of its drivers' logs.  The all-\r\ndriver audit was conducted the following month, in November\r\n1993, on the October 1993 phone bills.  It revealed that four\r\ndrivers, including Champagne, had falsified their DOT logs by\r\nrecording they were driving at times when phone records showed\r\nthey were making calls.  Servistar did not take immediate\r\naction on these individuals, but decided to investigate further\r\nto see if a pattern existed.  Servistar reaudited the four\r\ndrivers the following month and discovered that three of the\r\ndrivers, including Champagne, had multiple violations during\r\nthat month as well.  The fourth driver had only one violation.\r\n    Servistar decided to terminate the employment of the\r\nthree drivers who had multiple violations, including Champagne,\r\nand to give a written warning to the fourth driver.  Hammonds,\r\nBrennan and another supervisor met individually with each of\r\nthe three drivers who were to be fired.  Each was given copies\r\nof records and shown the violations.  Champagne did not dispute\r\nthe evidence.  In fact, Champagne said, he had been falsifying\r\nhis DOT logs for twenty years and he did so because he did not\r\nwant speeding violations showing in his logs.  Champagne said\r\nthis was common practice among Servistar drivers and something\r\nServistar itself knew about and encouraged.  On January 20,\r\n1994, Servistar fired Champagne and the two other drivers.\r\n    Since these terminations, Servistar has continued to\r\nperform random cross-checks of drivers' logs against their\r\nphone bills.  In late 1994, Servistar discharged another driver\r\nfor log violations.  In his twenty-five years with Servistar,\r\nBrennan has also terminated three other drivers for log\r\nviolations.\r\n    Champagne says that Servistar knew that its drivers\r\nroutinely violated DOT log regulations, and that the use of\r\nsuch violations to terminate him masks Servistar's real\r\nintention to discriminate against him on account of his\r\ndisability and retaliate for his filing a discrimination charge\r\nagainst the company.  Champagne's specific evidence on this\r\npoint is discussed below.\r\n                            III     On January 27, 1995, the EEOC issued Champagne a\r\n\"Right to Sue\" letter.  Champagne withdrew his state court\r\naction and, on February 21, 1995, filed this federal lawsuit. \r\nChampagne alleged that Servistar discriminated against him\r\nbecause he was disabled in violation of 42 U.S.C.  12112(a),\r\nthat Servistar fired him in retaliation for his filing a\r\ndiscrimination charge in violation of 42 U.S.C.  12203(a), and\r\nthat Servistar had threatened to withdraw his workplace\r\naccommodation in violation of 42 U.S.C.  12203(b).  Servistar\r\ncounterclaimed for damages alleging breach of fiduciary duty,\r\nand fraud and deceit.\r\n    Servistar moved for summary judgment on Champagne's\r\nclaims and its counterclaims.  The district court granted\r\nServistar's motion as to Champagne's claims, holding that\r\nChampagne did not meet the statutory definition of disability,\r\nand that his evidence of retaliation or threat was insufficient\r\nto overcome Servistar's legitimate and nondiscriminatory\r\nexplanation.  The district court denied summary judgment as to\r\nServistar's counterclaims.  Champagne appeals the granting of\r\nsummary judgment as to his three claims.\r\n                             IV     The scope of our review over the district court's\r\nentry of summary judgment in favor of Servistar is de novo. \r\nSee Soileau, 105 F.3d at 14.  Summary judgment is appropriate\r\nwhen the evidence shows \"that there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  \r\n    Champagne says he has suffered harm from two sources: \r\n(1) the termination of his employment, which he says resulted\r\nfrom discrimination or retaliation or both, and (2) the\r\nmemorandum notifying him he would have to return to rotating\r\nroutes or work in the warehouse, which he says was a threat to\r\nwithdraw the accommodation Servistar was obligated to grant\r\nhim. \r\nA.  Termination and Retaliation\r\n    As to the first harm, the district court carefully\r\nparsed Champagne's discrimination and retaliation claims, and\r\nconcluded that Champagne did not meet the statutory definition\r\nof disabled   and that his evidence of retaliation was\r\ninsufficient.  We take a shorter route.  We have no doubt that\r\nChampagne suffered from a mental impairment, a first step\r\ntoward establishing disability under the ADA.  But even if\r\nChampagne could establish he was disabled within the meaning of\r\nthe ADA, his case on termination fails on the issue of\r\ncausation.  Champagne has not produced evidence from which a\r\nfinder of fact could reasonably find that Servistar \"discharged\r\n[him] in whole or in part because of [his] disability,\"  Equal\r\nEmployment Opportunity Comm'n v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141\r\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1997),   or that there was a \"causal connection\r\nbetween [his] discharge and the conduct\" of filing an ADA\r\ncomplaint.  Soileau, 105 F.3d at 16.    \r\n    Servistar has produced considerable proof that\r\nChampagne was dismissed because he falsified the DOT log books\r\nin violation of company policy and DOT regulations, and thereby\r\nobtained unearned pay.  This proof comes from Servistar's\r\ncross-referencing the phone records against DOT logs for all\r\nWestfield terminal drivers, not just Champagne.  This audit\r\nproved that three drivers, including Champagne, were falsifying\r\ntheir DOT logs on a regular basis.  Champagne does not\r\nchallenge the accuracy of the telephone records demonstrating\r\nthat Champagne was in the motel room making calls during times\r\nhe was supposed to be driving, nor does he contest that he\r\nfalsified his logs.  Servistar terminated all three who had\r\nmultiple violations, not just Champagne.  Servistar has fired\r\nother drivers since that time for the same violations.\r\n    This evidence meets Servistar's burden of\r\narticulating a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for\r\nterminating Champagne.  Under the McDonnell Douglas framework,\r\nsee McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973),\r\nthe burden shifts back to Champagne to show that Servistar's\r\nproffered reason is a pretext for discrimination based on\r\ndisability, see Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816,\r\n823-24 (1st Cir. 1991), or for retaliation, see id. at 827-28. \r\nTo make this showing, \"[i]t is not enough for [Champagne]\r\nmerely to impugn the veracity of [Servistar's] justification;\r\nhe must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to\r\nfind the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended\r\nto cover up the employer's real motive.\"  Id. at 824 (internal\r\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\r\n    Champagne's response is twofold.  His first argument\r\nis that consideration of the larger context of events compels\r\nthe conclusion that he was terminated because of discrimination\r\nor retaliation.  His second argument is that the alleged\r\nmisconduct for which he was fired was something which all\r\nServistar drivers did, not just Champagne.  As to context,\r\nChampagne notes that he was terminated only six months after he\r\nfiled his discrimination complaint, despite years of good\r\nperformance evaluations.    Moreover, he says, the June 21 memo\r\nrequiring all drivers to rotate routes, after Servistar had for\r\nyears allowed him to drive a set route, shows discriminatory\r\nanimus.  As to his misconduct, Champagne provided an affidavit\r\nfrom a fellow driver, Jerry Gilbert, that \"[t]he actions of\r\nPhillip Champagne of logging time which alleges drive time\r\nlogged in longer than the time actually driven, was a common\r\npractice within the ranks of Servistar's truck drivers, and\r\nthis fact was known by the supervisors of the truck drivers\r\nprior to Champagne's termination.\"\r\n    The Gilbert affidavit is Champagne's strongest\r\nevidence, but it does not suffice, either alone or with the\r\ncontext evidence, to permit a reasonable inference that\r\nChampagne's firing was motivated by discrimination and\r\nretaliation.  Accepting as true that historically some\r\nServistar drivers falsified logs, it is undisputed that the two\r\nnew managers of the Westfield terminal decided to do something\r\nabout the problem when it was brought to their attention.  The\r\ntest these managers devised to determine if there had been\r\nfalsification of records -- comparing phone records with\r\ndriving logs -- was plainly neutral.  It is undisputed that\r\nthis test was applied equally to everyone.  It is undisputed\r\nthat the test turned up four offenders, including Champagne,\r\nthat the employer applied the same test equally to each of\r\nthese four for a second month to determine if there was a\r\npattern, and that when the second test showed three of the four\r\nhad repeatedly falsified their logs, including Champagne, they\r\nwere treated equally:  each had his employment terminated.  And\r\nit is undisputed that Servistar has continued to cross-\r\nreference phone records against driving logs on a random basis\r\nand terminate those who the test shows falsified the log.  No\r\ninference of discrimination or retaliation may reasonably be\r\ndrawn from these facts.  That others may have turned up clean\r\non the test although they had falsified logs, or that others in\r\nthe past had falsified logs but not been caught, adds nothing\r\nto Champagne's case.    More specifically, Champagne produced no\r\nevidence that audits were conducted in the past or that the\r\ncompany retained drivers who were shown by an audit to have\r\nrepeatedly falsified records.\r\n    The contextual evidence offered to show Servistar's\r\nmotive to discriminate or retaliate against Champagne is also\r\ninsufficient, and in any event cannot overcome the fact that\r\nChampagne was treated no differently than his fellow drivers. \r\nGiven the absence of differential treatment, the district court\r\nproperly concluded that Champagne had failed to produce\r\nevidence of causation sufficient to survive summary judgment.\r\nB.  Threatened withdrawal\r\n    Champagne finally claims that Servistar unlawfully\r\nthreatened his enjoyment of a reasonable accommodation under\r\nthe ADA when he filed a disability discrimination charge with\r\nMCAD and EEOC on July 15, 1993.  The threat, he claims, came in\r\nthe form of the June 21 memorandum.  That memo stated that\r\nChampagne, along with all others driving a set route, would be\r\nrequired to drive rotating routes thirty days from the date of\r\nthe memo.  The memo explained: \"[Y]ou must perform all the\r\nessential functions of your truck driving position.  Rotation\r\nof routes within a scheduled departure group is an essential\r\nfunction of the truck driver position at SERVISTAR.\"   The memo\r\nfurther explained that Champagne would be reassigned to light\r\nduty in the warehouse if \"medical restrictions keep you from\r\nrotation within a scheduled departure group. . . . This\r\naccommodation will continue until your medical condition\r\npermits you to perform the essential functions of truck\r\ndriving.\"\r\n    On the evidence, Champagne's claim does not survive. \r\nHe relies on part of the ADA's anti-retaliation statute, 42\r\nU.S.C.  12203(b):\r\n    It shall be unlawful to coerce,\r\n    intimidate, threaten, or interfere with\r\n    any individual in the exercise or\r\n    enjoyment of, or on account of his or her\r\n    having exercised or enjoyed, or on account\r\n    of his or her having aided or encouraged\r\n    any other individual in the exercise or\r\n    enjoyment of, any right granted or\r\n    protected by this chapter.\r\n\nIt is doubtful Champagne has shown that he had \"exercised a\r\nright granted or protected by the ADA.\"  Before he filed his\r\nEEOC complaint, Champagne had not asserted he was disabled\r\nwithin the meaning of the ADA.  He certainly never provided\r\nServistar with any medical evidence from which a conclusion of\r\ndisability, as defined in the ADA, was warranted.  That\r\nServistar voluntarily decided to permit Champagne to avoid\r\nroute-rotation for a period of time does not establish that\r\nChampagne was disabled or that avoidance of route-rotation was\r\na required reasonable accommodation.\r\n    In this context, like the district court, we do not\r\nthink the memorandum may be reasonably viewed as a threat or\r\ninterference under  12203(b).  Under the ADA, Servistar has\r\nsubstantial leeway in defining the essential functions of its\r\ntruck driving positions, and it may require its drivers to be\r\nable to perform those functions.  See 42 U.S.C.  12111(8).   \r\nIt is true that other Servistar managers had not enforced the\r\nroute-rotation policy strictly or cross-checked phone records\r\nagainst DOT logs in the past.  But that does not permit the\r\nconclusion that the decision by new managers to enforce company\r\npolicy, and to audit for non-compliance, is a threat or\r\ninterference with ADA rights.  We stress that the decision of\r\nnew managers to enforce the policy was applied uniformly.  The\r\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment in favor of\r\nServistar on this claim.     \r\n    The decision of the district court is affirmed. \r\nCosts are awarded to the defendant.\n",

Champagne sued his former employer Servistar Corporation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213.  Champagne, a truck driver, alleged that Servistar unlawfully terminated his employment because he was disabled.  His disability, he said, was that he suffered from emotional disorders which required him to drive only familiar routes, avoid high bridges, and not rotate truck routes as did other Servistar drivers.  Champagne also alleged that his termination was in retaliation for his filing disability discrimination charges and that Servistar threatened to withdraw the workplace accommodation it had earlier given him.  The district court rejected these claims in a carefully reasoned opinion granting summary judgment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* As summary judgment has been granted, we review the facts in the light most favorable to Champagne and will draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.  See Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, 105 F.3d 12, 13 (1st Cir.1997).  Because the issue of causation as to the termination of Champagne's employment is largely dispositive of the case, we focus particularly on those facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar is a cooperative engaged in the distribution of hardware, lumber, and building materials to approximately 3,700 owner-member stores nationwide.  In June 1974, Servistar hired Champagne as a truck driver at its Westfield, Massachusetts distribution center (\"Westfield terminal\").  Champagne, one of approximately twenty regular truck drivers at the Westfield terminal, operated a tractor-trailer and delivered merchandise to stores throughout New England and eastern New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Champagne's hiring, Servistar had a long-standing policy of requiring drivers to rotate their routes on a periodic basis.  The object of this policy was to better monitor driver productivity by comparing different drivers on the same route, obtain better feedback on customers' needs by gaining the perspective of numerous drivers, and equalize pay, work load, and overall driver responsibilities.  Champagne, like all Servistar drivers, was subject to this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1980's, Champagne began to develop emotional problems which increasingly interfered with his ability to rotate routes.  These problems included general anxiety, feelings of despair, suicidal tendencies, and a specific phobia of crossing bridges.  Champagne told his psychiatrist, Dr. Carl Saviano, that he sought to avoid bridges with which he was unfamiliar or thought unsafe (Champagne especially feared high bridges with low railings) for fear that he would commit suicide by driving off the bridge.  Champagne did not inform Servistar of his condition.  In 1988, Champagne asked his supervisor at the Westfield terminal to exempt him from route-rotation and to allow him to drive a set route.  Champagne's supervisor granted this request.  In 1990, Champagne fell into a major depression and was hospitalized for two weeks in the psychiatric unit at the Cooley-Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When other drivers at the Westfield terminal began to complain about Champagne's exemption from the route rotation system, Servistar's Vice President of Human Resources, Russell Thomas, asked Champagne to supply a medical reason for driving a set route.  In November 1990, Champagne produced a note from Dr. Saviano stating:  \"It is most important for Mr. Champagne's health that he have very regular work hours and a very regular, predictable schedule.\"   Because the note did not explain the nature of Champagne's problems, Thomas called Dr. Saviano for further explanation.  Dr. Saviano did not reveal Champagne's condition, but simply repeated that it would be in Champagne's best interest for him to continue driving the set route.  On this advice, Thomas asked Champagne's supervisor to leave Champagne on the set route, and the supervisor agreed.  Champagne continued to work without incident.  Indeed, Champagne's evaluations for 1991 through 1993 show that his performance was exemplary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1992, Servistar made managerial changes affecting the Westfield terminal.  Phil Hammonds became the new warehouse manager at the Westfield terminal, thus becoming Champagne's new supervisor, and Tom Brennan became Servistar's new Vice President of Operations.  Hammonds discovered that drivers at the Westfield terminal were switching routes on their own initiative and that three drivers, including Champagne, were driving set routes.  Hammonds, based on the medical information before him, did not believe that Champagne and the other individuals driving set routes suffered from medical disabilities preventing them from complying with the route-rotation requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1993, Brennan and Hammonds reinstated strict route rotation across the board at the Westfield terminal.  Routes were organized into groups of four or five routes and drivers were required to rotate within these groups.  On June 14, 1993, Champagne produced another short note from Dr. Saviano recommending that Champagne continue to drive a set route.  No explanation was given nor was a claim made that Champagne was disabled:  \"Mr. Champagne requires regular psychotherapy sessions.  It is essential that Mr. Champagne's treatment be augmented and supported by a very regular work schedule.\"   On June 17, 1993, Hammonds told Champagne by phone that Champagne would have to meet normal route-rotation requirements or go to work in the warehouse until he was able to do so.  On June 21, 1993, Hammonds sent written notice to all drivers on set routes, including Champagne, that Servistar expected them to drive according to rotating schedules and that, if they were unable to rotate routes within 30 days for medical reasons, they would, as an accommodation, be placed on light duty status and transferred to the warehouse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Transfer to the warehouse would have entailed a loss of pay for Champagne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne regarded his regular route as an accommodation to his mental condition, and he believed that the notice from Servistar constituted a threatened withdrawal of reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA.  On July 15, 1993, Champagne filed a disability discrimination complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  He filed a civil action in Massachusetts state court seeking to enjoin Servistar from removing him from his regular route.  The state court granted a temporary restraining order against Servistar.  Servistar complied with the TRO and, before the hearing on a preliminary injunction, voluntarily agreed to leave Champagne on the set route pending receipt of more specific information on Champagne's condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne did not release his medical records to Servistar, apparently on the advice of his attorney.  Dr. Saviano, however, responded to Servistar's inquiries about Champagne's condition in a letter dated October 20, 1993.  Dr. Saviano informed Servistar that Champagne suffered from anxiety disorders caused by previous emotional injuries, and he reiterated his view that Champagne needed \"a fixed regular schedule in which he travels the same route, sees the same people and performs the same activities routinely.\"   Dr. Saviano said that such a schedule would permit Champagne to control his anxieties.  \"Even changes known well in advance could be very hurtful to his therapy and his well being.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, other events were unfolding.  In the fall of 1993, two items of information came to Hammonds' attention suggesting that at least some Servistar drivers were falsifying travel logs they are required to keep by the federal Department of Transportation (\"DOT\").  DOT regulations require interstate truckers to record their driving time, non-driving but on-duty time, and off-duty time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first item of information was that a Servistar truck had been observed parked on a residential street for a period of time.  Hammonds checked the logs, which indicated the driver had been on duty at the time the truck was parked on the street.  Hammonds prepared a recommendation to fire the driver, believing the facts indicated that the driver was basically \"stealing\" time, and therefore pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  When Hammonds met with the driver, the driver indicated he had \"carried over\" time from the prior day in order to comply with DOT regulations, but that he put the time in.  Hammonds decided not to fire the driver, but still gave the driver a written reprimand for falsifying the logs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second item of information was the discovery that Champagne was making excessive use of the company telephone credit card that had been issued to him.  Servistar issues phone cards to all drivers and drivers are allowed one fifteen minute call per day. Supervisor Jim Atwater noticed that Champagne's phone bill for September 1993 listed more than sixty calls, some lasting more than an hour.  Atwater brought the phone bill to Hammonds' attention.  Hammonds decided to take no action against Champagne on the excessive phone use.  Hammonds also noticed that many of the calls had been made during the middle of the day when Champagne would ordinarily be driving.  Hammonds called the number from which Champagne had made these mid-day calls and learned that the source was a Holiday Inn in Ronkonkoma, New York.  Hammonds cross-checked the phone records against Champagne's logs.  He discovered that Champagne had recorded that he had been driving or was otherwise on-duty during those times when phone records showed he was making calls.  By recording more driving time than he had actually performed, Champagne had been paid money he was not properly owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning this, Servistar consulted legal counsel and decided to audit the logs and phone records of all Westfield terminal drivers when the following month's phone records came in, as well as to audit drivers in other locations randomly.  Servistar realized that the phone card records gave it a way to test the accuracy of its drivers' logs.  The all-driver audit was conducted the following month, in November 1993, on the October 1993 phone bills.  It revealed that four drivers, including Champagne, had falsified their DOT logs by recording they were driving at times when phone records showed they were making calls.  Servistar did not take immediate action on these individuals, but decided to investigate further to see if a pattern existed.  Servistar reaudited the four drivers the following month and discovered that three of the drivers, including Champagne, had multiple violations during that month as well.  The fourth driver had only one violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar decided to terminate the employment of the three drivers who had multiple violations, including Champagne, and to give a written warning to the fourth driver.  Hammonds, Brennan and another supervisor met individually with each of the three drivers who were to be fired.  Each was given copies of records and shown the violations.  Champagne did not dispute the evidence.  In fact, Champagne said, he had been falsifying his DOT logs for twenty years and he did so because he did not want speeding violations showing in his logs.  Champagne said this was common practice among Servistar drivers and something Servistar itself knew about and encouraged.  On January 20, 1994, Servistar fired Champagne and the two other drivers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since these terminations, Servistar has continued to perform random cross-checks of drivers' logs against their phone bills.  In late 1994, Servistar discharged another driver for log violations.  In his twenty-five years with Servistar, Brennan has also terminated three other drivers for log violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne says that Servistar knew that its drivers routinely violated DOT log regulations, and that the use of such violations to terminate him masks Servistar's real intention to discriminate against him on account of his disability and retaliate for his filing a discrimination charge against the company.  Champagne's specific evidence on this point is discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1995, the EEOC issued Champagne a \"Right to Sue\" letter.  Champagne withdrew his state court action and, on February 21, 1995, filed this federal lawsuit.  Champagne alleged that Servistar discriminated against him because he was disabled in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a), that Servistar fired him in retaliation for his filing a discrimination charge in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(a), and that Servistar had threatened to withdraw his workplace accommodation in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(b).  Servistar counterclaimed for damages alleging breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud and deceit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar moved for summary judgment on Champagne's claims and its counterclaims.  The district court granted Servistar's motion as to Champagne's claims, holding that Champagne did not meet the statutory definition of disability, and that his evidence of retaliation or threat was insufficient to overcome Servistar's legitimate and nondiscriminatory explanation.  The district court denied summary judgment as to Servistar's counterclaims.  Champagne appeals the granting of summary judgment as to his three claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of our review over the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Servistar is de novo.  See Soileau, 105 F.3d at 14.   Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence shows \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne says he has suffered harm from two sources:  (1) the termination of his employment, which he says resulted from discrimination or retaliation or both, and (2) the memorandum notifying him he would have to return to rotating routes or work in the warehouse, which he says was a threat to withdraw the accommodation Servistar was obligated to grant him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Termination and Retaliation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first harm, the district court carefully parsed Champagne's discrimination and retaliation claims, and concluded that Champagne did not meet the statutory definition of disabled<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that his evidence of retaliation was insufficient.  We take a shorter route.  We have no doubt that Champagne suffered from a mental impairment, a first step toward establishing disability under the ADA.  But even if Champagne could establish he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, his case on termination fails on the issue of causation.  Champagne has not produced evidence from which a finder of fact could reasonably find that Servistar \"discharged [him] in whole or in part because of [his] disability,\" Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141 n. 2 (1st Cir.1997),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> or that there was a \"causal connection between [his] discharge and the conduct\" of filing an ADA complaint.  Soileau, 105 F.3d at 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar has produced considerable proof that Champagne was dismissed because he falsified the DOT log books in violation of company policy and DOT regulations, and thereby obtained unearned pay.  This proof comes from Servistar's cross-referencing the phone records against DOT logs for all Westfield terminal drivers, not just Champagne.  This audit proved that three drivers, including Champagne, were falsifying their DOT logs on a regular basis.  Champagne does not challenge the accuracy of the telephone records demonstrating that Champagne was in the motel room making calls during times he was supposed to be driving, nor does he contest that he falsified his logs.  Servistar terminated all three who had multiple violations, not just Champagne.  Servistar has fired other drivers since that time for the same violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence meets Servistar's burden of articulating a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Champagne.  Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), the burden shifts back to Champagne to show that Servistar's proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination based on disability, see Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823-24 (1st Cir.1991), or for retaliation, see id. at 827-28.   To make this showing, \"[i]t is not enough for [Champagne] merely to impugn the veracity of [Servistar's] justification;  he must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real motive.\"  Id. at 824 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne's response is twofold.  His first argument is that consideration of the larger context of events compels the conclusion that he was terminated because of discrimination or retaliation.  His second argument is that the alleged misconduct for which he was fired was something which all Servistar drivers did, not just Champagne.  As to context, Champagne notes that he was terminated only six months after he filed his discrimination complaint, despite years of good performance evaluations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, he says, the June 21 memo requiring all drivers to rotate routes, after Servistar had for years allowed him to drive a set route, shows discriminatory animus.  As to his misconduct, Champagne provided an affidavit from a fellow driver, Jerry Gilbert, that \"[t]he actions of Phillip Champagne of logging time which alleges drive time logged in longer than the time actually driven, was a common practice within the ranks of Servistar's truck drivers, and this fact was known by the supervisors of the truck drivers prior to Champagne's termination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gilbert affidavit is Champagne's strongest evidence, but it does not suffice, either alone or with the context evidence, to permit a reasonable inference that Champagne's firing was motivated by discrimination and retaliation.  Accepting as true that historically some Servistar drivers falsified logs, it is undisputed that the two new managers of the Westfield terminal decided to do something about the problem when it was brought to their attention.  The test these managers devised to determine if there had been falsification of records--comparing phone records with driving logs--was plainly neutral.  It is undisputed that this test was applied equally to everyone.  It is undisputed that the test turned up four offenders, including Champagne, that the employer applied the same test equally to each of these four for a second month to determine if there was a pattern, and that when the second test showed three of the four had repeatedly falsified their logs, including Champagne, they were treated equally:  each had his employment terminated.  And it is undisputed that Servistar has continued to cross-reference phone records against driving logs on a random basis and terminate those who the test shows falsified the log.  No inference of discrimination or retaliation may reasonably be drawn from these facts.  That others may have turned up clean on the test although they had falsified logs, or that others in the past had falsified logs but not been caught, adds nothing to Champagne's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  More specifically, Champagne produced no evidence that audits were conducted in the past or that the company retained drivers who were shown by an audit to have repeatedly falsified records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contextual evidence offered to show Servistar's motive to discriminate or retaliate against Champagne is also insufficient, and in any event cannot overcome the fact that Champagne was treated no differently than his fellow drivers.  Given the absence of differential treatment, the district court properly concluded that Champagne had failed to produce evidence of causation sufficient to survive summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Threatened withdrawal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne finally claims that Servistar unlawfully threatened his enjoyment of a reasonable accommodation under the ADA when he filed a disability discrimination charge with MCAD and EEOC on July 15, 1993.  The threat, he claims, came in the form of the June 21 memorandum.  That memo stated that Champagne, along with all others driving a set route, would be required to drive rotating routes thirty days from the date of the memo.  The memo explained:  \"[Y]ou must perform all the essential functions of your truck driving position.  Rotation of routes within a scheduled departure group is an essential function of the truck driver position at SERVISTAR.\"   The memo further explained that Champagne would be reassigned to light duty in the warehouse if \"medical restrictions keep you from rotation within a scheduled departure group....  This accommodation will continue until your medical condition permits you to perform the essential functions of truck driving.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evidence, Champagne's claim does not survive.  He relies on part of the ADA's anti-retaliation statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(b):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>It shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his or her having aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected by this chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is doubtful Champagne has shown that he had \"exercised a right granted or protected by the ADA.\"  Before he filed his EEOC complaint, Champagne had not asserted he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA.  He certainly never provided Servistar with any medical evidence from which a conclusion of disability, as defined in the ADA, was warranted.  That Servistar voluntarily decided to permit Champagne to avoid route-rotation for a period of time does not establish that Champagne was disabled or that avoidance of route-rotation was a required reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, like the district court, we do not think the memorandum may be reasonably viewed as a threat or interference under &#167; 12203(b).  Under the ADA, Servistar has substantial leeway in defining the essential functions of its truck driving positions, and it may require its drivers to be able to perform those functions.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  It is true that other Servistar managers had not enforced the route-rotation policy strictly or cross-checked phone records against DOT logs in the past.  But that does not permit the conclusion that the decision by new managers to enforce company policy, and to audit for non-compliance, is a threat or interference with ADA rights.  We stress that the decision of new managers to enforce the policy was applied uniformly.  The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Servistar on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.   Costs are awarded to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Hammonds' memo stated in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>You have been given a 30 calendar day notice, beginning June 19, 1993, that you must perform all the essential functions of your truck driving position.  Rotation of routes within a scheduled departure group is an essential function of the truck driver position at SERVISTAR.</p>\n        <p>If on July 18, 1993, the last day of the 30 day period, your medical restrictions keep you from rotating within a scheduled departure group, SERVISTAR will accommodate you by offering work in the warehouse.

Champagne sued his former employer Servistar Corporation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213.  Champagne, a truck driver, alleged that Servistar unlawfully terminated his employment because he was disabled.  His disability, he said, was that he suffered from emotional disorders which required him to drive only familiar routes, avoid high bridges, and not rotate truck routes as did other Servistar drivers.  Champagne also alleged that his termination was in retaliation for his filing disability discrimination charges and that Servistar threatened to withdraw the workplace accommodation it had earlier given him.  The district court rejected these claims in a carefully reasoned opinion granting summary judgment.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* As summary judgment has been granted, we review the facts in the light most favorable to Champagne and will draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.  See Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197175\"><a href=\"/opinion/197175/soileau-v-guilford-of-me/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1997).  Because the issue of causation as to the termination of Champagne's employment is largely dispositive of the case, we focus particularly on those facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar is a cooperative engaged in the distribution of hardware, lumber, and building materials to approximately 3,700 owner-member stores nationwide.  In June 1974, Servistar hired Champagne as a truck driver at its Westfield, Massachusetts distribution center (\"Westfield terminal\").  Champagne, one of approximately twenty regular truck drivers at the Westfield terminal, operated a tractor-trailer and delivered merchandise to stores throughout New England and eastern New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Champagne's hiring, Servistar had a long-standing policy of requiring drivers to rotate their routes on a periodic basis.  The object of this policy was to better monitor driver productivity by comparing different drivers on the same route, obtain better feedback on customers' needs by gaining the perspective of numerous drivers, and equalize pay, work load, and overall driver responsibilities.  Champagne, like all Servistar drivers, was subject to this policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1980's, Champagne began to develop emotional problems which increasingly interfered with his ability to rotate routes.  These problems included general anxiety, feelings of despair, suicidal tendencies, and a specific phobia of crossing bridges.  Champagne told his psychiatrist, Dr. Carl Saviano, that he sought to avoid bridges with which he was unfamiliar or thought unsafe (Champagne especially feared high bridges with low railings) for fear that he would commit suicide by driving off the bridge.  Champagne did not inform Servistar of his condition.  In 1988, Champagne asked his supervisor at the Westfield terminal to exempt him from route-rotation and to allow him to drive a set route.  Champagne's supervisor granted this request.  In 1990, Champagne fell into a major depression and was hospitalized for two weeks in the psychiatric unit at the Cooley-Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When other drivers at the Westfield terminal began to complain about Champagne's exemption from the route rotation system, Servistar's Vice President of Human Resources, Russell Thomas, asked Champagne to supply a medical reason for driving a set route.  In November 1990, Champagne produced a note from Dr. Saviano stating:  \"It is most important for Mr. Champagne's health that he have very regular work hours and a very regular, predictable schedule.\"   Because the note did not explain the nature of Champagne's problems, Thomas called Dr. Saviano for further explanation.  Dr. Saviano did not reveal Champagne's condition, but simply repeated that it would be in Champagne's best interest for him to continue driving the set route.  On this advice, Thomas asked Champagne's supervisor to leave Champagne on the set route, and the supervisor agreed.  Champagne continued to work without incident.  Indeed, Champagne's evaluations for 1991 through 1993 show that his performance was exemplary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-1992, Servistar made managerial changes affecting the Westfield terminal.  Phil Hammonds became the new warehouse manager at the Westfield terminal, thus becoming Champagne's new supervisor, and Tom Brennan became Servistar's new Vice President of Operations.  Hammonds discovered that drivers at the Westfield terminal were switching routes on their own initiative and that three drivers, including Champagne, were driving set routes.  Hammonds, based on the medical information before him, did not believe that Champagne and the other individuals driving set routes suffered from medical disabilities preventing them from complying with the route-rotation requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1993, Brennan and Hammonds reinstated strict route rotation across the board at the Westfield terminal.  Routes were organized into groups of four or five routes and drivers were required to rotate within these groups.  On June 14, 1993, Champagne produced another short note from Dr. Saviano recommending that Champagne continue to drive a set route.  No explanation was given nor was a claim made that Champagne was disabled:  \"Mr. Champagne requires regular psychotherapy sessions.  It is essential that Mr. Champagne's treatment be augmented and supported by a very regular work schedule.\"   On June 17, 1993, Hammonds told Champagne by phone that Champagne would have to meet normal route-rotation requirements or go to work in the warehouse until he was able to do so.  On June 21, 1993, Hammonds sent written notice to all drivers on set routes, including Champagne, that Servistar expected them to drive according to rotating schedules and that, if they were unable to rotate routes within 30 days for medical reasons, they would, as an accommodation, be placed on light duty status and transferred to the warehouse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Transfer to the warehouse would have entailed a loss of pay for Champagne.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne regarded his regular route as an accommodation to his mental condition, and he believed that the notice from Servistar constituted a threatened withdrawal of reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA.  On July 15, 1993, Champagne filed a disability discrimination complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  He filed a civil action in Massachusetts state court seeking to enjoin Servistar from removing him from his regular route.  The state court granted a temporary restraining order against Servistar.  Servistar complied with the TRO and, before the hearing on a preliminary injunction, voluntarily agreed to leave Champagne on the set route pending receipt of more specific information on Champagne's condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne did not release his medical records to Servistar, apparently on the advice of his attorney.  Dr. Saviano, however, responded to Servistar's inquiries about Champagne's condition in a letter dated October 20, 1993.  Dr. Saviano informed Servistar that Champagne suffered from anxiety disorders caused by previous emotional injuries, and he reiterated his view that Champagne needed \"a fixed regular schedule in which he travels the same route, sees the same people and performs the same activities routinely.\"   Dr. Saviano said that such a schedule would permit Champagne to control his anxieties.  \"Even changes known well in advance could be very hurtful to his therapy and his well being.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, other events were unfolding.  In the fall of 1993, two items of information came to Hammonds' attention suggesting that at least some Servistar drivers were falsifying travel logs they are required to keep by the federal Department of Transportation (\"DOT\").  DOT regulations require interstate truckers to record their driving time, non-driving but on-duty time, and off-duty time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first item of information was that a Servistar truck had been observed parked on a residential street for a period of time.  Hammonds checked the logs, which indicated the driver had been on duty at the time the truck was parked on the street.  Hammonds prepared a recommendation to fire the driver, believing the facts indicated that the driver was basically \"stealing\" time, and therefore pay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  When Hammonds met with the driver, the driver indicated he had \"carried over\" time from the prior day in order to comply with DOT regulations, but that he put the time in.  Hammonds decided not to fire the driver, but still gave the driver a written reprimand for falsifying the logs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second item of information was the discovery that Champagne was making excessive use of the company telephone credit card that had been issued to him.  Servistar issues phone cards to all drivers and drivers are allowed one fifteen minute call per day. Supervisor Jim Atwater noticed that Champagne's phone bill for September 1993 listed more than sixty calls, some lasting more than an hour.  Atwater brought the phone bill to Hammonds' attention.  Hammonds decided to take no action against Champagne on the excessive phone use.  Hammonds also noticed that many of the calls had been made during the middle of the day when Champagne would ordinarily be driving.  Hammonds called the number from which Champagne had made these mid-day calls and learned that the source was a Holiday Inn in Ronkonkoma, New York.  Hammonds cross-checked the phone records against Champagne's logs.  He discovered that Champagne had recorded that he had been driving or was otherwise on-duty during those times when phone records showed he was making calls.  By recording more driving time than he had actually performed, Champagne had been paid money he was not properly owed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning this, Servistar consulted legal counsel and decided to audit the logs and phone records of all Westfield terminal drivers when the following month's phone records came in, as well as to audit drivers in other locations randomly.  Servistar realized that the phone card records gave it a way to test the accuracy of its drivers' logs.  The all-driver audit was conducted the following month, in November 1993, on the October 1993 phone bills.  It revealed that four drivers, including Champagne, had falsified their DOT logs by recording they were driving at times when phone records showed they were making calls.  Servistar did not take immediate action on these individuals, but decided to investigate further to see if a pattern existed.  Servistar reaudited the four drivers the following month and discovered that three of the drivers, including Champagne, had multiple violations during that month as well.  The fourth driver had only one violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar decided to terminate the employment of the three drivers who had multiple violations, including Champagne, and to give a written warning to the fourth driver.  Hammonds, Brennan and another supervisor met individually with each of the three drivers who were to be fired.  Each was given copies of records and shown the violations.  Champagne did not dispute the evidence.  In fact, Champagne said, he had been falsifying his DOT logs for twenty years and he did so because he did not want speeding violations showing in his logs.  Champagne said this was common practice among Servistar drivers and something Servistar itself knew about and encouraged.  On January 20, 1994, Servistar fired Champagne and the two other drivers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since these terminations, Servistar has continued to perform random cross-checks of drivers' logs against their phone bills.  In late 1994, Servistar discharged another driver for log violations.  In his twenty-five years with Servistar, Brennan has also terminated three other drivers for log violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne says that Servistar knew that its drivers routinely violated DOT log regulations, and that the use of such violations to terminate him masks Servistar's real intention to discriminate against him on account of his disability and retaliate for his filing a discrimination charge against the company.  Champagne's specific evidence on this point is discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1995, the EEOC issued Champagne a \"Right to Sue\" letter.  Champagne withdrew his state court action and, on February 21, 1995, filed this federal lawsuit.  Champagne alleged that Servistar discriminated against him because he was disabled in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a), that Servistar fired him in retaliation for his filing a discrimination charge in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(a), and that Servistar had threatened to withdraw his workplace accommodation in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(b).  Servistar counterclaimed for damages alleging breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud and deceit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar moved for summary judgment on Champagne's claims and its counterclaims.  The district court granted Servistar's motion as to Champagne's claims, holding that Champagne did not meet the statutory definition of disability, and that his evidence of retaliation or threat was insufficient to overcome Servistar's legitimate and nondiscriminatory explanation.  The district court denied summary judgment as to Servistar's counterclaims.  Champagne appeals the granting of summary judgment as to his three claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of our review over the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Servistar is de novo.  See Soileau, 105 F.3d at 14.   Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence shows \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne says he has suffered harm from two sources:  (1) the termination of his employment, which he says resulted from discrimination or retaliation or both, and (2) the memorandum notifying him he would have to return to rotating routes or work in the warehouse, which he says was a threat to withdraw the accommodation Servistar was obligated to grant him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Termination and Retaliation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first harm, the district court carefully parsed Champagne's discrimination and retaliation claims, and concluded that Champagne did not meet the statutory definition of disabled<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that his evidence of retaliation was insufficient.  We take a shorter route.  We have no doubt that Champagne suffered from a mental impairment, a first step toward establishing disability under the ADA.  But even if Champagne could establish he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA, his case on termination fails on the issue of causation.  Champagne has not produced evidence from which a finder of fact could reasonably find that Servistar \"discharged [him] in whole or in part because of [his] disability,\" Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Amego, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197290\"><a href=\"/opinion/197290/eeoc-v-amego-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span>, 141 n. 2 (1st Cir.1997),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> or that there was a \"causal connection between [his] discharge and the conduct\" of filing an ADA complaint.  Soileau, 105 F.3d at 16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Servistar has produced considerable proof that Champagne was dismissed because he falsified the DOT log books in violation of company policy and DOT regulations, and thereby obtained unearned pay.  This proof comes from Servistar's cross-referencing the phone records against DOT logs for all Westfield terminal drivers, not just Champagne.  This audit proved that three drivers, including Champagne, were falsifying their DOT logs on a regular basis.  Champagne does not challenge the accuracy of the telephone records demonstrating that Champagne was in the motel room making calls during times he was supposed to be driving, nor does he contest that he falsified his logs.  Servistar terminated all three who had multiple violations, not just Champagne.  Servistar has fired other drivers since that time for the same violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence meets Servistar's burden of articulating a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Champagne.  Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973), the burden shifts back to Champagne to show that Servistar's proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination based on disability, see Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 823-24 (1st Cir.1991), or for retaliation, see id. at 827-28.   To make this showing, \"[i]t is not enough for [Champagne] merely to impugn the veracity of [Servistar's] justification;  he must elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real motive.\"  Id. at 824 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne's response is twofold.  His first argument is that consideration of the larger context of events compels the conclusion that he was terminated because of discrimination or retaliation.  His second argument is that the alleged misconduct for which he was fired was something which all Servistar drivers did, not just Champagne.  As to context, Champagne notes that he was terminated only six months after he filed his discrimination complaint, despite years of good performance evaluations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, he says, the June 21 memo requiring all drivers to rotate routes, after Servistar had for years allowed him to drive a set route, shows discriminatory animus.  As to his misconduct, Champagne provided an affidavit from a fellow driver, Jerry Gilbert, that \"[t]he actions of Phillip Champagne of logging time which alleges drive time logged in longer than the time actually driven, was a common practice within the ranks of Servistar's truck drivers, and this fact was known by the supervisors of the truck drivers prior to Champagne's termination.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Gilbert affidavit is Champagne's strongest evidence, but it does not suffice, either alone or with the context evidence, to permit a reasonable inference that Champagne's firing was motivated by discrimination and retaliation.  Accepting as true that historically some Servistar drivers falsified logs, it is undisputed that the two new managers of the Westfield terminal decided to do something about the problem when it was brought to their attention.  The test these managers devised to determine if there had been falsification of records--comparing phone records with driving logs--was plainly neutral.  It is undisputed that this test was applied equally to everyone.  It is undisputed that the test turned up four offenders, including Champagne, that the employer applied the same test equally to each of these four for a second month to determine if there was a pattern, and that when the second test showed three of the four had repeatedly falsified their logs, including Champagne, they were treated equally:  each had his employment terminated.  And it is undisputed that Servistar has continued to cross-reference phone records against driving logs on a random basis and terminate those who the test shows falsified the log.  No inference of discrimination or retaliation may reasonably be drawn from these facts.  That others may have turned up clean on the test although they had falsified logs, or that others in the past had falsified logs but not been caught, adds nothing to Champagne's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  More specifically, Champagne produced no evidence that audits were conducted in the past or that the company retained drivers who were shown by an audit to have repeatedly falsified records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contextual evidence offered to show Servistar's motive to discriminate or retaliate against Champagne is also insufficient, and in any event cannot overcome the fact that Champagne was treated no differently than his fellow drivers.  Given the absence of differential treatment, the district court properly concluded that Champagne had failed to produce evidence of causation sufficient to survive summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Threatened withdrawal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champagne finally claims that Servistar unlawfully threatened his enjoyment of a reasonable accommodation under the ADA when he filed a disability discrimination charge with MCAD and EEOC on July 15, 1993.  The threat, he claims, came in the form of the June 21 memorandum.  That memo stated that Champagne, along with all others driving a set route, would be required to drive rotating routes thirty days from the date of the memo.  The memo explained:  \"[Y]ou must perform all the essential functions of your truck driving position.  Rotation of routes within a scheduled departure group is an essential function of the truck driver position at SERVISTAR.\"   The memo further explained that Champagne would be reassigned to light duty in the warehouse if \"medical restrictions keep you from rotation within a scheduled departure group....  This accommodation will continue until your medical condition permits you to perform the essential functions of truck driving.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evidence, Champagne's claim does not survive.  He relies on part of the ADA's anti-retaliation statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(b):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>It shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any individual in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his or her having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his or her having aided or encouraged any other individual in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected by this chapter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is doubtful Champagne has shown that he had \"exercised a right granted or protected by the ADA.\"  Before he filed his EEOC complaint, Champagne had not asserted he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA.  He certainly never provided Servistar with any medical evidence from which a conclusion of disability, as defined in the ADA, was warranted.  That Servistar voluntarily decided to permit Champagne to avoid route-rotation for a period of time does not establish that Champagne was disabled or that avoidance of route-rotation was a required reasonable accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, like the district court, we do not think the memorandum may be reasonably viewed as a threat or interference under &#167; 12203(b).  Under the ADA, Servistar has substantial leeway in defining the essential functions of its truck driving positions, and it may require its drivers to be able to perform those functions.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  It is true that other Servistar managers had not enforced the route-rotation policy strictly or cross-checked phone records against DOT logs in the past.  But that does not permit the conclusion that the decision by new managers to enforce company policy, and to audit for non-compliance, is a threat or interference with ADA rights.  We stress that the decision of new managers to enforce the policy was applied uniformly.  The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Servistar on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.
