Gary Johnson, who is currently serving a 37\r                           \r\n\nmonth sentence  in federal prison, appeals  from the district\r\n\ncourt's denial of his pro se  motion for  immediate release. \r\n\nFirst,  he argues  that  under  18  U.S.C.    3584(a),  which\r\n\nprovides in relevant part that terms of imprisonment \"may not\r\n\nrun consecutively for an attempt and for another offense that\r\n\nwas the sole  objective of  the attempt,\" he  is entitled  to\r\n\nimmediate release.  This argument  is based on the  erroneous\r\n\nassumption  that the  federal crime  of possessing  a firearm\r\n\nwith  an  obliterated serial  number and  the state  crime of\r\n\nrobbery   constitute \"an  attempt\" and \"another  offense that\r\n\nwas the  sole objective  of the  attempt\" under  the statute.\r\n\nHowever, these  are distinct  crimes for which  the sentences\r\n\nmay run consecutively.\r\n\n     Second, Johnson  argues that under 18  U.S.C.   3585(a),\r\n\nhis  federal  sentence began  to run  while  he was  in state\r\n\ncustody,  because that  statute  does not  specifically state\r\n\nthat  a  prisoner must  be in  federal  custody to  cause the\r                                                  \r\n\nsentence  to begin running.  This argument does not take into\r\n\naccount all of  the pertinent portions of the  statute, which\r\n\nprovides that \"[a] sentence  . . . commences on  the date the\r\n\ndefendant  is received  in custody  . .  . [at]  the official\r\n\ndetention facility  at which the  sentence is to  be served.\"\r\n\nBecause  the federal  government  never designated  the state\r\n\nprison as \"the  official detention facility\"  where Johnson's\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nfederal sentence  would be  served, his federal  sentence did\r\n\nnot begin to run until he reached the federal prison that was\r\n\ndesignated as his \"official detention facility.\"\r\n\n     Third, Johnson argues that under 18 U.S.C.  3585 (b)  he\r\n\nis  entitled to  have  the time  he  spent in  state  custody\r\n\ncredited toward his federal sentence.  The statue provides in\r\n\nrelevant part: \"A  defendant shall be given credit toward the\r\n\nservice  of a term of imprisonment for  any time he has spent\r\n\nin  official  detention  prior   to  the  date  the  sentence\r\n\ncommences  . . . that  has not been  credited against another\r\n\nsentence.\"   Crediting the time Johnson spent in state prison\r\n\nagainst  his federal  sentence would  be improper  under this\r\n\nstatute because Johnson's detention at the state facility was\r\n\ncredited against his state sentence.\r\n\n     Finally,  Johnson argues  that the  state court  had the\r\n\npower  to  order his  federal  and  state  sentences  to  run\r\n\nconcurrently.   However,  a state  court does  not have  this\r\n\npower  where, as  here, the  state sentence  is to  be served\r\n\nfirst.   Any  error that  occurred in  this case  occurred in\r\n\nstate court, while the federal court acted entirely properly;\r\n\nany  remedy  for  this  harm would  involve  Johnson's  state\r\n\nsentence  rather  than his  federal  sentence.   Johnson  has\r\n\nalready finished  serving his  state sentence.   We therefore\r\n\nsummarily  affirm   the  district  court's   order  and  deny\r\n\nappellant's motion for immediate release.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Affirmed. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                         \r\r\n",
