Robert M. Barry  appeals his sentence\r                                \r\n\nfor  bank robbery  in violation of  18 U.S.C.    2113(a).  He\r\n\nclaims that  the district  court erred  by considering  him a\r\n\ncareer offender pursuant to U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.  We disagree.1\r                                                                       1\r\n\n          Under   4B1.1, a career offender is one who \"has at\r\n\nleast  two prior  felony  convictions of  either  a crime  of\r\n\nviolence or a controlled substance offense.\"  These two prior\r\n\nconvictions  must be unrelated.   U.S.S.G.    4B1.2(3).   The\r\n\ncommentary to  the guidelines provides, in  part, that crimes\r\n\nare  \"related\" if they are part of a \"single common scheme or\r\n\nplan.\"   Id.   4A1.2, comment. (n.3).  Appellant alleges that\r                        \r\n\nhis two prior convictions  are part of a common  plan because\r\n\nthey were motivated by the  same goal -- the need  for arrest\r\n\nand punishment.\r\n\n          Both of these prior  offenses occurred in 1983, but\r\n\nthe  similarity between the crimes  ends there.  In September\r\n\n1984, appellant pleaded guilty to two counts of bank robbery;\r\n\nappellant committed both robberies  in Florida in March 1983.\r\n\nIn  January  1984,  appellant   pleaded  guilty  to   charges\r\n\nincluding assault and battery, assault with intent to murder,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Because  appellant  obviously  loses on  the  merits,  we\r               1\r\ndecline  to  address,   and  therefore  express   no  opinion\r\nconcerning, his  arguments (1) that the  district court erred\r\nby  not ruling  on his  motion objecting  to career  offender\r\nstatus and (2) that  the rule requiring the  sentencing court\r\nto  treat   as  unrelated   two  offenses  separated   by  an\r\nintervening  arrest is  inconsistent  with the  guideline for\r\ncomputing a defendant's criminal history score. \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\narmed  robbery,  and  rape.    These  crimes  took  place  in\r\n\nMassachusetts in  June  1983.   Ordinarily, crimes  involving\r\n\nseparate victims and occurring  at different places and times\r\n\nare not related  under U.S.S.G.    4A1.2, even where,  unlike\r\n\nhere, they  are the same type of crime.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nYeo,  936 F.2d  628,  629 (1st  Cir.  1991)(thefts of  rented\r               \r\n\nmachinery which took  place during a six-week time period are\r\n\nnot related,  when they involved different  victims, and took\r\n\nplace on different dates and in different places).\r\n\n          Nor does the allegation of a common goal, or motive\r\n\nmake the  two  prior felony  convictions  part of  a  \"single\r\n\ncommon scheme  or plan.\"   As the  Court of  Appeals for  the\r\n\nFourth  Circuit has  recognized, \"[s]hared  motivation cannot\r\n\ntransform two crimes committed three months apart, prosecuted\r\n\nin different jurisdictions,  and involving different victims,\r\n\ninto  one illicit act.\"   United States v.  Sanders, 954 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n227, 232  (4th Cir. 1992)(a robbery of a bank and a murder in\r\n\nthe  course of  a  different robbery  are  not \"related\"  for\r\n\npurposes of determining  defendant's career offender  status,\r\n\neven though  both crimes allegedly were  committed to sustain\r\n\ndefendant's  heroin addiction).
