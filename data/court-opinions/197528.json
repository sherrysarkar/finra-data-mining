They, along with two others, were charged\r\n\nwith conspiracy to  distribute and to possess  with intent to\r\n\ndistribute over five kilograms of cocaine in violation  of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.    846, and attempt to  distribute and to possess with\r\n\nintent  to distribute  over  five  kilograms  of  cocaine  in\r\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1).  Rogers and Beagan  both\r\n\nraise numerous  challenges to  their convictions.   The  most\r\n\nsubstantial of these  is Rogers' sufficiency of  the evidence\r\n\nclaim.    Beagan's  claims  revolve  around  his  defense  of\r\n\nentrapment.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          During  the Fall of 1994, members of the Providence\r\n\nPolice  Department  met  with Ronald  Rego,  an  informer, to\r\n\ndiscuss a drug sting.   Agreement was reached that Rego would\r\n\nreceive   10%  from  a drug  sting.   In  return, Rego  would\r\n\narrange a  meeting between  Detective Fred  Rocha and  Andrew\r\n\nBeagan,  a codefendant here.  Detective Rocha would arrange a\r\n\ncocaine  sale to  Beagan and arrest  him at  the time  of the\r\n\nsale.\r\n\n          On  November 16,  1994,  Rego  introduced Rocha  to\r\n\nBeagan.  The meeting was tape recorded.  Rocha claimed he was\r\n\na  large-scale cocaine  dealer and  Beagan  indicated he  was\r\n\ninterested  in  buying  as  much  as  25  kilograms.    Other\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ntelephone  conversations and  meetings  took  place in  early\r\n\nDecember.   Some of  these were recorded.   Rocha  and Beagan\r\n\nagreed on a December 12 sale date.\r\n\n          Beagan  and Rocha  met on  that day.   Beagan  told\r\n\nRocha that \"his people\" did not want to carry all their money\r\n\nat  once, so  Beagan and  Rocha agreed  they would  split the\r\n\ntransaction  into two parts.   Rocha  would first  deliver 10\r\n\nkilograms  of cocaine  and  Beagan would  pay.   If  Beagan's\r\n\npeople liked  the quality,  then the  remaining 15  kilograms\r\n\nwould be exchanged.\r\n\n          Beagan  and Rocha  worked out  the  details of  the\r\n\nexchange on  the telephone.   Rocha was to call  Beagan later\r\n\nthat day  to tell him where to bring  the \"drop car\" in which\r\n\nthe cocaine was to be loaded.   Rocha would then pick up  the\r\n\ndrop  car, load it with 10 kilograms of cocaine and drive the\r\n\ncar to an undisclosed location.  Beagan would meet Rocha at a\r\n\nthird location to show Rocha  the money for the 10 kilograms.\r\n\nOnce Rocha saw the money,  he would tell Beagan where  he had\r\n\nleft the  drop car.  Beagan's  people would pick up  the drop\r\n\ncar, and,  if they  were satisfied  with the  cocaine, Beagan\r\n\nwould release the money to  Rocha.  If Beagan's people wanted\r\n\nto buy the remaining  15 kilograms, they would have to  do so\r\n\nwithin the hour.\r\n\n          As  planned, Beagan called  Rocha to tell  him that\r\n\nthe drop car,  a white Taurus, was in  the University Heights\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nparking  lot in Providence.  Rocha and another police officer\r\n\npicked up the car, which had been rented by David Scialo (the\r\n\nthird codefendant in the case).  The rental agreement  listed\r\n\nRogers as the second driver.\r\n\n          The  police  officers   loaded  into  the   car  25\r\n\nkilograms of  oatmeal packaged  to look  like cocaine.   They\r\n\nmoved  the car  to  the  parking  lot  of  a  ball  field  in\r\n\nProvidence.   Rocha called Beagan  and told him to  bring the\r\n\nmoney  to the  India Point  Days Inn  in Providence.   Beagan\r\n\narrived at the  motel parking lot around 4  p.m., accompanied\r\n\nby the final  codefendant in the case, Ruben  DeLeon.  DeLeon\r\n\nwas carrying a  black bag.  Rocha saw  that the bag contained\r\n\nbundles of money.\r\n\n          Beagan  handed Rocha  a  cellular telephone  (which\r\n\nbelonged  to  Scialo)  so  that  Rocha  could  tell  Beagan's\r\n\nconfederate  at the  other end  of the  line where  the drugs\r\n\nwere.   However,  the line  went  dead.   Beagan plugged  the\r\n\ntelephone into  an outlet in  his car and the  telephone soon\r\n\nrang.  Beagan handed the phone  to Rocha, who told the caller\r\n\nthat the drop car was parked at the ball field parking lot at\r\n\nPower   Street  in  Providence.    Rocha  then  returned  the\r\n\ntelephone to  Beagan, who remained  on the line until  he was\r\n\narrested.\r\n\n          Officers who were stationed near the ball field saw\r\n\na green  Toyota pull  up next to  the drop  car.   Rogers was\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndriving; Scialo and  one other were passengers.   The car was\r\n\nrented to Scialo.   Scialo  got out of  the Toyota, into  the\r\n\ndrop  car and  began to  drive away,  following Rogers.   Two\r\n\nofficers saw that Rogers was  holding a cellular phone to his\r\n\near.   The  authorities  stopped the  two  cars and  arrested\r\n\nRogers and Scialo.1\r\n\n          Soon afterwards,  FBI agents and  Providence police\r\n\narrested  Beagan  and  DeLeon at  the  Days  Inn.   Telephone\r\n\nrecords established that  around 4 p.m.(the approximate  time\r\n\nthat Rocha spoke to Beagan's confederate on the telephone and\r\n\ntold him  where to find  the drop car), the  telephone Rogers\r\n\nwas holding was  used to twice call the  telephone Beagan was\r\n\nholding.\r\n\nProcedural History\r                              \r\n\n          The four codefendants -- Rogers, Beagan, Scialo and\r\n\nDeLeon --  were charged and  tried before  a jury on  the two\r\n\ndrug trafficking  counts.  At  the close of  the government's\r\n\ncase, Rogers moved for a judgment of acquittal as well as for\r\n\na  mistrial based on  an allegedly improper  statement by the\r\n\nprosecutor in his  opening.  The prosecutor had  said that he\r\n\nwould show that Rocha had  spoken on the telephone to someone\r\n\nnamed  Chuck during  the drug  deal.   No  such evidence  was\r\n\nadmitted at  trial.  The  district court denied  the motions,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  They also arrested  the other passenger in  the car, Juan\r\nToribio, but he later was released.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nstating  that defense counsel could argue in closing that the\r\n\ngovernment had failed to produce promised evidence.\r\n\n          After beginning  deliberations, the  jury requested\r\n\nthat the  court instruct  them once again  on the  meaning of\r\n\npredisposition.   The court did  so.  Beagan objected  to the\r\n\ninstruction,  asking  that   the  jurors  be  told   that  in\r\n\nconsidering  whether he was predisposed to commit the charged\r\n\ncrimes, they  might only consider  his behavior prior  to his\r\n\ncontact with the  government agents.   The court declined  to\r\n\ngive  the additional instruction.   The jury  returned to its\r\n\ndeliberations, and Beagan, Rogers and DeLeon2 were  convicted\r\n\non the two drug trafficking charges.  Scialo was acquitted.\r\n\n          Beagan and  Rogers moved for  a new trial,  each on\r\n\ndifferent  grounds.   Rogers  argued  that  the  verdict  was\r\n\nagainst the weight  of the evidence and that  there was newly\r\n\ndiscovered evidence, in the form of Scialo's testimony, which\r\n\nwould exculpate  Rogers.   The district  court ruled  against\r\n\nhim.\r\n\n          Beagan  moved for a  new trial on  several grounds,\r\n\nonly one  of which  warrants discussion:  his claim  of juror\r\n\nmisconduct.  Beagan  filed an affidavit from  Matthew Beagan,\r\n\nJr.,  his brother,  alleging that  after  the trial,  Matthew\r\n\nBeagan had spoken  to one of the jurors,  who stated that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  DeLeon  has petitioned for  habeas relief,  claiming that\r\nhis attorney failed to file and perfect his appeal.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\njury had  been very  confused about the  meaning of  the term\r\n\n\"predisposition\"  and that some  of the jurors  had consulted\r\n\ndictionaries.  The court called  in the juror to whom Matthew\r\n\nBeagan had spoken, as well as one other juror, and questioned\r\n\nthem regarding their  post-trial contact with  Matthew Beagan\r\n\nand the use of dictionaries  by jurors.  The questioning took\r\n\nplace  in the  presence of  counsel  for all  the parties  in\r\n\ninterest.    After  meticulous   inquiry,  the  court  denied\r\n\nBeagan's  motion for  a new  trial.   It found  that although\r\n\nthere had  been juror misconduct  in that at least  one juror\r\n\nhad  consulted a dictionary  on the term  predisposition, the\r\n\nconduct was  not prejudicial  to Beagan  because it  occurred\r\n\nprior  to  the  time the  jurors  requested  additional legal\r\n\ninstruction on the legal definition of the term.\r\n\n          Rogers was  sentenced to  78 months'  imprisonment.\r\n\nBeagan was  subject  to a  statutory minimum  of 240  months'\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\nRogers\r                  \r\n\n          Rogers'   primary   claim   is   that   there   was\r\n\ninsufficient   evidence  to  convict  him  on  the  two  drug\r\n\ntrafficking counts.  He argues  that he was merely present at\r\n\nthe scene of the crime and  that there is no evidence of  his\r\n\nactual involvement.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          The    case    against   Rogers    is    admittedly\r\n\ncircumstantial and requires  some inferences.  We  review the\r\n\nfacts in  the light  most favorable to  the verdict.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 778 (1st Cir. 1994).   Seen in\r                            \r\n\nthis light,  the evidence  is sufficient  to support  Rogers'\r\n\nconvictions on both counts.\r\n\n          It is true, as Rogers argues, that mere presence at\r\n\nthe scene  of a  crime is  insufficient  to establish  guilt.\r\n\nHowever, this court has distinguished between \"mere\" presence\r\n\nand \"culpable\" presence.   A defendant's presence  during the\r\n\ncommission  of  a   crime  can  establish  guilt   where  the\r\n\nsurrounding circumstances imply participation.  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Montilla-Rivera, 115  F.3d 1060,  1064  (1st Cir.  1997);\r                               \r\n\nUnited States  v. Paulino,  13 F.3d 20,  25 (1st  Cir. 1994);\r                                     \r\n\nUnited States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711-12 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                                  \r\n\nSuch is the case here.\r\n\n          It  was Rogers  who drove  Scialo  to the  baseball\r\n\nfield to  pick up  the drop  car and  who was  listed as  the\r\n\nsecond driver in  the rental agreement.   Most significantly,\r\n\nit was Rogers who was observed talking on a cellular phone in\r\n\nthe middle of the  drug deal.  Records place his  call to the\r\n\ncellular  phone Beagan  was  using.   Rogers  was not  merely\r\n\npresent, he was  talking on a cellular telephone  with one of\r\n\nthe  conspirators while  the deal  was in  progress.   A jury\r\n\ncould  reasonably find that Rogers was discussing the cocaine\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nsale, was a  knowing participant in the drug  conspiracy, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Piper, 35  F.3d 611,  615 (1st  Cir. 1994)\r                                    \r\n\n(defining  conspiracy),  and knowingly  attempted  to possess\r\n\ncocaine with  the intent  to distribute  it, see  Paulino, 13\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 25.3\r\n\n          Rogers' claim that he should be granted a new trial\r\n\nbecause  his   conviction  was  inconsistent   with  Scialo's\r\n\nacquittal also fails.   Rogers' argument essentially  is that\r\n\nthere  was more  evidence  of  Scialo's  involvement  in  the\r\n\nconspiracy than of his own,  and that the jury's acquittal of\r\n\nScialo  shows that there was insufficient evidence to convict\r\n\nRogers.  To the extent  that Rogers has preserved this claim,\r\n\nit is without merit.\r\n\n          A not guilty verdict  against one co-conspirator is\r\n\nnot  the  equivalent of  a  finding  that  the  evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient to sustain the conspiracy conviction of a second\r\n\nco-conspirator.   United States  v. Bucuvalas, 909  F.2d 593,\r                                                         \r\n\n595-97 (1st  Cir. 1990).   If the  reviewing court  finds the\r\n\nevidence  was sufficient to  support the verdict  against the\r\n\nconvicted defendant,  the conviction  must stand despite  the\r\n\nco-conspirator's   acquittal.     Id.     The  evidence   was\r                                                 \r\n\nsufficient.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

The  prosecutor  referred  to  someone\r\n\nidentified  as  Chuck  as being  on  the  telephone receiving\r\n\ninstructions from Rocha at the time of the drug deal (Rogers'\r\n\ngiven name  is Charles).   When  the prosecutor attempted  to\r\n\nelicit testimony from Rocha concerning that conversation, the\r\n\ncourt ruled the  evidence inadmissible.  Rogers  argues that,\r\n\ngiven the importance  of whether  he spoke  on the  telephone\r\n\nwith Rocha and Beagan during  the drug deal, the court should\r\n\nhave granted a mistrial.  We disagree.\r\n\n          Rocha   appropriately    has   not    claimed   the\r\n\nprosecutor's reference  during his opening statement was made\r\n\nin  bad faith  to  mislead  the jury.    In closing,  defense\r\n\ncounsel  argued that there was  no evidence linking Rogers to\r\n\nthe telephone  call during the  drug deal.  And  the district\r\n\ncourt  charged the jury  that statements by  counsel argument\r\n\nare not  evidence.  The district court did not err in denying\r\n\nthe motion for a mistrial.  See United States v. D'Alora, 585\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 16, 21  (1st Cir. 1978) (\"[A] defendant  is not entitled\r\n\nto  two  trials,   one  before  the   judge  to  filter   out\r\n\ninadmissible  evidence and  then a  jury  trial to  determine\r\n\nguilt or innocence.\")\r\n\n          Nor  did the court abuse its discretion in refusing\r\n\nto grant  Rogers' motion for  a severance.  Such  motions are\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nonly to  be granted  where the defendant  makes out  a strong\r\n\nshowing   of  prejudice;  a  defendant  is  not  entitled  to\r\n\nseverance  merely  because he  may  have a  better  chance of\r\n\nacquittal if tried separately.   Zafiro v. United States, 506\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 534, 540 (1993).  A  district court's decision to deny a\r\n\nmotion  for  severance  is  accorded  significant  deference.\r\n\nUnited States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                     \r\n\n          Rogers has not  presented any reason why  this case\r\n\nis  different from most  drug conspiracy cases  with multiple\r\n\ndefendants  involved in the  conspiracy to differing degrees,\r\n\nand  co-conspirators generally  are  tried together.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Perkins, 926  F.2d  1271, 1280  (1st  Cir. 1991).\r                               \r\n\nContrary to Rogers' claim, his  defense and Beagan's were not\r\n\nantagonistic,  merely different.   Beagan argued that  he was\r\n\nentrapped, Rogers  that he  was merely  present at the  crime\r\n\nscene.   These two theories  of the case are  not necessarily\r\n\ninconsistent.  The district court scrupulously instructed the\r\n\njurors that they must consider the evidence as to each charge\r\n\nand each defendant  separately.  The court did  not abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion in refusing to sever.\r\n\nBeagan\r                  \r\n\n          Beagan's sole defense at trial and focus on appeal4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Beagan's  only unrelated argument is that  a new trial is\r\nwarranted  because  the district  court never  instructed the\r\njury  to ignore  a drug  rally outside  the  courthouse. This\r\nissue has been  waived.  Beagan's counsel  requested that the\r\ncourt recess  until the  drug rally was  over, and  the court\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nwas  that he  was entrapped.   Beagan  first argues  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  instruction  on  entrapment  was   legally\r\n\nincorrect.  Specifically,  he argues that the  district court\r\n\nshould  have  instructed  the jury  that  the  government was\r\n\nrequired  to prove his  predisposition to commit  the charged\r\n\ncrime based on  evidence that predated  his contact with  the\r\n\ngovernment.  This is not a correct statement of the law.   It\r\n\nis  true  that,  when   a  defendant  raises  a  defense   of\r\n\nentrapment,  the government must show that he was predisposed\r\n\nto commit  the  charged  crime  prior  to  his  contact  with\r\n\ngovernment  agents;  however,  the  government  may  use  the\r\n\ndefendant's  behavior after  he was approached  by government\r\n\nagents as evidence of his predisposition prior to meeting the\r\n\nagents.  See, e.g., United States v. Acosta, 67 F.3d 334, 339\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          Beagan  next argues that  he is  entitled to  a new\r\n\ntrial because jurors impermissibly used extrinsic material (a\r\n\ndictionary)   to  understand   the   meaning  of   the   term\r\n\n\"predisposition.\"   Where,  as  here,  a  defendant  makes  a\r\n\ncolorable  claim of juror misconduct, the district court must\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nagreed.   No  request was  made  at the  time for  a specific\r\ncurative instruction.  Beagan cannot now claim he is entitled\r\nto  a  new   trial  because  he  did  not   receive  such  an\r\ninstruction.  United States v.  Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 123 (1st\r                                                 \r\nCir. 1987).   Furthermore, the court repeatedly  reminded the\r\njury to refrain  from considering anything heard  outside the\r\ncourtroom, which  likely made a specific curative instruction\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\ndetermine  whether any  misconduct has  occurred  and if  so,\r\n\nwhether it  was prejudicial.   United  States v.  Boylan, 898\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  230, 258  (1st  Cir.  1990).   We  review the  district\r\n\ncourt's refusal to grant a new trial for abuse of discretion.\r\n\nId. at 262; see also United States v. Cheyenne, 855 F.2d 566,\r                                                          \r\n\n568 (8th Cir.  1988) (giving \"substantial weight to the trial\r\n\ncourt's appraisal  of the  prejudicial effects  of extraneous\r\n\ninformation  on  the  jury, since  the  trial  judge  has the\r\n\nadvantages of close observation of the jurors and familiarity\r\n\nwith the issues at trial\").\r\n\n          Here,    Judge    Boyle   acted    carefully    and\r\n\nconscientiously in  response  to  the  allegations  of  juror\r\n\nmisconduct.  The court questioned the two jurors most closely\r\n\ninvolved.  It determined that although at least one juror had\r\n\nreferred  to  a  dictionary to  determine  the  definition of\r\n\npredisposition,  this occurred  before the  jury  as a  whole\r\n\nsought  additional instruction on  the legal  definition from\r\n\nthe court.  The court concluded that whatever use was made of\r\n\nthe dictionary,  the jurors  had been  unsatisfied that  they\r\n\nunderstood  the legal import  of the term  predisposition and\r\n\nhad properly  turned to  the court  for further  instruction.\r\n\nThe   court  concluded  that  any  misconduct  had  not  been\r\n\nprejudicial because of the court's  additional instruction on\r\n\nthe legal meaning of predisposition.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          There  was no abuse  of discretion.   To the extent\r\n\nthat the jurors'  consulting the dictionary was  misconduct,5\r\n\nwe agree with  the district court that any  potential harm to\r\n\nthe  defendant was cured by the subsequent legal instructions\r\n\non predisposition.\r\n\n          Beagan's  final  claim  is   that  he  was   denied\r\n\neffective  assistance of  counsel at  trial.   Trial  counsel\r\n\nintroduced  evidence concerning  Beagan's character,  opening\r\n\nthe door to  evidence of  Beagan's 1991  drug conviction  and\r\n\nthereby,  according  to   Beagan,  totally  undercutting  the\r\n\nentrapment defense.   In accordance with our  usual practice,\r\n\nwe  will not  consider a  claim  made for  the first  time on\r\n\ndirect appeal.  See, e.g., United States v. Springer, 28 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n236, 239 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058,\r                                                           \r\n\n1063  (1st Cir.  1993).   Determining  whether assistance  of\r\n\ncounsel  was  constitutionally   deficient  is  a  fact-bound\r\n\ninquiry  that would  require us  to go  beyond the  record on\r\n\nappeal and consider such matters as trial counsel's strategy.\r\n\nSee Springer, 28 F.3d at 239; Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063.\r                                              \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Courts that have considered the issue of juror dictionary\r\nuse have not generally considered such  use to be prejudicial\r\nper  se.  See,  e.g., United States v.  Turner, 936 F.2d 221,\r                                                          \r\n226-27 (6th Cir.  1991); United States v. Cheyenne,  855 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n566, 567-68 (8th Cir. 1988).  This circuit has not yet passed\r\non  the  issue  of  whether a  juror's  dictionary  use  even\r\nconstitutes misconduct, and we have no need to do so here.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n",

They, along with two others, were charged\r\n\nwith conspiracy to  distribute and to possess  with intent to\r\n\ndistribute over five kilograms of cocaine in violation  of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.    846, and attempt to  distribute and to possess with\r\n\nintent  to distribute  over  five  kilograms  of  cocaine  in\r\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1).  Rogers and Beagan  both\r\n\nraise numerous  challenges to  their convictions.   The  most\r\n\nsubstantial of these  is Rogers' sufficiency of  the evidence\r\n\nclaim.    Beagan's  claims  revolve  around  his  defense  of\r\n\nentrapment.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          During  the Fall of 1994, members of the Providence\r\n\nPolice  Department  met  with Ronald  Rego,  an  informer, to\r\n\ndiscuss a drug sting.   Agreement was reached that Rego would\r\n\nreceive   10%  from  a drug  sting.   In  return, Rego  would\r\n\narrange a  meeting between  Detective Fred  Rocha and  Andrew\r\n\nBeagan,  a codefendant here.  Detective Rocha would arrange a\r\n\ncocaine  sale to  Beagan and arrest  him at  the time  of the\r\n\nsale.\r\n\n          On  November 16,  1994,  Rego  introduced Rocha  to\r\n\nBeagan.  The meeting was tape recorded.  Rocha claimed he was\r\n\na  large-scale cocaine  dealer and  Beagan  indicated he  was\r\n\ninterested  in  buying  as  much  as  25  kilograms.    Other\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ntelephone  conversations and  meetings  took  place in  early\r\n\nDecember.   Some of  these were recorded.   Rocha  and Beagan\r\n\nagreed on a December 12 sale date.\r\n\n          Beagan  and Rocha  met on  that day.   Beagan  told\r\n\nRocha that \"his people\" did not want to carry all their money\r\n\nat  once, so  Beagan and  Rocha agreed  they would  split the\r\n\ntransaction  into two parts.   Rocha  would first  deliver 10\r\n\nkilograms  of cocaine  and  Beagan would  pay.   If  Beagan's\r\n\npeople liked  the quality,  then the  remaining 15  kilograms\r\n\nwould be exchanged.\r\n\n          Beagan  and Rocha  worked out  the  details of  the\r\n\nexchange on  the telephone.   Rocha was to call  Beagan later\r\n\nthat day  to tell him where to bring  the \"drop car\" in which\r\n\nthe cocaine was to be loaded.   Rocha would then pick up  the\r\n\ndrop  car, load it with 10 kilograms of cocaine and drive the\r\n\ncar to an undisclosed location.  Beagan would meet Rocha at a\r\n\nthird location to show Rocha  the money for the 10 kilograms.\r\n\nOnce Rocha saw the money,  he would tell Beagan where  he had\r\n\nleft the  drop car.  Beagan's  people would pick up  the drop\r\n\ncar, and,  if they  were satisfied  with the  cocaine, Beagan\r\n\nwould release the money to  Rocha.  If Beagan's people wanted\r\n\nto buy the remaining  15 kilograms, they would have to  do so\r\n\nwithin the hour.\r\n\n          As  planned, Beagan called  Rocha to tell  him that\r\n\nthe drop car,  a white Taurus, was in  the University Heights\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nparking  lot in Providence.  Rocha and another police officer\r\n\npicked up the car, which had been rented by David Scialo (the\r\n\nthird codefendant in the case).  The rental agreement  listed\r\n\nRogers as the second driver.\r\n\n          The  police  officers   loaded  into  the   car  25\r\n\nkilograms of  oatmeal packaged  to look  like cocaine.   They\r\n\nmoved  the car  to  the  parking  lot  of  a  ball  field  in\r\n\nProvidence.   Rocha called Beagan  and told him to  bring the\r\n\nmoney  to the  India Point  Days Inn  in Providence.   Beagan\r\n\narrived at the  motel parking lot around 4  p.m., accompanied\r\n\nby the final  codefendant in the case, Ruben  DeLeon.  DeLeon\r\n\nwas carrying a  black bag.  Rocha saw  that the bag contained\r\n\nbundles of money.\r\n\n          Beagan  handed Rocha  a  cellular telephone  (which\r\n\nbelonged  to  Scialo)  so  that  Rocha  could  tell  Beagan's\r\n\nconfederate  at the  other end  of the  line where  the drugs\r\n\nwere.   However,  the line  went  dead.   Beagan plugged  the\r\n\ntelephone into  an outlet in  his car and the  telephone soon\r\n\nrang.  Beagan handed the phone  to Rocha, who told the caller\r\n\nthat the drop car was parked at the ball field parking lot at\r\n\nPower   Street  in  Providence.    Rocha  then  returned  the\r\n\ntelephone to  Beagan, who remained  on the line until  he was\r\n\narrested.\r\n\n          Officers who were stationed near the ball field saw\r\n\na green  Toyota pull  up next to  the drop  car.   Rogers was\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndriving; Scialo and  one other were passengers.   The car was\r\n\nrented to Scialo.   Scialo  got out of  the Toyota, into  the\r\n\ndrop  car and  began to  drive away,  following Rogers.   Two\r\n\nofficers saw that Rogers was  holding a cellular phone to his\r\n\near.   The  authorities  stopped the  two  cars and  arrested\r\n\nRogers and Scialo.1\r\n\n          Soon afterwards,  FBI agents and  Providence police\r\n\narrested  Beagan  and  DeLeon at  the  Days  Inn.   Telephone\r\n\nrecords established that  around 4 p.m.(the approximate  time\r\n\nthat Rocha spoke to Beagan's confederate on the telephone and\r\n\ntold him  where to find  the drop car), the  telephone Rogers\r\n\nwas holding was  used to twice call the  telephone Beagan was\r\n\nholding.\r\n\nProcedural History\r                              \r\n\n          The four codefendants -- Rogers, Beagan, Scialo and\r\n\nDeLeon --  were charged and  tried before  a jury on  the two\r\n\ndrug trafficking  counts.  At  the close of  the government's\r\n\ncase, Rogers moved for a judgment of acquittal as well as for\r\n\na  mistrial based on  an allegedly improper  statement by the\r\n\nprosecutor in his  opening.  The prosecutor had  said that he\r\n\nwould show that Rocha had  spoken on the telephone to someone\r\n\nnamed  Chuck during  the drug  deal.   No  such evidence  was\r\n\nadmitted at  trial.  The  district court denied  the motions,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  They also arrested  the other passenger in  the car, Juan\r\nToribio, but he later was released.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nstating  that defense counsel could argue in closing that the\r\n\ngovernment had failed to produce promised evidence.\r\n\n          After beginning  deliberations, the  jury requested\r\n\nthat the  court instruct  them once again  on the  meaning of\r\n\npredisposition.   The court did  so.  Beagan objected  to the\r\n\ninstruction,  asking  that   the  jurors  be  told   that  in\r\n\nconsidering  whether he was predisposed to commit the charged\r\n\ncrimes, they  might only consider  his behavior prior  to his\r\n\ncontact with the  government agents.   The court declined  to\r\n\ngive  the additional instruction.   The jury  returned to its\r\n\ndeliberations, and Beagan, Rogers and DeLeon2 were  convicted\r\n\non the two drug trafficking charges.  Scialo was acquitted.\r\n\n          Beagan and  Rogers moved for  a new trial,  each on\r\n\ndifferent  grounds.   Rogers  argued  that  the  verdict  was\r\n\nagainst the weight  of the evidence and that  there was newly\r\n\ndiscovered evidence, in the form of Scialo's testimony, which\r\n\nwould exculpate  Rogers.   The district  court ruled  against\r\n\nhim.\r\n\n          Beagan  moved for a  new trial on  several grounds,\r\n\nonly one  of which  warrants discussion:  his claim  of juror\r\n\nmisconduct.  Beagan  filed an affidavit from  Matthew Beagan,\r\n\nJr.,  his brother,  alleging that  after  the trial,  Matthew\r\n\nBeagan had spoken  to one of the jurors,  who stated that the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  DeLeon  has petitioned for  habeas relief,  claiming that\r\nhis attorney failed to file and perfect his appeal.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\njury had  been very  confused about the  meaning of  the term\r\n\n\"predisposition\"  and that some  of the jurors  had consulted\r\n\ndictionaries.  The court called  in the juror to whom Matthew\r\n\nBeagan had spoken, as well as one other juror, and questioned\r\n\nthem regarding their  post-trial contact with  Matthew Beagan\r\n\nand the use of dictionaries  by jurors.  The questioning took\r\n\nplace  in the  presence of  counsel  for all  the parties  in\r\n\ninterest.    After  meticulous   inquiry,  the  court  denied\r\n\nBeagan's  motion for  a new  trial.   It found  that although\r\n\nthere had  been juror misconduct  in that at least  one juror\r\n\nhad  consulted a dictionary  on the term  predisposition, the\r\n\nconduct was  not prejudicial  to Beagan  because it  occurred\r\n\nprior  to  the  time the  jurors  requested  additional legal\r\n\ninstruction on the legal definition of the term.\r\n\n          Rogers was  sentenced to  78 months'  imprisonment.\r\n\nBeagan was  subject  to a  statutory minimum  of 240  months'\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\nRogers\r                  \r\n\n          Rogers'   primary   claim   is   that   there   was\r\n\ninsufficient   evidence  to  convict  him  on  the  two  drug\r\n\ntrafficking counts.  He argues  that he was merely present at\r\n\nthe scene of the crime and  that there is no evidence of  his\r\n\nactual involvement.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          The    case    against   Rogers    is    admittedly\r\n\ncircumstantial and requires  some inferences.

The  prosecutor  referred  to  someone\r\n\nidentified  as  Chuck  as being  on  the  telephone receiving\r\n\ninstructions from Rocha at the time of the drug deal (Rogers'\r\n\ngiven name  is Charles).   When  the prosecutor attempted  to\r\n\nelicit testimony from Rocha concerning that conversation, the\r\n\ncourt ruled the  evidence inadmissible.  Rogers  argues that,\r\n\ngiven the importance  of whether  he spoke  on the  telephone\r\n\nwith Rocha and Beagan during  the drug deal, the court should\r\n\nhave granted a mistrial.  We disagree.\r\n\n          Rocha   appropriately    has   not    claimed   the\r\n\nprosecutor's reference  during his opening statement was made\r\n\nin  bad faith  to  mislead  the jury.    In closing,  defense\r\n\ncounsel  argued that there was  no evidence linking Rogers to\r\n\nthe telephone  call during the  drug deal.  And  the district\r\n\ncourt  charged the jury  that statements by  counsel argument\r\n\nare not  evidence.  The district court did not err in denying\r\n\nthe motion for a mistrial.

Beagan argued that  he was\r\n\nentrapped, Rogers  that he  was merely  present at the  crime\r\n\nscene.   These two theories  of the case are  not necessarily\r\n\ninconsistent.  The district court scrupulously instructed the\r\n\njurors that they must consider the evidence as to each charge\r\n\nand each defendant  separately.  The court did  not abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion in refusing to sever.\r\n\nBeagan\r                  \r\n\n          Beagan's sole defense at trial and focus on appeal4\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Beagan's  only unrelated argument is that  a new trial is\r\nwarranted  because  the district  court never  instructed the\r\njury  to ignore  a drug  rally outside  the  courthouse. This\r\nissue has been  waived.  Beagan's counsel  requested that the\r\ncourt recess  until the  drug rally was  over, and  the court\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nwas  that he  was entrapped.   Beagan  first argues  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  instruction  on  entrapment  was   legally\r\n\nincorrect.  Specifically,  he argues that the  district court\r\n\nshould  have  instructed  the jury  that  the  government was\r\n\nrequired  to prove his  predisposition to commit  the charged\r\n\ncrime based on  evidence that predated  his contact with  the\r\n\ngovernment.  This is not a correct statement of the law.   It\r\n\nis  true  that,  when   a  defendant  raises  a  defense   of\r\n\nentrapment,  the government must show that he was predisposed\r\n\nto commit  the  charged  crime  prior  to  his  contact  with\r\n\ngovernment  agents;  however,  the  government  may  use  the\r\n\ndefendant's  behavior after  he was approached  by government\r\n\nagents as evidence of his predisposition prior to meeting the\r\n\nagents.

Acosta, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196327\"><a href=\"/opinion/196327/united-states-v-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          Beagan  next argues that  he is  entitled to  a new\r\n\ntrial because jurors impermissibly used extrinsic material (a\r\n\ndictionary)   to  understand   the   meaning  of   the   term\r\n\n\"predisposition.\"   Where,  as  here,  a  defendant  makes  a\r\n\ncolorable  claim of juror misconduct, the district court must\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nagreed.   No  request was  made  at the  time for  a specific\r\ncurative instruction.  Beagan cannot now claim he is entitled\r\nto  a  new   trial  because  he  did  not   receive  such  an\r\ninstruction.

The court questioned the two jurors most closely\r\n\ninvolved.  It determined that although at least one juror had\r\n\nreferred  to  a  dictionary to  determine  the  definition of\r\n\npredisposition,  this occurred  before the  jury  as a  whole\r\n\nsought  additional instruction on  the legal  definition from\r\n\nthe court.  The court concluded that whatever use was made of\r\n\nthe dictionary,  the jurors  had been  unsatisfied that  they\r\n\nunderstood  the legal import  of the term  predisposition and\r\n\nhad properly  turned to  the court  for further  instruction.\r\n\nThe   court  concluded  that  any  misconduct  had  not  been\r\n\nprejudicial because of the court's  additional instruction on\r\n\nthe legal meaning of predisposition.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          There  was no abuse  of discretion.   To the extent\r\n\nthat the jurors'  consulting the dictionary was  misconduct,5\r\n\nwe agree with  the district court that any  potential harm to\r\n\nthe  defendant was cured by the subsequent legal instructions\r\n\non predisposition.\r\n\n          Beagan's  final  claim  is   that  he  was   denied\r\n\neffective  assistance of  counsel at  trial.   Trial  counsel\r\n\nintroduced  evidence concerning  Beagan's character,  opening\r\n\nthe door to  evidence of  Beagan's 1991  drug conviction  and\r\n\nthereby,  according  to   Beagan,  totally  undercutting  the\r\n\nentrapment defense.   In accordance with our  usual practice,\r\n\nwe  will not  consider a  claim  made for  the first  time on\r\n\ndirect appeal.  See, e.g., United States v.
