Marine Mammal Protection Act\r          I.  Marine Mammal Protection Act\r\n\n          Strahan  contends  on  cross-appeal  that the  district\r\n\ncourt erred when it  determined that he could not bring a citizen\r\n\nsuit under  the provisions of  the Marine Mammal  Protection Act.\r\n\nSee 939 F.  Supp. at 975.   Defendants, on the other  hand, argue\r             \r\n\nthat the  district court,  having properly  found that  it lacked\r\n\njurisdiction under the  MMPA, erroneously entered a  remedy under\r\n\nthe MMPA  when it ordered the Commonwealth, in paragraph 2 of the\r\n\npreliminary injunction  order, to  apply for  an incidental  take\r\n\npermit pursuant to section 1387 of the MMPA and, in  paragraph 4,\r\n\nto convene a working group similar to those initiated pursuant to\r\n\nthe MMPA.   See id. at 990-91.   We find that  the district court\r                             \r\n\nproperly held  that it  lacked jurisdiction  under the  MMPA, and\r\n\ntherefore  its  remedy in  paragraph  2  based  on the  MMPA  was\r\n\nerroneous.  We find, however, that the remedy  in paragraph 4 was\r\n\nnot  ordered pursuant to the MMPA, but instead was intended to be\r\n\nmodelled  on  MMPA   working  groups  and,  therefore,   was  not\r\n\nerroneous.\r\n\n          The MMPA  does not  authorize citizen  suits against  a\r\n\nperson alleged to  be in violation  of the Act.   The Act  states\r\n\nthat, \"[e]xcept  as otherwise  provided in  this subchapter,  the\r\n\nSecretary shall enforce  the provisions of this  subchapter.\"  16\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nU.S.C.   1377.   The district court properly  recognized that the\r\n\nAct  does  not  authorize  the  federal  courts  to  enforce  its\r\n\nprovisions in the  type of suit brought  by Strahan.  See  939 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at  975.   In addition, the  court properly found  that the\r\n\nAdministrative Procedure  Act, 5 U.S.C.    701 et seq.,  does not\r                                                                \r\n\nauthorize suits  against state  officials.  See  939 F.  Supp. at\r                                                         \r\n\n975.  Based on these findings, the court correctly concluded that\r\n\nit did not have jurisdiction under the MMPA.\r\n\n          Seeking  a contrary  ruling, Strahan  relies solely  on\r\n\nKokechik Fisherman's  Association v.  Secretary of  Commerce, 839\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 795, 802 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  In that case, the court affirmed\r\n\na district court ruling that  an incidental take permit issued by\r\n\nthe Secretary of Commerce was contrary to the requirements of the\r\n\nMMPA.  Id.  The federal court had jurisdiction to hear the claims\r                    \r\n\npresented in Kokechik by virtue  of 16 U.S.C.   1374(d)(6), which\r                               \r\n\nauthorizes judicial  review  of the  terms  and conditions  of  a\r\n\npermit issued by  the Secretary.  See Kokechik,  839 F.2d at 797.\r                                                        \r\n\nThus, the case stands for the uncontroversial proposition that  a\r\n\ncitizen  can seek  review of  the Secretary's  actions under  the\r\n\nMMPA,  and  does  not  provide  authority  to  support  Strahan's\r\n\nposition that a private citizen  can seek an injunction against a\r\n\nstate official under the MMPA.\r\n\n          Defendants' argument  respecting the remedy  ordered in\r\n\nparagraph 2  has merit.   Defendants argue  that if  the district\r\n\ncourt  has no jurisdiction  under the MMPA,  it logically follows\r\n\nthat  the district  court may  not order  a remedy  that requires\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ncompliance  with provisions  of the  MMPA.   In paragraph  2, the\r\n\ndistrict  court ordered the Commonwealth officials to comply with\r\n\nthe terms  of the MMPA by applying  for an incidental take permit\r\n\npursuant to 16 U.S.C.   1387.   Except with respect to review  of\r\n\npermits actually  granted,  Congress vested  enforcement  of  the\r\n\nprovisions of the  MMPA in the Secretary of  Commerce, not in the\r\n\nfederal courts.    See  16  U.S.C.    1377.    Consequently,  the\r                                \r\n\ndistrict   court  lacked  the  jurisdiction  to  order  that  the\r\n\ndefendants comply with the MMPA.  We therefore vacate paragraph 2\r\n\nof the district court's preliminary injunction order.\r\n\n          We have considered the argument of the Conservation Law\r\n\nFoundation  that  the  cross-reference  provision,  cited by  the\r\n\ndistrict court,  effectively makes the  substantive provisions of\r\n\nthe MMPA part  of the ESA  for purposes of enforcement  through a\r\n\ncitizen's  suit.   Although  the  argument is  not  frivolous, on\r\n\nbalance  we think  that the  provision  does not  incorporate one\r\n\nstatute into the  other.  It merely prevents  anyone from arguing\r\n\nthat the less  restrictive requirements of one  statute supersede\r\n\nthe more restrictive requirements of the other.\r\n\n          On  the other hand,  the substantive provisions  of the\r\n\nMarine Mammal Protection  Act appear to be triggered  by the same\r\n\nactivities  that the  district court,  at  least for  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction purposes,  found to be a  taking.  To  the extent that\r\n\nthe  defendants  may fail  to  meet the  arguably  more stringent\r\n\nstandards of the  MMPA, the Secretary of Commerce  might conclude\r\n\nthat  it  was  improper  to  issue a  permit  under  the  ESA for\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nactivities  that  were  unlawful   under  another  statute   also\r\n\nadministered by the Secretary.  It is premature for this Court to\r\n\ndecide how the matter should be resolved if the Secretary  took a\r\n\ndifferent  view  and  issued  an  ESA  permit  while  ignoring  a\r\n\nviolation of the MMPA.\r\n\n          Finally,  defendants  contend that  the  district court\r\n\nlacked jurisdiction  under the  MMPA to order  the defendants  to\r\n\nform a working group modeled  on working groups required pursuant\r\n\nto the MMPA.  The district court's order was as follows:\r\n\n            Fourth, the Defendants will be ordered to\r\n            convene an Endangered Whale Working Group\r\n            and to engage  in substantive discussions\r\n            with     the     Plaintiff,     or    his\r\n            representative,  as  well as  with  other\r\n            interested       parties,       regarding\r\n            modifications of  fixed-fishing gear  and\r\n            other measures  to minimize  harm to  the\r\n            Northern Right whales.\r\n\n939 F. Supp. at 991.  We understand the district court here to be\r\n\nordering, under  its equitable  powers, a working  group that  is\r\n\nmerely  modelled  on   MMPA  working  groups  dedicated   to  the\r\n\npreservation of other marine mammals.  Nothing suggests that this\r\n\nportion of the district court's  order was issued pursuant to any\r\n\nauthority  other than its equitable  powers.  That  is, we do not\r\n\nread  this order  as emanating  from the  provisions of  the MMPA\r\n\nitself,  but rather from  the court's inherent  powers to fashion\r\n\nappropriate  equitable  relief.    See  discussion  of  equitable\r                                                \r\n\npowers, infra at 34.  Thus, we find no abuse in this exercise  of\r                       \r\n\ndiscretion and we do not find any error.\r\n\nII.  Endangered Species Act\r          II.

See 16  U.S.C.   1531.  The ESA\r                                               \r\n\nis  \"the most comprehensive  legislation for the  preservation of\r\n\nendangered species ever enacted by any nation.\"  TVA v.

The Act empowers the Secretary of Commerce\r\n\nto recommend to the Secretary  of the Interior that a species  be\r\n\nlisted as endangered or threatened and that the species'  habitat\r\n\nbe  listed as  a critical  habitat.   See    1533(a)(2)(A).   The\r                                                   \r\n\nSecretary of  the Interior, if  he concurs,  shall implement  the\r\n\ndesignation.  See    1533(a)(3)(A).  The Act further requires the\r                           \r\n\nSecretary to develop and implement plans for the conservation and\r\n\nsurvival of an endangered or  threatened species.  See   1533(f).\r                                                                \r\n\nThe Northern Right whale  has been listed as  endangered pursuant\r\n\nto the ESA.

In addition, the  ESA makes it unlawful for any\r\n\nperson \"to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause\r\n\nto be committed, any offense defined\" in the ESA.  See   1538(g).\r                                                                \r\n\nThe term  \"'take' means  to harass,  harm,  pursue, hunt,  shoot,\r\n\nwound, kill, trap,  capture, or collect, or to  attempt to engage\r\n\nin any such conduct.\"     1532(19).  \"'Take' is defined .  . . in\r\n\nthe broadest possible manner to  include every conceivable way in\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nwhich a  person can  'take'  or attempt  to  'take' any  fish  or\r\n\nwildlife.\"  S.

See  ESA, 16 U.S.C.\r                                                           \r\n\n   1532(15),  1540; MMPA, 16 U.S.C.    1362(12), 1377; Incidental\r\n\nTake of Endangered, Threatened and Other Depleted Marine Mammals,\r\n\n54  Fed. Reg.  40,338 (1989).   Under the  ESA, the  Secretary of\r\n\nCommerce, acting  through the NMFS,  may permit the taking  of an\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nendangered species if that taking  is \"incidental to, and not the\r\n\npurpose of,  the carrying out  of an otherwise  lawful activity.\"\r\n\n  1539(a)(1)(B).   Pursuant to  an application for  an incidental\r\n\ntake  permit,  an  applicant  must  submit  a  conservation  plan\r\n\ndiscussing the  impact of the  incidental takings, the  steps the\r\n\napplicant will take to minimize the  impact, and the alternatives\r\n\nconsidered  with  reasons  why  the  alternatives  would  not  be\r\n\nimplemented.  See   1539(2)(A).\r                           \r\n\n          On  August 31, 1995, the NMFS implemented a prohibition\r\n\non any taking of a  Northern Right whale incidental to commercial\r\n\nfishing  operations.    See Taking  of  Threatened  or Endangered\r                                     \r\n\nMarine  Mammals  Incidental  to  Commercial  Fishing  Operations;\r\n\nInterim Permit, 60  Fed. Reg. 45,399 (NMFS) (Aug. 31,  1995).  In\r\n\naddition,  the  NMFS  recently implemented  a  ban  on approaches\r\n\nwithin 500 yards of a Northern  Right whale.  See North  Atlantic\r                                                           \r\n\nNorthern Right Whale Protection; Interim Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg.\r\n\n21562  (Apr. 25,  1997).   This  restriction  brings the  federal\r\n\napproach  distance  in  line  with  the  Massachusetts  500  yard\r\n\napproach prohibition.  See 322 Code Mass. Reg.   12.05.\r                                    \r\n\n          Furthermore,  the NMFS  has  proposed an  interim final\r\n\nrule, modifying  50 C.F.R.  pt. 229 and  set to  become effective\r\n\nNovember 15, 1997,  62  Fed.

These  proposed\r                                      \r\n\nrestrictions, however, do not impact on  the district court's and\r\n\nthis court's consideration of whether  Massachusetts, through its\r\n\nfishing licensure scheme, has violated the provisions of the ESA.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n          B.  Legal challenges\r                    B.  Legal challenges\r\n\n          The  district   court's  reasoning,  in   finding  that\r\n\nMassachusetts'  commercial   fishing  regulatory   scheme  likely\r\n\nexacted  a taking  in violation  of the  ESA, was founded  on two\r\n\nprovisions of the ESA read in conjunction.   The first relates to\r\n\nthe definition  of the prohibited  activity of a \"taking,\"  see  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1538(a)(1)(B),  and the  second relates  to  the solicitation  or\r\n\ncausation  by a third  party of a prohibited  activity, such as a\r\n\ntaking,  see     1538(g).    The  district  court  viewed   these\r                      \r\n\nprovisions, when read together, to apply to acts by third parties\r\n\nthat allow  or authorize acts  that exact a taking  and that, but\r\n\nfor the  permitting process, could  not take place.   Indeed, the\r\n\ndistrict  court cited several  opinions that  have also  so held.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Sierra Club v.

We  believe\r\n\nthat,  contrary  to  the  defendants'  argument  on  appeal,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  properly found  that a  governmental third  party\r\n\npursuant to whose authority an  actor directly exacts a taking of\r\n\nan  endangered  species  may  be  deemed  to  have  violated  the\r\n\nprovisions of the ESA.\r\n\n          The  defendants argue that the statute was not intended\r\n\nto prohibit state licensure activity because such activity cannot\r\n\nbe a \"proximate cause\" of the taking.  The defendants  direct our\r\n\nattention  to  long-standing  principles of  common  law  tort in\r\n\narguing  that  the  district  court  improperly  found  that  its\r\n\nregulatory    scheme   \"indirectly    causes\"   these    takings.\r\n\nSpecifically,  the defendants contend that to construe the proper\r\n\nmeaning  of \"cause\"  under the  ESA,  this court  should look  to\r\n\ncommon  law  principles  of causation  and  further  contend that\r\n\nproximate cause is lacking here.  The defendants are correct that\r\n\nwhen  interpreting a  term in  a statute  which is,  like \"cause\"\r\n\nhere, well-known  to the common law, the court is to presume that\r\n\nCongress intended the meaning to  be interpreted as in the common\r\n\nlaw.  See Veiga v. McGee, 26 F.3d 1206, 1210 (1st Cir. 1994).  We\r                                  \r\n\ndo not believe,  however, that an interpretation  of \"cause\" that\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nincludes the \"indirect causation\" of a taking by the Commonwealth\r\n\nthrough its licensing scheme falls without the normal boundaries.\r\n\n          The  defendants  protest  this interpretation.    Their\r\n\nfirst   argument  is  that  the  Commonwealth's  licensure  of  a\r\n\ngenerally permitted activity does  not cause the taking  any more\r\n\nthan  its licensure of automobiles and drivers solicits or causes\r\n\nfederal  crimes, even though  automobiles it licenses  are surely\r\n\nused to  violate federal drug laws, rob  federally insured banks,\r\n\nor  cross state  lines for  the  purpose of  violating state  and\r\n\nfederal laws.  The answer to this argument is that, whereas it is\r\n\npossible for a person licensed by Massachusetts to use a car in a\r\n\nmanner that does not risk the violations of federal law suggested\r\n\nby the defendants,  it is not possible for  a licensed commercial\r\n\nfishing  operation to  use its  gillnets or  lobster pots  in the\r\n\nmanner  permitted by the  Commonwealth without risk  of violating\r\n\nthe  ESA by exacting  a taking.   Thus, the state's  licensure of\r\n\ngillnet and lobster pot fishing does not involve the  intervening\r\n\nindependent  actor that  is a  necessary component  of the  other\r\n\nlicensure  schemes which  it  argues are  comparable.   Where the\r\n\nstate has licensed  an automobile driver  to use that  automobile\r\n\nand  her license  in  a  manner consistent  with  both state  and\r\n\nfederal  law, the  violation of  federal  is caused  only by  the\r\n\nactor's conscious  and independent  decision to  disregard or  go\r\n\nbeyond the licensed purposes of her automobile use and instead to\r\n\nviolate  federal, and  possibly  state, law.    The situation  is\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nsimply not  the same  here.   In  this  instance, the  state  has\r\n\nlicensed  commercial  fishing  operations  to  use  gillnets  and\r\n\nlobster pots in specifically the  manner that is likely to result\r\n\nin  a  violation of  federal  law.    The causation  here,  while\r\n\nindirect, is not so removed that it  extends outside the realm of\r\n\ncausation as it is understood in the common law.1\r\n\n          The defendants'  next  argument  need  only  detain  us\r\n\nmomentarily.   They contend that  the statutory structure  of the\r\n\nESA does not envision utilizing the regulatory structures of  the\r\n\nstates in order to implement  its provisions, but that it instead\r\n\nleaves that implementing  authority to NMFS.  The  point that the\r\n\ndefendants  miss is  that the  district court's  ruling  does not\r\n\nimpose positive obligations on the Commonwealth by converting its\r\n\nregulation of  commercial fishing operations  into a tool  of the\r\n\nfederal ESA regulatory  scheme.   The Commonwealth  is not  being\r\n\ncompelled to  enforce the  provisions of the  ESA.   Instead, the\r\n\ndistrict  court's   ruling  seeks   to  end   the  Commonwealth's\r\n\ncontinuing violation of the Act.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   The defendants' citation to cases  in which courts refused to\r\nimpose  liability  for  a  state's  exercise  of  its  regulatory\r\nactivity is misplaced.   In Haddock v. Board  of Dental Examiners\r                                                                           \r\nof California,  777 F.2d 462,  463 (9th Cir. 1985),  for example,\r                       \r\nthe  relevant  statute applied  only to  \"employers,\" \"employment\r\nagencies,\"  and \"labor organizations,\"  and the state's  Board of\r\nDental Examiners clearly  did not fall  within the definition  of\r\nthose  terms.   Under the ESA's  definition of a  \"person\" who is\r\nprohibited  from  exacting  a taking,  the  Commonwealth  just as\r\nclearly falls within the definition.\r\n\n2   We note that the defendants'  concerns about the authority of\r\nthe district court  to force the Commonwealth to  ban gillnet and\r\nlobster pot fishing where the federal administering agency, NMFS,\r\nhas chosen not  to do so are  misplaced.  Had the  district court\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n          Defendants  also  contend  that  the  district  court's\r\n\nruling is  erroneous because  it fails to  give deference  to the\r\n\nposition  of NMFS, the federal  agency charged with enforcing the\r\n\nESA.  The defendants' position is flawed for two reasons.  First,\r\n\nthe   ESA  gives  NMFS,  through  the  Secretary,  discretion  in\r\n\nauthorizing takings  incidental to  certain commercial  activity;\r\n\nthe  Act does not give a federal  court, having determined that a\r\n\ntaking has occurred,  the same discretion in  determining whether\r\n\nto  grant injunctive  relief.   Second,  the fact  that NMFS  has\r\n\nexpressly declined to ban gillnet  or lobster pot fishing in Cape\r\n\nCod Bay does not reflect a policy determination by NMFS that such\r\n\na  ban is  unnecessary.    For these  two  reasons, we  find  the\r\n\ndefendants' deference arguments without merit.\r\n\n          C.  Factual challenges\r                    C.  Factual challenges\r\n\n          We review  the district  court's findings  of fact  for\r\n\nclear error.   See Concordia Co. v.  Panek, 115 F.3d 67,  69 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir.  1997).   The district  court found  that entanglement  with\r\n\nfishing gear in  Massachusetts waters caused  injury or death  to\r\n\nNorthern  Right whales.   See 939 F.  Supp. at 984.   Indeed, the\r                                       \r\n\ndistrict court cited  several of the Commonwealth's  documents in\r\n\nsupport  of this finding,  including its statement  that \"'[f]ive\r\n\nright whales have  been found entangled in fixed  fishing gear in\r\n\nMassachusetts  waters; three  in  gillnets  and  two  in  lobster\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nactually  ordered such a  ban, we might  consider these concerns,\r\nbut  indeed the district court  has not required the Commonwealth\r\nin its injunction to impose such a ban.  The situation complained\r\nof by the defendants is simply not before us.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nlines.'\"  Id.  (quoting Right Whales in  Massachusetts Waters, An\r                       \r\n\nExecutive Summary at  2).  The court further  cited to affidavits\r\n\nof  three scientists that suggested that entanglement of Northern\r\n\nRight whales  had harmed, injured,  or killed those whales.   The\r\n\ncourt cited eleven occasions  on which Northern Right whales  had\r\n\nbeen  found entangled  in fishing  gear  in Massachusetts  waters\r\n\nbetween 1978 and 1995.   The court also  indicated that at  least\r\n\nfifty-seven  percent  of  all Northern  right  whales  have scars\r\n\nindicating prior entanglement  with fishing gear and  noted that,\r\n\neven where the whale survives,  the entanglement still wounds the\r\n\nwhale.   Although these findings indicate only that entanglements\r\n\nhave  occurred  in  Massachusetts  waters,  the   district  court\r\n\ndetermined  that three whales  had been  found entangled  in gear\r\n\ndeployed in Massachusetts waters.\r\n\n          The defendants contend that the factual evidence before\r\n\nthe   district  court  did   not  support  a   finding  that  the\r\n\nCommonwealth  has perpetrated  a taking.    The defendants'  main\r\n\ncontention   is  that  the  \"District  Court  made  its  'taking'\r\n\ndetermination  . .  . based  on speculation  that Northern  Right\r\n\nwhales have  become entangled in  fishing gear:  (1)  deployed in\r\n\nMassachusetts   coastal   waters;  and   (2)   licensed  by   the\r\n\nCommonwealth.\"   Appellants'  Br. at  42.   The defendants  first\r\n\nstate that they  submitted affidavit evidence indicating  that no\r\n\ndeaths of  Northern Right  whales had  occurred in  Massachusetts\r\n\ncoastal waters.  While this may be true, it answers only half the\r\n\ntaking  question,  which bars  not  only  killings of,  but  also\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\ninjuries to, Northern  Right whales.  Because  the district court\r\n\nneed  not  have  made  a  determination as  to  whale  deaths  in\r\n\ndetermining whether the Commonwealth exacted a taking, we find no\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          The defendants  acknowledge  that  the  district  court\r\n\nrelied on a  scientist's affidavit  that was  supplied by  amicus\r\n\ncuriae  Conservation Law  Foundation.    The  defendants  do  not\r\n\nchallenge  the factual  statements  asserted  in  the  affidavit,\r\n\nincluding the one relied upon by the district court that \"[t]hree\r\n\nof the entanglements of endangered  whales . . . clearly involved\r\n\nfishing gear that was deployed in Massachusetts waters.\"  Despite\r\n\nthe defendants' protests  that the district court was engaging in\r\n\nspeculation  when it found  that whales have  become entangled in\r\n\nfishing  gear  deployed  in Commonwealth's  waters,  in  fact the\r\n\ndistrict  court relied on  the unchallenged factual  assertion in\r\n\nthe  scientific affidavit.  Thus, the defendants' first challenge\r\n\nto the district court's fact-finding speculation is not valid.\r\n\n          With respect to the district court's determination that\r\n\nthese  entanglements involved gear  licensed by the Commonwealth,\r\n\nthe district  court relied on  the affidavit regarding  the three\r\n\nentanglements   that  occurred  in  Massachusetts  waters.    The\r\n\naffidavit explained that the whales were found  entangled in gear\r\n\n\"fixed\"  in Massachusetts  waters such  that the whale  could not\r\n\nescape because it could not break free of the gear.  The district\r\n\ncourt's inference  that gear  fixed in  Massachusetts waters  was\r\n\nlicensed  by  the Commonwealth,  and  was  not set  illegally  or\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nbrought into Massachusetts waters from another area by the whale,\r\n\nwas reasonable and we find no clear error in that inference.\r\n\n          The  defendants next  contend that  the district  court\r\n\nignored  evidence  of   the  significant  efforts  made   by  the\r\n\nCommonwealth  to \"minimize Northern  Right Whale entanglements in\r\n\nfishing  gear,\"  and  evidence  of  other causes  of  takings  of\r\n\nNorthern  Right whales.   With  respect  to the  determination of\r\n\nwhether a taking  has occurred, the district  court quite rightly\r\n\ndisregarded such evidence.   Given that  there was evidence  that\r\n\nany entanglement with fishing gear injures a Northern Right whale\r\n\nand given that a single injury to one whale is a taking under the\r\n\nESA, efforts to  minimize such entanglements are irrelevant.  For\r\n\nthe same reasons,  the existence of other means  by which takings\r\n\nof Northern Right whales occur is irrelevant to the determination\r\n\nof whether the Commonwealth has engaged in a taking.\r\n\n          Finding  neither any error  of law nor  any clear error\r\n\nwith  respect  to  the  factual findings,  we  believe  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court properly  applied the ESA  to the facts  presented\r\n\nand was  correct in enjoining  the Commonwealth so as  to prevent\r\n\nthe taking of Northern Right whales in violation of the ESA.\r\n\nIII.  Scope of injunctive relief\r          III.  Scope of injunctive relief\r\n\n          Defendants claim  that the injunctive relief granted by\r\n\nthe district court goes beyond the scope of remedies available in\r\n\nan  action against  state  officials.   Specifically,  defendants\r\n\nclaim that,  although the  district court could  have ordered  an\r\n\ninjunction barring all Commonwealth licensing activity,  it could\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nnot  require the Commonwealth  to implement measures  designed to\r\n\naccord  Northern  Right  whales  greater  regulatory  protection.\r\n\nDefendants  argue   that  the  statutory  scheme,   the  Eleventh\r\n\nAmendment, and the Tenth Amendment  all bar the measures  ordered\r\n\nby the district court.\r\n\n          A.  Statutory scheme/Eleventh Amendment\r                    A.  Statutory scheme/Eleventh Amendment\r\n\n          The ESA's citizen suit provisions authorize\r\n\n            any person  [to] commence a civil suit on\r\n            his  own  behalf--   (a)  to  enjoin  any\r\n            person, including  the United  States and\r\n            any other governmental instrumentality or\r\n            agency  (to the  extent permitted  by the\r\n            eleventh amendment to  the Constitution),\r\n            who  is alleged to be in violation of any\r\n            provision of  this chapter  or regulation\r\n            issued under the authority thereof .  . .\r\n            .\r\n\n16 U.S.C.   1540(g)(1).  The very fact  that Congress has limited\r\n\nits  authorization to  suits allowed  by  the Eleventh  Amendment\r\n\nreinforces the conclusion that Congress clearly envisioned that a\r\n\ncitizen could seek  an injunction against a state's violations of\r\n\nthe ESA.  Defendants' claim  that the district court exceeded its\r\n\nauthority  to order  injunctive relief  against  the Commonwealth\r\n\nunder  the  ESA statutory  scheme is  ultimately grounded  in the\r\n\nlimitations provided under the Eleventh Amendment.\r\n\n          The Eleventh Amendment provides:\r\n\n            The Judicial power  of the United  States\r\n            shall not  be construed to extend  to any\r\n            suit  in  law  or  equity,  commenced  or\r\n            prosecuted  against  one  of  the  United\r\n            States by the Citizens of another  State,\r\n            or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\r\n            State.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nU.S. Const.  amend.

They  suggest\r\n\nthat  Congress did  not  intend to  preempt  state regulation  of\r\n\ncommercial fishing when  it enacted the ESA, and  also claim that\r\n\nthe  district court's interpretation of  the ESA works to preempt\r\n\nstate authority to regulate in the area of commercial fishing.\r\n\n          The Tenth Amendment provides:\r\n\n            The powers  not delegated  to the  United\r\n            States   by    the   Constitution,    nor\r\n            prohibited  by  it  to  the  States,  are\r\n            reserved to  the States  respectively, or\r\n            to the people.\r\n\nU.S. Const.  amend.

Nor  do  they contend  that  the\r\n\nCommonwealth's commercial fishing regulations, to the extent that\r\n\nthey   may  conflict  with  the  ESA,  survive  Supremacy  Clause\r\n\nanalysis.   Instead,  the defendants  contend  that the  district\r\n\ncourt, having  found that  the  Commonwealth's regulatory  scheme\r\n\nlikely violates  the ESA,  lacks the authority  to order  them to\r\n\nform a working group and engage in substantive discussions toward\r\n\nrectifying their  statutory violation with working  group members\r\n\nwhose  membership is directed  ultimately by the  district court.\r\n\nThe defendants reason that the district court, through its order,\r\n\nhas   \"commandee[red]   the   [regulatory]   processes   of   the\r\n\n[Commonwealth] by directly compelling [it] to enact and enforce a\r\n\nfederal regulatory program,\" New York v.

The  defendants' proposition ignores\r\nthe  clear  language  of the  statute,  which  explicitly defines\r\npersons who are  prohibited from engaging in a  taking to include\r\nthe states and state officials.  See 16 U.S.C.   1532(13).\r                                              \r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\n144,  161 (1992), and  thereby oversteps the  delicate federalism\r\n\nline.  The  district court did not order the  Commonwealth to ban\r\n\ngillnet  and   lobster  pot   fishing  although   the  defendants\r\n\nincorrectly,  and  repeatedly, so  claim throughout  their brief.\r\n\nRather, the injunction ordered the Commonwealth to consider means\r\n\nby which gillnets  and lobster pots may be  modified in order for\r\n\nthe  Commonwealth to  avoid authorizing  takings  in its  coastal\r\n\nwaters in violation of federal law.  The injunction did not order\r\n\nspecific  modifications,  let  alone ban  the  licensure  scheme.\r\n\nIndeed, the court's  order did not even  command the Commonwealth\r\n\nto  restrict its  permitting  process in  any way.   Thus,  it is\r\n\nimpossible  to conclude that  the district court  commandeered or\r\n\nusurped  the state's  regulatory  authority to  manage commercial\r\n\nfishing under its regulatory scheme and we reject the defendants'\r\n\ncontention that it did so.\r\n\n          The  defendants' argument  revolves  around  a line  of\r\n\nreasoning  that  we  find  inapposite  in  the  context  of  this\r\n\nlitigation.   The defendants rely  heavily on New York  v.

The Court determined that \"the\r                                           \r\n\nBrady Act  purports to direct  state law enforcement  officers to\r\n\nparticipate,  albeit only temporarily, in the administration of a\r\n\nfederally enacted regulatory scheme.\"   Id.

Because the Brady Act instead\r\n\ntransferred  that   responsibility  to  the   fifty  states,  its\r\n\nprovisions were struck  down as inconsistent with  the provisions\r\n\nof the Tenth  Amendment.  In reaching this  conclusion, the Court\r\n\nfollowed the reasoning of New York v.

The situation presented  here is not\r\n\none in which the district court has directed the state to enact a\r\n\nparticular regulatory regime that enforces and furthers a federal\r\n\npolicy, as  was the situation  presented in the caselaw  cited by\r\n\nthe defendants.   In complaining that the district  court's order\r\n\nsuggests that the Commonwealth must make the choice of either not\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nregulating   in  a  particular   area  or  risking   the  federal\r\n\ngovernment's commandeering its regulatory processes if it chooses\r\n\nto  regulate, the defendants repeatedly align their position with\r\n\nthat of  the states  in New York  v.

First, the  states in those cases were not\r\n\nfound to be  in violation of a congressional  act passed pursuant\r\n\nto its  constitutional authority.   Second,  the states  in those\r\n\ncases were  directed to  take positive action  with respect  to a\r\n\nparticular field.  Here, the  defendants are not being ordered to\r\n\ntake  positive steps  with respect  to advancing  the goals  of a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Defendants' argument that  the situations are comparable is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n          In fact, New  York had \"enact[ed] legislation\r\n          providing for the siting  and financing of  a\r\n          disposal  facility in New  York\" in  order to\r\n          obtain  the benefits  of the  federal act  in\r\n          question.   New  York  v. United  States, 505\r                                                            \r\n          U.S.  at 154.    Under  the District  Court's\r\n          rationale in  this case, therefore,  New York\r\n          should have been  required to  take title  to\r\n          radioactive  wastes pursuant  to the  federal\r\n          Low-Level  Radioactive   Waste  Policy   Act,\r\n          because  it  had   not  \"cease[d]  exercising\r\n          control\"  over  low-level  radioactive waste.\r\n          Likewise   under    the   District    Court's\r\n          rationale,  Louisiana in  Acorn, should  have\r                                                   \r\n          been  required to  establish remedial  action\r\n          programs for the removal of lead contaminants\r\n          from  school  and   day-care  drinking  water\r\n          systems   pursuant  to   the  LCCA,   because\r\n          Louisiana    had    distributed    to   local\r\n          educational agencies,  schools, and  day care\r\n          centers  a  \"fact  sheet\"  published  by  the\r\n          Environmental   Protection   Agency   (\"EPA\")\r\n          listing non-lead free drinking water coolers.\r\n\nAppellants' Br. at 50.\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nfederal  regulatory scheme.    Rather,  the  court  directed  the\r\n\ndefendants to find a means of bringing the  Commonwealth's scheme\r\n\ninto compliance with federal law.\r\n\n          The  situation faced  by  the  district  court,  as  it\r\n\ncorrectly recognized, see 939 F. Supp. at 979-80, was one held by\r                                   \r\n\nthe New York  Court to be permissible under  the Tenth Amendment.\r                      \r\n\nThe   Court,  in  discussing  acceptable  uses  of  congressional\r\n\nauthority  with respect  to the  states,  recognized that  \"where\r\n\nCongress has the authority to regulate private activity under the\r\n\nCommerce  Clause, we  have recognized  Congress'  power to  offer\r\n\nStates  the choice  of  regulating  that  activity  according  to\r\n\nfederal  standards  or  having state  law  pre-empted  by federal\r\n\nregulation.\"  505 U.S. at 167.   The district court, in answering\r\n\nthe  defendants' Tenth  Amendment challenge, recognized  that the\r\n\nCommonwealth has the  choice of  either regulating  in this  area\r\n\naccording  to federal  ESA standards  or  having its  regulations\r\n\npreempted  by   the  federal  ESA  provisions   and  regulations.\r\n\nBecause, for preliminary injunction  purposes, the Commonwealth's\r\n\nregulation   of  this  area  is  inconsistent  with  federal  ESA\r\n\nstandards, this  situation falls squarely  within the permissible\r\n\nbalance of federal and state authority recognized by the New York\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt and  the Commonwealth's  regulations are  preempted by  the\r\n\nfederal ESA provisions.\r\n\n          We believe  that the  district court  acted within  the\r\n\nscope  of its  equitable  powers.   The  ESA  governs the  relief\r\n\navailable  in a  citizen  suit and  authorizes  citizen suits  to\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\nenjoin  acts   in  violation  of  the  ESA.    See  16  U.S.C.   \r                                                            \r\n\n1540(g)(1)(A).\r\n\n            \"[T]he    comprehensiveness    of    this\r\n            equitable  jurisdiction  is   not  to  be\r\n            denied  or  limited in  the absence  of a\r\n            clear  and  valid   legislative  command.\r\n            Unless  a statute in so many words, or by\r\n            a  necessary  and  inescapable inference,\r\n            restricts  the  court's  jurisdiction  in\r\n            equity,   the   full    scope   of   that\r\n            jurisdiction  is  to  be  recognized  and\r\n            applied.\"\r\n\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcel ,  456 U.S. 305, 313  (1981) (quoting\r                                      \r\n\nPorter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946)).  The ESA\r                                      \r\n\ndoes not limit the injunctive  power available in a citizen suit,\r\n\nand, thus, we understand  the Act to  grant a district court  the\r\n\nfull  scope  of  its  traditional  equitable  injunctive  powers.\r\n\n\"Equitable  injunction includes  the  power  to provide  complete\r\n\nrelief in light of the  statutory purpose.\"  Ephraim Freightways,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc. v.

In fashioning  relief,  the  district  court  found  it\r\n\nnecessary to  outline the  exact contours  of the  Commonwealth's\r\n\nviolation and  the extent  of preemption.   Toward this  end, the\r\n\ndistrict  court sought  the input  and  assistance of  interested\r\n\nparties,  through the  creation of  the  Working Group,  which we\r\n\nconsider \"necessary and  appropriate to  enforce compliance  with\r\n\nthe Act.\"  Porter, 328 U.S. at 400.\r                           \r\n\nIV.  Forcing unwanted relationships\r          IV.  Forcing unwanted relationships\r\n\n          Regarding  the Working  Group,  the defendants  contend\r\n\nthat  \"[e]quity is not intended to force unwanted relationships.\"\r\n\nAppellants' Br. at 53.  In support of this proposition, they cite\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\nonly Brewster v. Dukakis, 687 F.2d 495 (1st Cir. 1982).   In that\r                                  \r\n\ncase,  a district  court was  presented  with disputes  regarding\r\n\ncertain provisions of  a consent decree concerning  the treatment\r\n\nof mentally ill persons within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\nId. at  495.  In  connection with its ongoing  supervisory powers\r             \r\n\nover  the  consent   decree,  the  district  court   ordered  the\r\n\nCommonwealth  to create  a legal  advocacy  program on  behalf of\r\n\nmentally ill  or retarded persons.   Id.   A panel of  this court\r                                                  \r\n\nheld that  the language and  purpose of the consent  decree, from\r\n\nwhich the  court's authority  over the  parties derived,  did not\r\n\nempower the district court to order the Commonwealth to pay for a\r\n\ngeneral  services program to deal  with general issues related to\r\n\nthe subjects' disabilities.   Id. at 498-500.   The court further\r                                           \r\n\nrecognized that the district court  did not have the authority to\r\n\norder this remedy based on its  general equitable powers because,\r\n\nfaced  with no  admission of  liability  by the  Commonwealth and\r\n\nhaving found no  violation by the Commonwealth,  such traditional\r\n\npowers had not been invoked in that case.\r\n\n          The instant case is significantly different because the\r\n\ndistrict  court  found  a likelihood  that  the  Commonwealth had\r\n\ncommitted  a statutory violation  and thereby its  full equitable\r\n\npowers were invoked.  Thus,  the sole support for the defendants'\r\n\ncontention is inapposite, and we find no merit in their argument.\r\n\nV.  Irreparable harm to the defendants\r          V.  Irreparable harm to the defendants\r\n\n          The  defendants  contend  that, given  the  contentious\r\n\nrelationship between the parties, the district court's injunction\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nordering  them  to engage  in  a  relationship or  dialogue  with\r\n\nStrahan  inflicts   irreparable  harm   upon  the   Commonwealth.\r\n\nAlthough  it  is  generally true  in  the  preliminary injunction\r\n\ncontext that the district court  is required to weigh and balance\r\n\nthe relative harms to the non-movant if the injunction is granted\r\n\nand to the movant  if it is not, see Romero-Barcel ,  456 U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n312, in  the context of  ESA litigation, that balancing  has been\r\n\nanswered  by  Congress'  determination   that  the  \"balance   of\r\n\nhardships  and the  public  interest  tips  heavily in  favor  of\r\n\nprotected species.\"   National Wildlife  Fed'n, 23 F.3d  at 1510.\r                                                        \r\n\nThe defendants have not cited  any authority to the contrary and,\r\n\naccordingly, we follow these precedents in deferring to Congress'\r\n\npronouncements  regarding the weight  to be given  the endangered\r\n\nspecies under  the ESA and find no  error in the district court's\r\n\norder in this respect.\r\n\nVI.  Strahan's remaining claims\r          VI.  Strahan's remaining claims\r\n\n          A.  Mandatory immediate injunctive relief\r                    A.  Mandatory immediate injunctive relief\r\n\n          Strahan  contends  that  the  district court  committed\r\n\nreversible error  by refusing to  grant the injunctive  relief he\r\n\nsought.   He contends that the Court in TVA ruled that injunctive\r                                                     \r\n\nrelief is mandatory upon a finding of a violation of the ESA.  In\r\n\nfact,  the TVA  Court  specifically  rejected  this  proposition,\r                        \r\n\nstating \"[i]t is correct, of course, that a federal judge sitting\r\n\nas  a  chancellor  is  not  mechanically obligated  to  grant  an\r\n\ninjunction for every  violation of law.\"   TVA, 437 U.S.  at 193.\r                                                        \r\n\nThe Court recognized, however, that in the instance presented, in\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nwhich the activity  at issue would have caused  eradication of an\r\n\nentire  endangered species if not enjoined,  the only remedy that\r\n\ncould prevent that outcome was a permanent injunction halting the\r\n\nactivity.  Id. at 194-95.\r                        \r\n\n          The  district   court,  having   determined  that   the\r\n\nCommonwealth's probable violation  of the ESA could  be curtailed\r\n\nwithout  such extreme measures, declined to impose the injunction\r\n\nStrahan  sought.  The  district court was not  required to go any\r\n\nfarther than ensuring that  any violation would end.   See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n193-95; Romero-Barcel , 456 U.S. at  311-16 (holding that, in the\r                                \r\n\nface of a violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, a\r\n\ndistrict court  is not  required to enjoin  any and  all activity\r\n\nrelated to  the  Act's violation,  but  instead is  charged  with\r\n\ndeveloping  remedies to ensure the violator's compliance with the\r\n\nAct).  We are satisfied that the  district court was aware of the\r\n\nneed  to curtail any violation and bring about the Commonwealth's\r\n\ncompliance with  the ESA and  that its order  adequately achieves\r\n\nthose ends.\r\n\n          B.  Error of fact\r                    B.  Error of fact\r\n\n          Strahan argues that the district court erred in finding\r\n\nthat \"[w]ith  the exception  of the  summer of 1986,  '[n]orthern\r\n\nright whales are rarely seen in Cape  Cod Bay after May 15.\"  939\r\n\nF.

We will  conclude  that a  finding is\r\n\nclearly  erroneous \"only when, after reviewing the entire record,\r\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\nwe are left with the  definite and firm conviction that a mistake\r\n\nhas been committed.'\"  Clement v.  United States, 980 F.2d 48, 53\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992)  (quoting Deguio v.

This claim need not detain us, because, as\r\n\nStrahan  points  out  in  his   brief,  his  claim  is  based  on\r\n\ninformation not presented to  the court below and,  therefore, it\r\n\nis not properly before this court.  \"'Except for motions to amend\r\n\nbased  on newly  discovered  evidence, the  trial  court is  only\r\n\nrequired  to  amend  its  findings  of  fact  based  on  evidence\r\n\ncontained  in the  record.

The docket reveals  that Strahan\r\n\nhas  filed  no motion  to  amend  this  finding, based  on  newly\r\n\ndiscovered evidence.  \"That other  evidence not in the record may\r\n\nnegate the [d]istrict  [c]ourt's inference is beside  the point.\"\r\n\nFontenot, 791 F.2d at 1220.   Strahan may not now claim error  in\r                  \r\n\nthe district court's  reasonable finding based on his own failure\r\n\nto present  evidence to the lower court.   See Aybar,    F.3d   ,\r                                                              \r\n\n1997  WL 342489,  at *25-26.   Given  the  record before  it, the\r\n\ndistrict court drew  a reasonable  inference and  relied on  that\r\n\ninference in making its findings of fact.  We find no error here.\r\n\n          C.

Beyond\r\n\nthis bare assertion, Strahan fails  to argue further in his brief\r\n\nin support of this contention.  It is well-established that\r\n\n            issues  adverted  to   in  a  perfunctory\r\n            manner, unaccompanied  by some  effort at\r\n            developed   argumentation,   are   deemed\r\n            waived. . . .  It is not enough merely to\r\n            mention a  possible argument in  the most\r\n            skeletal  way, leaving  the  court to  do\r\n            counsel's work.  . .  .   Judges are  not\r\n            expected      to     be      mindreaders.\r\n            Consequently,   a    litigant   has    an\r\n            obligation  to  spell out  its  arguments\r\n            squarely and distinctly,  or else forever\r\n            hold its peace.\"\r\n\nKing  v.

Marine Mammal Protection Act\r          I.  Marine Mammal Protection Act\r\n\n          Strahan  contends  on  cross-appeal  that the  district\r\n\ncourt erred when it  determined that he could not bring a citizen\r\n\nsuit under  the provisions of  the Marine Mammal  Protection Act.\r\n\nSee 939 F.  Supp. at 975.   Defendants, on the other  hand, argue\r             \r\n\nthat the  district court,  having properly  found that  it lacked\r\n\njurisdiction under the  MMPA, erroneously entered a  remedy under\r\n\nthe MMPA  when it ordered the Commonwealth, in paragraph 2 of the\r\n\npreliminary injunction  order, to  apply for  an incidental  take\r\n\npermit pursuant to section 1387 of the MMPA and, in  paragraph 4,\r\n\nto convene a working group similar to those initiated pursuant to\r\n\nthe MMPA.   See id. at 990-91.   We find that  the district court\r                             \r\n\nproperly held  that it  lacked jurisdiction  under the  MMPA, and\r\n\ntherefore  its  remedy in  paragraph  2  based  on the  MMPA  was\r\n\nerroneous.  We find, however, that the remedy  in paragraph 4 was\r\n\nnot  ordered pursuant to the MMPA, but instead was intended to be\r\n\nmodelled  on  MMPA   working  groups  and,  therefore,   was  not\r\n\nerroneous.\r\n\n          The MMPA  does not  authorize citizen  suits against  a\r\n\nperson alleged to  be in violation  of the Act.   The Act  states\r\n\nthat, \"[e]xcept  as otherwise  provided in  this subchapter,  the\r\n\nSecretary shall enforce  the provisions of this  subchapter.\"  16\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nU.S.C.   1377.   The district court properly  recognized that the\r\n\nAct  does  not  authorize  the  federal  courts  to  enforce  its\r\n\nprovisions in the  type of suit brought  by Strahan.  See  939 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at  975.   In addition, the  court properly found  that the\r\n\nAdministrative Procedure  Act, 5 U.S.C.    701 et seq.,  does not\r                                                                \r\n\nauthorize suits  against state  officials.  See  939 F.  Supp. at\r                                                         \r\n\n975.  Based on these findings, the court correctly concluded that\r\n\nit did not have jurisdiction under the MMPA.\r\n\n          Seeking  a contrary  ruling, Strahan  relies solely  on\r\n\nKokechik Fisherman's  Association v.  Secretary of  Commerce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501791\"><a href=\"/opinion/501791/kokechik-fishermens-association-v-secretary-of-commerce-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span>\r                                                                      \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  In that case, the court affirmed\r\n\na district court ruling that  an incidental take permit issued by\r\n\nthe Secretary of Commerce was contrary to the requirements of the\r\n\nMMPA.  Id.  The federal court had jurisdiction to hear the claims\r                    \r\n\npresented in Kokechik by virtue  of 16 U.S.C.   1374(d)(6), which\r                               \r\n\nauthorizes judicial  review  of the  terms  and conditions  of  a\r\n\npermit issued by  the Secretary.  See Kokechik,  839 F.2d at 797.\r                                                        \r\n\nThus, the case stands for the uncontroversial proposition that  a\r\n\ncitizen  can seek  review of  the Secretary's  actions under  the\r\n\nMMPA,  and  does  not  provide  authority  to  support  Strahan's\r\n\nposition that a private citizen  can seek an injunction against a\r\n\nstate official under the MMPA.\r\n\n          Defendants' argument  respecting the remedy  ordered in\r\n\nparagraph 2  has merit.   Defendants argue  that if  the district\r\n\ncourt  has no jurisdiction  under the MMPA,  it logically follows\r\n\nthat  the district  court may  not order  a remedy  that requires\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\ncompliance  with provisions  of the  MMPA.   In paragraph  2, the\r\n\ndistrict  court ordered the Commonwealth officials to comply with\r\n\nthe terms  of the MMPA by applying  for an incidental take permit\r\n\npursuant to 16 U.S.C.   1387.   Except with respect to review  of\r\n\npermits actually  granted,  Congress vested  enforcement  of  the\r\n\nprovisions of the  MMPA in the Secretary of  Commerce, not in the\r\n\nfederal courts.    See  16  U.S.C.    1377.    Consequently,  the\r                                \r\n\ndistrict   court  lacked  the  jurisdiction  to  order  that  the\r\n\ndefendants comply with the MMPA.  We therefore vacate paragraph 2\r\n\nof the district court's preliminary injunction order.\r\n\n          We have considered the argument of the Conservation Law\r\n\nFoundation  that  the  cross-reference  provision,  cited by  the\r\n\ndistrict court,  effectively makes the  substantive provisions of\r\n\nthe MMPA part  of the ESA  for purposes of enforcement  through a\r\n\ncitizen's  suit.   Although  the  argument is  not  frivolous, on\r\n\nbalance  we think  that the  provision  does not  incorporate one\r\n\nstatute into the  other.  It merely prevents  anyone from arguing\r\n\nthat the less  restrictive requirements of one  statute supersede\r\n\nthe more restrictive requirements of the other.\r\n\n          On  the other hand,  the substantive provisions  of the\r\n\nMarine Mammal Protection  Act appear to be triggered  by the same\r\n\nactivities  that the  district court,  at  least for  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction purposes,  found to be a  taking.  To  the extent that\r\n\nthe  defendants  may fail  to  meet the  arguably  more stringent\r\n\nstandards of the  MMPA, the Secretary of Commerce  might conclude\r\n\nthat  it  was  improper  to  issue a  permit  under  the  ESA for\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nactivities  that  were  unlawful   under  another  statute   also\r\n\nadministered by the Secretary.  It is premature for this Court to\r\n\ndecide how the matter should be resolved if the Secretary  took a\r\n\ndifferent  view  and  issued  an  ESA  permit  while  ignoring  a\r\n\nviolation of the MMPA.\r\n\n          Finally,  defendants  contend that  the  district court\r\n\nlacked jurisdiction  under the  MMPA to order  the defendants  to\r\n\nform a working group modeled  on working groups required pursuant\r\n\nto the MMPA.  The district court's order was as follows:\r\n\n            Fourth, the Defendants will be ordered to\r\n            convene an Endangered Whale Working Group\r\n            and to engage  in substantive discussions\r\n            with     the     Plaintiff,     or    his\r\n            representative,  as  well as  with  other\r\n            interested       parties,       regarding\r\n            modifications of  fixed-fishing gear  and\r\n            other measures  to minimize  harm to  the\r\n            Northern Right whales.\r\n\n939 F. Supp. at 991.  We understand the district court here to be\r\n\nordering, under  its equitable  powers, a working  group that  is\r\n\nmerely  modelled  on   MMPA  working  groups  dedicated   to  the\r\n\npreservation of other marine mammals.  Nothing suggests that this\r\n\nportion of the district court's  order was issued pursuant to any\r\n\nauthority  other than its equitable  powers.  That  is, we do not\r\n\nread  this order  as emanating  from the  provisions of  the MMPA\r\n\nitself,  but rather from  the court's inherent  powers to fashion\r\n\nappropriate  equitable  relief.    See  discussion  of  equitable\r                                                \r\n\npowers, infra at 34.  Thus, we find no abuse in this exercise  of\r                       \r\n\ndiscretion and we do not find any error.\r\n\nII.  Endangered Species Act\r          II.

Legal challenges\r                    B.  Legal challenges\r\n\n          The  district   court's  reasoning,  in   finding  that\r\n\nMassachusetts'  commercial   fishing  regulatory   scheme  likely\r\n\nexacted  a taking  in violation  of the  ESA, was founded  on two\r\n\nprovisions of the ESA read in conjunction.   The first relates to\r\n\nthe definition  of the prohibited  activity of a \"taking,\"  see  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1538(a)(1)(B),  and the  second relates  to  the solicitation  or\r\n\ncausation  by a third  party of a prohibited  activity, such as a\r\n\ntaking,  see     1538(g).    The  district  court  viewed   these\r                      \r\n\nprovisions, when read together, to apply to acts by third parties\r\n\nthat allow  or authorize acts  that exact a taking  and that, but\r\n\nfor the  permitting process, could  not take place.

We  believe\r\n\nthat,  contrary  to  the  defendants'  argument  on  appeal,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  properly found  that a  governmental third  party\r\n\npursuant to whose authority an  actor directly exacts a taking of\r\n\nan  endangered  species  may  be  deemed  to  have  violated  the\r\n\nprovisions of the ESA.\r\n\n          The  defendants argue that the statute was not intended\r\n\nto prohibit state licensure activity because such activity cannot\r\n\nbe a \"proximate cause\" of the taking.  The defendants  direct our\r\n\nattention  to  long-standing  principles of  common  law  tort in\r\n\narguing  that  the  district  court  improperly  found  that  its\r\n\nregulatory    scheme   \"indirectly    causes\"   these    takings.\r\n\nSpecifically,  the defendants contend that to construe the proper\r\n\nmeaning  of \"cause\"  under the  ESA,  this court  should look  to\r\n\ncommon  law  principles  of causation  and  further  contend that\r\n\nproximate cause is lacking here.  The defendants are correct that\r\n\nwhen  interpreting a  term in  a statute  which is,  like \"cause\"\r\n\nhere, well-known  to the common law, the court is to presume that\r\n\nCongress intended the meaning to  be interpreted as in the common\r\n\nlaw.  See Veiga v. McGee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195441\"><a href=\"/opinion/195441/veiga-v-mcgee/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1210 (1st Cir. 1994).  We\r                                  \r\n\ndo not believe,  however, that an interpretation  of \"cause\" that\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nincludes the \"indirect causation\" of a taking by the Commonwealth\r\n\nthrough its licensing scheme falls without the normal boundaries.\r\n\n          The  defendants  protest  this interpretation.    Their\r\n\nfirst   argument  is  that  the  Commonwealth's  licensure  of  a\r\n\ngenerally permitted activity does  not cause the taking  any more\r\n\nthan  its licensure of automobiles and drivers solicits or causes\r\n\nfederal  crimes, even though  automobiles it licenses  are surely\r\n\nused to  violate federal drug laws, rob  federally insured banks,\r\n\nor  cross state  lines for  the  purpose of  violating state  and\r\n\nfederal laws.  The answer to this argument is that, whereas it is\r\n\npossible for a person licensed by Massachusetts to use a car in a\r\n\nmanner that does not risk the violations of federal law suggested\r\n\nby the defendants,  it is not possible for  a licensed commercial\r\n\nfishing  operation to  use its  gillnets or  lobster pots  in the\r\n\nmanner  permitted by the  Commonwealth without risk  of violating\r\n\nthe  ESA by exacting  a taking.   Thus, the state's  licensure of\r\n\ngillnet and lobster pot fishing does not involve the  intervening\r\n\nindependent  actor that  is a  necessary component  of the  other\r\n\nlicensure  schemes which  it  argues are  comparable.   Where the\r\n\nstate has licensed  an automobile driver  to use that  automobile\r\n\nand  her license  in  a  manner consistent  with  both state  and\r\n\nfederal  law, the  violation of  federal  is caused  only by  the\r\n\nactor's conscious  and independent  decision to  disregard or  go\r\n\nbeyond the licensed purposes of her automobile use and instead to\r\n\nviolate  federal, and  possibly  state, law.    The situation  is\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nsimply not  the same  here.   In  this  instance, the  state  has\r\n\nlicensed  commercial  fishing  operations  to  use  gillnets  and\r\n\nlobster pots in specifically the  manner that is likely to result\r\n\nin  a  violation of  federal  law.    The causation  here,  while\r\n\nindirect, is not so removed that it  extends outside the realm of\r\n\ncausation as it is understood in the common law.1\r\n\n          The defendants'  next  argument  need  only  detain  us\r\n\nmomentarily.   They contend that  the statutory structure  of the\r\n\nESA does not envision utilizing the regulatory structures of  the\r\n\nstates in order to implement  its provisions, but that it instead\r\n\nleaves that implementing  authority to NMFS.  The  point that the\r\n\ndefendants  miss is  that the  district court's  ruling  does not\r\n\nimpose positive obligations on the Commonwealth by converting its\r\n\nregulation of  commercial fishing operations  into a tool  of the\r\n\nfederal ESA regulatory  scheme.   The Commonwealth  is not  being\r\n\ncompelled to  enforce the  provisions of the  ESA.   Instead, the\r\n\ndistrict  court's   ruling  seeks   to  end   the  Commonwealth's\r\n\ncontinuing violation of the Act.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   The defendants' citation to cases  in which courts refused to\r\nimpose  liability  for  a  state's  exercise  of  its  regulatory\r\nactivity is misplaced.

Under the ESA's  definition of a  \"person\" who is\r\nprohibited  from  exacting  a taking,  the  Commonwealth  just as\r\nclearly falls within the definition.\r\n\n2   We note that the defendants'  concerns about the authority of\r\nthe district court  to force the Commonwealth to  ban gillnet and\r\nlobster pot fishing where the federal administering agency, NMFS,\r\nhas chosen not  to do so are  misplaced.

The defendants' position is flawed for two reasons.  First,\r\n\nthe   ESA  gives  NMFS,  through  the  Secretary,  discretion  in\r\n\nauthorizing takings  incidental to  certain commercial  activity;\r\n\nthe  Act does not give a federal  court, having determined that a\r\n\ntaking has occurred,  the same discretion in  determining whether\r\n\nto  grant injunctive  relief.   Second,  the fact  that NMFS  has\r\n\nexpressly declined to ban gillnet  or lobster pot fishing in Cape\r\n\nCod Bay does not reflect a policy determination by NMFS that such\r\n\na  ban is  unnecessary.    For these  two  reasons, we  find  the\r\n\ndefendants' deference arguments without merit.\r\n\n          C.  Factual challenges\r                    C.

The district  court found  that entanglement  with\r\n\nfishing gear in  Massachusetts waters caused  injury or death  to\r\n\nNorthern  Right whales.   See 939 F.  Supp. at 984.   Indeed, the\r                                       \r\n\ndistrict court cited  several of the Commonwealth's  documents in\r\n\nsupport  of this finding,  including its statement  that \"'[f]ive\r\n\nright whales have  been found entangled in fixed  fishing gear in\r\n\nMassachusetts  waters; three  in  gillnets  and  two  in  lobster\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nactually  ordered such a  ban, we might  consider these concerns,\r\nbut  indeed the district court  has not required the Commonwealth\r\nin its injunction to impose such a ban.  The situation complained\r\nof by the defendants is simply not before us.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nlines.'\"  Id.  (quoting Right Whales in  Massachusetts Waters, An\r                       \r\n\nExecutive Summary at  2).  The court further  cited to affidavits\r\n\nof  three scientists that suggested that entanglement of Northern\r\n\nRight whales  had harmed, injured,  or killed those whales.   The\r\n\ncourt cited eleven occasions  on which Northern Right whales  had\r\n\nbeen  found entangled  in fishing  gear  in Massachusetts  waters\r\n\nbetween 1978 and 1995.   The court also  indicated that at  least\r\n\nfifty-seven  percent  of  all Northern  right  whales  have scars\r\n\nindicating prior entanglement  with fishing gear and  noted that,\r\n\neven where the whale survives,  the entanglement still wounds the\r\n\nwhale.   Although these findings indicate only that entanglements\r\n\nhave  occurred  in  Massachusetts  waters,  the   district  court\r\n\ndetermined  that three whales  had been  found entangled  in gear\r\n\ndeployed in Massachusetts waters.\r\n\n          The defendants contend that the factual evidence before\r\n\nthe   district  court  did   not  support  a   finding  that  the\r\n\nCommonwealth  has perpetrated  a taking.    The defendants'  main\r\n\ncontention   is  that  the  \"District  Court  made  its  'taking'\r\n\ndetermination  . .  . based  on speculation  that Northern  Right\r\n\nwhales have  become entangled in  fishing gear:  (1)  deployed in\r\n\nMassachusetts   coastal   waters;  and   (2)   licensed  by   the\r\n\nCommonwealth.\"   Appellants'  Br. at  42.   The defendants  first\r\n\nstate that they  submitted affidavit evidence indicating  that no\r\n\ndeaths of  Northern Right  whales had  occurred in  Massachusetts\r\n\ncoastal waters.  While this may be true, it answers only half the\r\n\ntaking  question,  which bars  not  only  killings of,  but  also\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\ninjuries to, Northern  Right whales.  Because  the district court\r\n\nneed  not  have  made  a  determination as  to  whale  deaths  in\r\n\ndetermining whether the Commonwealth exacted a taking, we find no\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          The defendants  acknowledge  that  the  district  court\r\n\nrelied on a  scientist's affidavit  that was  supplied by  amicus\r\n\ncuriae  Conservation Law  Foundation.    The  defendants  do  not\r\n\nchallenge  the factual  statements  asserted  in  the  affidavit,\r\n\nincluding the one relied upon by the district court that \"[t]hree\r\n\nof the entanglements of endangered  whales . . . clearly involved\r\n\nfishing gear that was deployed in Massachusetts waters.\"  Despite\r\n\nthe defendants' protests  that the district court was engaging in\r\n\nspeculation  when it found  that whales have  become entangled in\r\n\nfishing  gear  deployed  in Commonwealth's  waters,  in  fact the\r\n\ndistrict  court relied on  the unchallenged factual  assertion in\r\n\nthe  scientific affidavit.  Thus, the defendants' first challenge\r\n\nto the district court's fact-finding speculation is not valid.\r\n\n          With respect to the district court's determination that\r\n\nthese  entanglements involved gear  licensed by the Commonwealth,\r\n\nthe district  court relied on  the affidavit regarding  the three\r\n\nentanglements   that  occurred  in  Massachusetts  waters.    The\r\n\naffidavit explained that the whales were found  entangled in gear\r\n\n\"fixed\"  in Massachusetts  waters such  that the whale  could not\r\n\nescape because it could not break free of the gear.  The district\r\n\ncourt's inference  that gear  fixed in  Massachusetts waters  was\r\n\nlicensed  by  the Commonwealth,  and  was  not set  illegally  or\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nbrought into Massachusetts waters from another area by the whale,\r\n\nwas reasonable and we find no clear error in that inference.\r\n\n          The  defendants next  contend that  the district  court\r\n\nignored  evidence  of   the  significant  efforts  made   by  the\r\n\nCommonwealth  to \"minimize Northern  Right Whale entanglements in\r\n\nfishing  gear,\"  and  evidence  of  other causes  of  takings  of\r\n\nNorthern  Right whales.   With  respect  to the  determination of\r\n\nwhether a taking  has occurred, the district  court quite rightly\r\n\ndisregarded such evidence.   Given that  there was evidence  that\r\n\nany entanglement with fishing gear injures a Northern Right whale\r\n\nand given that a single injury to one whale is a taking under the\r\n\nESA, efforts to  minimize such entanglements are irrelevant.  For\r\n\nthe same reasons,  the existence of other means  by which takings\r\n\nof Northern Right whales occur is irrelevant to the determination\r\n\nof whether the Commonwealth has engaged in a taking.\r\n\n          Finding  neither any error  of law nor  any clear error\r\n\nwith  respect  to  the  factual findings,  we  believe  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court properly  applied the ESA  to the facts  presented\r\n\nand was  correct in enjoining  the Commonwealth so as  to prevent\r\n\nthe taking of Northern Right whales in violation of the ESA.\r\n\nIII.  Scope of injunctive relief\r          III.  Scope of injunctive relief\r\n\n          Defendants claim  that the injunctive relief granted by\r\n\nthe district court goes beyond the scope of remedies available in\r\n\nan  action against  state  officials.   Specifically,  defendants\r\n\nclaim that,  although the  district court could  have ordered  an\r\n\ninjunction barring all Commonwealth licensing activity,  it could\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nnot  require the Commonwealth  to implement measures  designed to\r\n\naccord  Northern  Right  whales  greater  regulatory  protection.\r\n\nDefendants  argue   that  the  statutory  scheme,   the  Eleventh\r\n\nAmendment, and the Tenth Amendment  all bar the measures  ordered\r\n\nby the district court.\r\n\n          A.  Statutory scheme/Eleventh Amendment\r                    A.  Statutory scheme/Eleventh Amendment\r\n\n          The ESA's citizen suit provisions authorize\r\n\n            any person  [to] commence a civil suit on\r\n            his  own  behalf--   (a)  to  enjoin  any\r\n            person, including  the United  States and\r\n            any other governmental instrumentality or\r\n            agency  (to the  extent permitted  by the\r\n            eleventh amendment to  the Constitution),\r\n            who  is alleged to be in violation of any\r\n            provision of  this chapter  or regulation\r\n            issued under the authority thereof .  . .\r\n            .\r\n\n16 U.S.C.   1540(g)(1).  The very fact  that Congress has limited\r\n\nits  authorization to  suits allowed  by  the Eleventh  Amendment\r\n\nreinforces the conclusion that Congress clearly envisioned that a\r\n\ncitizen could seek  an injunction against a state's violations of\r\n\nthe ESA.  Defendants' claim  that the district court exceeded its\r\n\nauthority  to order  injunctive relief  against  the Commonwealth\r\n\nunder  the  ESA statutory  scheme is  ultimately grounded  in the\r\n\nlimitations provided under the Eleventh Amendment.\r\n\n          The Eleventh Amendment provides:\r\n\n            The Judicial power  of the United  States\r\n            shall not  be construed to extend  to any\r\n            suit  in  law  or  equity,  commenced  or\r\n            prosecuted  against  one  of  the  United\r\n            States by the Citizens of another  State,\r\n            or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign\r\n            State.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nU.S. Const.  amend.

The  defendants' proposition ignores\r\nthe  clear  language  of the  statute,  which  explicitly defines\r\npersons who are  prohibited from engaging in a  taking to include\r\nthe states and state officials.

The  district court did not order the  Commonwealth to ban\r\n\ngillnet  and   lobster  pot   fishing  although   the  defendants\r\n\nincorrectly,  and  repeatedly, so  claim throughout  their brief.\r\n\nRather, the injunction ordered the Commonwealth to consider means\r\n\nby which gillnets  and lobster pots may be  modified in order for\r\n\nthe  Commonwealth to  avoid authorizing  takings  in its  coastal\r\n\nwaters in violation of federal law.  The injunction did not order\r\n\nspecific  modifications,  let  alone ban  the  licensure  scheme.\r\n\nIndeed, the court's  order did not even  command the Commonwealth\r\n\nto  restrict its  permitting  process in  any way.   Thus,  it is\r\n\nimpossible  to conclude that  the district court  commandeered or\r\n\nusurped  the state's  regulatory  authority to  manage commercial\r\n\nfishing under its regulatory scheme and we reject the defendants'\r\n\ncontention that it did so.\r\n\n          The  defendants' argument  revolves  around  a line  of\r\n\nreasoning  that  we  find  inapposite  in  the  context  of  this\r\n\nlitigation.

The  act, referred  to as  the \"Brady  Act,\" required\r\n\nstate law  enforcement  officers, called  \"chief law  enforcement\r\n\nofficers\"  (\"CLEOs\"), to \"make  a reasonable effort  to ascertain\r\n\nwithin 5  business  days  whether receipt  or  possession  [of  a\r\n\nhandgun  by the  applicant] would  be  in violation  of the  law,\r\n\nincluding  research in  whatever  State  and local  recordkeeping\r\n\nsystems are available and in  a national system designated by the\r\n\nAttorney General.\"  18 U.S.C.   922(s)(2), quoted in Printz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span>\r                                                                     \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">351180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at  *4.

The Court determined that \"the\r                                           \r\n\nBrady Act  purports to direct  state law enforcement  officers to\r\n\nparticipate,  albeit only temporarily, in the administration of a\r\n\nfederally enacted regulatory scheme.\"   Id.  The Court recognized\r                                                     \r\n\nthat the Constitution places responsibility for administering the\r\n\nlaws of Congress on the President.  Because the Brady Act instead\r\n\ntransferred  that   responsibility  to  the   fifty  states,  its\r\n\nprovisions were struck  down as inconsistent with  the provisions\r\n\nof the Tenth  Amendment.  In reaching this  conclusion, the Court\r\n\nfollowed the reasoning of New York v. United States.\r                                                             \r\n\n          Although the  defendants are  correct when  they assert\r\n\nthat the commands of the Tenth Amendment apply to all branches of\r\n\nthe  federal  government,  including  the  federal courts,  their\r\n\narguments under  the reasoning of  New York v. United  States and\r                                                                       \r\n\nits progeny are  misguided.  The situation presented  here is not\r\n\none in which the district court has directed the state to enact a\r\n\nparticular regulatory regime that enforces and furthers a federal\r\n\npolicy, as  was the situation  presented in the caselaw  cited by\r\n\nthe defendants.   In complaining that the district  court's order\r\n\nsuggests that the Commonwealth must make the choice of either not\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nregulating   in  a  particular   area  or  risking   the  federal\r\n\ngovernment's commandeering its regulatory processes if it chooses\r\n\nto  regulate, the defendants repeatedly align their position with\r\n\nthat of  the states  in New York  v. United  States and  Acorn v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nEdwards.4   The defendants'  argument ignores  the distinguishing\r                 \r\n\nfacts of those cases.  First, the  states in those cases were not\r\n\nfound to be  in violation of a congressional  act passed pursuant\r\n\nto its  constitutional authority.   Second,  the states  in those\r\n\ncases were  directed to  take positive action  with respect  to a\r\n\nparticular field.  Here, the  defendants are not being ordered to\r\n\ntake  positive steps  with respect  to advancing  the goals  of a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Defendants' argument that  the situations are comparable is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n          In fact, New  York had \"enact[ed] legislation\r\n          providing for the siting  and financing of  a\r\n          disposal  facility in New  York\" in  order to\r\n          obtain  the benefits  of the  federal act  in\r\n          question.   New  York  v. United  States, 505\r                                                            \r\n          U.S.  at 154.    Under  the District  Court's\r\n          rationale in  this case, therefore,  New York\r\n          should have been  required to  take title  to\r\n          radioactive  wastes pursuant  to the  federal\r\n          Low-Level  Radioactive   Waste  Policy   Act,\r\n          because  it  had   not  \"cease[d]  exercising\r\n          control\"  over  low-level  radioactive waste.\r\n          Likewise   under    the   District    Court's\r\n          rationale,  Louisiana in  Acorn, should  have\r                                                   \r\n          been  required to  establish remedial  action\r\n          programs for the removal of lead contaminants\r\n          from  school  and   day-care  drinking  water\r\n          systems   pursuant  to   the  LCCA,   because\r\n          Louisiana    had    distributed    to   local\r\n          educational agencies,  schools, and  day care\r\n          centers  a  \"fact  sheet\"  published  by  the\r\n          Environmental   Protection   Agency   (\"EPA\")\r\n          listing non-lead free drinking water coolers.\r\n\nAppellants' Br. at 50.\r\n\n                               -35-\r\r\n\nfederal  regulatory scheme.    Rather,  the  court  directed  the\r\n\ndefendants to find a means of bringing the  Commonwealth's scheme\r\n\ninto compliance with federal law.\r\n\n          The  situation faced  by  the  district  court,  as  it\r\n\ncorrectly recognized, see 939 F. Supp. at 979-80, was one held by\r                                   \r\n\nthe New York  Court to be permissible under  the Tenth Amendment.\r                      \r\n\nThe   Court,  in  discussing  acceptable  uses  of  congressional\r\n\nauthority  with respect  to the  states,  recognized that  \"where\r\n\nCongress has the authority to regulate private activity under the\r\n\nCommerce  Clause, we  have recognized  Congress'  power to  offer\r\n\nStates  the choice  of  regulating  that  activity  according  to\r\n\nfederal  standards  or  having state  law  pre-empted  by federal\r\n\nregulation.\"  505 U.S. at 167.   The district court, in answering\r\n\nthe  defendants' Tenth  Amendment challenge, recognized  that the\r\n\nCommonwealth has the  choice of  either regulating  in this  area\r\n\naccording  to federal  ESA standards  or  having its  regulations\r\n\npreempted  by   the  federal  ESA  provisions   and  regulations.\r\n\nBecause, for preliminary injunction  purposes, the Commonwealth's\r\n\nregulation   of  this  area  is  inconsistent  with  federal  ESA\r\n\nstandards, this  situation falls squarely  within the permissible\r\n\nbalance of federal and state authority recognized by the New York\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt and  the Commonwealth's  regulations are  preempted by  the\r\n\nfederal ESA provisions.\r\n\n          We believe  that the  district court  acted within  the\r\n\nscope  of its  equitable  powers.   The  ESA  governs the  relief\r\n\navailable  in a  citizen  suit and  authorizes  citizen suits  to\r\n\n                               -36-\r\r\n\nenjoin  acts   in  violation  of  the  ESA.

In that\r                                  \r\n\ncase,  a district  court was  presented  with disputes  regarding\r\n\ncertain provisions of  a consent decree concerning  the treatment\r\n\nof mentally ill persons within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\r\n\nId. at  495.  In  connection with its ongoing  supervisory powers\r             \r\n\nover  the  consent   decree,  the  district  court   ordered  the\r\n\nCommonwealth  to create  a legal  advocacy  program on  behalf of\r\n\nmentally ill  or retarded persons.   Id.   A panel of  this court\r                                                  \r\n\nheld that  the language and  purpose of the consent  decree, from\r\n\nwhich the  court's authority  over the  parties derived,  did not\r\n\nempower the district court to order the Commonwealth to pay for a\r\n\ngeneral  services program to deal  with general issues related to\r\n\nthe subjects' disabilities.   Id. at 498-500.   The court further\r                                           \r\n\nrecognized that the district court  did not have the authority to\r\n\norder this remedy based on its  general equitable powers because,\r\n\nfaced  with no  admission of  liability  by the  Commonwealth and\r\n\nhaving found no  violation by the Commonwealth,  such traditional\r\n\npowers had not been invoked in that case.\r\n\n          The instant case is significantly different because the\r\n\ndistrict  court  found  a likelihood  that  the  Commonwealth had\r\n\ncommitted  a statutory violation  and thereby its  full equitable\r\n\npowers were invoked.  Thus,  the sole support for the defendants'\r\n\ncontention is inapposite, and we find no merit in their argument.\r\n\nV.  Irreparable harm to the defendants\r          V.  Irreparable harm to the defendants\r\n\n          The  defendants  contend  that, given  the  contentious\r\n\nrelationship between the parties, the district court's injunction\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\nordering  them  to engage  in  a  relationship or  dialogue  with\r\n\nStrahan  inflicts   irreparable  harm   upon  the   Commonwealth.\r\n\nAlthough  it  is  generally true  in  the  preliminary injunction\r\n\ncontext that the district court  is required to weigh and balance\r\n\nthe relative harms to the non-movant if the injunction is granted\r\n\nand to the movant  if it is not, see Romero-Barcel ,  456 U.S. at\r                                                             \r\n\n312, in  the context of  ESA litigation, that balancing  has been\r\n\nanswered  by  Congress'  determination   that  the  \"balance   of\r\n\nhardships  and the  public  interest  tips  heavily in  favor  of\r\n\nprotected species.\"   National Wildlife  Fed'n, 23 F.3d  at 1510.\r                                                        \r\n\nThe defendants have not cited  any authority to the contrary and,\r\n\naccordingly, we follow these precedents in deferring to Congress'\r\n\npronouncements  regarding the weight  to be given  the endangered\r\n\nspecies under  the ESA and find no  error in the district court's\r\n\norder in this respect.\r\n\nVI.  Strahan's remaining claims\r          VI.  Strahan's remaining claims\r\n\n          A.  Mandatory immediate injunctive relief\r                    A.  Mandatory immediate injunctive relief\r\n\n          Strahan  contends  that  the  district court  committed\r\n\nreversible error  by refusing to  grant the injunctive  relief he\r\n\nsought.   He contends that the Court in TVA ruled that injunctive\r                                                     \r\n\nrelief is mandatory upon a finding of a violation of the ESA.  In\r\n\nfact,  the TVA  Court  specifically  rejected  this  proposition,\r                        \r\n\nstating \"[i]t is correct, of course, that a federal judge sitting\r\n\nas  a  chancellor  is  not  mechanically obligated  to  grant  an\r\n\ninjunction for every  violation of law.\"   TVA, 437 U.S.  at 193.\r                                                        \r\n\nThe Court recognized, however, that in the instance presented, in\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\nwhich the activity  at issue would have caused  eradication of an\r\n\nentire  endangered species if not enjoined,  the only remedy that\r\n\ncould prevent that outcome was a permanent injunction halting the\r\n\nactivity.  Id. at 194-95.\r                        \r\n\n          The  district   court,  having   determined  that   the\r\n\nCommonwealth's probable violation  of the ESA could  be curtailed\r\n\nwithout  such extreme measures, declined to impose the injunction\r\n\nStrahan  sought.  The  district court was not  required to go any\r\n\nfarther than ensuring that  any violation would end.   See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n193-95; Romero-Barcel , 456 U.S. at  311-16 (holding that, in the\r                                \r\n\nface of a violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, a\r\n\ndistrict court  is not  required to enjoin  any and  all activity\r\n\nrelated to  the  Act's violation,  but  instead is  charged  with\r\n\ndeveloping  remedies to ensure the violator's compliance with the\r\n\nAct).  We are satisfied that the  district court was aware of the\r\n\nneed  to curtail any violation and bring about the Commonwealth's\r\n\ncompliance with  the ESA and  that its order  adequately achieves\r\n\nthose ends.\r\n\n          B.  Error of fact\r                    B.  Error of fact\r\n\n          Strahan argues that the district court erred in finding\r\n\nthat \"[w]ith  the exception  of the  summer of 1986,  '[n]orthern\r\n\nright whales are rarely seen in Cape  Cod Bay after May 15.\"  939\r\n\nF.

We will  conclude  that a  finding is\r\n\nclearly  erroneous \"only when, after reviewing the entire record,\r\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\nwe are left with the  definite and firm conviction that a mistake\r\n\nhas been committed.'\"  Clement v.

The docket reveals  that Strahan\r\n\nhas  filed  no motion  to  amend  this  finding, based  on  newly\r\n\ndiscovered evidence.  \"That other  evidence not in the record may\r\n\nnegate the [d]istrict  [c]ourt's inference is beside  the point.\"\r\n\nFontenot, 791 F.2d at 1220.   Strahan may not now claim error  in\r                  \r\n\nthe district court's  reasonable finding based on his own failure\r\n\nto present  evidence to the lower court.   See Aybar,    F.3d   ,\r                                                              \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">342489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  at *25-26.   Given  the  record before  it, the\r\n\ndistrict court drew  a reasonable  inference and  relied on  that\r\n\ninference in making its findings of fact.  We find no error here.\r\n\n          C.  Strahan's right to conduct full discovery\r                    C.

Beyond\r\n\nthis bare assertion, Strahan fails  to argue further in his brief\r\n\nin support of this contention.  It is well-established that\r\n\n            issues  adverted  to   in  a  perfunctory\r\n            manner, unaccompanied  by some  effort at\r\n            developed   argumentation,   are   deemed\r\n            waived. . . .  It is not enough merely to\r\n            mention a  possible argument in  the most\r\n            skeletal  way, leaving  the  court to  do\r\n            counsel's work.  . .  .   Judges are  not\r\n            expected      to     be      mindreaders.\r\n            Consequently,   a    litigant   has    an\r\n            obligation  to  spell out  its  arguments\r\n            squarely and distinctly,  or else forever\r\n            hold its peace.\"\r\n\nKing  v.
