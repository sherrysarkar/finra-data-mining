Maravilla on brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        April 6, 2001\n\f             Per Curiam.       Daniel Joseph Maravilla has appealed\n\n from the district court's denial of his motion to correct\n\n his sentence pursuant to former Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a).1                     We\n\n affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             On September 10, 1982, Maravilla, a United States\n\n customs    officer,       along    with      Rafael   Dominguez,   a     fellow\n\n customs officer, kidnaped and murdered a money courier, who\n\n had     arrived   in   San    Juan      from    the   Dominican    Republic.\n\n Maravilla and Dominguez stole the approximately $700,000 in\n\n cash and checks that the courier had intended to deposit in\n\n a   San   Juan    bank.       As   of     September    10,   Maravilla      and\n\n Dominguez had less than $100 each in bank accounts.                       Their\n\n salaries     amounted        to    $34,000      and    $37,000     per     year\n\n respectively.      However, on the evening of September 10, they\n\n purchased, with cash, first class plane tickets and flew to\n\n Miami, carrying a briefcase containing $265,000 in cash.\n\n\n     1Maravilla was convicted in 1987 for an offense committed in\n1982.    Therefore, former Rule 35(a) applicable to offenses\ncommitted prior to November 1, 1987 pertains.          That rule\nprovided:\n\n           The court may correct an illegal sentence at\n           any time and may correct a sentence imposed\n           in an illegal manner within the time\n           provided   herein  for   the  reduction   of\n           sentence.\n\fThey paid a friend $12,000 to take $220,000 of the cash to\n\nPanama and deposit it in numbered, unnamed bank accounts.\n\nIn the weeks following, they made additional generous bank\n\ndeposits,    made    unusually   expensive      purchases    and   gave\n\ngenerous    gifts.     In   February    1983,    Maravilla    flew   to\n\nColombia with $53,700 in cash.         When stopped, he claimed not\n\nto know that he was supposed to declare cash, despite the\n\nfact that Maravilla's own customs job involved interviewing\n\npersons who made declarations of cash.           He later told three\n\ndifferent false stories about the origins of this cash.\n\n            Eventually, Maravilla was arrested, tried, and\n\nconvicted of depriving an inhabitant of the United States of\n\nhis civil rights (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 242), robbery\n\n(in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a)), transporting in\n\ninterstate commerce more than $5,000 knowing it to have been\n\nstolen (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314), concealing or\n\ndisposing of more than $5,000 which has moved in or is a\n\npart of interstate or foreign commerce, knowing it to have\n\nbeen stolen (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2315), lying to the\n\nFBI (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001), and obstruction of\n\njustice (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503).\n\n            On direct appeal, this court reversed Maravilla's\n\n§ 242 conviction, the victim not being an inhabitant of the\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fUnited States.      United States v. Maravilla, 907 F.2d 216\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).    On remand, the district court restructured\n\nthe   sentences     on   the   remaining    convictions   to   run\n\nconsecutively, rather than concurrently. Maravilla appealed\n\nfrom his resentencing, arguing that the restructuring was\n\nunconstitutionally vindictive.         We rejected that argument\n\nand affirmed the sentences.     United States v. Dominguez, 951\n\nF.2d 412 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 917 (1992).\n\n           Maravilla then began a series of pro se attacks on\n\nhis convictions and sentences.        He filed a motion for a new\n\ntrial, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.        The district court\n\ndenied the new trial motion (a decision that we affirmed on\n\nappeal).    United States v. Maravilla, 7 F.3d 219 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (per curiam) (TABLE),        cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1219\n\n(1994).    Thereafter, Maravilla moved to vacate his sentence,\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.      The district court denied the\n\n§ 2255 motion.     Maravilla v. United States, 901 F. Supp. 62\n\n(D. P.R. 1995).     We affirmed.      Maravilla v. United States,\n\n95 F.3d 1146 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (TABLE), cert.\n\ndenied, 520 U.S. 1202 (1997).          Next, Maravilla filed two\n\napplications in this court, seeking leave to file a second\n\nor successive § 2255 motion in the district court.              We\n\ndenied both applications.      Maravilla v. United States, No.\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f98-8014    (1st   Cir.    Jun.    19,   1998);    Maravilla      v.    United\n\nStates, No. 98-8021 (1st Cir. Sept. 8, 1998).\n\n           Then, Maravilla filed a habeas petition, pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in the United States District Court for\n\nthe Middle District of Florida.            That habeas petition was\n\ndismissed.    Maravilla v. Parks, No. 99-108-Civ-Oc-10C (M.D.\n\nFla. Apr. 27, 1999).             Maravilla resubmitted his habeas\n\npetition, but that petition was denied, as an impermissible\n\nattempt to circumvent the requirements imposed on second or\n\nsuccessive § 2255 motions by the Antiterrorism and Effective\n\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\").               Maravilla v. Parks,\n\nNo.   99-231-Civ-Oc-10C      (M.D.      Fla.   Aug.    20,    1999).        The\n\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling.\n\nMaravilla v. Parks, 220 F.3d 592 (11th Cir. 2000) (TABLE).\n\n           Most recently, Maravilla filed a motion, pursuant\n\nto former Criminal Rule 35(a), in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico.                He argued that the\n\nrobbery,    transporting     stolen      money,    and       concealing      or\n\ndisposing of stolen money counts were multiplicitous and\n\ncould not constitutionally support consecutive sentences\n\nunder the Double Jeopardy Clause.              He also contended that\n\nhis   conviction    and    sentence      for   lying     to    the    FBI    in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 must be vacated in light of\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506 (1995), because the\n\n element of materiality had been determined by the trial\n\n judge, not the jury.           As noted at the outset, the district\n\n court denied the Rule 35(a) motion and Maravilla appealed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n               As a threshold matter, Maravilla argues that former\n\n Rule 35(a), which authorized the district courts to correct\n\n an       illegal   sentence    \"at   any    time,\"       see   supra       note    1,\n\n effectively        permits     him   to   avoid    any    time       bar   or     the\n\n requirements that AEDPA imposes on second or successive §\n\n 2255      motions.     If     applicable,    former       Rule   35(a)       might\n\n arguably      also    permit    Maravilla    to    avoid       the    procedural\n\n default       rules    that      pertain     to      a    §     2255       motion,\n\n notwithstanding Maravilla's failure previously to raise his\n\n current claims in a timely fashion either on direct appeal\n\n or in his first § 2255 motion. 2                  See Callanan v. United\n\n      2\n      Maravilla's current claim that his consecutive sentences\nfor his § 1951(a), § 2314, and § 2315 convictions are\nunconstitutional under the Double Jeopardy Clause is similar,\nbut not identical, to his claim on appeal after resentencing\nthat    the    restructured    consecutive     sentences    were\nunconstitutionally vindictive. See United States v. Dominguez,\n951 F.2d at 414-18. Both claims that Maravilla raised in his\nmotion under former Rule 35(a) motion were first raised in his\napplication for leave to file a second or successive § 2255\nmotion, which we rejected on the ground that the issues did not\nsatisfy   the   statutory   requirements   for   the   requested\nauthorization.   Maravilla v. United States, No. 98-8014 (1st\nCir. Jun. 19, 1998). Maravilla then sought to raise his current\ndouble jeopardy claim in the habeas petition filed in the\n\n                                       -6-\n\f States, 364 U.S. 587, 589 n.3 (1961) (\"Rule 35 is available\n\n to correct an illegal sentence when the claim is based on\n\n the face of the indictment even if such claim had not been\n\n raised on direct appeal\"); United States v. Landrum, 93 F.3d\n\n 122, 125 (4th Cir. 1996) (reciting that the procedural\n\n default rules applicable to § 2255 motions do not pertain to\n\n motions brought under former Rule 35(a)).\n\n               With respect to his conviction for lying to the FBI\n\n in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, former Rule 35(a) is of no\n\n aid to Maravilla.             \"Former Rule 35(a) is limited to the\n\n correction        of   an     illegal   sentence;    it    does   not    cover\n\n arguments that the conviction is itself improper, for such\n\n arguments must be raised under § 2255.\"                    United States v.\n\n Canino, 212 F.3d 383, 384 (7th Cir. 2000).                  Notwithstanding\n\n his attempt to focus on the 5 year consecutive sentence\n\n imposed, Maravilla's objection is that his conviction under\n\n §    1001    is   improper     under    Gaudin.      The   district     court,\n\n therefore, correctly denied Maravilla's Rule 35(a) motion\n\n with respect to the Gaudin-based claim.\n\n               To the extent that Maravilla seeks to vacate his\n\n §§    2314    and      2315    convictions,       former   Rule   35(a)    is\n\n\n\n\nfederal district court in Florida. See Maravilla v. Parks, No.\n99-231-Civ-Oc-10C (M.D. Fla. Aug. 20, 1999).\n\n                                         -7-\n\funavailable, for the reasons already addressed.                   Maravilla's\n\nfiling has some flavor that what he is saying is that he\n\ncannot be constitutionally convicted both of robbery under\n\nthe Hobbs Act (§ 1951) and either transporting the stolen\n\nmoney (§ 2314) and/or concealing or disposing of that stolen\n\nmoney (§ 2315).     However, Maravilla's filing could also be\n\nread to include a claim that, apart from whether he could be\n\nconvicted   under      both    §    1951      and   §    2314    or    §    2315,\n\nconstitutionally       he     cannot     be    sentenced        and,       in   the\n\nparticulars of this case, sentenced to consecutive terms,\n\nunder both § 1951 and § 2314 or § 2315.                 In other words, the\n\n§§ 2314 and 2315 convictions could stand but each 10 year\n\nconsecutive term of imprisonment for the §§ 2314 and 2315\n\nconvictions must be vacated, leaving only the 20 year term\n\nof imprisonment for the robbery conviction.                      This latter\n\ntype of contention conceivably could be an appropriate basis\n\nfor review under former Rule 35(a).                     See Hill v. United\n\nStates,   368   U.S.    424,       430   (1962)     (remarking         that     the\n\nimposition of multiple terms for the same offense could\n\nconstitute an illegal sentence under former Rule 35(a)).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f                                  III.\n\n          Assuming     without    deciding,      that   Maravilla    may\n\nappropriately raise this double jeopardy claim in a motion\n\nunder former Rule 35(a) and is not barred from doing so now,\n\nit is nevertheless clear that the claim has no merit.                 We\n\nneed not decide whether our review is de novo or for an\n\nabuse of discretion.       Compare United States v. Gruenberg, 53\n\nF.3d   214,   215   (8th   Cir.   1995)   (per    curiam)   (abuse    of\n\ndiscretion) with United States v. Thompson, 979 F.2d 743,\n\n744 (9th Cir. 1992) (de novo).           There was neither an abuse\n\nof discretion nor an error of law in the district court's\n\ndenial of Maravilla's Rule 35(a) motion.\n\n          Maravilla has offered no authority to support his\n\ncontention that the offenses of interstate transportation\n\nand concealment/disposing of stolen money merge into the\n\noffense of the interference with commerce by robbery, so as\n\nto bar the imposition of consecutive sentences for these\n\noffenses. Maravilla points to cases that hold that one\n\ncannot be separately punished for stealing property and\n\nreceiving that same stolen property.             See, e.g., Heflin v.\n\nUnited States, 358 U.S. 415, 419-20 (1959) (finding no\n\ncongressional intent to punish multiple aspects of the same\n\ncriminal act).      But, Maravilla was not convicted of stealing\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f and    receiving   the    same    stolen    money.       Although    he\n\n characterizes his conduct as a single, if extended, criminal\n\n act -- he views his criminal conduct as simply the theft of\n\n money moving in interstate commerce -- he clearly committed\n\n several discrete criminal acts.\n\n            Maravilla     was    convicted   of     robbing   the   money\n\n courier    (§   1951),   transporting       that    stolen   money    in\n\n interstate or foreign commerce (§ 2314) and concealing or\n\n disposing of money that had moved in or was a part of\n\n interstate or foreign commerce, knowing that money to have\n\n been stolen (§ 2315).          Certainly, these statutes pass the\n\n Blockburger test.        Each offense requires proof of a fact\n\n which the other does not.        Blockburger v. United States, 284\n\n U.S. 299, 304 (1932).\n\n            As interfaced with the facts of this case: Section\n\n 1951 requires proof of the obstruction of the movement of\n\n the courier's cash and checks in commerce, by robbery.3               It\n\n    3Sections 1951(a) and (b), in the version current in 1981,\nprovided, in pertinent part:\n\n           (a) Whoever in any way or degree obstructs,\n           delays, or affects commerce or the movement\n           of any article or commodity in commerce, by\n           robbery ... shall be fined not more than\n           $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty\n           years, or both.\n\n           (b) As used in this section–\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f does   not      require    proof     that     Maravilla   also   either\n\n transported       the     money     in      interstate    commerce     or\n\n concealed/disposed of stolen money that had moved in or was\n\n part   of    interstate    or    foreign    commerce.     Section    2314\n\n requires proof that Maravilla had transported the stolen\n\n money in interstate or foreign commerce, knowing the money\n\n to have been stolen.4           It does not require that Maravilla,\n\n himself, steal the money or that he conceal/dispose of the\n\n money that had moved in or was part of interstate or foreign\n\n commerce.      And, although Maravilla did, in fact, himself,\n\n commit the robbery, he did more in \"transporting\" the stolen\n\n money in interstate commerce than simply, as he would have\n\n it, remove it from the courier's possession and carry it\n\n away from the crime scene.          Section 2315 requires proof that\n\n Maravilla concealed or disposed of the money that had moved\n\n\n                  (1) The term \"robbery\" means the\n             unlawful taking or obtaining of personal\n             property from the person ... against his\n             will, by means of ... violence....\n    4Section 2314, in the version current in 1981, provided, in\npertinent part:\n\n                  Whoever transports in interstate or\n             foreign commerce any ... securities or\n             money, of the value of $5,000 or more,\n             knowing the same to have been stolen ...\n\n             Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or\n             imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f in or was part of interstate or foreign commerce, knowing it\n\n to       have    been   stolen. 5      While it does not require that\n\n Maravilla, himself, steal the money or transport it in\n\n interstate commerce, Maravilla, did, in fact, steal the\n\n money and transport it in interstate commerce, and he did\n\n more       than    simply     remove    the    money   from    the   courier's\n\n possession and transport it in interstate commerce.\n\n                  The facts of this case evidence discrete criminal\n\n acts       that     support    separate       convictions     and    sentences.\n\n Maravilla robbed the money courier (in violation of § 1951);\n\n later that evening, he transported $265,000 of the stolen\n\n cash from San Juan to Miami (in violation of § 2314) and\n\n there paid a friend $12,000 to conceal/dispose of $220,000\n\n of the stolen cash in numbered, unnamed bank accounts in\n\n Panama (in violation of § 2315).\n\n\n\n\n      5\n     Section 2315, in the version current in 1981, provided, in\npertinent part:\n\n                      Whoever ... conceals ... or disposes of\n                 any ... securities, or money of the value of\n                 $5,000 or more, ... moving as, or which are\n                 a part of, or which constitute interstate or\n                 foreign commerce, knowing the same to have\n                 been stolen...\n\n                      Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or\n                 imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\n                                         -12-\n\f         Contrary to Maravilla's contention, transporting\n\nin interstate commerce stolen money and concealing/disposing\n\nof stolen money that has moved in or is part of interstate\n\nor foreign commerce are not lesser included offenses of\n\nrobbery under the Hobbs Act.

Daniel Joseph Maravilla has appealed\n\n from the district court's denial of his motion to correct\n\n his sentence pursuant to former Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a).1                     We\n\n affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n             On September 10, 1982, Maravilla, a United States\n\n customs    officer,       along    with      Rafael   Dominguez,   a     fellow\n\n customs officer, kidnaped and murdered a money courier, who\n\n had     arrived   in   San    Juan      from    the   Dominican    Republic.\n\n Maravilla and Dominguez stole the approximately $700,000 in\n\n cash and checks that the courier had intended to deposit in\n\n a   San   Juan    bank.       As   of     September    10,   Maravilla      and\n\n Dominguez had less than $100 each in bank accounts.                       Their\n\n salaries     amounted        to    $34,000      and    $37,000     per     year\n\n respectively.      However, on the evening of September 10, they\n\n purchased, with cash, first class plane tickets and flew to\n\n Miami, carrying a briefcase containing $265,000 in cash.\n\n\n     1Maravilla was convicted in 1987 for an offense committed in\n1982.    Therefore, former Rule 35(a) applicable to offenses\ncommitted prior to November 1, 1987 pertains.          That rule\nprovided:\n\n           The court may correct an illegal sentence at\n           any time and may correct a sentence imposed\n           in an illegal manner within the time\n           provided   herein  for   the  reduction   of\n           sentence.\n\fThey paid a friend $12,000 to take $220,000 of the cash to\n\nPanama and deposit it in numbered, unnamed bank accounts.\n\nIn the weeks following, they made additional generous bank\n\ndeposits,    made    unusually   expensive      purchases    and   gave\n\ngenerous    gifts.     In   February    1983,    Maravilla    flew   to\n\nColombia with $53,700 in cash.         When stopped, he claimed not\n\nto know that he was supposed to declare cash, despite the\n\nfact that Maravilla's own customs job involved interviewing\n\npersons who made declarations of cash.           He later told three\n\ndifferent false stories about the origins of this cash.\n\n            Eventually, Maravilla was arrested, tried, and\n\nconvicted of depriving an inhabitant of the United States of\n\nhis civil rights (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 242), robbery\n\n(in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a)), transporting in\n\ninterstate commerce more than $5,000 knowing it to have been\n\nstolen (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2314), concealing or\n\ndisposing of more than $5,000 which has moved in or is a\n\npart of interstate or foreign commerce, knowing it to have\n\nbeen stolen (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2315), lying to the\n\nFBI (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001), and obstruction of\n\njustice (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503).\n\n            On direct appeal, this court reversed Maravilla's\n\n§ 242 conviction, the victim not being an inhabitant of the\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fUnited States.

He argued that the\n\nrobbery,    transporting     stolen      money,    and       concealing      or\n\ndisposing of stolen money counts were multiplicitous and\n\ncould not constitutionally support consecutive sentences\n\nunder the Double Jeopardy Clause.              He also contended that\n\nhis   conviction    and    sentence      for   lying     to    the    FBI    in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 must be vacated in light of\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f United States v.

As noted at the outset, the district\n\n court denied the Rule 35(a) motion and Maravilla appealed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n               As a threshold matter, Maravilla argues that former\n\n Rule 35(a), which authorized the district courts to correct\n\n an       illegal   sentence    \"at   any    time,\"       see   supra       note    1,\n\n effectively        permits     him   to   avoid    any    time       bar   or     the\n\n requirements that AEDPA imposes on second or successive §\n\n 2255      motions.     If     applicable,    former       Rule   35(a)       might\n\n arguably      also    permit    Maravilla    to    avoid       the    procedural\n\n default       rules    that      pertain     to      a    §     2255       motion,\n\n notwithstanding Maravilla's failure previously to raise his\n\n current claims in a timely fashion either on direct appeal\n\n or in his first § 2255 motion. 2                  See Callanan v. United\n\n      2\n      Maravilla's current claim that his consecutive sentences\nfor his § 1951(a), § 2314, and § 2315 convictions are\nunconstitutional under the Double Jeopardy Clause is similar,\nbut not identical, to his claim on appeal after resentencing\nthat    the    restructured    consecutive     sentences    were\nunconstitutionally vindictive. See United States v. Dominguez,\n951 F.2d at 414-18. Both claims that Maravilla raised in his\nmotion under former Rule 35(a) motion were first raised in his\napplication for leave to file a second or successive § 2255\nmotion, which we rejected on the ground that the issues did not\nsatisfy   the   statutory   requirements   for   the   requested\nauthorization.

Notwithstanding\n\n his attempt to focus on the 5 year consecutive sentence\n\n imposed, Maravilla's objection is that his conviction under\n\n §    1001    is   improper     under    Gaudin.      The   district     court,\n\n therefore, correctly denied Maravilla's Rule 35(a) motion\n\n with respect to the Gaudin-based claim.\n\n               To the extent that Maravilla seeks to vacate his\n\n §§    2314    and      2315    convictions,       former   Rule   35(a)    is\n\n\n\n\nfederal district court in Florida.

Maravilla's\n\nfiling has some flavor that what he is saying is that he\n\ncannot be constitutionally convicted both of robbery under\n\nthe Hobbs Act (§ 1951) and either transporting the stolen\n\nmoney (§ 2314) and/or concealing or disposing of that stolen\n\nmoney (§ 2315).     However, Maravilla's filing could also be\n\nread to include a claim that, apart from whether he could be\n\nconvicted   under      both    §    1951      and   §    2314    or    §    2315,\n\nconstitutionally       he     cannot     be    sentenced        and,       in   the\n\nparticulars of this case, sentenced to consecutive terms,\n\nunder both § 1951 and § 2314 or § 2315.                 In other words, the\n\n§§ 2314 and 2315 convictions could stand but each 10 year\n\nconsecutive term of imprisonment for the §§ 2314 and 2315\n\nconvictions must be vacated, leaving only the 20 year term\n\nof imprisonment for the robbery conviction.                      This latter\n\ntype of contention conceivably could be an appropriate basis\n\nfor review under former Rule 35(a).                     See Hill v.

There was neither an abuse\n\nof discretion nor an error of law in the district court's\n\ndenial of Maravilla's Rule 35(a) motion.\n\n          Maravilla has offered no authority to support his\n\ncontention that the offenses of interstate transportation\n\nand concealment/disposing of stolen money merge into the\n\noffense of the interference with commerce by robbery, so as\n\nto bar the imposition of consecutive sentences for these\n\noffenses. Maravilla points to cases that hold that one\n\ncannot be separately punished for stealing property and\n\nreceiving that same stolen property.             See, e.g., Heflin v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105826\"><a href=\"/opinion/105826/heflin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 419-20 (1959) (finding no\n\ncongressional intent to punish multiple aspects of the same\n\ncriminal act).      But, Maravilla was not convicted of stealing\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f and    receiving   the    same    stolen    money.       Although    he\n\n characterizes his conduct as a single, if extended, criminal\n\n act -- he views his criminal conduct as simply the theft of\n\n money moving in interstate commerce -- he clearly committed\n\n several discrete criminal acts.\n\n            Maravilla     was    convicted   of     robbing   the   money\n\n courier    (§   1951),   transporting       that    stolen   money    in\n\n interstate or foreign commerce (§ 2314) and concealing or\n\n disposing of money that had moved in or was a part of\n\n interstate or foreign commerce, knowing that money to have\n\n been stolen (§ 2315).          Certainly, these statutes pass the\n\n Blockburger test.        Each offense requires proof of a fact\n\n which the other does not.        Blockburger v.

Section    2314\n\n requires proof that Maravilla had transported the stolen\n\n money in interstate or foreign commerce, knowing the money\n\n to have been stolen.4           It does not require that Maravilla,\n\n himself, steal the money or that he conceal/dispose of the\n\n money that had moved in or was part of interstate or foreign\n\n commerce.      And, although Maravilla did, in fact, himself,\n\n commit the robbery, he did more in \"transporting\" the stolen\n\n money in interstate commerce than simply, as he would have\n\n it, remove it from the courier's possession and carry it\n\n away from the crime scene.          Section 2315 requires proof that\n\n Maravilla concealed or disposed of the money that had moved\n\n\n                  (1) The term \"robbery\" means the\n             unlawful taking or obtaining of personal\n             property from the person ... against his\n             will, by means of ... violence....\n    4Section 2314, in the version current in 1981, provided, in\npertinent part:\n\n                  Whoever transports in interstate or\n             foreign commerce any ... securities or\n             money, of the value of $5,000 or more,\n             knowing the same to have been stolen ...\n\n             Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or\n             imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f in or was part of interstate or foreign commerce, knowing it\n\n to       have    been   stolen. 5      While it does not require that\n\n Maravilla, himself, steal the money or transport it in\n\n interstate commerce, Maravilla, did, in fact, steal the\n\n money and transport it in interstate commerce, and he did\n\n more       than    simply     remove    the    money   from    the   courier's\n\n possession and transport it in interstate commerce.\n\n                  The facts of this case evidence discrete criminal\n\n acts       that     support    separate       convictions     and    sentences.\n\n Maravilla robbed the money courier (in violation of § 1951);\n\n later that evening, he transported $265,000 of the stolen\n\n cash from San Juan to Miami (in violation of § 2314) and\n\n there paid a friend $12,000 to conceal/dispose of $220,000\n\n of the stolen cash in numbered, unnamed bank accounts in\n\n Panama (in violation of § 2315).\n\n\n\n\n      5\n     Section 2315, in the version current in 1981, provided, in\npertinent part:\n\n                      Whoever ... conceals ... or disposes of\n                 any ... securities, or money of the value of\n                 $5,000 or more, ... moving as, or which are\n                 a part of, or which constitute interstate or\n                 foreign commerce, knowing the same to have\n                 been stolen...\n\n                      Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or\n                 imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\n\n                                         -12-\n\f         Contrary to Maravilla's contention, transporting\n\nin interstate commerce stolen money and concealing/disposing\n\nof stolen money that has moved in or is part of interstate\n\nor foreign commerce are not lesser included offenses of\n\nrobbery under the Hobbs Act.   There was no double jeopardy\n\nviolation in the district court's imposition of consecutive\n\nsentences for these convictions.\n\n         The district court's denial of the motion filed\n\nunder former Rule 35(a) is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -13-\n\f</pre>",
