Upon careful  review  of the  briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nrecord, we  conclude that  the pat-frisk  of defendant  was a\r\n\npermissible  search and that  district court correctly denied\r\n\nsuppression of  the evidence discovered  during that  search.\r\n\nWe  reach  this   conclusion  essentially  for   the  reasons\r\n\nexpressed by the  district court in its order dated September\r\n\n9, 1996.   We  thus reject defendant's appellate  contentions\r\n\nthat the officers  lacked a reasonable suspicion  grounded in\r\n\nspecific and articulable facts to justify the search and that\r\n\nthe  officer conducting the search personally did not possess\r\n\nsuch a reasonable suspicion.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
