Gen.  L.  ch.  175E,     4(d).   It  is  claimed  this\r\n\nrequirement  is irrational on its  face and thus violates the\r\n\nEqual   Protection  Clause   of  the   Fourteenth  Amendment.\r\n\nPlaintiffs also assert that  the statute on its face  results\r\n\nin an unconstitutional taking  in violation of the  Fifth and\r\n\nFourteenth Amendments.\r\n\n          Plaintiff  Basimah Abdullah  lives  in the  Roxbury\r\n\nsection of Boston  and is aggrieved  that policy holders  who\r\n\nlive  in Roxbury, a mostly  poor community of  color, may pay\r\n\nautomobile insurance  rates more than  two and  a half  times\r\n\nmore  than those paid by  policy holders with similar driving\r\n\nrecords  who live  in  Wellesley, Massachusetts,  an affluent\r\n\nsuburb of Boston.  She is joined as plaintiff by the National\r\n\nAssociation  of African  Americans, Inc.    After considering\r\n\ncross-motions for  summary judgment on stipulated  facts, the\r\n\ndistrict court granted the  defendants' motion and denied the\r\n\nplaintiffs' motion.  We affirm.\r\n\n          It  is important  to be  clear about  the challenge\r\n\nplaintiffs  have chosen to mount.  This is a facial challenge\r\n\nto  the   statute.    Plaintiffs  have   stipulated  that  no\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nfundamental  right is  involved in  the litigation  and their\r\n\nchallenge does  not  involve claims  of race  discrimination.\r\n\nThey do  not challenge the  group discount provisions  of the\r\n\ninsurance  regulatory  scheme, although  they  do attempt  to\r\n\nbring those issues to the attention of the court.  Plaintiffs\r\n\nhave  appropriately  stipulated   that  insurance  risk  does\r\n\ncorrelate  with the territory in which the insured lives.  In\r\n\nlight  of  these  stipulations  and the  very  narrow  review\r\n\navailable   in  a   constitutional   challenge  to   economic\r\n\nregulation  by a state, grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\n\nthe defendants was plainly correct.\r\n\n          The challenged statute requires:\r\n\n          For  motor  vehicle insurance  rates, the\r\n          commissioner     shall    establish     a\r\n          classification   of  risks   which  shall\r\n          include  a designation  of not  less than\r\n          fifteen territories.\r\n\nMass. Gen. L. ch. 175E,   4(d).\r\n\n          In order  to prevail, the plaintiffs  would have to\r\n\nshow  that   the  establishment  of  a   minimum  of  fifteen\r\n\nterritories for use in classifying automobile insurance risks\r\n\ncould  not be rational.   See Members of  the City Council v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nTaxpayers for  Vincent, 466  U.S. 789,  796 (1984).   Indeed,\r                                  \r\n\nplaintiffs would have  to show that  no set of  circumstances\r\n\nexist  under which the statute could be validly applied.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nReno  v. Flores, 507 U.S.  292, 301 (1993)  (facial attack on\r                           \r\n\ndue process  grounds).   Plaintiffs make two  arguments, both\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ndemonstrating a  misunderstanding of the role  of the federal\r\n\ncourts in  reviewing state  economic regulation.   They argue\r\n\nthat because  there is  no legislative history  setting forth\r\n\nthe statute's  purpose  and  because  the  statute  allegedly\r\n\nresults in unfairness it is unconstitutional.\r\n\n           Plaintiffs   seek  to   reverse  the   burdens  in\r\n\nconstitutional  economic regulation litigation by saying that\r\n\nthe  state, in a  situation where  no fundamental  rights are\r\n\ninvolved,  must provide  legislative  history explaining  the\r\n\npurpose  of  its  choice of  classifications.    Cf. City  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nRichmond v. J.  A. Croson  Co., 488 U.S.  469, 500-04  (1989)\r                                          \r\n\n(when  legislature  employs  suspect   classification,  court\r\n\nreviews  legislative findings  to support  the discrimination\r\n\nvisited).   In  the  absence of  legislative history  plainly\r\n\nexplaining the purpose  of an economic regulatory  provision,\r\n\nthe  plaintiffs posit,  the statute  must be  presumed  to be\r\n\nirrational.    But  there  is  no  such  requirement  and  no\r\n\npresumption.    The Constitution  does  not  impose on  state\r\n\nlegislatures   the  requirement  of  creating  a  legislative\r\n\nhistory  record to  justify economic  regulatory legislation.\r\n\nSee  FCC v.  Beach Communications,  Inc., 508  U.S. 307,  315\r                                                    \r\n\n(1993)  (\"we never  require a  legislature to  articulate its\r\n\nreasons for enacting a statute\").\r\n\n          Plaintiffs who  claim a statute  is irrational bear\r\n\nthe burden of showing that it is so.  Id.

That showing  of irrationality  is not\r\n\nmade  by  simple  arguments  of perceived  unfairness.    The\r\n\nstatutory  scheme  must  stand  so long  as  it  bears  \"some\r\n\nrational relationship  to a  legitimate state purpose.\"   San\r                                                                         \r\n\nAntonio Indep.  Sch.  Dist.  v. Rodriguez,  411  U.S.  1,  44\r                                                     \r\n\n(1973).    We cannot  say that  on  its face  the legislative\r\n\nchoice   of  requiring  at   least  fifteen   territories  is\r\n\nirrational.    It  is  evident  that  insureds  in  different\r\n\nterritories pose different risks and it is rational to permit\r\n\nthe  insurance companies  to  set premiums  to reflect  those\r\n\ndifferent risks.   The choice by  the legislature to  mandate\r\n\nthe establishment of at least fifteen territories may reflect\r\n\na  judgment that  that number  will provide  some approximate\r\n\nreflection of the proper number of categories into which this\r\n\ntype of risk should be divided.  That the state has chosen to\r\n\nclassify  purchasers   into  groupings  based   on  objective\r\n\ncharacteristics  and to use such groupings as a base on which\r\n\nto set rates is surely rational and promotes a more equitable\r\n\ninsurance system.\r\n\n          In fact,  the Commissioner has chosen  to create 27\r\n\nterritories, a decision which is  also rational on the theory\r\n\nthat somewhat more territories  more closely reflect the risk\r\n\nassociated  with the  residents  of those  territories.   The\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nparties have  appropriately stipulated that the  risk of loss\r\n\n\"varies  according  to  the   town  in  which  the  [insured]\r\n\nvehicle[]  [is]   principally  garaged.\"     They  have  also\r\n\nstipulated  that each  state  uses some  form of  territorial\r\n\nsubdivision system to  set rates and such  use of territorial\r\n\nassignment has  existed in this  country since  1917.   Prior\r\n\nrate-setting schemes in Massachusetts, also implementing some\r\n\nform   of   territorial   system,   have  twice   been   held\r\n\nconstitutional  by   the  state  courts.     See  Doherty  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCommissioner of Ins., 102  N.E.2d 496 (Mass. 1951);  Brest v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCommissioner of Ins., 169 N.E. 657 (Mass. 1930).\r                                \r\n\n           The  scheme itself  has  been tested  in a  manner\r\n\nconsonant  with  democracy.    Prior  unhappiness  about  the\r\n\nterritorial rating system once  led to an initiative petition\r\n\nwhich  would have  abolished  the use  of  territories.   The\r\n\nvoters rejected the  petition by  a margin of  three to  one.\r\n\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts Election Statistics,  Pub. Doc.\r                                                             \r\n\nNo.  43,  at 343-45  (1950).    The Commissioner  establishes\r\n\nterritories  in  a  public  proceeding which  is  subject  to\r\n\njudicial  review,  and we  do  not  understand plaintiffs  to\r\n\ncomplain about these procedures.   Indeed, the federal courts\r\n\nwould  abstain  from considering  the constitutionality  of a\r\n\nparticular   decision  of   the  Commissioner   defining  the\r\n\nterritories or  setting particular rates.   See Allstate Ins.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.  v. Sabbagh, 603 F.2d 228, 233 (1st Cir. 1979) (affirming\r                           \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\ndecision of district court to abstain from such a suit due to\r\n\nintensity of  local  interest and  because Massachusetts  had\r\n\n\"indicated  the  importance  it  place[d]  on  coherency   by\r\n\nconcentrating review  of  all  regulatory  decisions  in  one\r\n\ncourt\").\r\n\n          Even  consideration of  the  facts surrounding  Ms.\r\n\nAbdullah's   individual  situation  does  not  establish  the\r\n\nirrationality  of the  statute.  The territory  in which  Ms.\r\n\nAbdullah lives,  the Roxbury section of  Boston, does reflect\r\n\ngreater insurance risks than the territory  she has chosen as\r\n\na comparator, the territory  including the town of Wellesley,\r\n\nMassachusetts.  The  parties agree that in  1993, the Roxbury\r\n\nterritory, Territory  22, had 3.5 times the  state average of\r\n\nbodily   injury  claims,   while  the   Wellesley  territory,\r\n\nTerritory 2,  had half the claims.   Further, if one looks at\r\n\nbodily injury  per 100  accidents, the statewide  average was\r\n\n30.6.  The  territory in  which Ms. Abdullah  lives had  56.6\r\n\nbodily  injuries  per  100  accidents,  while  the  Wellesley\r\n\nterritory had 17.4.   As a final example,  although insurance\r\n\ncoverage for theft is  not compulsory (see Mass. Gen.  L. ch.\r                                                      \r\n\n90,     34A,  34B,  34O; ch.  175,    113O),  in  the Roxbury\r\n\nterritory, the theft  rate is five  times the state  average,\r\n\nwhile the  rate in  the Wellesley  territory is  one-half the\r\n\nstate average.   These statistics support  the rationality of\r\n\nthe statutory scheme. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n           Plaintiffs'  efforts  to  bootstrap   their  Equal\r\n\nProtection  claim  into  some  form of  takings  analysis  is\r\n\nneither  supported by the case law nor the facts.  Plaintiffs\r\n\nargue  that  because  some  ratings schemes  have  been  held\r\n\nunconstitutionally  confiscatory to the  insurance company if\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe scheme deprives the company of an opportunity  to achieve\r\n\na  fair return, see Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. v. Commissioner\r                                                                         \r\n\nof Ins., 263 N.E.2d  698, 703 (Mass. 1970), Ms.  Abdullah may\r                   \r\n\nassert a claim  that the  premiums she pays  as an  insurance\r\n\npurchaser   are  so   high   as  to   be   unconstitutionally\r\n\nconfiscatory.  Without accepting  the premise of the argument\r\n\nor its leap from the property rights of a regulated insurance\r\n\ncompany to  the premiums  paid  by an  insured, the  argument\r\n\nsuffers from fatal flaws.   The facts asserted in  support of\r\n\nthe argument are not properly before us.  Ms. Abdullah states\r\n\nin her brief before this court  that she pays more than  one-\r\n\nthird  of the value of her car to insure it each year.  This,\r\n\nshe says, effectively denies  her the use of her  automobile,\r\n\nas the Massachusetts legislature requires that automobiles be\r\n\ninsured in order to be  operated on a public way.   See Mass.\r                                                                   \r\n\nGen. L. ch. 90,   34B.  And without a car, Ms. Abdullah says,\r\n\nher constitutional  right to  travel is infringed.   However,\r\n\nthe parties agreed to litigate this case on stipulated facts.\r\n\nThe  only  facts  with  respect to  Ms.  Abdullah's  personal\r\n\ncircumstances  that  are  properly  before us  are  that  she\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n\"resides .  . . in  the Roxbury section of  Boston,\" that she\r\n\n\"owns  a private  passenger  automobile which  is garaged  in\r\n\nRoxbury  and is insured . . . under the compulsory automobile\r\n\ninsurance  laws of  the Commonwealth,\"  and that  the average\r\n\nrate  for the standard package of insurance was higher in the\r\n\nRoxbury territory than in the Wellesley territory.\r\n\n          Even were there  facts in the record to support Ms.\r\n\nAbdullah's   claim,   the   argument   collapses   because  a\r\n\nfoundational piece is missing.  The statutory provision under\r\n\nattack  does not per se  result in any  particular rate being\r\n\nset  or premium being charged.  It simply requires that there\r\n\nbe at  least fifteen territories  used in assessment  of risk\r\n\nfactors,  and  plaintiffs do  not  attempt to  show  that any\r\n\npossible  designation of  fifteen or  more territories  would\r\n\nresult in  a confiscatory rate  for Ms. Abdullah.   Moreover,\r\n\nother  risk  factors such  as  driver  class (which  includes\r\n\nnumber of  years of  driving experience) and  group discounts\r\n\nalso  go into the assessment  of an individual's  rates.

Mass.Gen. L. ch. 175E, &#167; 4(d).  It is claimed this requirement is irrational on its face and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

She is joined as plaintiff by the National Association of African Americans, Inc.  After considering cross-motions for summary judgment on stipulated facts, the district court granted the defendants' motion and denied the plaintiffs' motion.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to be clear about the challenge plaintiffs have chosen to mount.  This is a facial challenge to the statute.  Plaintiffs have stipulated that no fundamental right is involved in the litigation and their challenge does not involve claims of race discrimination.  They do not challenge the group discount provisions of the insurance regulatory scheme, although they do attempt to bring those issues to the attention of the court.  Plaintiffs have appropriately stipulated that insurance risk does correlate with the territory in which the insured lives.  In light of these stipulations and the very narrow review available in a constitutional challenge to economic regulation by a state, grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was plainly correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The challenged statute requires:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>For motor vehicle insurance rates, the commissioner shall establish a classification of risks which shall include a designation of not less than fifteen territories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.Gen.

See Members of the City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 796, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2124, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984).  Indeed, plaintiffs would have to show that no set of circumstances exist under which the statute could be validly applied.  See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 1446, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) (facial attack on due process grounds).  Plaintiffs make two arguments, both demonstrating a misunderstanding of the role of the federal courts in reviewing state economic regulation.  They argue that because there is no legislative history setting forth the statute's purpose and because the statute allegedly results in unfairness it is unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek to reverse the burdens in constitutional economic regulation litigation by saying that the state, in a situation where no fundamental rights are involved, must provide legislative history explaining the purpose of its choice of classifications.  Cf. City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 500-04, 109 S.Ct. 706, 725-27, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (when legislature employs suspect classification, court reviews legislative findings to support the discrimination visited).  In the absence of legislative history plainly explaining the purpose of an economic regulatory provision, the plaintiffs posit, the statute must be presumed to be irrational.  But there is no such requirement and no presumption.  The Constitution does not impose on state legislatures the requirement of creating a legislative history record to justify economic regulatory legislation.  See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 2102, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993) (\"we never require a legislature to articulate its reasons for enacting a statute\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs who claim a statute is irrational bear the burden of showing that it is so.  Id.  (\"[T]hose attacking the rationality ... have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\"  (internal quotation omitted)).  That showing of irrationality is not made by simple arguments of perceived unfairness.  The statutory scheme must stand so long as it bears \"some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.\"   San Antonio Indep.  Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 44, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1302, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).  We cannot say that on its face the legislative choice of requiring at least fifteen territories is irrational.  It is evident that insureds in different territories pose different risks and it is rational to permit the insurance companies to set premiums to reflect those different risks.  The choice by the legislature to mandate the establishment of at least fifteen territories may reflect a judgment that that number will provide some approximate reflection of the proper number of categories into which this type of risk should be divided.  That the state has chosen to classify purchasers into groupings based on objective characteristics and to use such groupings as a base on which to set rates is surely rational and promotes a more equitable insurance system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the Commissioner has chosen to create 27 territories, a decision which is also rational on the theory that somewhat more territories more closely reflect the risk associated with the residents of those territories.  The parties have appropriately stipulated that the risk of loss \"varies according to the town in which the [insured] vehicle[ ] [is] principally garaged.\"   They have also stipulated that each state uses some form of territorial subdivision system to set rates and such use of territorial assignment has existed in this country since 1917.  Prior rate-setting schemes in Massachusetts, also implementing some form of territorial system, have twice been held constitutional by the state courts.  See Doherty v. Commissioner of Ins., 328 Mass. 161, 102 N.E.2d 496 (1951);  Brest v. Commissioner of Ins., 270 Mass. 7, 169 N.E. 657 (1930).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme itself has been tested in a manner consonant with democracy.  Prior unhappiness about the territorial rating system once led to an initiative petition which would have abolished the use of territories.  The voters rejected the petition by a margin of three to one.  Commonwealth of Massachusetts Election Statistics, Pub. Doc.  No. 43, at 343-45 (1950).  The Commissioner establishes territories in a public proceeding which is subject to judicial review, and we do not understand plaintiffs to complain about these procedures.  Indeed, the federal courts would abstain from considering the constitutionality of a particular decision of the Commissioner defining the territories or setting particular rates.  See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Sabbagh, 603 F.2d 228, 233 (1st Cir.1979) (affirming decision of district court to abstain from such a suit due to intensity of local interest and because Massachusetts had \"indicated the importance it place[d] on coherency by concentrating review of all regulatory decisions in one court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even consideration of the facts surrounding Ms. Abdullah's individual situation does not establish the irrationality of the statute.  The territory in which Ms. Abdullah lives, the Roxbury section of Boston, does reflect greater insurance risks than the territory she has chosen as a comparator, the territory including the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts.  The parties agree that in 1993, the Roxbury territory, Territory 22, had 3.5 times the state average of bodily injury claims, while the Wellesley territory, Territory 2, had half the claims.  Further, if one looks at bodily injury per 100 accidents, the statewide average was 30.6.  The territory in which Ms. Abdullah lives had 56.6 bodily injuries per 100 accidents, while the Wellesley territory had 17.4.  As a final example, although insurance coverage for theft is not compulsory (see Mass.Gen. L. ch. 90, &#167;&#167; 34A, 34B, 34O;  ch. 175, &#167; 113O), in the Roxbury territory, the theft rate is five times the state average, while the rate in the Wellesley territory is one-half the state average.  These statistics support the rationality of the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' efforts to bootstrap their Equal Protection claim into some form of takings analysis is neither supported by the case law nor the facts.  Plaintiffs argue that because some ratings schemes have been held unconstitutionally confiscatory to the insurance company if the scheme deprives the company of an opportunity to achieve a fair return, see Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. v. Commissioner of Ins., 358 Mass. 272, 263 N.E.2d 698, 703 (1970), Ms. Abdullah may assert a claim that the premiums she pays as an insurance purchaser are so high as to be unconstitutionally confiscatory.  Without accepting the premise of the argument or its leap from the property rights of a regulated insurance company to the premiums paid by an insured, the argument suffers from fatal flaws.  The facts asserted in support of the argument are not properly before us.  Ms. Abdullah states in her brief before this court that she pays more than one-third of the value of her car to insure it each year.  This, she says, effectively denies her the use of her automobile, as the Massachusetts legislature requires that automobiles be insured in order to be operated on a public way.  See Mass.Gen. L. ch. 90, &#167; 34B.  And without a car, Ms. Abdullah says, her constitutional right to travel is infringed.  However, the parties agreed to litigate this case on stipulated facts.  The only facts with respect to Ms. Abdullah's personal circumstances that are properly before us are that she \"resides ... in the Roxbury section of Boston,\" that she \"owns a private passenger automobile which is garaged in Roxbury and is insured ... under the compulsory automobile insurance laws of the Commonwealth,\" and that the average rate for the standard package of insurance was higher in the Roxbury territory than in the Wellesley territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were there facts in the record to support Ms. Abdullah's claim, the argument collapses because a foundational piece is missing.  The statutory provision under attack does not per se result in any particular rate being set or premium being charged.  It simply requires that there be at least fifteen territories used in assessment of risk factors, and plaintiffs do not attempt to show that any possible designation of fifteen or more territories would result in a confiscatory rate for Ms. Abdullah.  Moreover, other risk factors such as driver class (which includes number of years of driving experience) and group discounts also go into the assessment of an individual's rates.  The facts before the court do not establish a causal connection between the statute facially attacked and the rates claimed to be confiscatory.  In essence, plaintiff's argument inappropriately asks us to turn this facial challenge to the statute into an as applied challenge.  Cf. Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 494-95, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 1246-47, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1987) (in facial challenge, \"mere enactment\" of the statute must deprive plaintiff of economically viable use of her real property);  Gilbert v. City of Cambridge, 932 F.2d 51, 56 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 866, 112 S.Ct. 192, 116 L.Ed.2d 153 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' claim at bottom is that the system is unfair.

It is evident that insureds in different territories pose different risks and it is rational to permit the insurance companies to set premiums to reflect those different risks.  The choice by the legislature to mandate the establishment of at least fifteen territories may reflect a judgment that that number will provide some approximate reflection of the proper number of categories into which this type of risk should be divided.  That the state has chosen to classify purchasers into groupings based on objective characteristics and to use such groupings as a base on which to set rates is surely rational and promotes a more equitable insurance system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the Commissioner has chosen to create 27 territories, a decision which is also rational on the theory that somewhat more territories more closely reflect the risk associated with the residents of those territories.  The parties have appropriately stipulated that the risk of loss \"varies according to the town in which the [insured] vehicle[ ] [is] principally garaged.\"   They have also stipulated that each state uses some form of territorial subdivision system to set rates and such use of territorial assignment has existed in this country since 1917.  Prior rate-setting schemes in Massachusetts, also implementing some form of territorial system, have twice been held constitutional by the state courts.  See Doherty v.

Prior unhappiness about the territorial rating system once led to an initiative petition which would have abolished the use of territories.  The voters rejected the petition by a margin of three to one.  Commonwealth of Massachusetts Election Statistics, Pub. Doc.  No. 43, at 343-45 (1950).  The Commissioner establishes territories in a public proceeding which is subject to judicial review, and we do not understand plaintiffs to complain about these procedures.  Indeed, the federal courts would abstain from considering the constitutionality of a particular decision of the Commissioner defining the territories or setting particular rates.  See Allstate Ins. Co. v.

The territory in which Ms. Abdullah lives, the Roxbury section of Boston, does reflect greater insurance risks than the territory she has chosen as a comparator, the territory including the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts.  The parties agree that in 1993, the Roxbury territory, Territory 22, had 3.5 times the state average of bodily injury claims, while the Wellesley territory, Territory 2, had half the claims.  Further, if one looks at bodily injury per 100 accidents, the statewide average was 30.6.  The territory in which Ms. Abdullah lives had 56.6 bodily injuries per 100 accidents, while the Wellesley territory had 17.4.  As a final example, although insurance coverage for theft is not compulsory (see Mass.Gen. L. ch. 90, &#167;&#167; 34A, 34B, 34O;  ch. 175, &#167; 113O), in the Roxbury territory, the theft rate is five times the state average, while the rate in the Wellesley territory is one-half the state average.  These statistics support the rationality of the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' efforts to bootstrap their Equal Protection claim into some form of takings analysis is neither supported by the case law nor the facts.  Plaintiffs argue that because some ratings schemes have been held unconstitutionally confiscatory to the insurance company if the scheme deprives the company of an opportunity to achieve a fair return, see Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. v. Commissioner of Ins., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2195788\"><a href=\"/opinion/2195788/the-aetna-casualty-surety-co-v-commr-of-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2195788\"><a href=\"/opinion/2195788/the-aetna-casualty-surety-co-v-commr-of-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 703 (1970), Ms. Abdullah may assert a claim that the premiums she pays as an insurance purchaser are so high as to be unconstitutionally confiscatory.  Without accepting the premise of the argument or its leap from the property rights of a regulated insurance company to the premiums paid by an insured, the argument suffers from fatal flaws.  The facts asserted in support of the argument are not properly before us.  Ms. Abdullah states in her brief before this court that she pays more than one-third of the value of her car to insure it each year.  This, she says, effectively denies her the use of her automobile, as the Massachusetts legislature requires that automobiles be insured in order to be operated on a public way.  See Mass.Gen. L. ch. 90, &#167; 34B.  And without a car, Ms. Abdullah says, her constitutional right to travel is infringed.  However, the parties agreed to litigate this case on stipulated facts.  The only facts with respect to Ms. Abdullah's personal circumstances that are properly before us are that she \"resides ... in the Roxbury section of Boston,\" that she \"owns a private passenger automobile which is garaged in Roxbury and is insured ... under the compulsory automobile insurance laws of the Commonwealth,\" and that the average rate for the standard package of insurance was higher in the Roxbury territory than in the Wellesley territory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were there facts in the record to support Ms. Abdullah's claim, the argument collapses because a foundational piece is missing.  The statutory provision under attack does not per se result in any particular rate being set or premium being charged.  It simply requires that there be at least fifteen territories used in assessment of risk factors, and plaintiffs do not attempt to show that any possible designation of fifteen or more territories would result in a confiscatory rate for Ms. Abdullah.  Moreover, other risk factors such as driver class (which includes number of years of driving experience) and group discounts also go into the assessment of an individual's rates.  The facts before the court do not establish a causal connection between the statute facially attacked and the rates claimed to be confiscatory.  In essence, plaintiff's argument inappropriately asks us to turn this facial challenge to the statute into an as applied challenge.  Cf. Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111839\"><a href=\"/opinion/111839/keystone-bituminous-coal-assn-v-debenedictis/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 494-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111839\"><a href=\"/opinion/111839/keystone-bituminous-coal-assn-v-debenedictis/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It may or may not be.  There is evidence submitted by the defendants that in fact the Commissioner has required certain non-urban areas essentially to subsidize the insurance of persons, such as Ms. Abdullah, living in highly urban areas.  Importantly, however, the question of fairness is not properly addressed to this court.  Those arguments should be made to the state insurance regulatory authorities or to the Massachusetts legislature or directly to the citizenry through the petition process.  Our review is restricted to whether there is any rational basis for this scheme.  There is, and the constitutional challenge must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
