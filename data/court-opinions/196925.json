See 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1)  &amp;\r                                                \r\n\n(b)(1)(B),  860(a);   18  U.S.C.     2.1    They  challenged  the\r\n\nconstitutionality of section 860(a), but the district court ruled\r\n\nagainst them.   See United States v. Salmiento, 898  F. Supp. 45,\r                                                        \r\n\n46-48  (D.P.R. 1996).    They then  pled  guilty to  the  charge,\r\n\nreserving  the right  to revisit  the constitutional  question on\r\n\nappeal.  The lower court sentenced them under 21 U.S.C.   841(b),\r\n\nmaking use of  the enhancement  directed by 21  U.S.C.    860(a).\r\n\nThese proceedings followed.\r\n\n          We review  the constitutionality of an  Act of Congress\r\n\nde novo.   See United  States v. Gifford,  17 F.3d 462,  472 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1994).  The statute that the appellants challenge, 21 U.S.C.\r\n\n  860(a), by its terms applies to some    but not all   offenders\r\n\nwho  manufacture or  distribute, or  who possess  with intent  to\r\n\nmanufacture   or   distribute,  controlled   substances,  thereby\r\n\nviolating 21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1).   The selection  process under\r\n\nsection  860(a)  operates  by   plucking  from  the  mine-run  of\r\n\nmiscreants who  violate section 841(a)(1) those  whose crimes are\r\n\ncommitted within 1,000 feet of a school  and essentially doubling\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1We   reproduce  the  relevant   text  of  sections  860(a),\r\n841(a)(1), and  841(b)(1)(B) in the appendix.   18 U.S.C.   2 is,\r\nof  course, the  familiar  statute that  criminalizes aiding  and\r\nabetting, and we see no need to reprint it.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthe maximum  available punishment.    Thus, section  860(a) is  a\r\n\nsentence-enhancer, pure and simple.\r\n\n          The defendants contend  that this  sentence-enhancement\r\n\nscheme runs afoul of  the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const.  art. I,  \r\n\n8,  cl.  3, because  Congress lacked  power  under the  Clause to\r\n\nlegislate in  this realm.   They pin their  hopes on  the Court's\r\n\nopinion in United States v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624 (1995).  Their\r                                           \r\n\nreliance is mislaid.\r\n\n          We need  not tarry.   Although  the Lopez  Court struck\r                                                             \r\n\ndown  the   Gun-Free  School  Zones  Act,  18   U.S.C.     922(q)\r\n\n(criminalizing the possession of  firearms within a school zone),\r\n\non the ground that the prohibited  conduct was not of a type that\r\n\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce, 115 S. Ct. at 1631, it\r\n\ndid  so  because the  underlying  conduct    firearms  possession\r\n\nsimpliciter   \"has nothing  to do with `commerce' or  any sort of\r                     \r\n\neconomic  enterprise,  however  broadly one  might  define  those\r\n\nterms.\"   Id. at 1630-31.   The Lopez  Court nonetheless  made it\r                                               \r\n\nperfectly clear  that, under the Commerce  Clause, Congress could\r\n\nregulate, inter alia, those activities which have a consequential\r                              \r\n\neffect on,  or which  bear a  meaningful relation  to, interstate\r\n\ncommerce.  See  id. at 1629-30 (citing  NLRB v. Jones  &amp; Laughlin\r                                                                           \r\n\nSteel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 37 (1937)).\r                     \r\n\n          This  is such  a  case.   Here,  unlike in  Lopez,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\nstatutory  scheme has  an unmistakable  commercial nexus  and the\r\n\nunderlying  conduct possesses  a significant  economic dimension.\r\n\nMany  courts,   including  this   court,  have  held   that  drug\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ntrafficking  is precisely  the kind  of economic  enterprise that\r\n\nsubstantially  affects interstate  commerce and  that, therefore,\r\n\ncomes  within  Congress's  regulatory  power under  the  Commerce\r\n\nClause.  See, e.g., United States v. Lerebours, 87 F.3d 582, 584-\r                                                        \r\n\n85 (1st Cir.  1996); United States v.

Indeed, Congress made particularized\r\n\nfindings  to  this effect  when it  enacted  the full  panoply of\r\n\ncriminal laws anent controlled substances.

Because we  do not doubt that Congress has\r\n\nthe authority under the Commerce  Clause to regulate an  activity\r\n\nas  clearly  commercial in  character  as  drug trafficking,  and\r\n\nbecause the  particular statute that the  appellants challenge is\r\n\nnothing  more  than  a sentence-enhancer  applicable  to  certain\r\n\nproscribed drug trafficking activities, we  hold that 21 U.S.C.  \r\n\n860(a) does not trespass into constitutionally forbidden terrain.\r\n\nSee generally Lopez, 115 S.

See United States v. Salmiento, 898 F.Supp. 45, 46-48 (D.P.R.1995).  They then pled guilty to the charge, reserving the right to revisit the constitutional question on appeal.  The lower court sentenced them under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b), making use of the enhancement directed by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a).  These proceedings followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the constitutionality of an Act of Congress de novo.  See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 472 (1st Cir.1994).  The statute that the appellants challenge, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a), by its terms applies to some--but not all--offenders who manufacture or distribute, or who possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, controlled substances, thereby violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1).  The selection process under section 860(a) operates by plucking from the mine-run of miscreants who violate section 841(a)(1) those whose crimes are committed within 1,000 feet of a school and essentially doubling the maximum available punishment.  Thus, section 860(a) is a sentence-enhancer, pure and simple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants contend that this sentence-enhancement scheme runs afoul of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.  I, &#167; 8, cl. 3, because Congress lacked power under the Clause to legislate in this realm.  They pin their hopes on the Court's opinion in United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995).  Their reliance is mislaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.  Although the Lopez Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q) (criminalizing the possession of firearms within a school zone), on the ground that the prohibited conduct was not of a type that substantially affects interstate commerce, 514 U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1631, it did so because the underlying conduct--firearms possession simpliciter--\"has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.   The Lopez Court nonetheless made it perfectly clear that, under the Commerce Clause, Congress could regulate, inter alia, those activities which have a consequential effect on, or which bear a meaningful relation to, interstate commerce.  See id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30 (citing NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 37, 57 S.Ct. 615, 624, 81 L.Ed. 893 (1937)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case.  Here, unlike in Lopez, the statutory scheme has an unmistakable commercial nexus and the underlying conduct possesses a significant economic dimension.  Many courts, including this court, have held that drug trafficking is precisely the kind of economic enterprise that substantially affects interstate commerce and that, therefore, comes within Congress's regulatory power under the Commerce Clause.  See, e.g., United States v. Lerebours, 87 F.3d 582, 584-85 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Staples, 85 F.3d 461, 463, amended, (9th Cir.  June 28, 1996);  United States v. Genao, 79 F.3d 1333, 1336-37 (2d Cir.1996);  United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 1453, 1475 (10th Cir.1995), petition for cert. filed, No. 95-9284 (U.S. June 10, 1996);  United States v. Brown, 72 F.3d 96, 97 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2581, 135 L.Ed.2d 1095 (1996);  United States v. Leshuk, 65 F.3d 1105, 1112 (4th Cir.1995).  Indeed, Congress made particularized findings to this effect when it enacted the full panoply of criminal laws anent controlled substances.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 801.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given both this background and the truism \"that courts, when passing upon the constitutionality of a statutory provision, must view it in the context of the whole statutory scheme,\" Vote Choice, Inc. v. DiStefano, 4 F.3d 26, 33 (1st Cir.1993), it is not surprising to find that every court which has confronted the appellants' argument in the post-Lopez era has upheld section 860(a) against a Commerce Clause challenge.  See, e.g., United States v. Tucker, 90 F.3d 1135, 1138-41 (6th Cir.1996) ;   United States v. Rogers, 89 F.3d 1326, 1337-38 (7th Cir.1996);  United States v. Clark, 67 F.3d 1154, 1165-66 (5th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1432, 134 L.Ed.2d 554 (1996);  United States v. Garcia-Salazar, 891 F.Supp. 568, 569-72 (D.Kan.1995);  see also United States v. McDougherty, 920 F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir.1990) (scuttling pre-Lopez Commerce Clause challenge to earlier version of &#167; 860(a)), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 911, 111 S.Ct. 1119, 113 L.Ed.2d 227   (1991) Because we do not doubt that Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate an activity as clearly commercial in character as drug trafficking, and because the particular statute that the appellants challenge is nothing more than a sentence-enhancer applicable to certain proscribed drug trafficking activities, we hold that 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a) does not trespass into constitutionally forbidden terrain.  See generally Lopez, 514 U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1633 (hypothesizing that a law enacted by virtue of Congress's \"authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate numerous commercial activities that substantially affect interstate commerce and also affect the educational process\" would survive a constitutional attack).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The challenged statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 860(a), passes constitutional muster under the Commerce Clause.

Although the Lopez Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q) (criminalizing the possession of firearms within a school zone), on the ground that the prohibited conduct was not of a type that substantially affects interstate commerce, 514 U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1631, it did so because the underlying conduct--firearms possession simpliciter--\"has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.   The Lopez Court nonetheless made it perfectly clear that, under the Commerce Clause, Congress could regulate, inter alia, those activities which have a consequential effect on, or which bear a meaningful relation to, interstate commerce.  See id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30 (citing NLRB v.

Here, unlike in Lopez, the statutory scheme has an unmistakable commercial nexus and the underlying conduct possesses a significant economic dimension.  Many courts, including this court, have held that drug trafficking is precisely the kind of economic enterprise that substantially affects interstate commerce and that, therefore, comes within Congress's regulatory power under the Commerce Clause.
