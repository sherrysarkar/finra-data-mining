Barrington Cove Limited\n\nPartnership (“Barrington”) appeals from a district court order\n\nwhich dismissed its civil rights action against the Rhode Island\n\nHousing and Mortgage Finance Corporation (RIHMFC) for allegedly\n\nviolating its constitutional rights to substantive due process\n\nand equal protection by denying federal income tax credits\n\nneeded to finance its construction of a housing project for\n\nlower-income families.   We affirm.\n\n                                 I\n\n                            BACKGROUND\n\n         RIHMFC, an agency established by the State of Rhode\n\nIsland to foster development of low-to-moderate-income housing,\n\nalso administers the federal lower-income housing tax credit\n\nprogram in Rhode Island.     See 26 U.S.C. § 42 et seq.    During\n\n1996, RIHMFC was authorized to award approximately $1.7 million\n\nin federal tax credits to qualified private developers of lower-\n\nincome housing.   Under its Rules and Regulations and Qualified\n\nAction Plan [hereinafter: “Regulations”], RIHMFC allocates these\n\nfederal tax credits in accordance with various criteria, such as\n\nproject design, site location and overall construction costs.\n\nThe Regulations require that RIHMFC employ the same application\n\nprocedures in relation to for-profit and non-profit developers.\n\n\n                                 2\n\fSee Regulations at § 5 (setting application fee at $500 and 2%\n\nof tax credit requested).\n\n           In 1996, Barrington, whose general partner is a company\n\nowned by a Massachusetts resident, constructed an apartment\n\nbuilding for lower-income residents in Barrington, Rhode Island,\n\nand submitted an application to RIHMFC for federal income tax\n\ncredits.   Its application was awarded more points than any other\n\napplication under the criteria prescribed by the Regulations,\n\nresulting in a $519,536 federal tax credit.\n\n           In order to minimize its resort to RIHMFC resources,\n\nhowever,   Barrington     explicitly        represented     in   its    RIHMFC\n\napplication that it also expected to receive from the National\n\nPark Service $100,000 in historic restoration tax credits in\n\nconnection with the lower-income apartment project.                    Although\n\nBarrington had begun construction on the project before its\n\napplication for National Park Service historic restoration tax\n\ncredits was processed, it had been assured — informally — that\n\nRIHMFC would “work with” Barrington in the event the historic\n\nrestoration      tax   credits   failed       to      materialize.       After\n\nconstruction had advanced to the point that abandonment of the\n\nproject would have resulted in a substantial financial loss to\n\nBarrington, the National Park Service rejected the application\n\nfor   historic    restoration    tax       credits,    thereby   effectively\n\n\n                                       3\n\frendering the project financially unsound.\n\n           In due course, Barrington applied for an additional\n\n$100,000 federal income tax credit to offset its failure to\n\nobtain    the    National     Park   Service    historic    restoration      tax\n\ncredit.         Initially,    RIHMFC    and    defendant-appellee        Richard\n\nGodfrey, Jr., its executive director, were unreceptive, with\n\nGodfrey stating not only that Barrington ought not receive\n\n“another dime” from RIHMFC, but that it should be left “holding\n\nthe bag” and absorb the loss.               Nevertheless, on December 11,\n\n1996,    RIHMFC    awarded     Barrington      an   additional    $122,000    in\n\nfederal income tax credits, provided its individual contractors\n\nagreed to make a $366,000 charitable contribution to the Rhode\n\nIsland Affordable Housing Trust Fund.1\n\n           Meanwhile,        however,   on    November   20,     1996,   another\n\ndeveloper, Gemini Hotel, had “remitted” to RIHMFC its $253,462\n\nfederal income tax credit allocation for 1996, in return for a\n\ncommitment from RIHMFC that Gemini Hotel would receive federal\n\nincome    tax    credits     the   following    year.      The   Gemini    Hotel\n\n\n\n    1 The trust fund was established by the State of Rhode Island\nto receive charitable contributions in aid of goals consistent\nwith RIHMFC’s statutory mission of fostering lower-income\nhousing. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-55.1-1 et seq.        The trust\nfund is administered by the appellees. Ostensibly, the $366,000\ncharitable contribution represented RIHMFC’s estimate of one-\nhalf the equity in the project attributable to the $122,000\nsupplemental federal tax credit.\n\n                                        4\n\f“refund” was more than enough to fund all pending applications\n\nfor supplemental 1996 federal income tax credits, including that\n\nsubmitted by Barrington.             Thus, the statement Richard Godfrey,\n\nJr. allegedly made to Barrington — that Barrington’s “charitable\n\ncontribution” was essential in order that other qualified lower-\n\nincome    housing   project      developers      not    be    denied     additional\n\nfederal income tax credits in 1996 — was knowingly false.\n\n            Furthermore, Barrington later learned that RIHMFC had\n\nallocated    additional        federal   income    tax       credits     to   several\n\ndevelopers in 1996, all of which (unlike Barrington) were non-\n\nprofits    sponsored      by    Rhode    Island    residents.            Yet    those\n\ndevelopers were not required to make a charitable contribution.\n\n            Thereafter, in December 1997, Barrington sought to\n\ndetermine why it was the only developer seeking additional 1996\n\nfederal    income   tax     credits      which    was    required        to    make    a\n\ncharitable     contribution.             Although       Godfrey        offered        no\n\nexplanation, he ventured the opinion that Barrington should not\n\nhave received additional federal income tax credits in the first\n\nplace.      Finally,   in      May   1998,   prior      to   its   tax    deadline,\n\nBarrington reluctantly disbursed $323,172 to the Rhode Island\n\nAffordable Housing Trust Fund in order to obtain the necessary\n\nfederal income tax credit documentation from RIHMFC.\n\n            In due course, Barrington filed its ten-count complaint\n\n\n                                         5\n\fagainst RIHMFC and Godfrey in Rhode Island Superior Court, which\n\nRIHMFC removed to federal district court.               Count one alleges\n\nthat RIHMFC and Godfrey, by requiring a charitable contribution,\n\nexceeded and abused their statutory and regulatory authority\n\nunder the Regulations relating to the imposition of application\n\nfees. Counts two through nine allege that the defendants thereby\n\nviolated Barrington’s federal and state constitutional rights to\n\nequal protection and substantive due process.              Finally, count\n\nten asserts an unjust enrichment claim under Rhode Island law.\n\n           After RIHMFC and Godfrey moved to dismiss the complaint\n\npursuant   to   Federal   Rule   of       Civil   Procedure    12(b)(6),   a\n\nmagistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss,\n\nwith prejudice, counts two through nine and that the pendant\n\nstate-law claims in counts one and ten be dismissed, without\n\nprejudice.      The   district   court        adopted    the   report   and\n\nrecommendation and Barrington appealed.\n\n                                  II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Standard of Review\n\n           We review Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals de novo, accepting\n\nall factual allegations in the amended complaint as true and\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the appellant.\n\nBessette v. Avco Fin. Servs., Inc., 230 F.3d 439, 443 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                      6\n\f2000).    We are to affirm the district court ruling only if it\n\nclearly appears that Barrington cannot recover on any viable\n\nlegal theory, given the facts alleged in its amended complaint.\n\nId.    Although we construe all well-pleaded allegations liberally\n\nat this stage in the proceedings, see, e.g., Barrios-Velazquez\n\nv. Asociacion, 84 F.3d 487, 490 (1st Cir. 1996);                        see also\n\nLeatherman        v.   Tarrant     Cty.       Narcotics     Intelligence     and\n\nCoordination       Unit,   507     U.S.       163,    168   (1993)    (rejecting\n\nheightened pleading requirements for civil rights claims), we do\n\nnot credit conclusory assertions, subjective characterizations\n\nor “outright vituperation.”           Coyne v. City of Somerville, 972\n\nF.2d 440, 444 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Judge v. Lowell, 160\n\nF.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nB.     The Substantive Due Process Claim\n\n               First, Barrington argues that its amended complaint\n\nstated     a     viable    claim    that        the    $323,172      “charitable\n\ncontribution” demanded by RIHMFC violated its substantive due\n\nprocess rights under the federal and state constitutions.                     In\n\norder to prevail against a motion to dismiss a substantive due\n\nprocess claim under Rule 12(b)(6), however, it was essential\n\nthat    the    complaint   either    (i)      allege    that   RIHMFC   deprived\n\nBarrington of a cognizable “property interest,” i.e., its right\n\nto acquire additional federal income tax credits without being\n\n\n                                          7\n\frequired to pay an application fee in excess of that expressly\n\nrequired by the Regulations, or, failing that, (ii) allege that\n\nBarrington’s     conduct      was   so   egregious     as   to   “‘shock[]    the\n\nconscience.’”        Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez, 212 F.3d 617, 622\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted); Coyne, 972 F.2d at 443\n\n(citation omitted); L.A. Ray Realty v. Town of Cumberland, 698\n\nA.2d    202,   211    (R.I.    1997)     (adopting     federal    test).       As\n\nBarrington failed to plead various essential allegations, the\n\ndistrict court correctly dismissed the substantive due process\n\nclaims.     We explain.\n\n       1.    The Alleged “Property Interest” in the Tax Credits\n\n             First, we consider whether Barrington held a cognizable\n\n“property interest” in further federal income tax credits.                     In\n\norder to qualify for “substantive due process” protection, an\n\nalleged     “property    interest”       in   a   governmental    benefit    must\n\nconsist of something more than either (i) “an abstract need or\n\ndesire” for the governmental benefit, or (ii) a mere “unilateral\n\nexpectation” that the claimant deserves it.                  Thus, Barrington\n\nneeded to allege facts demonstrating a “legitimate claim of\n\nentitlement” to the supplemental tax credits.                Board of Regents\n\nv. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972) (emphasis added); Coyne, 972\n\nF.2d at 443; Reed v. Village of Shorewood, 704 F.2d 943, 948\n\n(7th Cir. 1983) (observing that a cognizable property interest\n\n\n                                         8\n\f“is what is securely and durably yours under state [or federal]\n\nlaw,    as    distinct     from    what       you        hold    subject    to    so     many\n\nconditions as to make your interest meager, transitory, or\n\nuncertain”) (emphasis added).\n\n              Since the Regulations ultimately vest in RIHMFC the\n\nabsolute discretion to determine whether federal income tax\n\ncredits are awarded to an applicant, see Figueroa-Serrano v.\n\nRamos-Alverio,       221   F.3d    1,     6       (1st    Cir.    2000)    (noting       that\n\n“property interest” is defined not by Federal Constitution, but\n\nby   independent     sources      such        as    state       law   or   regulations),\n\nBarrington can lay claim to no cognizable “property interest” in\n\nthe “promised” federal income tax credits.                        See, e.g., DeHarder\n\nInv. Corp. v. Indiana Hous. Fin. Auth., 909 F. Supp. 606, 613-14\n\n(S.D. Ind. 1995) (addressing identical statutory scheme in 26\n\nU.S.C. § 42, as applied and administered by State of Indiana).\n\n              As the DeHarder court aptly noted, the federal statute\n\nsimply mandates that states promulgate their own allocation\n\nplans    regarding    these       federal          income       tax   credits,     without\n\nidentifying any particular condition under which the states are\n\nobligated to allocate them.              Id. at 614; see also City of Santa\n\nClara v. Andrus, 572 F.2d 660, 676 (9th Cir. 1978) (“‘[A]\n\nstatute will create an entitlement to a governmental benefit\n\neither   if    the   statute      sets    out       conditions        under      which    the\n\n\n                                              9\n\fbenefit must be granted or if the statute sets out the only\n\nconditions under which the benefit may be denied.’”) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            Like the state plan in DeHarder, the Regulations simply\n\nprescribe     the   criteria     for    assessing   the     comparative\n\ndeservedness of competing applicants for any federal income tax\n\ncredits allocated to Rhode Island.        See Davila-Lopes v. Zapata,\n\n111 F.3d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1997) (“The [mere] existence of a\n\ndetailed set of procedural rules is clearly inadequate to create\n\na constitutionally protected property right.”).        Moreover, none\n\nof these prescribed criteria, many of which necessarily entail\n\nhighly subjective assessments, are susceptible to objective\n\nquantification.\n\n            Accordingly, even if RIHMFC were to assign its highest\n\nrating to an application following a preliminary assessment of\n\nits criteria, the RIHMFC plan expressly accords the agency the\n\ndiscretion to withhold federal income tax credits from any\n\napplicant, albeit a high scorer.        See DeHarder, 909   F. Supp. at\n\n613-14 (“Although [federal law requires that] certain selection\n\ncriteria must be included in [the State] plan, no specific\n\ndirectives mandate how the [State] Authority must weigh or\n\nconsider those criteria.       In other words, once the criteria are\n\nconsidered, no particular outcome necessarily follows.”); see\n\n\n                                   10\n\falso Coyne, 972 F.2d at 443 (noting that “property interests”\n\nnormally wane as governmental regulation waxes).                            Thus, under\n\nthe governing regulatory scheme, Barrington never acquired a\n\n“legitimate claim of entitlement” to supplemental federal income\n\ntax credits.       Roth, 408 U.S. at 577.\n\n             Barrington attempts to distinguish                      DeHarder on the\n\nground that the Regulations contemplate that each applicant is\n\nto be assigned a set number of points, provided its proposed\n\nproject meets certain criteria, and that Barrington was far and\n\naway   the    high    scorer    in    this       instance;      a    status   which   it\n\nretained even after failing to win a National Park Service\n\n“historic restoration” tax credit.                  Be that as it may, neither\n\nthe federal tax code nor the Regulations required RIHMFC to\n\naward federal income tax credits to the high-scoring applicant.\n\n             Rather, the Regulations expressly preserve to RIHMFC\n\n“the right to rescind reservations of tax credits for projects\n\nin   the   event     that   [RIHMFC]    determines         that       the   project    is\n\ninfeasible as proposed or a change of circumstances materially\n\naltered      the     proposal    as    submitted          and       approved.”        See\n\nRegulations § IV(A).           The quoted provision severely undermines\n\nBarrington’s       contention        that    it     was    “entitled”         to,   thus\n\npossessed a property interest in, the 1996 federal income tax\n\ncredits.      Indeed, Barrington acknowledged as much before the\n\n\n                                            11\n\fdistrict court, by noting that “[t]here is no regulation that\n\nsays that anyone is entitled to any number or a certain number\n\nof   credits.”         As   eligibility       simply     cannot    be    considered\n\nsynonymous with entitlement, its substantive due process claim\n\nis fatally flawed.\n\n      2.    The “Shock the Conscience” Element\n\n            Nor   is    the   “shock   the       conscience”      element    in   the\n\nsubstantive due process test met on the basis of the motivation\n\nRIHMFC     allegedly        harbored     in      demanding        the   charitable\n\ncontribution.     See Cruz-Erazo, 212 F.3d at 622 (explaining that\n\nstate action “shocks conscience” only if it is “arbitrary and\n\ncapricious,”      “run[s]      counter      to    ‘the    concept       of   ordered\n\nliberty’” or “‘violat[es] universal standards of decency’”)\n\n(citations omitted).           Assuming       arguendo that the charitable\n\ncontribution violated the Regulations, mere violations of a\n\nstate regulatory scheme are not the stuff of which substantive\n\ndue process claims are constituted.               See Coyne, 972 F.2d at 444\n\n(“It is bedrock law in this circuit[] . . . [] that violations\n\nof state law – even where arbitrary, capricious, or undertaken\n\nin bad faith – do not, without more, give rise to a denial of\n\nsubstantive due process under the U.S. Constitution.”).\n\n            Additionally, although the comments Godfrey allegedly\n\nmade about Barrington might be characterized — arguably and at\n\n\n                                       12\n\fworst — as harsh, callous or impolitic, see supra Section I, we\n\nhave    held   on    numerous      occasions      that   far    more     egregious\n\nutterances by state officials did not satisfy the “shock the\n\nconscience” standard.         See, e.g., Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer\n\nProds., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 532 (1st Cir. 1995) (“[T]he threshold\n\nfor alleging such [verbal-based] claims is high.”); Santiago-de-\n\nCastro v. Morales-Medina, 943 F.2d 129, 131-32 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(same).    Moreover, the Supreme Court itself has been chary about\n\ninvoking the “shock the conscience” test, lest all policymaking\n\nat the state level become routine grist for substantive due\n\nprocess litigation in the federal courts.                   See Collins v. City\n\nof Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 128-29 (1992).                          Thus, the\n\nsubstantive due process claims were properly dismissed.\n\nC.     The Equal Protection Claim\n\n            Barrington contends that it alleged a viable “selective\n\ntreatment” claim to the effect that appellees violated its equal\n\nprotection rights under the United States and Rhode Island\n\nconstitutions by requiring the $323,172 charitable contribution,\n\nsince no other developer attempting to obtain additional 1996\n\nfederal income tax credits was required to make a contribution.\n\nSee    Yerardi’s     Moody   St.   Rest.      &   Lounge,    Inc.   v.   Board   of\n\nSelectmen,     932    F.2d   89,    94   (1st     Cir.   1991);     Rhode   Island\n\nDepositors Econ. Prot. Corp. v. Brown, 659 A.2d 95, 100 (R.I.\n\n\n                                         13\n\f1995)   (federal   and   Rhode   Island   equal   protection   standards\n\ncoterminous).\n\n           Under the Equal Protection Clause, similarly situated\n\nentities must be accorded similar governmental treatment.             See\n\nCity of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439-40\n\n(1985). In order to establish its claim, however, Barrington\n\nneeded to allege facts indicating that, “compared with others\n\nsimilarly situated, [it] was selectively treated . . . based on\n\nimpermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to\n\ninhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or\n\nmalicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.”             Rubinovitz\n\nv. Rogato, 60 F.3d 906, 909-10 (1st Cir. 1995) (emphasis added;\n\ncitations omitted).2\n\n    1.     The “Similar Situation” Standard\n\n            In determining that the amended complaint failed the\n\n“similarly situated” test, the district court faulted Barrington\n\nfor failing to allege, inter alia, whether its coapplicants (i)\n\nreceived supplemental federal income tax credits due to their\n\nfailure to obtain the historic restoration tax credits which\n\n\n\n    2Barrington has not alleged that any other fundamental\nconstitutional right was violated by appellees in this regard.\nSee Batra v. Board of Regents, 79 F.3d 717, 721 (8th Cir. 1996)\n(noting that equal protection claim need not allege violation of\na fundamental or constitutional right, but may allege\nintentional discrimination for any illegitimate reason).\n\n                                   14\n\fwere a prerequisite to their initial RIHMFC allocation, or (ii)\n\ncommenced    construction    prior        to    confirmation    of    all   the\n\nfinancing required to construct their respective projects, or\n\n(iii) would have failed to complete construction absent an\n\nadditional award of federal income tax credits from RIHMFC.                 See\n\nSamaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925, 941 n.31 (5th Cir. 1991)\n\n(noting that an adequate “similarly situated” allegation is\n\nessential to a viable equal protection claim).\n\n            Barrington     insists    that       its   amended       complaint\n\nsurmounted the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal threshold in that it\n\nstates unequivocally that Barrington and its coapplicants were\n\n“similarly    situated,”    whereas       the    district    court    expected\n\nBarrington to allege each and every pertinent attribute it\n\nshared, qua applicant, with its coapplicants.               Barrington argues\n\nthat the amended complaint was adequate because it alleged that\n\nBarrington and its coapplicants were similarly situated in one\n\ncritical respect; i.e., each applied to RIHMFC for an additional\n\n1996 federal income tax credit.       On appeal, it contends that the\n\n“similar situation” standard adopted by the district court is\n\noverly cramped, in that it contemplates such identicality within\n\na particular class as to make it next to impossible to assert a\n\nviable equal protection claim.\n\n            The formula for determining whether individuals or\n\n\n                                     15\n\fentities are “similarly situated” for equal protection purposes\n\nis not always susceptible to precise demarcation.                    See Coyne,\n\n972 F.2d at 444-45 (“[T]he ‘line between sufficient facts and\n\ninsufficient       conclusions     is        often    blurred.’”)     (citation\n\nomitted).     As we have explained, however, “[t]he test is whether\n\na prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents, would\n\nthink them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly\n\nsituated.      Much as in the lawyer's art of distinguishing cases,\n\nthe    ‘relevant    aspects’     are     those       factual   elements     which\n\ndetermine whether reasoned analogy supports, or demands, a like\n\nresult.      Exact correlation is neither likely nor necessary, but\n\nthe cases must be fair congeners.             In other words, apples should\n\nbe compared to apples.” Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll., 889\n\nF.2d   13,    19   (1st   Cir.   1989)       (citation   omitted);    see    also\n\nRodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181 F.3d 15, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n             Thus, it was essential that Barrington allege, inter\n\nalia, that it and its coapplicants were similarly situated “‘in\n\nall relevant respects.’”           Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 19\n\n(citation omitted; emphasis added).              Its amended complaint did\n\nallege, albeit in conclusory fashion, that Barrington and other\n\n“similarly     situated”    applicants        requested    supplemental      1996\n\nfederal income tax credits, a fact which certainly is material\n\n\n                                        16\n\fto the present issue.\n\n            Yet the issue before us is not only distinct, it is\n\nfurther complicated by the significant characteristics which\n\nBarrington alleges it possessed, without any mention whether its\n\ncoapplicants shared those characteristics. Consequently, at the\n\npresent    stage    in    the    Rule     12(b)(6)        analysis,     the    question\n\nreduces to whether it was necessary that Barrington allege these\n\ncorrelations with reasonable particularity.                       We conclude that it\n\nwas   incumbent     upon       Barrington      to    do     so,   for   the   following\n\nreasons.\n\n            First,       the     complaint       included         allegations     which\n\narguably intimated that Barrington was not similarly situated to\n\nother applicants in several important respects.                               The three\n\nfactual allegations which gave the district court most concern\n\ncannot     be   dismissed         as     either       incidental         or    facially\n\ninconsequential; i.e., (1) Barrington’s original application to\n\nRIHMFC for federal income tax credits, which was based on an\n\nexplicit    representation         that     it      would    receive    the    $100,000\n\nhistoric    restoration          tax    credit;       (2)    its    commencement     of\n\nconstruction on the lower-income housing project prior to final\n\nconfirmation of its financing package; and (3) the financial\n\ninfeasibility of the project absent either the supplemental\n\nfederal    income    tax        credits     from      RIHMFC       or   the    historic\n\n\n                                          17\n\frestoration tax credits from the National Park Service.\n\n            In our view, it would have been entirely reasonable for\n\nRIHMFC to consider         each of these matters an adequate basis\n\n(i.e., dubious business acumen and judgment) for treating the\n\nBarrington    application       differently      in    the     competition   for\n\nsupplemental federal income tax credits.               Cf. Knapp v. Hanson,\n\n183 F.3d 786, 789 (8th Cir. 1999) (“When all that must be shown\n\nby defendant is ‘any reasonably conceivable state of facts that\n\ncould     provide     a    rational    basis     for     the    [governmental]\n\nclassification,’ it is not necessary to wait for further factual\n\ndevelopment     [of       the   record].”)     (quoting        FCC   v.   Beach\n\nCommunications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)); cf. also Almon\n\nv. Reno, 192 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1999) (“[T]he government need\n\nnot actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale\n\nsupporting its [selective] classification.”) (citing Heller v.\n\nDoe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993)), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 83\n\n(2000).\n\n            Second, neither in its amended complaint, nor elsewhere\n\nin the record on appeal, is there any indication that the\n\ninformation Barrington would have needed in order to evaluate\n\nwhether its coapplicants were “similarly situated” in these\n\nthree important respects was inaccessible, let alone in the sole\n\npossession    or    control     of   appellees    (and    hence,     reasonably\n\n\n                                       18\n\faccessible    to    Barrington   only    through   discovery   procedures\n\npostdating the Rule 12(b)(6) stage).           For that matter, in its\n\nappellate brief Barrington relates in exhaustive detail the\n\ncontents of the RIHMFC applications filed by other applicants.\n\nSee, e.g., Judge, 160 F.3d at 72 n.3, 77 (mandating specificity\n\nin complaint so civil rights claimant cannot “drag a defendant\n\npast the pleading threshold” with “baseless claims,” or with a\n\n“conclusory description[] of a ‘general scenario which could be\n\ndominated    by    unpleaded   facts’”)   (emphasis   added;    citations\n\nomitted); Glassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 629\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (“[I]t is plaintiff’s responsibility to plead\n\nfactual   allegations,     not   hypotheticals.”)     (emphasis   added);\n\nFuternick v. Sumpter Township, 78 F.3d 1051, 1058 (6th Cir.\n\n1996).    Thus, Barrington readily could have alleged sufficient\n\nfacts in its amended complaint to demonstrate that its co-\n\napplicants were similarly situated in the “relevant” respects\n\nnoted by the district court.        See, e.g., Nestor-Colon-Medina &\n\nSucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 43 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nMoreover, exhaustive independent research has disclosed no case\n\nauthority supporting Barrington’s argument.\n\n            Finally, the three cases principally relied upon by\n\nBarrington are inapposite.       See Interboro Inst., Inc. v. Maurer,\n\n956 F. Supp. 188 (N.D.N.Y. 1997); see also Santos v. Shields\n\n\n                                    19\n\fHealth Group, 996 F. Supp. 87 (D. Mass. 1998); X-Men Sec., Inc.\n\nv. Pataki, 983 F. Supp. 101 (E.D.N.Y. 1997).                   Interboro involved\n\na   junior     college    which    brought      an     equal    protection       claim\n\nalleging       that    state   education       officials       had    withheld     TAP\n\nfunding, following an audit, because Interboro is located in\n\ndownstate New York and primarily enrolls minority students.                        The\n\ndistrict court rejected a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),\n\nnoting that Interboro “has alleged that of                      all    institutions\n\nreceiving TAP funds, it is the only school audited three times\n\nin the past six years, and of those institutions audited more\n\nthan once during that time frame, all were downstate schools.”\n\nInterboro Inst., 956 F. Supp. at 200 (emphasis added).\n\n             Interboro simply demonstrates that a complaint may\n\nsurvive    a    Rule    12(b)(6)    motion      as   long      as    the    “similarly\n\nsituated” prong of the equal protection rubric is satisfied by\n\nan allegation that the plaintiff was a member of the class,\n\nviz., “all institutions receiving TAP funds,” thereby supporting\n\nthe   essential       implication       that   class    members       are   similarly\n\nsituated in all relevant respects; hence, are qualified to make\n\nthe further allegation that the discriminatory action must have\n\nbeen predicated on an impermissible ground, i.e., a race-based\n\nanimus.\n\n             Interboro     did    not    consider      the     implications      of   a\n\n\n                                          20\n\fcomplaint alleging additional facts arguably differentiating the\n\nplaintiff in important respects from fellow class members.   Id.\n\n(“[T]he Court finds that the Complaint alleges sufficient facts\n\nto make out a claim for a violation of the Equal Protection\n\nClause.”). 3   An equal protection claimant “‘may not prevail\n\n[against a Rule 12(b)(6) motion] simply by asserting an inequity\n\nand tacking on the self-serving conclusion that the defendant\n\nwas motivated by a discriminatory animus.’”   Coyne, 972 F.2d at\n\n444 (citation omitted).4\n\n\n     3Barrington incorrectly asserts that the Second Circuit, see\nInterboro Inst., Inc. v. Maurer, 152 F.3d 918 (2d Cir. 1998),\naffirmed the district court’s denial of the Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion. Instead, it affirmed the district court’s subsequent\npost-discovery dismissal of appellees’ motion for summary\njudgment. Interboro Inst., Inc. v. Maurer, 984 F. Supp. 119, 124\n(N.D.N.Y. 1997) (“Defendants, in turn, rebut each of . . .\n[plaintiff’s] points.”). Moreover, even assuming their right to\nan immediate appeal, we can discern no indication that the\nInterboro defendants ever appealed the denial of their Rule\n12(b)(6) motion. See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d\n41, 44-45 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that orders denying motions to\ndismiss normally are nonfinal, thus not subject to interlocutory\nappeal).\n     4The two other case citations proffered by Barrington are\nunavailing as well. See Santos, 996 F. Supp. at 94-95 (holding\nthat there remained a genuine issue of material fact, precluding\nsummary judgment, as to whether defendant treated plaintiff\ndifferently than a fellow employee, but defendant never disputed\nthat the two employees were “similarly situated”); X-Men, 983 F.\nSupp. at 112 (denying Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss equal\nprotection claim where plaintiff, a security guard company,\nalleged that defendants improperly singled it out due to its\naffiliation with the Nation of Islam, since it could be inferred\nfrom complaint that other applicants for government contract\nwere not so affiliated; but decision rested on “selective\n\n                               21\n\f    2.      The “Bad Faith” Allegation\n\n            Although the failure to allege that its coapplicants\n\nwere “similarly situated” suffices to dispose of its appeal, we\n\nnote that Barrington’s factual allegations regarding RIHMFC’s\n\n“bad faith” were inadequate as well.                See Rubinowitz, 60 F.3d at\n\n909-10;   cf.     Yerardi’s,     932   F.2d    at     94   (noting    that   where\n\nplaintiff does not rest “equal protection” claim on alleged\n\nviolation of fundamental constitutional right, it is essential\n\nthat it “scrupulously me[e]t” the “bad faith” element of its\n\nclaim).     Once again, cf. supra Section II.B.2, the mere fact\n\nthat appellees may have violated or abused federal or state\n\nregulatory       regimes    by   imposing     the    charitable      contribution\n\nrequirement upon Barrington, in effect wrongfully imposing an\n\napplication “fee” in excess of regulatory limits, has no direct\n\nbearing     on    whether    appellees      violated       Barrington’s      equal\n\nprotection rights.         See Coyne, 972 F.2d at 444 n.7.\n\n            Further, the comments Godfrey made about Barrington’s\n\nloss of the historic restoration tax credits – i.e., Godfrey\n\n“wouldn’t    give    the    project    another        dime”   and    would   leave\n\n\n\ntreatment” element, rather that “similarly situated” element,\nsince court never suggested that complaint alleged additional\nfactual attributes of plaintiffs (other than their religious\naffiliation) which might also differentiate them from other\nsecurity   guard  companies  which  were  awarded  government\ncontract).\n\n                                       22\n\fBarrington “holding the bag” – are likewise readily explained as\n\nrational reactions to the perceived imprudence demonstrated by\n\nBarrington in commencing project construction before its entire\n\nfinancing package was in place.           Although such an inference is\n\nnot compelled, and we are to draw all reasonable inferences from\n\nthe amended complaint in Barrington’s favor,5 the ambiguity of\n\nGodfrey’s comments unquestionably accentuates the tenuousness of\n\nthe claim that Barrington was subjected to selective treatment\n\nbecause it is an out-of-state, for-profit organization.\n\n          As the discussion in Section II.C.1, supra, affords a\n\nsufficient basis for resolving the present appeal, we affirm the\n\ndismissal of the equal protection claims.\n\n                                    III\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n          Accordingly, the district court order dismissing the\n\nfederal   claims   in   counts    two     through   nine,   and   the   order\n\nremanding the pendant state-law claims in counts one and ten to\n\nthe Rhode Island Superior Court, see 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3)\n\n\n\n     5\n     RIHMFC implies in its appellate brief that the precise\npreconditions for its approval of the Barrington credit\napplications for federal income tax credits ( i.e., the so-called\ncommitment letters) were part of the appellate record, even\nthough it conceded at oral argument that the applications were\nneither appended to the complaint nor incorporated by reference\nbelow. Thus, the commitment letters form no part of the basis\nfor our decision. See Bessette, 230 F.3d at 443.\n\n                                     23\n\f(supplemental jurisdiction), are affirmed.     Nothing in this\n\nopinion shall be construed as a statement on the merits of the\n\nremanded state-law claims.\n\n         Affirmed.   Costs to appellees.

See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 42 et seq. During 1996, RIHMFC was authorized to award approximately $1.7 million in federal tax credits to qualified private developers of lower-income housing. Under its Rules and Regulations and Qualified Action Plan [hereinafter: \"Regulations\"], RIHMFC allocates these federal tax credits in accordance with various criteria, such as project design, site location and overall construction costs. The Regulations require that RIHMFC employ the same application procedures in relation to for-profit and non-profit developers. See Regulations at &#167; 5 (setting application fee at $500 and 2% of tax credit requested).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Barrington, whose general partner is a company owned by a Massachusetts resident, constructed an apartment building for lower-income residents in Barrington, Rhode Island, and submitted an application to RIHMFC for federal income tax credits. Its application was awarded more points than any other application under the criteria prescribed by the Regulations, resulting in a $519,536 federal tax credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to minimize its resort to RIHMFC resources, however, Barrington explicitly represented in its RIHMFC application that it also expected to receive from the National Park Service $100,000 in historic restoration tax credits in connection with the lower-income apartment project. Although Barrington had begun construction on the project before its application for National Park Service historic restoration tax credits was processed, it had been assured -- informally -- that RIHMFC would \"work with\" Barrington in the event the historic restoration tax credits failed to materialize. After construction had advanced to the point that abandonment of the project would have resulted in a substantial financial loss to Barrington, the National Park Service rejected the application for historic restoration tax credits, thereby effectively rendering the project financially unsound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Barrington applied for an additional $100,000 federal income tax credit to offset its failure to obtain the National Park Service historic restoration tax credit. Initially, RIHMFC and defendant-appellee Richard Godfrey, Jr., its executive director, were unreceptive, with Godfrey stating not only that Barrington ought not receive \"another dime\" from RIHMFC, but that it should be left \"holding the bag\" and absorb the loss. Nevertheless, on December 11, 1996, RIHMFC awarded Barrington an additional $122,000 in federal income tax credits, provided its individual contractors agreed to make a $366,000 charitable contribution to the Rhode Island Affordable Housing Trust Fund.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, however, on November 20, 1996, another developer, Gemini Hotel, had \"remitted\" to RIHMFC its $253,462 federal income tax credit allocation for 1996, in return for a commitment from RIHMFC that Gemini Hotel would receive federal income tax credits the following year. The Gemini Hotel \"refund\" was more than enough to fund all pending applications for supplemental 1996 federal income tax credits, including that submitted by Barrington. Thus, the statement Richard Godfrey, Jr. allegedly made to Barrington -- that Barrington's \"charitable contribution\" was essential in order that other qualified lower-income housing project developers not be denied additional federal income tax credits in 1996 -- was knowingly false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Barrington later learned that RIHMFC had allocated additional federal income tax credits to several developers in 1996, all of which (unlike Barrington) were non-profits sponsored by Rhode Island residents. Yet those developers were not required to make a charitable contribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in December 1997, Barrington sought to determine why it was the only developer seeking additional 1996 federal income tax credits which was required to make a charitable contribution. Although Godfrey offered no explanation, he ventured the opinion that Barrington should not have received additional federal income tax credits in the first place. Finally, in May 1998, prior to its tax deadline, Barrington reluctantly disbursed $323,172 to the Rhode Island Affordable Housing Trust Fund in order to obtain the necessary federal income tax credit documentation from RIHMFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Barrington filed its ten-count complaint against RIHMFC and Godfrey in Rhode Island Superior Court, which RIHMFC removed to federal district court. Count one alleges that RIHMFC and Godfrey, by requiring a charitable contribution, exceeded and abused their statutory and regulatory authority under the Regulations relating to the imposition of application fees. Counts two through nine allege that the defendants thereby violated Barrington's federal and state constitutional rights to equal protection and substantive due process. Finally, count ten asserts an unjust enrichment claim under Rhode Island law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After RIHMFC and Godfrey moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss, with prejudice, counts two through nine and that the pendant state-law claims in counts one and ten be dismissed, without prejudice. The district court adopted the report and recommendation and Barrington appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals de novo, accepting all factual allegations in the amended complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the appellant. Bessette v. Avco Fin. Servs., Inc., 230 F.3d 439, 443 (1st Cir. 2000). We are to affirm the district court ruling only if it clearly appears that Barrington cannot recover on any viable legal theory, given the facts alleged in its amended complaint. Id. Although we construe all well-pleaded allegations liberally at this stage in the proceedings, see, e.g., Barrios-Velazquez v. Asociacion, 84 F.3d 487, 490 (1st Cir. 1996); see alsoLeatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993) (rejecting heightened pleading requirements for civil rights claims), we do not credit conclusory assertions, subjective characterizations or \"outright vituperation.\" Coyne v. City of Somerville, 972 F.2d 440, 444 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Judge v. Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Substantive Due Process Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Barrington argues that its amended complaint stated a viable claim that the $323,172 \"charitable contribution\" demanded by RIHMFC violated its substantive due process rights under the federal and state constitutions. In order to prevail against a motion to dismiss a substantive due process claim under Rule 12(b)(6), however, it was essential that the complaint either (i) allege that RIHMFC deprived Barrington of a cognizable \"property interest,\" i.e., its right to acquire additional federal income tax credits without being required to pay an application fee in excess of that expressly required by the Regulations, or, failing that, (ii) allege that Barrington's conduct was so egregious as to \"'shock[] the conscience.'\" Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez, 212 F.3d 617, 622 (1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted); Coyne, 972 F.2d at 443 (citation omitted); L.A. Ray Realty v. Town of Cumberland, 698 A.2d 202, 211 (R.I. 1997) (adopting federal test). As Barrington failed to plead various essential allegations, the district court correctly dismissed the substantive due process claims. We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Alleged \"Property Interest\" in the Tax Credits</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we consider whether Barrington held a cognizable \"property interest\" in further federal income tax credits. In order to qualify for \"substantive due process\" protection, an alleged \"property interest\" in a governmental benefit must consist of something more than either (i) \"an abstract need or desire\" for the governmental benefit, or (ii) a mere \"unilateral expectation\" that the claimant deserves it. Thus, Barrington needed to allege facts demonstrating a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" to the supplemental tax credits. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972) (emphasis added); Coyne, 972 F.2d at 443; Reed v. Village of Shorewood, 704 F.2d 943, 948 (7th Cir. 1983) (observing that a cognizable property interest \"is what is securely and durably yours under state [or federal] law, as distinct from what you hold subject to so many conditions as to make your interest meager, transitory, or uncertain\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Regulations ultimately vest in RIHMFC the absolute discretion to determine whether federal income tax credits are awarded to an applicant, see Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that \"property interest\" is defined not by Federal Constitution, but by independent sources such as state law or regulations), Barrington can lay claim to no cognizable \"property interest\" in the \"promised\" federal income tax credits. See, e.g., DeHarder Inv. Corp. v. Indiana Hous. Fin. Auth., 909 F. Supp. 606, 613-14 (S.D. Ind. 1995) (addressing identical statutory scheme in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 42, as applied and administered by State of Indiana).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the DeHarder court aptly noted, the federal statute simply mandates that states promulgate their own allocation plans regarding these federal income tax credits, without identifying any particular condition under which the states are obligated to allocate them. Id. at 614; see also City of Santa Clara v. Andrus, 572 F.2d 660, 676 (9th Cir. 1978) (\"'[A] statute will create an entitlement to a governmental benefit either if the statute sets out conditions under which the benefit must be granted or if the statute sets out the only conditions under which the benefit may be denied.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the state plan in DeHarder, the Regulations simply prescribe the criteria for assessing the comparative deservedness of competing applicants for any federal income tax credits allocated to Rhode Island. See Davila-Lopes v. Zapata, 111 F.3d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"The [mere] existence of a detailed set of procedural rules is clearly inadequate to create a constitutionally protected property right.\"). Moreover, none of these prescribed criteria, many of which necessarily entail highly subjective assessments, are susceptible to objective quantification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, even if RIHMFC were to assign its highest rating to an application following a preliminary assessment of its criteria, the RIHMFC plan expressly accords the agency the discretion to withhold federal income tax credits from any applicant, albeit a high scorer. See DeHarder, 909 F. Supp. at 613-14 (\"Although [federal law requires that] certain selection criteria must be included in [the State] plan, no specific directives mandate how the [State] Authority must weigh or consider those criteria. In other words, once the criteria are considered, no particular outcome necessarily follows.\"); seealso Coyne, 972 F.2d at 443 (noting that \"property interests\" normally wane as governmental regulation waxes). Thus, under the governing regulatory scheme, Barrington never acquired a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" to supplemental federal income tax credits. Roth, 408 U.S. at 577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barrington attempts to distinguish DeHarder on the ground that the Regulations contemplate that each applicant is to be assigned a set number of points, provided its proposed project meets certain criteria, and that Barrington was far and away the high scorer in this instance; a status which it retained even after failing to win a National Park Service \"historic restoration\" tax credit. Be that as it may, neither the federal tax code nor the Regulations required RIHMFC to award federal income tax credits to the high-scoring applicant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the Regulations expressly preserve to RIHMFC \"the right to rescind reservations of tax credits for projects in the event that [RIHMFC] determines that the project is infeasible as proposed or a change of circumstances materially altered the proposal as submitted and approved.\" See Regulations &#167; IV(A). The quoted provision severely undermines Barrington's contention that it was \"entitled\" to, thus possessed a property interest in, the 1996 federal income tax credits. Indeed, Barrington acknowledged as much before the district court, by noting that \"[t]here is no regulation that says that anyone is entitled to any number or a certain number of credits.\" As eligibility simply cannot be considered synonymous with entitlement, its substantive due process claim is fatally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The \"Shock the Conscience\" Element</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the \"shock the conscience\" element in the substantive due process test met on the basis of the motivation RIHMFC allegedly harbored in demanding the charitable contribution. See Cruz-Erazo, 212 F.3d at 622 (explaining that state action \"shocks conscience\" only if it is \"arbitrary and capricious,\" \"run[s] counter to 'the concept of ordered liberty'\" or \"'violat[es] universal standards of decency'\") (citations omitted). Assuming arguendo that the charitable contribution violated the Regulations, mere violations of a state regulatory scheme are not the stuff of which substantive due process claims are constituted. See Coyne, 972 F.2d at 444 (\"It is bedrock law in this circuit[] . . . [] that violations of state law - even where arbitrary, capricious, or undertaken in bad faith - do not, without more, give rise to a denial of substantive due process under the U.S. Constitution.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, although the comments Godfrey allegedly made about Barrington might be characterized -- arguably and at worst -- as harsh, callous or impolitic, see supra Section I, we have held on numerous occasions that far more egregious utterances by state officials did not satisfy the \"shock the conscience\" standard. See, e.g., Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 532 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he threshold for alleging such [verbal-based] claims is high.\"); Santiago-de-Castro v. Morales-Medina, 943 F.2d 129, 131-32 (1st Cir. 1991) (same). Moreover, the Supreme Court itself has been chary about invoking the \"shock the conscience\" test, lest all policymaking at the state level become routine grist for substantive due process litigation in the federal courts. See Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 128-29 (1992). Thus, the substantive due process claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Equal Protection Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barrington contends that it alleged a viable \"selective treatment\" claim to the effect that appellees violated its equal protection rights under the United States and Rhode Island constitutions by requiring the $323,172 charitable contribution, since no other developer attempting to obtain additional 1996 federal income tax credits was required to make a contribution. See Yerardi's Moody St. Rest. &amp; Lounge, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen, 932 F.2d 89, 94 (1st Cir. 1991); Rhode Island Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp. v. Brown, 659 A.2d 95, 100 (R.I. 1995) (federal and Rhode Island equal protection standards coterminous).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Equal Protection Clause, similarly situated entities must be accorded similar governmental treatment. SeeCity of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439-40 (1985). In order to establish its claim, however, Barrington needed to allege facts indicating that, \"compared with others similarly situated, [it] was selectively treated . . . based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\" Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60 F.3d 906, 909-10 (1st Cir. 1995) (emphasis added; citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The \"Similar Situation\" Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining that the amended complaint failed the \"similarly situated\" test, the district court faulted Barrington for failing to allege, inter alia, whether its coapplicants (i) received supplemental federal income tax credits due to their failure to obtain the historic restoration tax credits which were a prerequisite to their initial RIHMFC allocation, or (ii) commenced construction prior to confirmation of all the financing required to construct their respective projects, or (iii) would have failed to complete construction absent an additional award of federal income tax credits from RIHMFC. SeeSamaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925, 941 n.31 (5th Cir. 1991) (noting that an adequate \"similarly situated\" allegation is essential to a viable equal protection claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barrington insists that its amended complaint surmounted the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal threshold in that it states unequivocally that Barrington and its coapplicants were \"similarly situated,\" whereas the district court expected Barrington to allege each and every pertinent attribute it shared, qua applicant, with its coapplicants. Barrington argues that the amended complaint was adequate because it alleged that Barrington and its coapplicants were similarly situated in one critical respect; i.e., each applied to RIHMFC for an additional 1996 federal income tax credit. On appeal, it contends that the \"similar situation\" standard adopted by the district court is overly cramped, in that it contemplates such identicality within a particular class as to make it next to impossible to assert a viable equal protection claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The formula for determining whether individuals or entities are \"similarly situated\" for equal protection purposes is not always susceptible to precise demarcation. See Coyne, 972 F.2d at 444-45 (\"[T]he 'line between sufficient facts and insufficient conclusions is often blurred.'\") (citation omitted). As we have explained, however, \"[t]he test is whether a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents, would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated. Much as in the lawyer's art of distinguishing cases, the 'relevant aspects' are those factual elements which determine whether reasoned analogy supports, or demands, a like result. Exact correlation is neither likely nor necessary, but the cases must be fair congeners. In other words, apples should be compared to apples.\" Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation omitted); see alsoRodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it was essential that Barrington allege, interalia, that it and its coapplicants were similarly situated \"'inall relevant respects.'\" Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 19 (citation omitted; emphasis added). Its amended complaint did allege, albeit in conclusory fashion, that Barrington and other \"similarly situated\" applicants requested supplemental 1996 federal income tax credits, a fact which certainly is material to the present issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the issue before us is not only distinct, it is further complicated by the significant characteristics which Barrington alleges it possessed, without any mention whether its coapplicants shared those characteristics. Consequently, at the present stage in the Rule 12(b)(6) analysis, the question reduces to whether it was necessary that Barrington allege these correlations with reasonable particularity. We conclude that it was incumbent upon Barrington to do so, for the following reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the complaint included allegations which arguably intimated that Barrington was not similarly situated to other applicants in several important respects. The three factual allegations which gave the district court most concern cannot be dismissed as either incidental or facially inconsequential; i.e., (1) Barrington's original application to RIHMFC for federal income tax credits, which was based on an explicit representation that it would receive the $100,000 historic restoration tax credit; (2) its commencement of construction on the lower-income housing project prior to final confirmation of its financing package; and (3) the financial infeasibility of the project absent either the supplemental federal income tax credits from RIHMFC or the historic restoration tax credits from the National Park Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, it would have been entirely reasonable for RIHMFC to consider each of these matters an adequate basis (i.e., dubious business acumen and judgment) for treating the Barrington application differently in the competition for supplemental federal income tax credits. Cf. Knapp v. Hanson, 183 F.3d 786, 789 (8th Cir. 1999) (\"When all that must be shown by defendant is 'any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the [governmental] classification,' it is not necessary to wait for further factual development [of the record].\") (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)); cf. also Almon v. Reno, 192 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[T]he government need not actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its [selective] classification.\") (citing Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993)), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 83 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, neither in its amended complaint, nor elsewhere in the record on appeal, is there any indication that the information Barrington would have needed in order to evaluate whether its coapplicants were \"similarly situated\" in these three important respects was inaccessible, let alone in the sole possession or control of appellees (and hence, reasonably accessible to Barrington only through discovery procedures postdating the Rule 12(b)(6) stage). For that matter, in its appellate brief Barrington relates in exhaustive detail the contents of the RIHMFC applications filed by other applicants. See, e.g., Judge, 160 F.3d at 72 n.3, 77 (mandating specificity in complaint so civil rights claimant cannot \"drag a defendant past the pleading threshold\" with \"baseless claims,\" or with a \"conclusory description[] of a 'general scenario which could be dominated by unpleaded facts'\") (emphasis added; citations omitted); Glassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 629 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[I]t is plaintiff's responsibility to plead factual allegations, not hypotheticals.\") (emphasis added); Futernick v. Sumpter Township, 78 F.3d 1051, 1058 (6th Cir. 1996). Thus, Barrington readily could have alleged sufficient facts in its amended complaint to demonstrate that its co-applicants were similarly situated in the \"relevant\" respects noted by the district court. See, e.g., Nestor-Colon-Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 43 (1st Cir. 1992). Moreover, exhaustive independent research has disclosed no case authority supporting Barrington's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the three cases principally relied upon by Barrington are inapposite. See Interboro Inst., Inc. v. Maurer, 956 F. Supp. 188 (N.D.N.Y. 1997); see also Santos v. Shields Health Group, 996 F. Supp. 87 (D. Mass. 1998); X-Men Sec., Inc. v. Pataki, 983 F. Supp. 101 (E.D.N.Y. 1997). Interboro involved a junior college which brought an equal protection claim alleging that state education officials had withheld TAP funding, following an audit, because Interboro is located in downstate New York and primarily enrolls minority students. The district court rejected a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), noting that Interboro \"has alleged that of all institutions receiving TAP funds, it is the only school audited three times in the past six years, and of those institutions audited more than once during that time frame, all were downstate schools.\" Interboro Inst., 956 F. Supp. at 200 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interboro simply demonstrates that a complaint may survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion as long as the \"similarly situated\" prong of the equal protection rubric is satisfied by an allegation that the plaintiff was a member of the class, viz., \"all institutions receiving TAP funds,\" thereby supporting the essential implication that class members are similarly situated in all relevant respects; hence, are qualified to make the further allegation that the discriminatory action must have been predicated on an impermissible ground, i.e., a race-based animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interboro did not consider the implications of a complaint alleging additional facts arguably differentiating the plaintiff in important respects from fellow class members. Id. (\"[T]he Court finds that the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to make out a claim for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> An equal protection claimant \"'may not prevail [against a Rule 12(b)(6) motion] simply by asserting an inequity and tacking on the self-serving conclusion that the defendant was motivated by a discriminatory animus.'\" Coyne, 972 F.2d at 444 (citation omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The \"Bad Faith\" Allegation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the failure to allege that its coapplicants were \"similarly situated\" suffices to dispose of its appeal, we note that Barrington's factual allegations regarding RIHMFC's \"bad faith\" were inadequate as well. See Rubinowitz, 60 F.3d at 909-10; cf. Yerardi's, 932 F.2d at 94 (noting that where plaintiff does not rest \"equal protection\" claim on alleged violation of fundamental constitutional right, it is essential that it \"scrupulously me[e]t\" the \"bad faith\" element of its claim). Once again, cf. supra Section II.B.2, the mere fact that appellees may have violated or abused federal or state regulatory regimes by imposing the charitable contribution requirement upon Barrington, in effect wrongfully imposing an application \"fee\" in excess of regulatory limits, has no direct bearing on whether appellees violated Barrington's equal protection rights.

Although such an inference is not compelled, and we are to draw all reasonable inferences from the amended complaint in Barrington's favor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the ambiguity of Godfrey's comments unquestionably accentuates the tenuousness of the claim that Barrington was subjected to selective treatment because it is an out-of-state, for-profit organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the discussion in Section II.C.1, supra, affords a sufficient basis for resolving the present appeal, we affirm the dismissal of the equal protection claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court order dismissing the federal claims in counts two through nine, and the order remanding the pendant state-law claims in counts one and ten to the Rhode Island Superior Court, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) (supplemental jurisdiction), are affirmed.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIHMFC, an agency established by the State of Rhode Island to foster development of low-to-moderate-income housing, also administers the federal lower-income housing tax credit program in Rhode Island. See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 42 et seq. During 1996, RIHMFC was authorized to award approximately $1.7 million in federal tax credits to qualified private developers of lower-income housing. Under its Rules and Regulations and Qualified Action Plan [hereinafter: \"Regulations\"], RIHMFC allocates these federal tax credits in accordance with various criteria, such as project design, site location and overall construction costs. The Regulations require that RIHMFC employ the same application procedures in relation to for-profit and non-profit developers. See Regulations at &#167; 5 (setting application fee at $500 and 2% of tax credit requested).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Barrington, whose general partner is a company owned by a Massachusetts resident, constructed an apartment building for lower-income residents in Barrington, Rhode Island, and submitted an application to RIHMFC for federal income tax credits. Its application was awarded more points than any other application under the criteria prescribed by the Regulations, resulting in a $519,536 federal tax credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to minimize its resort to RIHMFC resources, however, Barrington explicitly represented in its RIHMFC application that it also expected to receive from the National Park Service $100,000 in historic restoration tax credits in connection with the lower-income apartment project. Although Barrington had begun construction on the project before its application for National Park Service historic restoration tax credits was processed, it had been assured -- informally -- that RIHMFC would \"work with\" Barrington in the event the historic restoration tax credits failed to materialize. After construction had advanced to the point that abandonment of the project would have resulted in a substantial financial loss to Barrington, the National Park Service rejected the application for historic restoration tax credits, thereby effectively rendering the project financially unsound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Barrington applied for an additional $100,000 federal income tax credit to offset its failure to obtain the National Park Service historic restoration tax credit. Initially, RIHMFC and defendant-appellee Richard Godfrey, Jr., its executive director, were unreceptive, with Godfrey stating not only that Barrington ought not receive \"another dime\" from RIHMFC, but that it should be left \"holding the bag\" and absorb the loss. Nevertheless, on December 11, 1996, RIHMFC awarded Barrington an additional $122,000 in federal income tax credits, provided its individual contractors agreed to make a $366,000 charitable contribution to the Rhode Island Affordable Housing Trust Fund.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, however, on November 20, 1996, another developer, Gemini Hotel, had \"remitted\" to RIHMFC its $253,462 federal income tax credit allocation for 1996, in return for a commitment from RIHMFC that Gemini Hotel would receive federal income tax credits the following year. The Gemini Hotel \"refund\" was more than enough to fund all pending applications for supplemental 1996 federal income tax credits, including that submitted by Barrington. Thus, the statement Richard Godfrey, Jr. allegedly made to Barrington -- that Barrington's \"charitable contribution\" was essential in order that other qualified lower-income housing project developers not be denied additional federal income tax credits in 1996 -- was knowingly false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Barrington later learned that RIHMFC had allocated additional federal income tax credits to several developers in 1996, all of which (unlike Barrington) were non-profits sponsored by Rhode Island residents. Yet those developers were not required to make a charitable contribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in December 1997, Barrington sought to determine why it was the only developer seeking additional 1996 federal income tax credits which was required to make a charitable contribution. Although Godfrey offered no explanation, he ventured the opinion that Barrington should not have received additional federal income tax credits in the first place. Finally, in May 1998, prior to its tax deadline, Barrington reluctantly disbursed $323,172 to the Rhode Island Affordable Housing Trust Fund in order to obtain the necessary federal income tax credit documentation from RIHMFC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Barrington filed its ten-count complaint against RIHMFC and Godfrey in Rhode Island Superior Court, which RIHMFC removed to federal district court. Count one alleges that RIHMFC and Godfrey, by requiring a charitable contribution, exceeded and abused their statutory and regulatory authority under the Regulations relating to the imposition of application fees. Counts two through nine allege that the defendants thereby violated Barrington's federal and state constitutional rights to equal protection and substantive due process. Finally, count ten asserts an unjust enrichment claim under Rhode Island law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After RIHMFC and Godfrey moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss, with prejudice, counts two through nine and that the pendant state-law claims in counts one and ten be dismissed, without prejudice. The district court adopted the report and recommendation and Barrington appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals de novo, accepting all factual allegations in the amended complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the appellant.

The Substantive Due Process Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Barrington argues that its amended complaint stated a viable claim that the $323,172 \"charitable contribution\" demanded by RIHMFC violated its substantive due process rights under the federal and state constitutions. In order to prevail against a motion to dismiss a substantive due process claim under Rule 12(b)(6), however, it was essential that the complaint either (i) allege that RIHMFC deprived Barrington of a cognizable \"property interest,\" i.e., its right to acquire additional federal income tax credits without being required to pay an application fee in excess of that expressly required by the Regulations, or, failing that, (ii) allege that Barrington's conduct was so egregious as to \"'shock[] the conscience.'\" Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montanez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768711\"><a href=\"/opinion/768711/no-99-1675/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 622 (1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted); Coyne, 972 F.2d at 443 (citation omitted); L.A.

In order to qualify for \"substantive due process\" protection, an alleged \"property interest\" in a governmental benefit must consist of something more than either (i) \"an abstract need or desire\" for the governmental benefit, or (ii) a mere \"unilateral expectation\" that the claimant deserves it. Thus, Barrington needed to allege facts demonstrating a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" to the supplemental tax credits. Board of Regents v.

Ramos-Alverio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199013\"><a href=\"/opinion/199013/figueroa-serrano-v-ramos-alverio/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that \"property interest\" is defined not by Federal Constitution, but by independent sources such as state law or regulations), Barrington can lay claim to no cognizable \"property interest\" in the \"promised\" federal income tax credits. See, e.g., DeHarder Inv. Corp. v. Indiana Hous. Fin. Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525020/deharder-inv-corp-v-ind-housing-finance-auth/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. at 614; see also City of Santa Clara v. Andrus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"354061\"><a href=\"/opinion/354061/city-of-santa-clara-california-v-cecil-andrus-individually-and-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 676 (9th Cir. 1978) (\"'[A] statute will create an entitlement to a governmental benefit either if the statute sets out conditions under which the benefit must be granted or if the statute sets out the only conditions under which the benefit may be denied.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the state plan in DeHarder, the Regulations simply prescribe the criteria for assessing the comparative deservedness of competing applicants for any federal income tax credits allocated to Rhode Island. See Davila-Lopes v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739670\"><a href=\"/opinion/739670/juan-a-davila-lopes-v-jose-soler-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"The [mere] existence of a detailed set of procedural rules is clearly inadequate to create a constitutionally protected property right.\"). Moreover, none of these prescribed criteria, many of which necessarily entail highly subjective assessments, are susceptible to objective quantification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, even if RIHMFC were to assign its highest rating to an application following a preliminary assessment of its criteria, the RIHMFC plan expressly accords the agency the discretion to withhold federal income tax credits from any applicant, albeit a high scorer. See DeHarder, 909 F. Supp. at 613-14 (\"Although [federal law requires that] certain selection criteria must be included in [the State] plan, no specific directives mandate how the [State] Authority must weigh or consider those criteria. In other words, once the criteria are considered, no particular outcome necessarily follows.\"); seealso Coyne, 972 F.2d at 443 (noting that \"property interests\" normally wane as governmental regulation waxes). Thus, under the governing regulatory scheme, Barrington never acquired a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" to supplemental federal income tax credits. Roth, 408 U.S. at 577.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barrington attempts to distinguish DeHarder on the ground that the Regulations contemplate that each applicant is to be assigned a set number of points, provided its proposed project meets certain criteria, and that Barrington was far and away the high scorer in this instance; a status which it retained even after failing to win a National Park Service \"historic restoration\" tax credit. Be that as it may, neither the federal tax code nor the Regulations required RIHMFC to award federal income tax credits to the high-scoring applicant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the Regulations expressly preserve to RIHMFC \"the right to rescind reservations of tax credits for projects in the event that [RIHMFC] determines that the project is infeasible as proposed or a change of circumstances materially altered the proposal as submitted and approved.\" See Regulations &#167; IV(A). The quoted provision severely undermines Barrington's contention that it was \"entitled\" to, thus possessed a property interest in, the 1996 federal income tax credits. Indeed, Barrington acknowledged as much before the district court, by noting that \"[t]here is no regulation that says that anyone is entitled to any number or a certain number of credits.\" As eligibility simply cannot be considered synonymous with entitlement, its substantive due process claim is fatally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The \"Shock the Conscience\" Element</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is the \"shock the conscience\" element in the substantive due process test met on the basis of the motivation RIHMFC allegedly harbored in demanding the charitable contribution. See Cruz-Erazo, 212 F.3d at 622 (explaining that state action \"shocks conscience\" only if it is \"arbitrary and capricious,\" \"run[s] counter to 'the concept of ordered liberty'\" or \"'violat[es] universal standards of decency'\") (citations omitted). Assuming arguendo that the charitable contribution violated the Regulations, mere violations of a state regulatory scheme are not the stuff of which substantive due process claims are constituted. See Coyne, 972 F.2d at 444 (\"It is bedrock law in this circuit[] . . . [] that violations of state law - even where arbitrary, capricious, or undertaken in bad faith - do not, without more, give rise to a denial of substantive due process under the U.S. Constitution.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, although the comments Godfrey allegedly made about Barrington might be characterized -- arguably and at worst -- as harsh, callous or impolitic, see supra Section I, we have held on numerous occasions that far more egregious utterances by state officials did not satisfy the \"shock the conscience\" standard.

Barrington argues that the amended complaint was adequate because it alleged that Barrington and its coapplicants were similarly situated in one critical respect; i.e., each applied to RIHMFC for an additional 1996 federal income tax credit. On appeal, it contends that the \"similar situation\" standard adopted by the district court is overly cramped, in that it contemplates such identicality within a particular class as to make it next to impossible to assert a viable equal protection claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The formula for determining whether individuals or entities are \"similarly situated\" for equal protection purposes is not always susceptible to precise demarcation.

As we have explained, however, \"[t]he test is whether a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents, would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated. Much as in the lawyer's art of distinguishing cases, the 'relevant aspects' are those factual elements which determine whether reasoned analogy supports, or demands, a like result. Exact correlation is neither likely nor necessary, but the cases must be fair congeners. In other words, apples should be compared to apples.\" Dartmouth Review v.

Its amended complaint did allege, albeit in conclusory fashion, that Barrington and other \"similarly situated\" applicants requested supplemental 1996 federal income tax credits, a fact which certainly is material to the present issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the issue before us is not only distinct, it is further complicated by the significant characteristics which Barrington alleges it possessed, without any mention whether its coapplicants shared those characteristics. Consequently, at the present stage in the Rule 12(b)(6) analysis, the question reduces to whether it was necessary that Barrington allege these correlations with reasonable particularity. We conclude that it was incumbent upon Barrington to do so, for the following reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the complaint included allegations which arguably intimated that Barrington was not similarly situated to other applicants in several important respects. The three factual allegations which gave the district court most concern cannot be dismissed as either incidental or facially inconsequential; i.e., (1) Barrington's original application to RIHMFC for federal income tax credits, which was based on an explicit representation that it would receive the $100,000 historic restoration tax credit; (2) its commencement of construction on the lower-income housing project prior to final confirmation of its financing package; and (3) the financial infeasibility of the project absent either the supplemental federal income tax credits from RIHMFC or the historic restoration tax credits from the National Park Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, it would have been entirely reasonable for RIHMFC to consider each of these matters an adequate basis (i.e., dubious business acumen and judgment) for treating the Barrington application differently in the competition for supplemental federal income tax credits. Cf. Knapp v. Hanson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765163\"><a href=\"/opinion/765163/larry-knapp-and-paul-tinder-v-linda-hanson-individually-and-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span>, 789 (8th Cir. 1999) (\"When all that must be shown by defendant is 'any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the [governmental] classification,' it is not necessary to wait for further factual development [of the record].\") (quoting FCC v.

For that matter, in its appellate brief Barrington relates in exhaustive detail the contents of the RIHMFC applications filed by other applicants. See, e.g., Judge, 160 F.3d at 72 n.3, 77 (mandating specificity in complaint so civil rights claimant cannot \"drag a defendant past the pleading threshold\" with \"baseless claims,\" or with a \"conclusory description[] of a 'general scenario which could be dominated by unpleaded facts'\") (emphasis added; citations omitted); Glassman v.

Thus, Barrington readily could have alleged sufficient facts in its amended complaint to demonstrate that its co-applicants were similarly situated in the \"relevant\" respects noted by the district court. See, e.g., Nestor-Colon-Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583574\"><a href=\"/opinion/583574/nestor-colon-medina-sucesores-inc-v-patria-g-custodio/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1992).

Interboro involved a junior college which brought an equal protection claim alleging that state education officials had withheld TAP funding, following an audit, because Interboro is located in downstate New York and primarily enrolls minority students. The district court rejected a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), noting that Interboro \"has alleged that of all institutions receiving TAP funds, it is the only school audited three times in the past six years, and of those institutions audited more than once during that time frame, all were downstate schools.\" Interboro Inst., 956 F.

See Rubinowitz, 60 F.3d at 909-10; cf. Yerardi's, 932 F.2d at 94 (noting that where plaintiff does not rest \"equal protection\" claim on alleged violation of fundamental constitutional right, it is essential that it \"scrupulously me[e]t\" the \"bad faith\" element of its claim). Once again, cf. supra Section II.B.2, the mere fact that appellees may have violated or abused federal or state regulatory regimes by imposing the charitable contribution requirement upon Barrington, in effect wrongfully imposing an application \"fee\" in excess of regulatory limits, has no direct bearing on whether appellees violated Barrington's equal protection rights. See Coyne, 972 F.2d at 444 n.7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the comments Godfrey made about Barrington's loss of the historic restoration tax credits - i.e., Godfrey \"wouldn't give the project another dime\" and would leave Barrington \"holding the bag\" - are likewise readily explained as rational reactions to the perceived imprudence demonstrated by Barrington in commencing project construction before its entire financing package was in place. Although such an inference is not compelled, and we are to draw all reasonable inferences from the amended complaint in Barrington's favor,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the ambiguity of Godfrey's comments unquestionably accentuates the tenuousness of the claim that Barrington was subjected to selective treatment because it is an out-of-state, for-profit organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the discussion in Section II.C.1, supra, affords a sufficient basis for resolving the present appeal, we affirm the dismissal of the equal protection claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court order dismissing the federal claims in counts two through nine, and the order remanding the pendant state-law claims in counts one and ten to the Rhode Island Superior Court, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(c)(3) (supplemental jurisdiction), are affirmed.
