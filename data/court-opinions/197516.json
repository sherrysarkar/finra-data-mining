James  MacFarlane appeals  from  the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict court's grant  of the motion by  appellees, Edgar D.\r\n\nMcKean, III, Esq.,  Julia M.  Nye, Esq. and  the law firm  of\r\r\n\nMcKean, Mattson and Latici, P.A., for judgment as a matter of\r\n\nlaw under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 50(a).  We agree with the district\r\n\ncourt  that appellant failed to introduce evidence from which\r\n\na   reasonable  jury  could  find  causation  in  this  legal\r\n\nmalpractice case.  We also find no abuse of discretion in the\r\n\ndistrict  court's exclusion  of  one  of  appellant's  expert\r\n\nwitnesses.  Finally, we decline appellant's request to vacate\r\n\na sanction imposed jointly  on him and his attorney  pursuant\r\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 11.\r\n\n     1. Rule 50(a) Dismissal \r                                        \r\n\n     We  have   carefully  reviewed  the   evidence  and  the\r\n\ninferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to MacFarlane.

As the  governing standard\r\n\nrequires,  we   have  not   considered  the   credibility  of\r\n\nwitnesses, resolved conflicts in testimony,  or evaluated the\r\n\nweight of evidence.  See id.  Applying plenary  review to the\r                                        \r\n\ndistrict court's judgment,  we conclude that the  evidence of\r\n\ncausation  \"is such that reasonable minds could not differ as\r\n\nto  the outcome.\" Rolon-Alvorado v.
