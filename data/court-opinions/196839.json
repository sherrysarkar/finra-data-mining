FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r          I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We recite  the facts pertinent  to this appeal  as they\r\n\nwere found by the district court, consistent with record support.\r\n\nSee United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 973 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                     \r\n\n          In  early  1994, Susan  Forey,  a  New Hampshire  state\r\n\ntrooper, initiated an investigation  of the appellant's suspected\r\n\nmarijuana-growing   activities.      After  gathering   evidence,\r\n\ninterviewing a confidential informant, and speaking  with several\r\n\ncolleagues  (one of  whom had  interviewed a  second confidential\r\n\ninformant),   Forey  concluded   that  the  appellant   had  been\r\n\ncultivating cannabis in his barn.  She then prepared an affidavit\r\n\n(which relied heavily, albeit not exclusively, on clues furnished\r\n\nby  the  informants)  and  sought a  search  warrant  authorizing\r\n\ninspection of the barn.\r\n\n          A state magistrate issued the warrant on June 27, 1994.\r\n\nThat morning a coterie  of federal, state and local  officers set\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nout to  execute the warrant but temporarily  refrained from doing\r\n\nso when they could  not locate the appellant.   While members  of\r\n\nthe  search party stood guard  at Beech Hill  Road, two troopers,\r\n\nForey  and Elizabeth D'Angelo,  proceeded to  Kathleen Schaefer's\r\n\nresidence in  the hope that they  would find her there.   Forey  \r\n\nwithout entering  the dwelling    noted the distinctive  aroma of\r\n\nmarijuana wafting from  within.  However,  when Ms. Schaefer  did\r\n\nnot  answer the door,  Forey departed (leaving  D'Angelo to await\r\n\nMs. Schaefer's appearance).\r\n\n          Meanwhile,  back  at Beech  Hill  Road,  the Schaefers'\r\n\ntwelve-year-old   daughter,  Amber,  became   agitated  over  the\r\n\ncontinued police presence and enlisted a neighbor to drive her to\r\n\nher  mother's home in Center Harbor.   When she arrived she found\r\n\nD'Angelo patrolling  the  premises.   Using  her own  key,  Amber\r\n\nentered  the house.    D'Angelo accompanied  her and  immediately\r\n\nnoticed the smell of marijuana.   Once inside, the pair found Ms.\r\n\nSchaefer,  who explained that  she had slept  through the earlier\r\n\ncommotion.  D'Angelo asked Ms. Schaefer to accompany her to Beech\r\n\nHill  Road.   Ms. Schaefer  assented, and  they repaired  to that\r\n\nsite.   By then, the search party  had made an initial inspection\r\n\nof the barn and had found some incriminating evidence.\r\n\n          Ms. Schaefer spoke freely  with the officers, and Forey\r\n\neventually asked  for  permission to  search her  dwelling.   Ms.\r\n\nSchaefer hinted that she  might seek counsel, and Forey  told her\r\n\nthat  she could contact  an attorney  if she  so desired.   After\r\n\npondering her options, Ms. Schaefer decided not to call a lawyer,\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nbut,  instead, gave  the authorities  access to  her abode.   She\r\n\nasked only that  the officers conduct their  search discreetly so\r\n\nas not to alarm her neighbors.  The police complied.  It is worth\r\n\nnoting that, before  the search began, Ms. Schaefer forecast that\r\n\nthe searchers would find approximately 100 cannabis plants on the\r\n\npremises.  The forecast proved to be accurate.\r\n\n          Early that afternoon the  appellant returned home  from\r\n\nwork.  The  authorities promptly  placed him under  arrest.   The\r\n\nsearch  of  the  barn  thereafter  commenced  in  earnest.    The\r\n\nsearchers  discovered  1,126 cannabis  plants, plus  an elaborate\r\n\narray of equipment associated  with the growing, preparation, and\r\n\ndistribution of marijuana.\r\n\nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r          II.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In  due  season  a   federal  grand  jury  charged  the\r\n\nSchaefers  with  the   commission  of  various  marijuana-related\r\n\noffenses.1     In  addition,   the  government   sought  criminal\r\n\nforfeiture  of  the  appellant's   home  and  barn,  and  certain\r\n\nmachinery used in the marijuana-growing process.  See 21 U.S.C.  \r                                                               \r\n\n853.  The appellant moved to  suppress the evidence that had been\r\n\nobtained during the searches.   Following a hearing, the district\r\n\ncourt  denied the motion.   See United States  v. Schaefer, Crim.\r                                                                    \r\n\nNo. 94-53-1-M (D.N.H. Dec. 30, 1994) (D. Ct. Op.).\r\n\n          The case  proceeded  to trial  and  a jury  returned  a\r\n\nguilty verdict.   Schaefer then  consented to the  forfeiture and\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Kathleen Schaefer did not  contest the charges against her.\r\nShe is not a party to this appeal.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthe  court imposed  a sixty-three  month incarcerative  sentence.\r\n\nThis appeal ensued.\r\n\nIII.  THE BEECH HILL ROAD SEARCH\r          III.  THE BEECH HILL ROAD SEARCH\r\n\n          On  appeal  Schaefer  charges  that  the   trial  court\r\n\ncommitted  several errors  in refusing  to suppress  the evidence\r\n\nseized from his barn.   His primary asseveration is  that Forey's\r\n\naffidavit  in  support  of   the  warrant  contained   inadequate\r\n\ninformation to  justify  a  finding  of  probable  cause.    This\r\n\nasseveration has two prongs.  First, the appellant maintains that\r\n\nthe  information  provided  by  the confidential  informants  was\r\n\nunreliable  (and, therefore, unusable)  because the affidavit did\r\n\nnot  set  forth sufficient  bases  for  crediting those  sources.\r\n\nSecond,  the appellant  maintains  that much  of the  informants'\r\n\nfingerpointing  was  predicated  on  outdated  information  (and,\r\n\ntherefore,  unusable).   The appellant  insists that, if  all the\r\n\nuntrustworthy information  is stripped from the  affidavit, there\r\n\nis too little left to sustain a finding of probable cause.\r\n\n                     A.  Standard of Review.\r                               A.  Standard of Review.\r                                                     \r\n\n          The Fourth  Amendment provides that  \"no Warrants shall\r\n\nissue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\r\n\nand  particularly describing  the  place to  be searched.\"   U.S.\r\n\nConst. amend. IV.  Probable cause exists when \"the affidavit upon\r\n\nwhich  a  warrant is  founded  demonstrates  in some  trustworthy\r\n\nfashion  the likelihood  that an  offense has been  committed and\r\n\nthat  there is sound reason  to believe that  a particular search\r\n\nwill turn up evidence of it.\"  United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n854,  857-58 (1st Cir. 1988).  The magistrate issuing the warrant\r\n\nmust  look to  the  totality of  the  circumstances in  order  to\r\n\nascertain  the existence  of  probable cause.    See Illinois  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGates,  462 U.S.  213,  238 (1983);  see  also United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nFigueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1024 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                  \r\n\n          This holistic  approach also  applies  when a  district\r\n\ncourt  is called  upon to  evaluate a  magistrate's determination\r\n\nthat, based on the  totality of the circumstances indicated  in a\r\n\nsupporting affidavit, probable cause  exists to search particular\r\n\npremises.    See Aguirre,  839  F.2d  at 857-58.    And the  same\r                                  \r\n\napproach holds when a reviewing tribunal is called upon to assess\r\n\nthe  district  court's  denial   of  a  suppression  motion  that\r\n\nchallenges such a  probable cause  determination.  See  id.   Yet\r                                                                     \r\n\nsuch  review   cannot  start  from  scratch.     \"A  magistrate's\r\n\ndetermination of probable cause should be paid great deference by\r\n\nreviewing courts.\"  Gates, 462 U.S. at 236 (citation and internal\r                                   \r\n\nquotation marks omitted).  Moreover, on an appeal from a district\r\n\ncourt's ruling on a suppression motion, judicial scrutiny must be\r\n\nfiltered  through  a  second  layer of  deference;  although  the\r\n\nappellate court  reviews  the  district  court's  ultimate  legal\r\n\nconclusion   in this  context, the existence vel non  of probable\r                                                              \r\n\ncause   de novo,  it must accept the district  court's subsidiary\r\n\nfindings of  fact unless  those findings are  clearly erroneous.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The Court's  recent decision  in Ornelas v.  United States,\r                                                                          \r\n116 S. Ct. 1657  (1996), reinforces this dichotomous  standard of\r\nreview.  In Ornelas the Court  held, in the case of a warrantless\r                             \r\nsearch pursuant  to the  so-called \"automobile exception\"  to the\r\nwarrant requirement,  that \"the ultimate questions  of reasonable\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nSee Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.\r                    \r\n\n                   B.  Reliance on Informants.\r                             B.  Reliance on Informants.\r                                                       \r\n\n          The  appellant  calumnizes  Forey's heavy  reliance  on\r\n\nstatements  of the two  confidential informants, complaining that\r\n\nher affidavit  provides too  rickety a foundation  for evaluating\r\n\nthe informants' veracity or  bases of knowledge.  Relatedly,  the\r\n\nappellant   suggests  that   the  trooper   did   not  adequately\r\n\ncorroborate the  informants' statements.  Though  forcefully made\r\n\nby able counsel, the appellant's arguments are unfounded.\r\n\n          The   use  of   confidential  informants   in  criminal\r\n\ninvestigations  is  commonplace.   See,  e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nManning,  79  F.3d 212,  220 (1st  Cir.  1996); United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nVargas,  931 F.2d 112, 115-16 (1st Cir.  1991).  The practice has\r                \r\n\nbeen  characterized  as a  necessary part  of  police work.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGates,  462 U.S. at 237-38.   What is  more, an informant's tales\r               \r\n\nneed not invariably  be buttressed  by extensive  encomia to  his\r\n\nveracity  or detailed discussions of the source of his knowledge.\r\n\nWhile  an informant's  truthfulness  and basis  of knowledge  are\r\n\n\"highly  relevant in  determining the value  of his  report,\" the\r\n\nCourt  has  cautioned  that   \"these  elements  should  [not]  be\r\n\nunderstood as entirely separate  and independent requirements  to\r\n\nbe rigidly exacted in every case.\"  Id. at 230.\r                                                 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nsuspicion and probable cause .  . . should be reviewed  de novo.\"\r\nId. at 1659.   By contrast, \"a reviewing  court should take  care\r             \r\nboth to review findings  of historical fact only for  clear error\r\nand  to give due  weight to inferences drawn  from those facts by\r\nresident  judges and  local  law enforcement  officers.\"   Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n1663.   The Ornelas Court's holding is fully consistent with this\r                             \r\ncircuit's precedent as expressed in cases like Zapata.\r                                                               \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          Here,  Forey's  affidavit  contains  more  than  enough\r\n\nsubstantiation to  lend credence to the  confidential informants'\r\n\nreports.   First, Forey expressly  stated that CI-1  had a proven\r\n\ntrack record, and  fortified this statement by attesting that, to\r\n\nher personal  knowledge,  CI-1 had  assisted  the police  in  the\r\n\napprehension  of another drug felon.   We heretofore  have held  \r\n\nand today reaffirm    that  such an indicium  of reliability  may\r\n\nitself  be sufficient  to bulwark  an  informant's report.3   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. 5 Bell Rock  Rd., 896 F.2d 605, 608-09 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1990).      Second,  Forey's   affidavit  explains   that  CI-2's\r\n\ninformation  included declarations against  penal interest.   The\r\n\nfact  that an informant's statements are against his or her penal\r\n\ninterest adds credibility  to the informant's report.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Fields, 72 F.3d  1200, 1214 (5th  Cir. 1996), petition\r                                                                           \r\n\nfor  cert. filed, 64 U.S.L.W.  3709 (U.S. Apr.  8, 1996) (No. 95-\r                          \r\n\n1639); Turner v. Caspari, 38 F.3d 388, 393 (8th Cir. 1994).\r                                  \r\n\n          In addition to these badges  of veracity, circumstances\r\n\nexternal  to each informant's  statements lend additional weight.\r\n\nFor example,  CI-2 confirmed CI-1's statement  that the Schaefers\r\n\nwere engaged in growing cannabis plants indoors in a barn located\r\n\non  their property.    Courts often  have  held that  consistency\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Here, moreover, Forey convincingly explained her failure to\r\nelaborate  upon her comments.  She stated that \"[t]his affiant is\r\npersonally  familiar  with  the   case  in  which  CI-1  provided\r\ninformation and further  detail or description of  the case would\r\nlikely  disclose the  identity of  the CI.\"   The  district court\r\nfound  Forey to  be credible on  this and  other points,  and the\r\nappellant  has  advanced  no   sound  basis  for  rejecting  this\r\ncredibility determination.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nbetween  the  reports  of  two independent  informants  helps  to\r\n\nvalidate both  accounts.  See, e.g., Fields, 72 F.3d at 1214.  In\r                                                     \r\n\na related vein,  neighbors complained  to the police  in June  of\r\n\n1992 regarding the appellant's marijuana cultivation.  The latter\r\n\ncomplaints enjoy  special stature since  information provided  by\r\n\nordinary  citizens has  particular  value in  the probable  cause\r\n\nequation.   See United States v.  Scalia, 993 F.2d  984, 987 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1993); United States  v. Campbell, 732 F.2d 1017,  1019 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1984).\r\n\n          There  is more.   Drawing  on several  sources, Forey's\r\n\naffidavit depicts  the appellant  as a  member of  a loosely-knit\r\n\nband  of marijuana  growers,  known colloquially  as the  \"sea of\r\n\ngreen\" group.  In  an interview with CI-1, summarized  in Forey's\r\n\naffidavit,  Special  Agent Gerald  Graffam  of  the federal  Drug\r\n\nEnforcement  Administration  learned the  names  of  a number  of\r\n\nindividuals  whom  CI-1 claimed  were part  of  the sea  of green\r\n\noperation.   The roster  included the Schaefers,  James Crawford,\r\n\nand James Spellman, to name  a few.  The record  contains several\r\n\nexternal data (i) confirming  the identities and predilections of\r\n\nCrawford, Spellman, and other growers  in the group, (ii) pinning\r\n\ndown   Crawford's  and   Spellman's  involvement   with  cannabis\r\n\ncultivation,  and  (iii)  demonstrating  the  group's  access  to\r\n\nmarijuana plants that were being grown indoors.4\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Forey's affidavit  also contains an account  of an incident\r\nthat occurred in  June 1993  when a fellow  state trooper,  Scott\r\nChampagne, discovered  marijuana plants under  cultivation in the\r\nwoods, in close proximity to the appellant's camper.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n          This list  of sea  of green participants  featured Marc\r\n\nBirmingham, an aide  to Crawford (who had  recently been arrested\r\n\nfor  growing  marijuana).5    Forey's  independent  investigation\r\n\nrevealed that,  before teaming  up with Crawford,  Birmingham had\r\n\nworked  for a company owned  by the appellant.   CI-2 underscored\r\n\nthe Schaefer/Birmingham connection, explaining to Graffam in June\r\n\n1994 that Birmingham told  him that his former employer  \"had set\r\n\nup  a   marijuana  growing  operation  under   his  horse  barn.\"\r\n\nMoreover,  in April  1994, Birmingham  told CI-2  that Crawford's\r\n\ngroup  had procured  \"eight big  plants\" from  his (Birmingham's)\r\n\n\"ex-boss.\"\r\n\n          Birmingham also informed CI-2 that \"his former employer\r\n\nsold  his finished  product in  New York,  where he  was  able to\r\n\nreceive  a  higher price  for it.\"    CI-1 added  an interlocking\r\n\ndatum:   that the appellant \"was the least `controlled' member of\r\n\nthe group  and had been  arrested in  New York for  possession of\r\n\nmarijuana and `patronizing a  prostitute.'\"  Forey confirmed that\r\n\nthe  police had  arrested the  appellant in  Suffolk County,  New\r\n\nYork, on June 8,  1993, for criminal possession of  marijuana and\r\n\npandering.\r\n\n          Forey  also  attempted  to  verify  her  suspicions  by\r\n\ninspecting the appellant's electric bills.  The bills indicated a\r\n\nsuspicious pattern of electricity usage:   the appellant drew  an\r\n\nabnormally  high amount of power in October  of 1993 and April of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5CI-2's   statements   confirmed   CI-1's   assurance   that\r\nBirmingham served as Crawford's lieutenant.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n1994   two  months in which the New  England climate often allows\r\n\nconsumers a  brief respite  from copious  use of  electricity for\r\n\nheating  or cooling.  Based on  Forey's substantial experience in\r\n\nthe  investigation  of  marijuana  farming  and  other  narcotics\r\n\noperations, she concluded that  this pattern indicated periods of\r\n\nintensive cultivation.\r\n\n          The appellant strives to undercut this latter detail by\r\n\npointing out  CI-1's observation  that the appellant  \"powers the\r\n\ngrow operation in the barn with propane rather than electricity.\"\r\n\nThe  appellant   argues  that,  if  CI-1's   statement  is  true,\r\n\nfluctuations   in  the  electric   bills  necessarily   would  be\r\n\nmeaningless.  Forey herself dispelled this seeming paradox at the\r\n\nsuppression  hearing, stating that \"[t]o  say that you're using a\r\n\nsecondary  source of power  and to say  that you know  how to use\r\n\nthat are two different  things,\" and the district court  accepted\r\n\nher explanation.  We need not pursue the point.  Even  were we to\r\n\nfind a discrepancy here, our result would remain unchanged.  When\r\n\nan informant's statements and the  events he attempts to describe\r\n\ndiverge in minor  ways, the magistrate  may reasonably choose  to\r\n\ncredit the statements and  disregard petty inconsistencies.  See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., United States v. Diallo, 29 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                       \r\n\n          To  sum up,  the informants'  credibility and  bases of\r\n\nknowledge  are  sufficiently  illuminated.     More  importantly,\r\n\nForey's affidavit is not  entirely dependent upon the informants'\r\n\nassertions, but  includes  many external  data  fortifying  those\r\n\nassertions.   Indeed, the wealth  of incriminating  circumstances\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nmarshalled  by Forey  in her  affidavit defenestrates  Schaefer's\r\n\nallegation that  the trooper  did not adequately  corroborate the\r\n\ndetails  of  the  confidential  informants' statements.    Having\r\n\ncarefully examined the totality of the circumstances described in\r\n\nthe  affidavit,  we  agree  with  the  state magistrate  and  the\r\n\ndistrict court  that probable cause to issue the warrant existed.\r\n\nSee  Gates, 462 U.S. at  244-45 (explaining that  the police need\r                    \r\n\nonly independently corroborate some of the details supplied by an\r\n\ninformant).\r\n\n                          C.  Staleness.\r                                    C.  Staleness.\r                                                 \r\n\n          We  turn now  to  the appellant's  insistence that  the\r\n\nmagistrate  should  have  disregarded  much  of  the  information\r\n\ndisclosed in the affidavit because it was out of date.   We agree\r\n\nwith the appellant's premise    an affidavit supporting a  search\r\n\nwarrant  must contain timely information  or else it  will fail  \r\n\nbut  we  disagree  with  his conclusion  that  Forey's  affidavit\r\n\nsuffers from this vice.\r\n\n          In trying to make the case for staleness, the appellant\r\n\npoints  to Forey's statement that, \"[i]n 1991 and 1992, CI-1 knew\r\n\nHarold  Schaefer and his wife, Kathleen, to be involved in indoor\r\n\ncannabis cultivation in a  barn on their property.\"   Building on\r\n\nthis  introduction,  he  posits  that  CI-1's  knowledge  of  his\r\n\nactivities  went back two to three years, and, therefore, was old\r\n\nhat.  But courts  confronting suppression motions do not  measure\r\n\nthe timeliness of  collected information mechanistically,  merely\r\n\ncounting  the number  of  days elapsed.    See United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nBucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937,  940 (1st Cir. 1992), cert.  denied, 507\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  959 (1993).  Rather, a number  of integers must be factored\r\n\ninto  the calculus    e.g.,  the nature  of the  information, the\r\n\nnature and characteristics of the supposed criminal activity, the\r\n\nnature and  characteristics  of the  place  to be  searched,  the\r\n\nnature of  the items delineated  in the warrant    and the likely\r\n\nendurance of the information must  be gauged on that basis.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.; see also  United States  v. Moscatiello, 771  F.2d 589,  597\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1985), vacated on other grounds, 476 U.S. 1138 (1986).\r                                                    \r\n\nThe longer the expected duration of the criminal activity and the\r\n\nlonger the expected life  of the items attendant to it,  the more\r\n\nlikely  that  a datum  from the  seemingly  distant past  will be\r\n\nrelevant to a current investigation.\r\n\n          In this case, all signs point to ongoing and entrenched\r\n\nactivity.  CI-1 told Forey that the appellant built his barn as a\r\n\nhaven  for  his  illicit   marijuana-growing  enterprise.    Both\r\n\ninformants  expressed their belief that the appellant was a major\r\n\nplayer in  a long-term  cartel that involved  several independent\r\n\nmarijuana growers.  The warrant did not target items of transient\r\n\nexistence,  but,  rather, featured  chattels  of relatively  dear\r\n\nvalue and solid construction (including hardware commonly used in\r\n\nthe  growing  and distribution  of  marijuana), likely  to  be in\r\n\nservice for several years.  Since these  items possessed enduring\r\n\nworth and  utility, information that might  be considered ancient\r\n\nhistory in considering the probable whereabouts of more transient\r\n\ngoods would  be timely here.   See United  States v. McKeever,  5\r                                                                       \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nF.3d  863, 866 (5th Cir. 1993) (holding that information need not\r\n\nbe  as current  when the  items to  be seized  include hydroponic\r\n\nmarijuana-growing apparatuses);  United States v.  Sturmoski, 971\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  452, 457 (10th Cir. 1992) (holding to like effect regarding\r\n\nlaboratory equipment for the production of methamphetamine).\r\n\n          Then,  too,  the   troopers  proposed  to   search  the\r\n\nappellant's own barn, not a rented  or appropriated facility that\r\n\ncould  easily be used and then abandoned.  The target's ownership\r\n\nof  the  real estate  to  be  searched influences  the  staleness\r\n\ncalculus.   See  Bucuvalas,  970  F.2d  at 941  (explaining  that\r                                    \r\n\ninformation  is more likely to  be timely when  it concerns items\r\n\nstored at a permanent locus).  Finally, it is common ground  that\r\n\ndrug conspiracies tend to be ongoing operations, rendering timely\r\n\ninformation that might, in other contexts, be  regarded as stale.\r\n\nSee  United States v. Nocella,  849 F.2d 33,  40 (1st Cir. 1988).\r                                       \r\n\nIn cumulation, these factors make us hesitant to characterize the\r\n\nchallenged information, even if it is not of very recent vintage,\r\n\nas stale.\r\n\n          We need  not dwell on this subject,  however, since the\r\n\nappellant's argument  fails for an even  more abecedarian reason.\r\n\nWhen an  affidavit tendered in  support of a  warrant application\r\n\ncontains information  that is  remote in  time, a magistrate  may\r\n\nstill  hold  it to  be adequate  if  it also  contains sufficient\r\n\nrecent facts corroborating the  older data and linking that  data\r\n\nto the present.  See id. at 39-40.  Here, the affidavit cited the\r                                  \r\n\nappellant's transfer of marijuana plants to Crawford's  entourage\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nin  April of  1994 (approximately two  months before  the warrant\r\n\nissued), and, moreover, Forey's  probe of utility company records\r\n\nindicated  the appellant's  excessive use  of electricity  in the\r\n\nspring  of 1994.  These  recent details bear  out the appellant's\r\n\nearlier connections  with marijuana growing,  thus rendering  the\r\n\naffidavit temporally adequate.\r\n\nIV.  THE WINONA ROAD SEARCH\r          IV.  THE WINONA ROAD SEARCH\r\n\n          The appellant also challenges the warrantless search of\r\n\nhis wife's residence.  It is settled that an individual may waive\r\n\nthe warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment by consenting  to\r\n\na search of  her person,  property, or  effects, as  long as  the\r\n\nindividual's  consent  is  freely  and voluntarily  given.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nSchneckloth  v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S.  218, 219 (1973); Zapata, 18\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at 977.  Citing  this caselaw, the  government asserts that\r\n\nKathleen Schaefer consented to the search of her home.\r\n\n          The chronology of events  is important.  After Schaefer\r\n\nlodged  his suppression  motion, the  government filed  a written\r\n\nopposition.   Attached  to  the opposition  (and incorporated  by\r\n\nreference therein) were two key documents:  (1) a copy of Forey's\r\n\nreport of her investigation concerning, inter alia, the events of\r                                                            \r\n\nJune  27,  1994, and  (2)  a  copy of  the  affidavit that  Forey\r\n\nsubmitted to the magistrate in conjunction with her request for a\r\n\nsearch warrant.   Judge  McAuliffe heard arguments  regarding the\r\n\nsuppression motion on two separate dates in December of 1994, and\r\n\nconducted a proceeding (partially in camera)  in which both Forey\r\n\nand CI-1  were questioned.  At  the close of the  second day, the\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\njudge  denied the  appellant's motion for  a Franks  hearing, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nFranks v. Delaware, 438  U.S. 154, 171 (1978), and added from the\r                            \r\n\nbench that \"to  the extent we've had a de  facto Franks hearing I\r                                                                 \r\n\nfind  Trooper Forey to be  entirely credible and  I find that she\r\n\ndid  not include any false statement or omission in her affidavit\r\n\nwith regard  to the statements made by confidential informant No.\r\n\n1.\"6  Shortly thereafter,  the court handed down a  written order\r\n\nin which  it denied the appellant's  motion to suppress.   See D.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCt. Op. at 12.\r\n\n           The  government  bears  the  burden of  proving  by  a\r\n\npreponderance of the  evidence that an individual  consented to a\r\n\nsearch of her person, property, or effects.  See United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMatlock,  415 U.S.  164, 177  (1974).   Before us,  the appellant\r                 \r\n\nchallenges  the  Winona  Road  search  on  the  ground  that  the\r\n\ngovernment  adduced  no  evidence   of  consent.    The  relevant\r\n\nparticulars follow.  The suppression motion  cited the absence of\r\n\na  warrant as a ground  for invalidating the  Winona Road search,\r\n\nand the government's opposition  parried this thrust by asserting\r\n\nthat Ms. Schaefer had consented to the search.  Withal, the issue\r\n\nwas  not the  subject of  any testimony  or argumentation  at the\r\n\nsuppression hearing itself.  The only record evidence  of consent\r\n\nis Forey's account of her conversation with Ms. Schaefer (set out\r\n\nin the  police  report).   Judge McAuliffe  addressed the  matter\r\n\nbriefly  in his  written order.   He  found, consistent  with the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Though one  thrust of Schaefer's argument  below focused on\r\nwhat  he   termed   \"material  misrepresentations\"   in   Forey's\r\naffidavit, he does not renew that claim on appeal.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\npolice report,7  that \"Ms. Schaefer agreed to  allow the troopers\r\n\nto  return to  her home  and search  it,\"  D. Ct.  Op. at  3, and\r\n\nconcluded  that \"[t]he  search  of the  Winona Road  property was\r\n\nconducted only  after Kathleen  Schaefer gave express  consent to\r                               \r\n\nthe search,\" id. at 9.\r                          \r\n\n            The appellant argues that the report was not properly\r\n\nbefore the district court  at the suppression hearing,  and that,\r\n\nin  the absence  of  any other  proof  of consent,  the  district\r\n\ncourt's finding  is plucked out of thin  air.  Hence, the pivotal\r\n\nquestion is whether  the district court appropriately  considered\r\n\nthe police report.8  We believe that it did.\r\n\n          We begin with bedrock.   Although a suppression hearing\r\n\nmay be of decretory significance in a given case, it is generally\r\n\ntrue that \"the interests at stake in a suppression hearing are of\r\n\na lesser  magnitude than  those in  the  criminal trial  itself.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S.  667, 679 (1980).  Thus, apart\r                                  \r\n\nfrom questions of privilege, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not\r\n\napply  at suppression hearings.  See Matlock, 415 U.S. at 172-74;\r                                                      \r\n\nsee also Fed. R. Evid. 104(a)  (explaining that the court is \"not\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The  police   report  comprised   Forey's  report  on   the\r\ninvestigation into the appellant's marijuana  growing activities.\r\nThe  report recounted  extended  negotiations  with Ms.  Schaefer\r\nanent the proposed search, culminating in Ms. Schaefer's informed\r\nconsent to it.\r\n\n     8Because the appellant does  not argue that Forey's account,\r\nif properly considered by the district court, was insufficient to\r\nshow the requisite consent,  he has for all intents  and purposes\r\nconceded that  point.  See United States  v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\r                                                              \r\n17  (1st  Cir.)

Consistent with  this praxis, a  judge may  receive\r\n\nhearsay  evidence at a suppression hearing.   See, e.g., Raddatz,\r                                                                          \r\n\n474 U.S. at 679;  United States v.

In implementing this intention, the\r\n\ncourt obviously accepted and relied upon the government's proffer\r\n\nof the police report.  In the absence of a motion to strike   and\r\n\nthe appellant made none   the court  was entitled to do so.   Put\r\n\nanother way,  the government  effected a prima  facie showing  of\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nconsent by placing a copy of the police report before the  court,\r\n\nsee  United States  v.

That  was the time  for appellant to\r\nclaim  surprise and, concomitantly, to move  either to reopen the\r\nproceedings or for reconsideration.  The failure to file any such\r\nmotion  below undercuts the claim  of surprise that  he mounts in\r\nthis  venue.  Cf.  United  States v.

In this appeal, he argues that the lower court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from (a) a barn located near his house on Beech Hill Road in Winona Heights, New Hampshire, and (b) the separate residence of his estranged wife, Kathleen Schaefer, located on Winona Road in Center Harbor, New Hampshire.  Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts pertinent to this appeal as they were found by the district court, consistent with record support.  See United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 973 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1994, Susan Forey, a New Hampshire state trooper, initiated an investigation of the appellant's suspected marijuana-growing activities.  After gathering evidence, interviewing a confidential informant, and speaking with several colleagues (one of whom had interviewed a second confidential informant), Forey concluded that the appellant had been cultivating cannabis in his barn.  She then prepared an affidavit (which relied heavily, albeit not exclusively, on clues furnished by the informants) and sought a search warrant authorizing inspection of the barn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state magistrate issued the warrant on June 27, 1994.  That morning a coterie of federal, state and local officers set out to execute the warrant but temporarily refrained from doing so when they could not locate the appellant.  While members of the search party stood guard at Beech Hill Road, two troopers, Forey and Elizabeth D'Angelo, proceeded to Kathleen Schaefer's residence in the hope that they would find her there.  Forey--without entering the dwelling--noted the distinctive aroma of marijuana wafting from within.  However, when Ms. Schaefer did not answer the door, Forey departed (leaving D'Angelo to await Ms. Schaefer's appearance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, back at Beech Hill Road, the Schaefers' twelve-year-old daughter, Amber, became agitated over the continued police presence and enlisted a neighbor to drive her to her mother's home in Center Harbor.  When she arrived she found D'Angelo patrolling the premises.  Using her own key, Amber entered the house.  D'Angelo accompanied her and immediately noticed the smell of marijuana.  Once inside, the pair found Ms. Schaefer, who explained that she had slept through the earlier commotion.  D'Angelo asked Ms. Schaefer to accompany her to Beech Hill Road.  Ms. Schaefer assented, and they repaired to that site.  By then, the search party had made an initial inspection of the barn and had found some incriminating evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Schaefer spoke freely with the officers, and Forey eventually asked for permission to search her dwelling.  Ms. Schaefer hinted that she might seek counsel, and Forey told her that she could contact an attorney if she so desired.  After pondering her options, Ms. Schaefer decided not to call a lawyer, but, instead, gave the authorities access to her abode.  She asked only that the officers conduct their search discreetly so as not to alarm her neighbors.  The police complied.  It is worth noting that, before the search began, Ms. Schaefer forecast that the searchers would find approximately 100 cannabis plants on the premises.  The forecast proved to be accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early that afternoon the appellant returned home from work.  The authorities promptly placed him under arrest.  The search of the barn thereafter commenced in earnest.  The searchers discovered 1,126 cannabis plants, plus an elaborate array of equipment associated with the growing, preparation, and distribution of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season a federal grand jury charged the Schaefers with the commission of various marijuana-related offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In addition, the government sought criminal forfeiture of the appellant's home and barn, and certain machinery used in the marijuana-growing process.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  The appellant moved to suppress the evidence that had been obtained during the searches.  Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion.  See United States v. Schaefer, Crim.  No. 94-53-1-M (D.N.H. Dec. 30, 1994) (D.Ct.Op.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial and a jury returned a guilty verdict.  Schaefer then consented to the forfeiture and the court imposed a sixty-three month incarcerative sentence.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE BEECH HILL ROAD SEARCH</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Schaefer charges that the trial court committed several errors in refusing to suppress the evidence seized from his barn.  His primary asseveration is that Forey's affidavit in support of the warrant contained inadequate information to justify a finding of probable cause.  This asseveration has two prongs.  First, the appellant maintains that the information provided by the confidential informants was unreliable (and, therefore, unusable) because the affidavit did not set forth sufficient bases for crediting those sources.  Second, the appellant maintains that much of the informants' fingerpointing was predicated on outdated information (and, therefore, unusable).  The appellant insists that, if all the untrustworthy information is stripped from the affidavit, there is too little left to sustain a finding of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A. Standard of Review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched.\"   U.S. Const. amend.  IV. Probable cause exists when \"the affidavit upon which a warrant is founded demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been committed and that there is sound reason to believe that a particular search will turn up evidence of it.\"  United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 857-58 (1st Cir.1988).  The magistrate issuing the warrant must look to the totality of the circumstances in order to ascertain the existence of probable cause.  See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983);  see also United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1024 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holistic approach also applies when a district court is called upon to evaluate a magistrate's determination that, based on the totality of the circumstances indicated in a supporting affidavit, probable cause exists to search particular premises.  See Aguirre, 839 F.2d at 857-58.   And the same approach holds when a reviewing tribunal is called upon to assess the district court's denial of a suppression motion that challenges such a probable cause determination.  See id.   Yet such review cannot start from scratch.  \"A magistrate's determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\"  Gates, 462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. at 2331 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, on an appeal from a district court's ruling on a suppression motion, judicial scrutiny must be filtered through a second layer of deference;  although the appellate court reviews the district court's ultimate legal conclusion--in this context, the existence vel non of probable cause--de novo, it must accept the district court's subsidiary findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.B. Reliance on Informants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant calumnizes Forey's heavy reliance on statements of the two confidential informants, complaining that her affidavit provides too rickety a foundation for evaluating the informants' veracity or bases of knowledge.  Relatedly, the appellant suggests that the trooper did not adequately corroborate the informants' statements.  Though forcefully made by able counsel, the appellant's arguments are unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of confidential informants in criminal investigations is commonplace.  See, e.g., United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 220 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Vargas, 931 F.2d 112, 115-16 (1st Cir.1991).  The practice has been characterized as a necessary part of police work.  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 237-38, 103 S.Ct. at 2331-32.   What is more, an informant's tales need not invariably be buttressed by extensive encomia to his veracity or detailed discussions of the source of his knowledge.  While an informant's truthfulness and basis of knowledge are \"highly relevant in determining the value of his report,\" the Court has cautioned that \"these elements should [not] be understood as entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\"  Id. at 230, 103 S.Ct. at 2328.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Forey's affidavit contains more than enough substantiation to lend credence to the confidential informants' reports.  First, Forey expressly stated that CI-1 had a proven track record, and fortified this statement by attesting that, to her personal knowledge, CI-1 had assisted the police in the apprehension of another drug felon.  We heretofore have held--and today reaffirm--that such an indicium of reliability may itself be sufficient to bulwark an informant's report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See United States v. 5 Bell Rock Rd., 896 F.2d 605, 608-09 (1st Cir.1990).  Second, Forey's affidavit explains that CI-2's information included declarations against penal interest.  The fact that an informant's statements are against his or her penal interest adds credibility to the informant's report.  See United States v. Fields, 72 F.3d 1200, 1214 (5th Cir.1996), petition for cert. filed, 64 U.S.L.W. 3709 (U.S. Apr. 8, 1996) (No. 95-1639);  Turner v. Caspari, 38 F.3d 388, 393 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these badges of veracity, circumstances external to each informant's statements lend additional weight.  For example, CI-2 confirmed CI-1's statement that the Schaefers were engaged in growing cannabis plants indoors in a barn located on their property.  Courts often have held that consistency between the reports of two independent informants helps to validate both accounts.  See, e.g., Fields, 72 F.3d at 1214.   In a related vein, neighbors complained to the police in June of 1992 regarding the appellant's marijuana cultivation.  The latter complaints enjoy special stature since information provided by ordinary citizens has particular value in the probable cause equation.  See United States v. Scalia, 993 F.2d 984, 987 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Campbell, 732 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is more.  Drawing on several sources, Forey's affidavit depicts the appellant as a member of a loosely-knit band of marijuana growers, known colloquially as the \"sea of green\" group.  In an interview with CI-1, summarized in Forey's affidavit, Special Agent Gerald Graffam of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration learned the names of a number of individuals whom CI-1 claimed were part of the sea of green operation.  The roster included the Schaefers, James Crawford, and James Spellman, to name a few.  The record contains several external data (i) confirming the identities and predilections of Crawford, Spellman, and other growers in the group, (ii) pinning down Crawford's and Spellman's involvement with cannabis cultivation, and (iii) demonstrating the group's access to marijuana plants that were being grown indoors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This list of sea of green participants featured Marc Birmingham, an aide to Crawford (who had recently been arrested for growing marijuana).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Forey's independent investigation revealed that, before teaming up with Crawford, Birmingham had worked for a company owned by the appellant.  CI-2 underscored the Schaefer/Birmingham connection, explaining to Graffam in June 1994 that Birmingham told him that his former employer \"had set up a marijuana growing operation under his horse barn.\"   Moreover, in April 1994, Birmingham told CI-2 that Crawford's group had procured \"eight big plants\" from his (Birmingham's) \"ex-boss.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham also informed CI-2 that \"his former employer sold his finished product in New York, where he was able to receive a higher price for it.\"   CI-1 added an interlocking datum:  that the appellant \"was the least 'controlled' member of the group and had been arrested in New York for possession of marijuana and 'patronizing a prostitute.' \"   Forey confirmed that the police had arrested the appellant in Suffolk County, New York, on June 8, 1993, for criminal possession of marijuana and pandering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forey also attempted to verify her suspicions by inspecting the appellant's electric bills.  The bills indicated a suspicious pattern of electricity usage:  the appellant drew an abnormally high amount of power in October of 1993 and April of 1994--two months in which the New England climate often allows consumers a brief respite from copious use of electricity for heating or cooling.  Based on Forey's substantial experience in the investigation of marijuana farming and other narcotics operations, she concluded that this pattern indicated periods of intensive cultivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant strives to undercut this latter detail by pointing out CI-1's observation that the appellant \"powers the grow operation in the barn with propane rather than electricity.\"   The appellant argues that, if CI-1's statement is true, fluctuations in the electric bills necessarily would be meaningless.  Forey herself dispelled this seeming paradox at the suppression hearing, stating that \"[t]o say that you're using a secondary source of power and to say that you know how to use that are two different things,\" and the district court accepted her explanation.  We need not pursue the point.  Even were we to find a discrepancy here, our result would remain unchanged.  When an informant's statements and the events he attempts to describe diverge in minor ways, the magistrate may reasonably choose to credit the statements and disregard petty inconsistencies.  See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, 29 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the informants' credibility and bases of knowledge are sufficiently illuminated.  More importantly, Forey's affidavit is not entirely dependent upon the informants' assertions, but includes many external data fortifying those assertions.  Indeed, the wealth of incriminating circumstances marshalled by Forey in her affidavit defenestrates Schaefer's allegation that the trooper did not adequately corroborate the details of the confidential informants' statements.  Having carefully examined the totality of the circumstances described in the affidavit, we agree with the state magistrate and the district court that probable cause to issue the warrant existed.  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 244-45, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 (explaining that the police need only independently corroborate some of the details supplied by an informant).C. Staleness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the appellant's insistence that the magistrate should have disregarded much of the information disclosed in the affidavit because it was out of date.  We agree with the appellant's premise--an affidavit supporting a search warrant must contain timely information or else it will fail--but we disagree with his conclusion that Forey's affidavit suffers from this vice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trying to make the case for staleness, the appellant points to Forey's statement that, \"[i]n 1991 and 1992, CI-1 knew Harold Schaefer and his wife, Kathleen, to be involved in indoor cannabis cultivation in a barn on their property.\"   Building on this introduction, he posits that CI-1's knowledge of his activities went back two to three years, and, therefore, was old hat.  But courts confronting suppression motions do not measure the timeliness of collected information mechanistically, merely counting the number of days elapsed.  See United States v. Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937, 940 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 959, 113 S.Ct. 1382, 122 L.Ed.2d 758 (1993).  Rather, a number of integers must be factored into the calculus--e.g., the nature of the information, the nature and characteristics of the supposed criminal activity, the nature and characteristics of the place to be searched, the nature of the items delineated in the warrant--and the likely endurance of the information must be gauged on that basis.  See id.;   see also United States v. Moscatiello, 771 F.2d 589, 597 (1st Cir.1985), vacated on other grounds, 476 U.S. 1138, 106 S.Ct. 2241, 90 L.Ed.2d 688 (1986).  The longer the expected duration of the criminal activity and the longer the expected life of the items attendant to it, the more likely that a datum from the seemingly distant past will be relevant to a current investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, all signs point to ongoing and entrenched activity.  CI-1 told Forey that the appellant built his barn as a haven for his illicit marijuana-growing enterprise.  Both informants expressed their belief that the appellant was a major player in a long-term cartel that involved several independent marijuana growers.  The warrant did not target items of transient existence, but, rather, featured chattels of relatively dear value and solid construction (including hardware commonly used in the growing and distribution of marijuana), likely to be in service for several years.  Since these items possessed enduring worth and utility, information that might be considered ancient history in considering the probable whereabouts of more transient goods would be timely here.  See United States v. McKeever, 5 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that information need not be as current when the items to be seized include hydroponic marijuana-growing apparatuses);  United States v. Sturmoski, 971 F.2d 452, 457 (10th Cir.1992) (holding to like effect regarding laboratory equipment for the production of methamphetamine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, the troopers proposed to search the appellant's own barn, not a rented or appropriated facility that could easily be used and then abandoned.  The target's ownership of the real estate to be searched influences the staleness calculus.  See Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d at 941 (explaining that information is more likely to be timely when it concerns items stored at a permanent locus).  Finally, it is common ground that drug conspiracies tend to be ongoing operations, rendering timely information that might, in other contexts, be regarded as stale.  See United States v. Nocella, 849 F.2d 33, 40 (1st Cir.1988).  In cumulation, these factors make us hesitant to characterize the challenged information, even if it is not of very recent vintage, as stale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell on this subject, however, since the appellant's argument fails for an even more abecedarian reason.  When an affidavit tendered in support of a warrant application contains information that is remote in time, a magistrate may still hold it to be adequate if it also contains sufficient recent facts corroborating the older data and linking that data to the present.  See id. at 39-40.   Here, the affidavit cited the appellant's transfer of marijuana plants to Crawford's entourage in April of 1994 (approximately two months before the warrant issued), and, moreover, Forey's probe of utility company records indicated the appellant's excessive use of electricity in the spring of 1994.  These recent details bear out the appellant's earlier connections with marijuana growing, thus rendering the affidavit temporally adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE WINONA ROAD SEARCH</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also challenges the warrantless search of his wife's residence.  It is settled that an individual may waive the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment by consenting to a search of her person, property, or effects, as long as the individual's consent is freely and voluntarily given.  See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2043-44, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973);  Zapata, 18 F.3d at 977.   Citing this caselaw, the government asserts that Kathleen Schaefer consented to the search of her home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chronology of events is important.  After Schaefer lodged his suppression motion, the government filed a written opposition.  Attached to the opposition (and incorporated by reference therein) were two key documents:  (1) a copy of Forey's report of her investigation concerning, inter alia, the events of June 27, 1994, and (2) a copy of the affidavit that Forey submitted to the magistrate in conjunction with her request for a search warrant.  Judge McAuliffe heard arguments regarding the suppression motion on two separate dates in December of 1994, and conducted a proceeding (partially in camera) in which both Forey and CI-1 were questioned.  At the close of the second day, the judge denied the appellant's motion for a Franks hearing, see Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2684, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), and added from the bench that \"to the extent we've had a de facto Franks hearing I find Trooper Forey to be entirely credible and I find that she did not include any false statement or omission in her affidavit with regard to the statements made by confidential informant No. 1.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Shortly thereafter, the court handed down a written order in which it denied the appellant's motion to suppress.  See D. Ct. Op. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an individual consented to a search of her person, property, or effects.  See United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 177, 94 S.Ct. 988, 996, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974).  Before us, the appellant challenges the Winona Road search on the ground that the government adduced no evidence of consent.  The relevant particulars follow.  The suppression motion cited the absence of a warrant as a ground for invalidating the Winona Road search, and the government's opposition parried this thrust by asserting that Ms. Schaefer had consented to the search.  Withal, the issue was not the subject of any testimony or argumentation at the suppression hearing itself.  The only record evidence of consent is Forey's account of her conversation with Ms. Schaefer (set out in the police report).  Judge McAuliffe addressed the matter briefly in his written order.  He found, consistent with the police report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that \"Ms. Schaefer agreed to allow the troopers to return to her home and search it,\" D. Ct. Op. at 3, and concluded that \"[t]he search of the Winona Road property was conducted only after Kathleen Schaefer gave express consent to the search,\" id. at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that the report was not properly before the district court at the suppression hearing, and that, in the absence of any other proof of consent, the district court's finding is plucked out of thin air.  Hence, the pivotal question is whether the district court appropriately considered the police report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We believe that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  Although a suppression hearing may be of decretory significance in a given case, it is generally true that \"the interests at stake in a suppression hearing are of a lesser magnitude than those in the criminal trial itself.\"  United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 679, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 2414, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980).  Thus, apart from questions of privilege, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at suppression hearings.  See Matlock, 415 U.S. at 172-74, 94 S.Ct. at 993-95;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) (explaining that the court is \"not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges,\" in deciding \"[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence\") &amp; 1101(d)(1) (declaring the Evidence Rules inapplicable to \"[t]he determination of questions of fact preliminary to admissibility of evidence when the issue is to be determined by the court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, a judge presiding at a suppression hearing may receive and consider any relevant evidence, including affidavits and unsworn documents that bear indicia of reliability.  See United States v. Lee, 541 F.2d 1145, 1146 (5th Cir.1976).  Consistent with this praxis, a judge may receive hearsay evidence at a suppression hearing.  See, e.g., Raddatz, 447 U.S. at 679, 100 S.Ct. at 2414;  United States v. Merritt, 695 F.2d 1263, 1269 (10th Cir.1982);  United States v. Ocampo, 650 F.2d 421, 427 (2d Cir.1981);  United States v. Bolin, 514 F.2d 554, 557 (7th Cir.1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the suppression hearing itself concentrated on only a few of the many issues raised by the appellant's motion.  It did not focus at all on the Winona Road search, and it is apparent to even a casual observer that the district court--with the parties' tacit acquiescence--intended to decide that aspect of the motion on the papers.  In implementing this intention, the court obviously accepted and relied upon the government's proffer of the police report.  In the absence of a motion to strike--and the appellant made none--the court was entitled to do so.  Put another way, the government effected a prima facie showing of consent by placing a copy of the police report before the court, see United States v. Barnes, 443 F.Supp. 137, 139 (S.D.N.Y.1977);  and since the appellant (who cross-examined Forey but shied away from questioning her about the Winona Road search) adduced no evidence that impeached or contradicted the trooper's account of the manner in which she obtained Ms. Schaefer's consent, the court could properly base a finding on that account.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See, e.g., Zapata, 18 F.3d at 977 (affirming the trial court's inference of consent in the absence of contrary factual evidence);  cf.  United States v. McKneely, 6 F.3d 1447, 1453 (10th Cir.1993) (rejecting as clearly erroneous a finding of coerced consent under circumstances in which the government's evidence of the defendant's voluntary consent was \"uncontroverted by facts because defendants offered no testimony to the contrary\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Because the lower court appropriately refused to suppress the inculpatory evidence that the government's lawful searches had amassed, the judgment below must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Kathleen Schaefer did not contest the charges against her.

United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134  L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), reinforces this dichotomous standard of review.  In Ornelas the Court held, in the case of a warrantless search pursuant to the so-called \"automobile exception\" to the warrant requirement, that \"the ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause ... should be reviewed de novo.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1659.   By contrast, \"a reviewing court should take care both to review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1663.

See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.)  (admonishing that matters neither briefed nor argued are waived), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The appellant claims unfair surprise, saying in effect that he was unaware that the court would consider the police report.

Discerning no error, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts pertinent to this appeal as they were found by the district court, consistent with record support.  See United States v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>, 973 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1994, Susan Forey, a New Hampshire state trooper, initiated an investigation of the appellant's suspected marijuana-growing activities.  After gathering evidence, interviewing a confidential informant, and speaking with several colleagues (one of whom had interviewed a second confidential informant), Forey concluded that the appellant had been cultivating cannabis in his barn.  She then prepared an affidavit (which relied heavily, albeit not exclusively, on clues furnished by the informants) and sought a search warrant authorizing inspection of the barn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state magistrate issued the warrant on June 27, 1994.  That morning a coterie of federal, state and local officers set out to execute the warrant but temporarily refrained from doing so when they could not locate the appellant.  While members of the search party stood guard at Beech Hill Road, two troopers, Forey and Elizabeth D'Angelo, proceeded to Kathleen Schaefer's residence in the hope that they would find her there.  Forey--without entering the dwelling--noted the distinctive aroma of marijuana wafting from within.  However, when Ms. Schaefer did not answer the door, Forey departed (leaving D'Angelo to await Ms. Schaefer's appearance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, back at Beech Hill Road, the Schaefers' twelve-year-old daughter, Amber, became agitated over the continued police presence and enlisted a neighbor to drive her to her mother's home in Center Harbor.  When she arrived she found D'Angelo patrolling the premises.  Using her own key, Amber entered the house.  D'Angelo accompanied her and immediately noticed the smell of marijuana.  Once inside, the pair found Ms. Schaefer, who explained that she had slept through the earlier commotion.  D'Angelo asked Ms. Schaefer to accompany her to Beech Hill Road.  Ms. Schaefer assented, and they repaired to that site.  By then, the search party had made an initial inspection of the barn and had found some incriminating evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Schaefer spoke freely with the officers, and Forey eventually asked for permission to search her dwelling.  Ms. Schaefer hinted that she might seek counsel, and Forey told her that she could contact an attorney if she so desired.  After pondering her options, Ms. Schaefer decided not to call a lawyer, but, instead, gave the authorities access to her abode.  She asked only that the officers conduct their search discreetly so as not to alarm her neighbors.  The police complied.  It is worth noting that, before the search began, Ms. Schaefer forecast that the searchers would find approximately 100 cannabis plants on the premises.  The forecast proved to be accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early that afternoon the appellant returned home from work.  The authorities promptly placed him under arrest.  The search of the barn thereafter commenced in earnest.  The searchers discovered 1,126 cannabis plants, plus an elaborate array of equipment associated with the growing, preparation, and distribution of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season a federal grand jury charged the Schaefers with the commission of various marijuana-related offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In addition, the government sought criminal forfeiture of the appellant's home and barn, and certain machinery used in the marijuana-growing process.  See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853.  The appellant moved to suppress the evidence that had been obtained during the searches.  Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion.  See United States v. Schaefer, Crim.  No. 94-53-1-M (D.N.H. Dec. 30, 1994) (D.Ct.Op.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case proceeded to trial and a jury returned a guilty verdict.  Schaefer then consented to the forfeiture and the court imposed a sixty-three month incarcerative sentence.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE BEECH HILL ROAD SEARCH</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Schaefer charges that the trial court committed several errors in refusing to suppress the evidence seized from his barn.  His primary asseveration is that Forey's affidavit in support of the warrant contained inadequate information to justify a finding of probable cause.  This asseveration has two prongs.  First, the appellant maintains that the information provided by the confidential informants was unreliable (and, therefore, unusable) because the affidavit did not set forth sufficient bases for crediting those sources.  Second, the appellant maintains that much of the informants' fingerpointing was predicated on outdated information (and, therefore, unusable).  The appellant insists that, if all the untrustworthy information is stripped from the affidavit, there is too little left to sustain a finding of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>A.

The magistrate issuing the warrant must look to the totality of the circumstances in order to ascertain the existence of probable cause.  See Illinois v.

See Aguirre, 839 F.2d at 857-58.   And the same approach holds when a reviewing tribunal is called upon to assess the district court's denial of a suppression motion that challenges such a probable cause determination.  See id.   Yet such review cannot start from scratch.  \"A magistrate's determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\"  Gates, 462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. at 2331 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, on an appeal from a district court's ruling on a suppression motion, judicial scrutiny must be filtered through a second layer of deference;  although the appellate court reviews the district court's ultimate legal conclusion--in this context, the existence vel non of probable cause--de novo, it must accept the district court's subsidiary findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975.B. Reliance on Informants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant calumnizes Forey's heavy reliance on statements of the two confidential informants, complaining that her affidavit provides too rickety a foundation for evaluating the informants' veracity or bases of knowledge.  Relatedly, the appellant suggests that the trooper did not adequately corroborate the informants' statements.  Though forcefully made by able counsel, the appellant's arguments are unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of confidential informants in criminal investigations is commonplace.  See, e.g., United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196640\"><a href=\"/opinion/196640/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v.

The practice has been characterized as a necessary part of police work.  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 237-38, 103 S.Ct. at 2331-32.   What is more, an informant's tales need not invariably be buttressed by extensive encomia to his veracity or detailed discussions of the source of his knowledge.  While an informant's truthfulness and basis of knowledge are \"highly relevant in determining the value of his report,\" the Court has cautioned that \"these elements should [not] be understood as entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\"  Id. at 230, 103 S.Ct. at 2328.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Forey's affidavit contains more than enough substantiation to lend credence to the confidential informants' reports.  First, Forey expressly stated that CI-1 had a proven track record, and fortified this statement by attesting that, to her personal knowledge, CI-1 had assisted the police in the apprehension of another drug felon.  We heretofore have held--and today reaffirm--that such an indicium of reliability may itself be sufficient to bulwark an informant's report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See United States v. 5 Bell Rock Rd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536972\"><a href=\"/opinion/536972/united-states-v-parcel-of-land-and-residence-located-thereon-at-5-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 608-09 (1st Cir.1990).  Second, Forey's affidavit explains that CI-2's information included declarations against penal interest.  The fact that an informant's statements are against his or her penal interest adds credibility to the informant's report.  See United States v. Fields, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8255\"><a href=\"/opinion/8255/united-states-v-fields/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span>, 1214 (5th Cir.1996), petition for cert. filed, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.L.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">3709</span></span> (U.S. Apr. 8, 1996) (No. 95-1639);  Turner v. Caspari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680756\"><a href=\"/opinion/680756/shon-turner-v-paul-caspari-mary-brundage-ann-austermann-major-j-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 393 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these badges of veracity, circumstances external to each informant's statements lend additional weight.  For example, CI-2 confirmed CI-1's statement that the Schaefers were engaged in growing cannabis plants indoors in a barn located on their property.  Courts often have held that consistency between the reports of two independent informants helps to validate both accounts.  See, e.g., Fields, 72 F.3d at 1214.   In a related vein, neighbors complained to the police in June of 1992 regarding the appellant's marijuana cultivation.  The latter complaints enjoy special stature since information provided by ordinary citizens has particular value in the probable cause equation.  See United States v. Scalia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607107\"><a href=\"/opinion/607107/united-states-v-rickie-albert-scalia/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>, 987 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v.

Drawing on several sources, Forey's affidavit depicts the appellant as a member of a loosely-knit band of marijuana growers, known colloquially as the \"sea of green\" group.  In an interview with CI-1, summarized in Forey's affidavit, Special Agent Gerald Graffam of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration learned the names of a number of individuals whom CI-1 claimed were part of the sea of green operation.  The roster included the Schaefers, James Crawford, and James Spellman, to name a few.  The record contains several external data (i) confirming the identities and predilections of Crawford, Spellman, and other growers in the group, (ii) pinning down Crawford's and Spellman's involvement with cannabis cultivation, and (iii) demonstrating the group's access to marijuana plants that were being grown indoors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This list of sea of green participants featured Marc Birmingham, an aide to Crawford (who had recently been arrested for growing marijuana).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Forey's independent investigation revealed that, before teaming up with Crawford, Birmingham had worked for a company owned by the appellant.  CI-2 underscored the Schaefer/Birmingham connection, explaining to Graffam in June 1994 that Birmingham told him that his former employer \"had set up a marijuana growing operation under his horse barn.\"   Moreover, in April 1994, Birmingham told CI-2 that Crawford's group had procured \"eight big plants\" from his (Birmingham's) \"ex-boss.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham also informed CI-2 that \"his former employer sold his finished product in New York, where he was able to receive a higher price for it.\"   CI-1 added an interlocking datum:  that the appellant \"was the least 'controlled' member of the group and had been arrested in New York for possession of marijuana and 'patronizing a prostitute.' \"   Forey confirmed that the police had arrested the appellant in Suffolk County, New York, on June 8, 1993, for criminal possession of marijuana and pandering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forey also attempted to verify her suspicions by inspecting the appellant's electric bills.  The bills indicated a suspicious pattern of electricity usage:  the appellant drew an abnormally high amount of power in October of 1993 and April of 1994--two months in which the New England climate often allows consumers a brief respite from copious use of electricity for heating or cooling.  Based on Forey's substantial experience in the investigation of marijuana farming and other narcotics operations, she concluded that this pattern indicated periods of intensive cultivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant strives to undercut this latter detail by pointing out CI-1's observation that the appellant \"powers the grow operation in the barn with propane rather than electricity.\"   The appellant argues that, if CI-1's statement is true, fluctuations in the electric bills necessarily would be meaningless.  Forey herself dispelled this seeming paradox at the suppression hearing, stating that \"[t]o say that you're using a secondary source of power and to say that you know how to use that are two different things,\" and the district court accepted her explanation.  We need not pursue the point.  Even were we to find a discrepancy here, our result would remain unchanged.  When an informant's statements and the events he attempts to describe diverge in minor ways, the magistrate may reasonably choose to credit the statements and disregard petty inconsistencies.  See, e.g., United States v. Diallo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195489\"><a href=\"/opinion/195489/united-states-v-diallo/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the informants' credibility and bases of knowledge are sufficiently illuminated.  More importantly, Forey's affidavit is not entirely dependent upon the informants' assertions, but includes many external data fortifying those assertions.  Indeed, the wealth of incriminating circumstances marshalled by Forey in her affidavit defenestrates Schaefer's allegation that the trooper did not adequately corroborate the details of the confidential informants' statements.  Having carefully examined the totality of the circumstances described in the affidavit, we agree with the state magistrate and the district court that probable cause to issue the warrant existed.  See Gates, 462 U.S. at 244-45, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 (explaining that the police need only independently corroborate some of the details supplied by an informant).C. Staleness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the appellant's insistence that the magistrate should have disregarded much of the information disclosed in the affidavit because it was out of date.  We agree with the appellant's premise--an affidavit supporting a search warrant must contain timely information or else it will fail--but we disagree with his conclusion that Forey's affidavit suffers from this vice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trying to make the case for staleness, the appellant points to Forey's statement that, \"[i]n 1991 and 1992, CI-1 knew Harold Schaefer and his wife, Kathleen, to be involved in indoor cannabis cultivation in a barn on their property.\"   Building on this introduction, he posits that CI-1's knowledge of his activities went back two to three years, and, therefore, was old hat.  But courts confronting suppression motions do not measure the timeliness of collected information mechanistically, merely counting the number of days elapsed.  See United States v. Bucuvalas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587567\"><a href=\"/opinion/587567/united-states-v-george-m-bucuvalas-united-states-of-america-v-aristedes/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span>, 940 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></span> (1993).  Rather, a number of integers must be factored into the calculus--e.g., the nature of the information, the nature and characteristics of the supposed criminal activity, the nature and characteristics of the place to be searched, the nature of the items delineated in the warrant--and the likely endurance of the information must be gauged on that basis.  See id.;   see also United States v. Moscatiello, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457689\"><a href=\"/opinion/457689/united-states-v-christopher-moscatiello-united-states-of-america-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span>, 597 (1st Cir.1985), vacated on other grounds, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1138</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></span> (1986).  The longer the expected duration of the criminal activity and the longer the expected life of the items attendant to it, the more likely that a datum from the seemingly distant past will be relevant to a current investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, all signs point to ongoing and entrenched activity.  CI-1 told Forey that the appellant built his barn as a haven for his illicit marijuana-growing enterprise.  Both informants expressed their belief that the appellant was a major player in a long-term cartel that involved several independent marijuana growers.  The warrant did not target items of transient existence, but, rather, featured chattels of relatively dear value and solid construction (including hardware commonly used in the growing and distribution of marijuana), likely to be in service for several years.  Since these items possessed enduring worth and utility, information that might be considered ancient history in considering the probable whereabouts of more transient goods would be timely here.  See United States v. McKeever, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5966\"><a href=\"/opinion/5966/united-states-v-mckeever/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span>, 866 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that information need not be as current when the items to be seized include hydroponic marijuana-growing apparatuses);  United States v. Sturmoski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587720\"><a href=\"/opinion/587720/united-states-v-walt-anthony-sturmoski-aka-anthony-w-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 457 (10th Cir.1992) (holding to like effect regarding laboratory equipment for the production of methamphetamine).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, the troopers proposed to search the appellant's own barn, not a rented or appropriated facility that could easily be used and then abandoned.  The target's ownership of the real estate to be searched influences the staleness calculus.  See Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d at 941 (explaining that information is more likely to be timely when it concerns items stored at a permanent locus).  Finally, it is common ground that drug conspiracies tend to be ongoing operations, rendering timely information that might, in other contexts, be regarded as stale.  See United States v. Nocella, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507354\"><a href=\"/opinion/507354/united-states-v-robert-nocella-sr-aka-doc/\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1988).  In cumulation, these factors make us hesitant to characterize the challenged information, even if it is not of very recent vintage, as stale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell on this subject, however, since the appellant's argument fails for an even more abecedarian reason.  When an affidavit tendered in support of a warrant application contains information that is remote in time, a magistrate may still hold it to be adequate if it also contains sufficient recent facts corroborating the older data and linking that data to the present.  See id. at 39-40.   Here, the affidavit cited the appellant's transfer of marijuana plants to Crawford's entourage in April of 1994 (approximately two months before the warrant issued), and, moreover, Forey's probe of utility company records indicated the appellant's excessive use of electricity in the spring of 1994.  These recent details bear out the appellant's earlier connections with marijuana growing, thus rendering the affidavit temporally adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE WINONA ROAD SEARCH</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also challenges the warrantless search of his wife's residence.  It is settled that an individual may waive the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment by consenting to a search of her person, property, or effects, as long as the individual's consent is freely and voluntarily given.  See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108800\"><a href=\"/opinion/108800/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 219, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108800\"><a href=\"/opinion/108800/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Citing this caselaw, the government asserts that Kathleen Schaefer consented to the search of her home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chronology of events is important.  After Schaefer lodged his suppression motion, the government filed a written opposition.  Attached to the opposition (and incorporated by reference therein) were two key documents:  (1) a copy of Forey's report of her investigation concerning, inter alia, the events of June 27, 1994, and (2) a copy of the affidavit that Forey submitted to the magistrate in conjunction with her request for a search warrant.  Judge McAuliffe heard arguments regarding the suppression motion on two separate dates in December of 1994, and conducted a proceeding (partially in camera) in which both Forey and CI-1 were questioned.  At the close of the second day, the judge denied the appellant's motion for a Franks hearing, see Franks v. Delaware, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 171, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span> (1978), and added from the bench that \"to the extent we've had a de facto Franks hearing I find Trooper Forey to be entirely credible and I find that she did not include any false statement or omission in her affidavit with regard to the statements made by confidential informant No. 1.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Shortly thereafter, the court handed down a written order in which it denied the appellant's motion to suppress.  See D. Ct. Op. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an individual consented to a search of her person, property, or effects.  See United States v. Matlock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108967\"><a href=\"/opinion/108967/united-states-v-matlock/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 177, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108967\"><a href=\"/opinion/108967/united-states-v-matlock/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span> (1974).  Before us, the appellant challenges the Winona Road search on the ground that the government adduced no evidence of consent.  The relevant particulars follow.  The suppression motion cited the absence of a warrant as a ground for invalidating the Winona Road search, and the government's opposition parried this thrust by asserting that Ms. Schaefer had consented to the search.  Withal, the issue was not the subject of any testimony or argumentation at the suppression hearing itself.  The only record evidence of consent is Forey's account of her conversation with Ms. Schaefer (set out in the police report).  Judge McAuliffe addressed the matter briefly in his written order.  He found, consistent with the police report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that \"Ms. Schaefer agreed to allow the troopers to return to her home and search it,\" D. Ct. Op. at 3, and concluded that \"[t]he search of the Winona Road property was conducted only after Kathleen Schaefer gave express consent to the search,\" id. at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant argues that the report was not properly before the district court at the suppression hearing, and that, in the absence of any other proof of consent, the district court's finding is plucked out of thin air.  Hence, the pivotal question is whether the district court appropriately considered the police report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We believe that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock.  Although a suppression hearing may be of decretory significance in a given case, it is generally true that \"the interests at stake in a suppression hearing are of a lesser magnitude than those in the criminal trial itself.\"  United States v. Raddatz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110315\"><a href=\"/opinion/110315/united-states-v-raddatz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 679, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110315\"><a href=\"/opinion/110315/united-states-v-raddatz/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2406</span></a></span>, 2414, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110315\"><a href=\"/opinion/110315/united-states-v-raddatz/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span> (1980).  Thus, apart from questions of privilege, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at suppression hearings.  See Matlock, 415 U.S. at 172-74, 94 S.Ct. at 993-95;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 104(a) (explaining that the court is \"not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges,\" in deciding \"[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence\") &amp; 1101(d)(1) (declaring the Evidence Rules inapplicable to \"[t]he determination of questions of fact preliminary to admissibility of evidence when the issue is to be determined by the court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, a judge presiding at a suppression hearing may receive and consider any relevant evidence, including affidavits and unsworn documents that bear indicia of reliability.  See United States v. Lee, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339084\"><a href=\"/opinion/339084/united-states-v-dennis-wade-lee-and-edward-john-matchus/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1145</span></a></span>, 1146 (5th Cir.1976).  Consistent with this praxis, a judge may receive hearsay evidence at a suppression hearing.  See, e.g., Raddatz, 447 U.S. at 679, 100 S.Ct. at 2414;  United States v. Merritt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411943\"><a href=\"/opinion/411943/united-states-v-david-allen-merritt/\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span>, 1269 (10th Cir.1982);  United States v. Ocampo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391014\"><a href=\"/opinion/391014/united-states-v-daniel-ocampo-theodoro-hernandez-jose-otero-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 427 (2d Cir.1981);  United States v. Bolin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326933\"><a href=\"/opinion/326933/united-states-v-robert-c-bolin-aka-bob-bolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 557 (7th Cir.1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the suppression hearing itself concentrated on only a few of the many issues raised by the appellant's motion.  It did not focus at all on the Winona Road search, and it is apparent to even a casual observer that the district court--with the parties' tacit acquiescence--intended to decide that aspect of the motion on the papers.  In implementing this intention, the court obviously accepted and relied upon the government's proffer of the police report.  In the absence of a motion to strike--and the appellant made none--the court was entitled to do so.  Put another way, the government effected a prima facie showing of consent by placing a copy of the police report before the court, see United States v. Barnes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1953268\"><a href=\"/opinion/1953268/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 139 (S.D.N.Y.1977);  and since the appellant (who cross-examined Forey but shied away from questioning her about the Winona Road search) adduced no evidence that impeached or contradicted the trooper's account of the manner in which she obtained Ms. Schaefer's consent, the court could properly base a finding on that account.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  See, e.g., Zapata, 18 F.3d at 977 (affirming the trial court's inference of consent in the absence of contrary factual evidence);  cf.  United States v. McKneely, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654640\"><a href=\"/opinion/654640/united-states-v-dracy-lamont-mckneely-andrew-ellis-and-alandis-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></a></span>, 1453 (10th Cir.1993) (rejecting as clearly erroneous a finding of coerced consent under circumstances in which the government's evidence of the defendant's voluntary consent was \"uncontroverted by facts because defendants offered no testimony to the contrary\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Because the lower court appropriately refused to suppress the inculpatory evidence that the government's lawful searches had amassed, the judgment below must be</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Kathleen Schaefer did not contest the charges against her.

United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span> (1996), reinforces this dichotomous standard of review.  In Ornelas the Court held, in the case of a warrantless search pursuant to the so-called \"automobile exception\" to the warrant requirement, that \"the ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause ... should be reviewed de novo.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1659.   By contrast, \"a reviewing court should take care both to review findings of historical fact only for clear error and to give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1663.   The Ornelas Court's holding is fully consistent with this circuit's precedent as expressed in cases like Zapata</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Here, moreover, Forey convincingly explained her failure to elaborate upon her comments.  She stated that \"[t]his affiant is personally familiar with the case in which CI-1 provided information and further detail or description of the case would likely disclose the identity of the CI.\"  The district court found Forey to be credible on this and other points, and the appellant has advanced no sound basis for rejecting this credibility determination</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Forey's affidavit also contains an account of an incident that occurred in June 1993 when a fellow state trooper, Scott Champagne, discovered marijuana plants under cultivation in the woods, in close proximity to the appellant's camper</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> CI-2's statements confirmed CI-1's assurance that Birmingham served as Crawford's lieutenant</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Though one thrust of Schaefer's argument below focused on what he termed \"material misrepresentations\" in Forey's affidavit, he does not renew that claim on appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The police report comprised Forey's report on the investigation into the appellant's marijuana growing activities.  The report recounted extended negotiations with Ms. Schaefer anent the proposed search, culminating in Ms. Schaefer's informed consent to it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Because the appellant does not argue that Forey's account, if properly considered by the district court, was insufficient to show the requisite consent, he has for all intents and purposes conceded that point.  See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.)

But if the appellant labored under that mistaken assumption at all, his reverie surely did not survive his receipt of the district court's rescript.  That was the time for appellant to claim surprise and, concomitantly, to move either to reopen the proceedings or for reconsideration.  The failure to file any such motion below undercuts the claim of surprise that he mounts in this venue.  Cf. United States v.
