This is an appeal by the\r\nGovernment from a sentence imposed following a guilty plea pursuant\r\nto a plea agreement tendered under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(C). \r\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291 and 18 U.S.C.\r\n3742(b), (c) and review de novo.  United States v. Ticchiarelli,\r\n171 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 1999).  We reverse and remand.\r\nDefendant Edwin Moure Ortiz (\"Moure\") was indicted by a\r\ngrand jury on February 28, 1996, and charged with conspiracy to\r\ndistribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine (Count One);\r\naiding and abetting in the possession with intent to distribute two\r\nkilograms of cocaine (Count Two); carrying a firearm during and in\r\nrelation to a drug trafficking crime (Count Three); and using a\r\ncommunication facility to commit and facilitate the crime of\r\ndistribution of narcotics (Count Four).\r\nOn March 4, 1997, Moure  pled guilty to counts Two and\r\nThree, conditioned upon Moure's right to appeal the district\r\ncourt's denial of his motion to dismiss the firearms count. \r\nSentence was scheduled for July 11, 1997.\r\nPrior to sentencing, Moure filed a motion for downward\r\ndeparture pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines\r\n(\"Guidelines\")  5H1.4 due to his \"extraordinary physical\r\nimpairment.\"  He also requested that Dr. Wilfredo Daz Romero, the\r\nmedical director of MDC Guaynabo, be permitted to testify regarding\r\nhis medical condition.\r\nThe Court held a hearing on July 10, 1997 at which\r\nDr. Daz Romero testified that Moure suffered from polycythemia\r\nvera, a condition which constituted an \"extraordinary physical\r\nimpairment\" rendering Moure seriously infirm.  The Court took\r\nMoure's request for downward departure under advisement and\r\nsentencing was rescheduled for July 29, 1997.\r\nOn July 29, 1997, the Court granted a motion by Moure to\r\nwithdraw his guilty plea.  Subsequently, the United States and\r\nMoure negotiated an 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement pursuant to which\r\nMoure would plead guilty to Count Two and the remaining counts\r\nwould be dismissed.  This second plea agreement called for a\r\nspecific sentence of 84 months of imprisonment based on an adjusted\r\noffense level of 28.\r\nOn August 22, 1997, the Court held a change of plea\r\nhearing, during which Moure entered a plea of guilty to Count Two\r\nof the indictment.  After advising the defendant of his rights, the\r\nCourt stated as follows:\r\n  Very well, the plea agreement is hereby\r\norder[ed] filed.  The Court does hereby accept\r\nthe plea agreement and will sentence the\r\ndefendant in accordance with the plea\r\nagreement after receiving the pre-sentence\r\nreport.\r\nAfter the defendant had accepted the Government's version\r\nof the facts, the district court also advised the defendant as\r\nfollows:\r\n  Even though the Court has accepted the plea\r\nagreement, I want you to be aware that the\r\nguideline sentence in the pre-sentence report\r\nmay be different from the one that has been\r\ncontemplated in these negotiations as a result\r\nof the findings of the pre-sentence report. \r\nBut the Court in this hearing has accepted the\r\nplea agreement and will sentence you according\r\nto the plea agreement. (emphasis ours).\r\n\nHaving thus declared its intentions for the record, the \r\nparties were nonplussed when the Court announced at the sentencing\r\nhearing held on October 10, 1997, that it would, sua sponte, depart\r\ndownward from the agreed-to specific sentence of 84 months due to\r\nMoure's extraordinary physical impairment.\r\nDespite the Government's objections to the Court's\r\nunanticipated downward departure, and its explanation that Moure's\r\nphysical condition had been taken into account during the\r\nrenegotiations that followed defendant's withdrawal of his original\r\nguilty plea, and despite the Court's acknowledgment that \"[t]he\r\nusual case... is that the Court either accepts the plea agreement\r\nor gives the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.\", the\r\nCourt, finding that extraordinary circumstances and the interests\r\nof justice so warranted, proceeded to depart downward from the\r\nexpected 84 month sentence to the Guidelines level identified in\r\nthe Presentence Report, and sentenced defendant to 63 months.\r\n                         DISCUSSION \r\nA contractual approach to disputes over plea agreements \r\n\"ensures not only that constitutional rights are respected, but\r\nalso that the integrity of the criminal process is upheld.\"  United\r\nStates v. Papaleo, 853 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\nA principal purpose of an 11(e)(1)(C) agreement is to\r\npermit the Government and the defendant to come to an agreement as\r\nto a specific sentence.\r\nThus, Rule 11(e) Fed. R. Crim. P. provides in pertinent\r\npart as follows:\r\n(E) Plea Agreement Procedure\r\n   (1) In General.  The attorney for the government and\r\nthe attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting pro se\r\nmay engage in discussions with a view toward reaching an agreement\r\nthat, upon the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to\r\na charged offense or to a lesser or related offense, the attorney\r\nfor the government will do any of the following:\r\n  (A) move for dismissal of other charges; or\r\n  (B) make a recommendation, or agree not to oppose\r\nthe defendant's request, for a particular sentence, with the\r\nunderstanding that such recommendation or request shall not be\r\nbinding upon the court; or\r\n  (C) agree that a specific sentence is the\r\nappropriate disposition of the case.\r\n\nOnce the court accepts an 11(e)(1)(C) agreement, an\r\nexpectation is created in the parties that the court--if it\r\nproceeds to impose sentence--will indeed sentence defendant in\r\nconformity with the dispositions of the contract.\r\nAfter the district court provisionally accepted the\r\nagreement, its only recourse was to reject the agreement if it\r\nfound the negotiated sentence unsatisfactory.  \"If the Court did\r\nnot find the terms [of the agreement] appropriate, its only option\r\nwas to reject the agreement in its entirety.\"  United States v.\r\nMukai, 26 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir. 1994).  See also United States v.\r\nGilchrist, 130 F.3d 1131, 1134 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"An 11(e)(1)(C) plea\r\nagreement, once accepted, binds the district court notwithstanding\r\ndepartures from the applicable guidelines\"); United States v. Veri,\r\n108 F.3d 1311, 1315 (10th Cir. 1997) (\"[I]f a sentencing court\r\naccepts a Rule 11(e)(1)(C) agreement, it is bound by the agreement\r\nand may not modify it\".).\r\nIn defense of his sentence, Moure argues that Rule 11(e)\r\ndoes not prohibit the Court from unilaterally imposing a more\r\nlenient sentence than that specified in a Rule 11(e)(1)(C)\r\nagreement.  We disagree.\r\nThe rule plainly contemplates that plea agreements\r\nexecuted pursuant to subdivisions (e)(1)(A) or (C) are binding on\r\nthe district court.  \"[C]ritical to a type (A) or (C) agreement is\r\nthat the defendant receive the contemplated charge dismissal or\r\nagreed-to sentence.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. advisory committee's note\r\n(1979 amendment).\r\nMoreover, the rule does not authorize a district court to\r\naccept the agreement at a plea hearing, advise  the defendant that\r\nhe or she will be sentenced in accordance with its terms on the one\r\nhand, and on the other disregard its own pronouncements and modify\r\nthe agreement in accordance with a personal notion of what\r\nconstitutes a just sentence.\r\nThis interpretation is firmly supported by Rule 11(e)'s\r\nhistory:\r\n  The legislative history of 11(e)(3) shows that\r\nCongress wished to preclude a district court\r\nfrom accepting a plea agreement which provides\r\nfor a specific sentence and then imposing a\r\nmore lenient sentence than that provided for\r\nin the plea agreement.  The version of\r\n11(e)(3) proposed by the Supreme Court in 1974\r\nstated that \"the court shall inform the\r\ndefendant that it will embody in the ...\r\nsentence the disposition provided for in the\r\nplea agreement or another disposition more\r\nfavorable to the defendant than that provided\r\nfor in the plea agreement.\"  The House\r\nJudiciary Committee then deleted the language\r\n\"or another disposition more favorable to the\r\ndefendant than that provided for in the plea\r\nagreement,\" and the House affirmed the\r\ncommittee's action by rejecting on the floor\r\nan amendment offered to restore the Supreme\r\nCourt's version of the rule.  The Senate\r\naccepted the House's version of the rule.\r\n\n  By deleting the Supreme Court's \"more\r\nfavorable to the defendant\" language, Congress\r\nevidenced its intent to require a district\r\ncourt to sentence a defendant in accordance\r\nwith the plea agreement.\r\n\nUnited States v. Semler, 883 F.2d 832, 833-34 (9th Cir.\r\n1989)(internal citations omitted).\r\nFinally, we reject Moure's contention that while Rule\r\n11(e) provides that the defendant may withdraw his plea if a higher\r\nsentence is contemplated, it does not provide for the Government to\r\nwithdraw from the agreement if a lower sentence is envisioned by\r\nthe district court. \"A district court which unilaterally reduces\r\nthe sentence provided for in an accepted plea agreement deprives\r\nthe prosecutor of the 'benefit of his bargain'. . .\".  Semler, 883\r\nF.2d at 834, an action which he or she is specifically authorized\r\nto appeal pursuant to statute.  See 18 U.S.C. 3742(c)(2).\r\nAccordingly, we remand the case to the district court\r\nwith instructions to vacate the sentence previously imposed, vacate\r\nthe dismissal of the other counts, and then either sentence the\r\ndefendant according to the terms of the plea agreement or reject\r\nthe agreement and afford the Government and Moure an opportunity to\r\nrenegotiate its terms (or in the alternative, try the case).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\n",

We           reverse and remand.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Edwin Moure Ortiz (\"Moure\") was indicted by a grand jury on February 28, 1996, and charged           with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine (Count One); aiding and abetting in the           possession with intent to distribute two kilograms of cocaine (Count Two); carrying a firearm during and in           relation to a drug trafficking crime (Count Three); and using a communication facility to commit and facilitate the           crime of distribution of narcotics (Count Four).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1997, Moure pled guilty to counts Two and Three, conditioned upon Moure's right to appeal the           district court's denial of his motion to dismiss the firearms count. Sentence was scheduled for July 11, 1997.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to sentencing, Moure filed a motion for downward departure pursuant to United States Sentencing           Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") &#167; 5H1.4 due to his \"extraordinary physical impairment.\" He also requested that Dr.           Wilfredo Daz Romero, the medical director of MDC Guaynabo, be permitted to testify regarding his medical           condition.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court held a hearing on July 10, 1997 at which Dr. Daz Romero testified that Moure suffered from           polycythemia vera,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  a condition which constituted an \"extraordinary physical impairment\" rendering Moure           seriously infirm. The Court took Moure's request for downward departure under advisement and sentencing was           rescheduled for July 29, 1997.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 29, 1997, the Court granted a motion by Moure to withdraw his guilty plea. Subsequently, the United           States and Moure negotiated an 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreement pursuant to which Moure would plead guilty to           Count Two and the remaining counts would be dismissed. This second plea agreement called for a specific           sentence of 84 months of imprisonment based on an adjusted offense level of 28.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 22, 1997, the Court held a change of plea hearing, during which Moure entered a plea of guilty to           Count Two of the indictment. After advising the defendant of his rights, the Court stated as follows:   \"Very well, the plea agreement is hereby order[ed] filed. The Court does hereby accept the plea agreement and           will sentence the defendant in accordance with the plea agreement after receiving the pre-sentence report.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the defendant had accepted the Government's version of the facts, the district court also advised the           defendant as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Even though the Court has accepted the plea agreement, I want you to be aware that the guideline sentence in           the pre-sentence report may be different from the one that has been contemplated in these negotiations as a result           of the findings of the pre-sentence report. But the Court in this hearing has accepted the plea agreement and will           sentence you according to the plea agreement. (emphasis ours).\"Having thus declared its intentions for the record, the parties<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  were nonplussed when the Court announced at           the sentencing hearing held on October 10, 1997, that it would, sua sponte, depart downward from the           agreed-to specific sentence of 84 months due to Moure's extraordinary physical impairment.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Government's objections to the Court's unanticipated downward departure, and its explanation that           Moure's physical condition had been taken into account during the renegotiations that followed defendant's           withdrawal of his original guilty plea, and despite the Court's acknowledgment that \"[t]he usual case... is that the           Court either accepts the plea agreement or gives the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.\", the Court,           finding that extraordinary circumstances and the interests of Justice so warranted, proceeded to depart           downward from the expected 84 month sentence to the Guidelines level identified in the Presentence Report,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  and sentenced defendant to 63 months.</p>\n      <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A contractual approach to disputes over plea agreements \"ensures not only that constitutional rights are           respected, but also that the integrity of the criminal process is upheld.\" United States v.

R. Crim. P. provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(E) Plea Agreement Procedure\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(1) In General. The attorney for the government and the attorney for the defendant or the defendant when acting           pro se may engage in Discussions with a view toward reaching an agreement that, upon the entering of a plea of           guilty or nolo contendere to a charged offense or to a lesser or related offense, the attorney for the government           will do any of the following:\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(A) move for dismissal of other charges; or\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(B) make a recommendation, or agree not to oppose the defendant's request, for a particular sentence, with the           understanding that such recommendation or request shall not be binding upon the court; or\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(C) agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate Disposition of the case.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the court accepts an 11(e)(1)(C) agreement, an expectation is created in the parties that the court--if it           proceeds to impose sentence--will indeed sentence defendant in conformity with the Dispositions of the contract.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court provisionally accepted the agreement, its only recourse was to reject the agreement if it           found the negotiated sentence unsatisfactory. \"If the Court did not find the terms [of the agreement] appropriate,           its only option was to reject the agreement in its entirety.\" United States v.

We disagree.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule plainly contemplates that plea agreements executed pursuant to subdivisions (e)(1)(A) or (C) are binding           on the district court. \"[C]ritical to a type (A) or (C) agreement is that the defendant receive the contemplated           charge dismissal or agreed-to sentence.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. advisory committee's note (1979 amendment).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the rule does not authorize a district court to accept the agreement at a plea hearing, advise the           defendant that he or she will be sentenced in accordance with its terms on the one hand, and on the other           disregard its own pronouncements and modify the agreement in accordance with a personal notion of what           constitutes a just sentence.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation is firmly supported by Rule 11(e)'s history:</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The legislative history of 11(e)(3) shows that Congress wished to preclude a district court from accepting a plea           agreement which provides for a specific sentence and then imposing a more lenient sentence than that provided           for in the plea agreement. The version of 11(e)(3) proposed by the Supreme Court in 1974 stated that \"the court           shall inform the defendant that it will embody in the ... sentence the Disposition provided for in the plea agreement           or another Disposition more favorable to the defendant than that provided for in the plea agreement.\" The House           Judiciary Committee then deleted the language \"or another Disposition more favorable to the defendant than that           provided for in the plea agreement,\" and the House affirmed the committee's action by rejecting on the floor an           amendment offered to restore the Supreme Court's version of the rule. The Senate accepted the House's version           of the rule.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"By deleting the Supreme Court's 'more favorable to the defendant' language, Congress evidenced its intent to           require a district court to sentence a defendant in accordance with the plea agreement.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.
