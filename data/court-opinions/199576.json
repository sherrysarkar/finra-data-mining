Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Howard M. Cooper, David H. Rich and Todd & Weld LLP on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Jennifer Hay\nZacks, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition.\n\n\n\n\n                         July 10, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam. Michael A. Casciano appeals from the\n\ndistrict court’s order revoking his supervised release and\n\nimposing a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment, followed by\n\ntwo years’ supervised release.       Casciano contends on appeal\n\nthat the district court clearly erred in determining that\n\nthe witnesses who testified against him at his revocation\n\nhearing   were   credible   when   they   stated   that   Casciano\n\nthreatened them.     The government has filed a Motion for\n\nSummary Disposition, pursuant to Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n          This court reviews the district court’s decision\n\nto revoke supervised release for abuse of discretion, while\n\nthe underlying finding that Casciano violated a term of\n\nsupervised release is reviewed for clear error.           See e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Whalen, 82 F.3d 528, 532 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nThe government has the burden of proving by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence that at least one of the conditions of the\n\ndefendant's supervised release was violated. United States\n\nv. Portalla, 985 F.2d 621, 622 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          \"Credibility determinations by the trier of fact\n\nare accorded special deference,\" United States v. Bouthot,\n\n878 F.2d 1506, 1514 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1989), particularly\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fbecause only the trial court can judge a witness's demeanor\n\nor tone of voice, see United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005,\n\n1009 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470\n\nU.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).\n\nWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\n\nfactfinder’s     choice     between      them    cannot         be   clearly\n\nerroneous.     United States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342,\n\n347 (1st Cir. 1997).      Moreover, on appeal of a revocation of\n\nsupervised release, we consider the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the government.          See Portalla, 985 F.2d at\n\n622.\n\n          Upon a careful review of the record, we cannot hold\n\nclearly erroneous the district court’s decision to credit\n\nWatson’s and Riopelle’s testimony that Casciano threatened\n\nthem.    The inconsistencies complained of by Casciano on\n\nappeal   are   merely     variations     in    degree      of   detail   the\n\nwitnesses gave to the various police officers who questioned\n\nthem.    Both witnesses testified that they gave explicit\n\ndetail   about   the    incident    when      asked   to    elaborate     by\n\nauthorities.     Both witnesses consistently reported that\n\nCasciano had threatened them using obscenities.\n\n          Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\n\ndid not clearly err in finding that Casciano had made a\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fcriminal threat, resulting in a violation of a condition of\n\nsupervised release, and did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndeciding to revoke supervised release.\n\n           The Government’s Motion for Summary Disposition is\n\ngranted.   Casciano’s sentence is affirmed.     See Loc. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                             -4-\n\f",
