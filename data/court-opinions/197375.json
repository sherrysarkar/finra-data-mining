We conclude,\r\n\nnotwithstanding plaintiffs failure to prevail on specifically\r\n\nfederal grounds, that they are nonetheless prevailing parties\r\n\nunder   1988, and entitled to fees.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          The  disputed fees  claim arises  in the  following\r\n\ncircumstances.    The  plaintiffs-appellants  were  receiving\r\n\nfederal  housing  subsidies under  Section  8  of the  United\r\n\nStates Housing Act of 1937,  as amended.3  In April of  1993,\r\n\nthey brought an  action under  42 U.S.C.    1983 against  the\r\n\nArlington   and   Danvers,   Massachusetts,  Public   Housing\r\n\nAuthorities  (the \"Authorities\"),  as  well  as  against  the\r\n\nHanover,  Massachusetts  Public  Housing  Authority  and  the\r\n\nSecretary of the Department  of Housing and Urban Development\r\n\n(\"HUD\").4      Plaintiffs-appellants    alleged   that    the\r\n\nAuthorities,   with  HUD's   approval,  were   illegally  and\r\n\nunconstitutionally preventing them from using their Section 8\r\n\nsubsidies for housing outside  the geographical limits of the\r\n\ncity or town within  which the Authority issuing  the subsidy\r\n\nwas  located.    The Authorities  are  quasi-public  entities\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

Section 8 allowed\r\n\ntenants wider geographical choice than  did earlier programs,\r\n\nincreasing opportunities to obtain dwellings in areas of less\r\n\nconcentrated  poverty.   42 U.S.C.    1437f(r)  (West 1994).5\r\n\nSee  also Cranston-Gonzalez National  Affordable Housing Act,\r                     \r\n\nPub.

See  24\r                                                                     \r\n\nC.F.R.   882.103(a) (1995).\r\n\n          In 1977, HUD was  presented with conflicting  legal\r\n\nopinions  from  two  different Massachusetts  public  housing\r\n\nauthorities as  to whether  they could legally  contract with\r\n\nprivate landlords outside  their municipal boundaries.6   HUD\r\n\nasked  the Massachusetts Executive  Office of Communities and\r\n\nDevelopment (\"EOCD\"), the state agency that supervises  local\r\n\npublic  housing authorities, to seek a legal opinion from the\r\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General.   Instead, the EOCD  provided\r\n\nits own legal opinion, which was that a Massachusetts  public\r\n\nhousing authority  could not contract with  private landlords\r                                        \r\n\noutside its municipal  boundaries, except  by agreement  with\r\n\nanother  local  public  housing   authority.    HUD  and  the\r\n\nAuthorities accepted and followed  the EOCD's opinion on this\r\n\nmatter.   The extent of a local authority's \"jurisdiction\" to\r\n\nprovide subsidized housing took on added significance in 1992\r\n\nwhen  Congress amended the portability rules of the Section 8\r\n\nhousing programs.   Plaintiffs say that  the amendment forced\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The Cambridge Housing  Authority, like the plaintiffs  in\r\nthis  case, took  the position  that state  law does  not bar\r\nlocal public housing authorities from contracting anywhere in\r\nthe  Commonwealth,  while  the Arlington  Housing  Authority,\r\nsimilar to  the defendants  in this litigation,  took a  much\r\nnarrower view of Section 8 \"jurisdiction.\"\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthem and others  like them  to seek rental  units within  the\r\n\njurisdiction of  a single authority.7   Unless that authority\r\n\ncould provide  housing beyond its  municipal limits,  tenants\r\n\nlike plaintiffs  were curtailed in their  mobility and choice\r\n\nof housing.   Faced with  this situation, plaintiffs  sued in\r\n\nthe district court under    1983 in April of 1993,  seeking a\r\n\njudicial determination of  their right to use their Section 8\r\n\nhousing subsidies in  any community within the  Commonwealth.\r\n\nTo  expedite a  decision, the  parties agreed that  the facts\r\n\nwould be submitted as  a case stated.  See  Continental Grain\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo. v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth., 927 F.2d 426, 429\r                                                      \r\n\nn.7 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n          In contending that it was unlawful for HUD and  the\r\n\nAuthorities to restrict their  Section 8 housing subsidies to\r\n\nthe  city or town in which the issuing Authority was located,\r\n\nthe   tenants  alleged  that  the  geographical  restrictions\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Section 147 of the  Housing and Community Development Act\r\nof  1992 amended  the portability provisions  of 42  U.S.C.  \r\n1437f by providing that:\r\n          \"any   family   not  living   within  the\r\n          jurisdiction of a  public housing  agency\r\n          at the  time that such family applies for\r\n          assistance from such agency shall, during\r\n          the  12-month  period beginning  upon the\r\n          receipt   of   any  tenant-based   rental\r\n          assistance  made  available on  behalf of\r\n          the family, use  such assistance to  rent\r\n          an eligible dwelling unit  located within\r\n          the  jurisdiction  served by  such public\r\n          housing agency.\"   Housing and  Community\r\n          Development  Act      147,  42  U.S.C.   \r\n          1437f(r)(1) (West 1994).\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nviolated   42   U.S.C.      1437f(r)(1),  the   relevant  HUD\r\n\nregulations,  Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and\r\n\n42  U.S.C.   1983.   They also alleged  that the restrictions\r\n\ninterfered  with their  constitutional right to  travel under\r\n\nthe  Fifth and  Fourteenth  Amendments to  the United  States\r\n\nConstitution.\r\n\n          Fearing the  loss of  their Section 8  subsidies if\r\n\nthey could not immediately  find housing within the municipal\r\n\nboundaries of  the  Authority that  issued  their  respective\r\n\nSection   8  certificates,   the   plaintiffs  moved   for  a\r\n\npreliminary  injunction  that   would  toll  or   freeze  the\r\n\nsubsidies' expiration dates.  The need for preliminary relief\r\n\nceased, however, when defendants  agreed not to terminate the\r\n\nplaintiffs' subsidies while the case was pending.\r\n\n          After reviewing submissions and  hearing arguments,\r\n\nthe district  court issued  an oral  opinion on September  9,\r\n\n1993,  followed by a  written decision on  December 12, 1994.\r\n\nSee Williams, 871  F. Supp.  at 527-35.   The district  court\r                        \r\n\nstated in both that, in its view, Massachusetts law permitted\r\n\nstate public  housing authorities to contract  with landlords\r\n\nowning dwellings outside their municipal boundaries.\r\n\n          Less than  a month after the  district court's oral\r\n\nopinion, HUD  issued a directive to  the Massachusetts public\r\n\nhousing authorities informing them that all Section 8 tenants\r\n\ncould henceforth use their  housing subsidies anywhere in the\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nCommonwealth.   HUD,  as the  district court  later declared,\r\n\nWilliams,  926 F. Supp.  at 12, treated  the district court's\r                    \r\n\nruling  as   an  authoritative  declaration   of  state  law,\r\n\nsuperseding  the   contrary  opinion   of  the  EOCD.     The\r\n\nAuthorities also went along.\r\n\n          While the  district court rendered its  own opinion\r\n\nas to an authority's jurisdiction, it also certified the same\r\n\nquestion  to  the  Massachusetts  Supreme   Judicial  Court.8\r\n\nBefore  that court  reached  the matter,  the district  court\r\n\nwithdrew  its  certification,  in  part  because  of  certain\r\n\nchanges in HUD's regulations.  At a November 30, 1995 hearing\r\n\nin  the district court to  determine the status  of the case,\r\n\nHUD  assured the district court that, in spite of its changed\r\n\nregulations,9 it would continue to instruct all Massachusetts\r\n\npublic  housing authorities to abide by  the court's oral and\r\n\nwritten decisions  issued in  plaintiffs'    1983 case.   The\r\n\ndistrict court thereupon dismissed the   1983  action as moot\r\n\nand   plaintiffs   petitioned,   unsuccessfully,  for   their\r\n\nattorneys' fees.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  The district court certified the following question:\r\n          \"Is   a   Massachusetts  Public   Housing\r\n          Authority legally barred from contracting\r\n          with landlords outside the  boundaries of\r\n          the organizing city or town?\"\r\n\n9.

In that action, the court continued,\r\n\nplaintiffs claimed  to have been deprived  of \"rights secured\r\n\nby  federal  statutes,  regulations  and  the  United  States\r\n\nConstitution.\"  Williams, 926 F. Supp. at 13.  In the court's\r                                    \r\n\nview, plaintiffs  never became  entitled to fees  because the\r\n\ncourt never found that they \"had a right under federal law to\r\n\nhave  the Authorities  contract  outside of  their  political\r\n\nboundaries for Section 8 housing.\"  Id.

As plaintiffs did not vindicate  a federal\r                            \r\n\nright, the  district court believed  that   1988  provided no\r\n\nright to fees.\r\n\n          The  court also  stated, as  a separate  ground for\r\n\ndecision, that it would refrain from awarding attorneys' fees\r\n\nas a matter of discretion, even  assuming plaintiffs could be\r\n\nsaid to have prevailed on a federal right.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n          In reviewing the  district court's denial of  fees,\r\n\nwe  turn first to its ruling that, because plaintiffs did not\r\n\nprevail  on any of their federal claims, they are barred from\r\n\nreceiving  attorneys'  fees under     1988.   We  review this\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nruling  de novo as it presents essentially a question of law,\r                           \r\n\nnot the individualized considerations  which lead us to apply\r\n\na deferential  review standard.   See  Domegan v.  Ponte, 972\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 401, 406 n.8 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n          We  think   the   district  court's   analysis   is\r\n\nunsupported  by Supreme Court precedent and  that of this and\r\n\nother circuits.  The clear tendency of the courts has been to\r\n\napply  the  fees  statute  in  a  more   practical  and  less\r\n\nrestrictive way.\r\n\n          Section  1988 itself nowhere states that attorneys'\r\n\nfees  can be awarded only  to those who  prevail on expressly\r\n\nfederal grounds.  To be sure, the statute specifies that fees\r\n\nare to be  awarded only  \"in\" any of  the enumerated  federal\r\n\ncauses of action, including   1983.  Note 2, supra.  And fees\r                                                              \r\n\ncan  be  allowed  only  to  a  prevailing  party.    But  the\r\n\nattorneys'  fees being requested here  are for services in an\r\n\naction  to  enforce a  provision of     1983 and  (as further\r\n\ndiscussed below) plaintiffs  have, in every  practical sense,\r\n\nprevailed    having, as  a result of their  lawsuit, achieved\r\n\nprecisely the end-relief they wanted, namely the right to use\r\n\ntheir  Section  8  housing subsidies  outside  the  political\r\n\nboundaries of the Authority providing the subsidy.\r\n\n          To uphold the district court's rationale,  we would\r\n\nhave to read into   1988 an implied further requirement that,\r\n\nto be  a prevailing party, it  is necessary not only  to have\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nsecured a significant objective of one's federal lawsuit, but\r\n\nto  have  done so  by obtaining  a  favorable ruling  on some\r\n\nfederal legal  or constitutional claim advanced  in the suit.\r\n\nA theory akin  to this  was rejected seventeen  years ago  in\r\n\nMaherv. Gagne, 448 U.S. 122 (1980), the Supreme Court saying,\r                         \r\n\n          \"The   fact  that   respondent  prevailed\r\n          through  settlement  rather than  through\r\n          litigation does not  weaken her claim  to\r\n          fees.  Nothing in  the language of   1988\r\n          conditions the District Court's  power to\r\n          award  fees on  full  litigation  of  the\r\n          issues  or  on  a judicial  determination\r\n          that  the  plaintiffs'  rights have  been\r\n          violated.    Moreover, the  Senate Report\r\n          expressly  stated  that 'for  purposes of\r\n          the award of counsel fees, parties may be\r\n          considered  to  have prevailed  when they\r\n          vindicate   rights   through  a   consent\r\n          judgment  or   without  obtaining  relief\r\n          . . . .\"\r\n\nMaher, 448 U.S. at 129 (citation omitted).\r                 \r\n\n          Maher, it is true, did not deal with  precisely the\r                           \r\n\npresent situation,  where  the winning  party  has  prevailed\r\n\nthrough the  federal court's favorable  interpretation of  an\r\n\nissue of state law.  But decisions in this and other circuits\r\n\nhave dealt with outcomes  like the present.   These decisions\r\n\nindicate that  it  is immaterial  for    1988  purposes  that\r\n\nplaintiffs'  success in  the    1983  action  results from  a\r\n\nfavorable ruling on a relevant issue of state law, so long as\r\n\nthe state law issue and the federal claims being  made in the\r\n\n  1983 proceeding are closely interrelated. \r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\n          Judge (now Justice)  Breyer writing for this  court\r\n\nin  Aubin  v.

Pontarelli, 788  F.2d 47 (1st Cir. 1986).   We said\r                                \r\n\nthere  that  attorneys' fees  were  recoverable in  a    1983\r\n\naction  where  plaintiffs  prevailed  on a  state  law  issue\r\n\narising  from the same nucleus of common facts as the federal\r\n\nclaims,  provided  the  latter  were  substantial  enough  to\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\nsupport  federal jurisdiction.  Id.  at 51-53.   There, the  \r                                               \r\n\n1983 action    alleging that a state education commissioner's\r\n\ninterpretation and  application of  a state law  violated the\r\n\nfederal  constitution     became moot  when the  Rhode Island\r\n\nSupreme Court, on certification from the federal court, ruled\r\n\nthat  the   commissioner  had   interpreted  the   state  law\r\n\nincorrectly.  As here,  the favorable interpretation of state\r\n\nlaw  came  as a  consequence of  the    1983  litigation, the\r\n\nfederal court,  as part of that  proceeding, having certified\r\n\nthe  determinative state  law  question to  the state  court,\r\n\nwhich  overturned the commissioner's interpretation.  Also as\r\n\nhere,  the federal claims in  the lawsuit were  mooted by the\r\n\nstate law ruling and were never decided.  \r\n\n          In the  present case, as in  Exeter-West Greenwich,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe  unfavorable  interpretation   of  state  law  that   led\r\n\nplaintiffs to bring the    1983 action was also  certified to\r\n\nthe  highest state  court.   However,  the certification  was\r\n\nwithdrawn   and  federal  and  state  authorities  agreed  to\r\n\ncontinue to  abide by the district  judge's own determination\r\n\nof  state law    a determination that had reversed the EOCD's\r\n\nconstruction  challenged in  the    1983 lawsuit.   Following\r\n\nExeter-West Greenwich, therefore, we see  no legal impediment\r                                 \r\n\nto  allowing plaintiffs  their attorneys'  fees under    1988\r\n\neven though their  victory rests  on a state,  not a  federal\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nground.

Here, as in Exeter-West Greenwich,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe federal statutory and constitutional claims made in the  \r\n\n1983  action were  directed  at  overthrowing an  unfavorable\r\n\nstate law ruling.  Whether that ruling was itself correct was\r\n\na  legitimate question for consideration  in the   1983 suit:\r\n\nif,   as   the   district   court   determined,   the  EOCD's\r\n\ninterpretation was  incorrect, there  was no need  to resolve\r\n\nthe federal constitutional claim raised by plaintiffs, a fact\r\n\nnoted   by  the  district  judge  himself  as  a  reason  for\r\n\ncertification.    Williams,  926  F.   Supp.  at  12.10    By\r                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  In the 1994 opinion, the district court stated:\r\n          \"In view of  this Court's  interpretation of  state\r\nlaw,           there  is   no   occasion  to   consider   the\r\nconstitutional           question whether  the 1992 amendment\r\nto 42 U.S.C.             1437f(r) infringes upon the right to\r\ntravel.  A court         should address constitutional issues\r\nonly when a case         cannot be resolved on other grounds.\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\naddressing the  state law  question first, the  federal court\r\n\nfollowed the principle that  a case should not be  decided on\r\n\nconstitutional grounds  if other grounds are  available.  The\r\n\ncertification process  enabled the  federal court to  seek an\r\n\nauthoritative interpretation  of state  law from the  state's\r\n\nhighest court;  but this  proved unnecessary as  the district\r\n\ncourt's own announced view of the state law persuaded HUD and\r\n\nthe  Authorities  to abandon,  without  more,  their previous\r\n\nconstruction, and  to embrace the one plaintiffs wanted.  The\r\n\nstate  law question on which the court ruled was thus closely\r\n\nentwined with  the federal claims, the  court's addressing of\r\n\nit  being an  appropriate  judicial action  taken within  the\r\n\ncontext of the    1983 proceeding itself.  Being  integral to\r\n\nthe latter and to the federal claims therein, it furnished an\r\n\nunexceptionable   basis   for   finding  plaintiffs   to   be\r\n\n\"prevailing  parties\" entitled  to fees  under    1988.   We,\r\n\ntherefore,   reject  the  district   court's  reasoning  that\r\n\nplaintiffs are not entitled  to attorneys' fees because their\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nBurton v.

This  Court will\r\nconfront the        constitutional  question if  the decision\r\nof the         Supreme Judicial Court on the issues presented\r\nmakes          such confrontation necessary and appropriate.\"\r\n    Williams, 871 F. Supp. at 535.\r                        \r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\nsuccess  did   not  derive   from  the  vindication   of  any\r\n\nspecifically federal right.11\r\n\n          We add that it is well-settled in this circuit that\r\n\na   1983 plaintiff  seeking attorneys' fees under    1988 may\r\n\nestablish  \"prevailing party\"  status under  a  \"catalyst\" as\r\n\nwell as a \"merits\"  analysis.  See, e.g., Paris, 988  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n241.   Plaintiffs argue that  they win under either approach.\r\n\nBecause the \"catalyst\" formulation is  so plainly dispositive\r\n\nwe  need   not  determine  whether   plaintiffs  sufficiently\r\n\nprevailed on the  merits of  their claims to  be entitled  to\r\n\nfees  under a \"merits\" analysis  also.  Their  action under  \r\n\n1983  was at  least  a \"catalyst,\"  which  resulted in  their\r\n\nachieving precisely  the result  they sought by  bringing the\r\n\naction.\r\n\n          In order to  qualify for \"prevailing party\"  status\r\n\nunder  a catalyst theory, plaintiffs  must show \"(1) a causal\r\n\nconnection between  the litigation and  the relief  obtained,\r\n\nand  (2)  that  the  fee-target did  not  act  gratuitously.\"\r\n\nGuglietti v.

It was only\r\n\nin the wake of the district court's announced decision to the\r\n\ncontrary  that  HUD reversed  this  policy  by notifying  all\r\n\nMassachusetts   public   housing   authorities   that   their\r\n\n\"jurisdiction,\" for  purposes of  Section 8, extended  to any\r\n\ncommunity  within  the  Commonwealth,  and  by  granting  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  full  portability  rights  under     1437f(r)(1).\r\n\nThere  is  no  suggestion  that  without  the filing  of  the\r\n\nunderlying action,  and the  proceedings spawned by  it, this\r\n\nchange in  Section 8 portability policy  would have occurred.\r\n\nPlaintiffs' lawsuit  was not only a  \"necessary and important\r\n\nfactor\" in  achieving the  desired result,  it seems  to have\r\n\nbeen the key factor.\r\n\n          While  acknowledging that  the plaintiffs  got what\r\n\nthey wanted in their  lawsuit, the Authorities attribute this\r\n\n\"practical\"  success to HUD's \"voluntary\" agreement to change\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nits Section  8 portability policy, a  \"gratuitous gesture\" by\r\n\nthe  fee-target.  But for reasons already stated, there is no\r\n\nreasonable  way that  HUD's  and the  defendant  Authorities'\r\n\nchange  of heart can be  disassociated from the  lawsuit.  We\r\n\naccept that HUD and the Authorities were cooperative once the\r\n\ncourt had  expressed its interpretation  of state law.   They\r\n\nmight  have continued to fight.   One may  applaud their good\r\n\nsense and good will.  Still, a ruling even as to state law by\r\n\nan  experienced district  judge is  a significant  matter, as\r\n\nthese events showed, and the court's ruling was backed by the\r\n\npending  certification to the  highest state court.   HUD and\r\n\nthe  Authorities would  hardly have  accepted the  ruling had\r\n\nthey  doubted its  correctness.    The  filing of  this  case\r\n\ntriggered  a  process before  the  district  court (i.e.  the\r\n\nsubmission   of   papers,  the   holding  of   hearings,  the\r\n\npresentation  of arguments,  etc.) that  led to  the district\r\n\ncourt's decision.  It  was in response to that  decision that\r\n\nHUD, and the Authorities, changed their Section 8 portability\r\n\npolicy  in  Massachusetts.   Plaintiffs  are  thus prevailing\r\n\nparties as that term is used in 42 U.S.C.   1988.\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n          Having  found that  the plaintiffs  are \"prevailing\r\n\nparties\" for  purposes of    1988, we now turn  to the second\r\n\nissue  presented  for  review,  to wit,  whether  there  were\r\n\n\"special  circumstances\" in  this case meriting  the district\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\ncourt's denial of  attorneys' fees on discretionary  grounds.\r\n\nWhile    1988 provides that attorneys' fees may be granted to\r\n\nthe prevailing party in the district court's discretion, both\r\n\nthe  legislative history  and case law  since enactment  of  \r\n\n1988 indicate  that prevailing parties may  not ordinarily be\r\n\ndenied fees except in  special circumstances making the award\r\n\nunjust.   The  district court's  \"broad discretion\"  to award\r\n\nfees  to \"prevailing parties\"  under   1988,  see Sargeant v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSharp, 579 F.2d 645, 647  (1st Cir. 1978), must be guided  by\r                 \r\n\nthe  statutory presumption  that  fees should  be awarded  to\r\n\nsuccessful   plaintiffs  absent  unusual   situations.

With this in\r                    \r\n\nmind, we review for abuse  of discretion the district court's\r\n\ndiscretionary   determination,   asking  whether   the  court\r\n\nidentified appropriate \"special  circumstances\" that  justify\r\n\nthe denial of fees.\r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\n          In this circuit, \"special circumstances\" warranting\r\n\na denial of attorneys' fees  under   1988 have been  found if\r\n\nthere is  a showing of \"outrageous\"  or \"inexcusable\" conduct\r\n\nby  plaintiffs (or plaintiffs' counsel) during the litigation\r\n\nof the  case.

In Lewis, this court reversed an award of attorneys'\r                             \r\n\nfees  noting  that the  plaintiff  had  \"failed entirely,  or\r\n\nlargely,  in  everything\" and  that  her  lawyers' subsequent\r\n\nfailure  to  adjust  their  billing  accordingly  was,  thus,\r\n\n\"inexcusable.\"   Id. at 955-56.  In  a case where a fee award\r                                \r\n\nwas affirmed,  but its amount reduced,  this court reiterated\r\n\nthat, under  Lewis, \"special  circumstances\" exist where  the\r                              \r\n\nfee  application  reflects \"(1)  no  'good  faith' effort  to\r\n\nexclude excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary hours,\r\n\n(2)  no reduction for time spent  on unsuccessful claims, and\r\n\n(3) no allowance for the limited 'degree of success' achieved\r\n\nby  the  plaintiff.\"   Domegan, 972  F.2d  at 419  (citing to\r                                          \r\n\nLewis, 944 F.2d at 957-58).  In the instant case, there is no\r                 \r\n\nindication  from the record below that any of the parties (or\r\n\ntheir  lawyers)  engaged  in  \"outrageous\"  or  \"inexcusable\"\r\n\nconduct of this nature,  nor does the court suggest  as much.\r\n\nCompare Lewis,  944 F.2d at 955-56, with,  e.g., Domegan, 972\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 419-20.\r\n\n          The district court seems  rather to have employed a\r\n\n\"balancing  of  the  equities\"  test  not  accepted  in  this\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\ncircuit, see Stefan v.

The  plaintiffs-appellants  were  receiving\r\n\nfederal  housing  subsidies under  Section  8  of the  United\r\n\nStates Housing Act of 1937,  as amended.3  In April of  1993,\r\n\nthey brought an  action under  42 U.S.C.    1983 against  the\r\n\nArlington   and   Danvers,   Massachusetts,  Public   Housing\r\n\nAuthorities  (the \"Authorities\"),  as  well  as  against  the\r\n\nHanover,  Massachusetts  Public  Housing  Authority  and  the\r\n\nSecretary of the Department  of Housing and Urban Development\r\n\n(\"HUD\").4      Plaintiffs-appellants    alleged   that    the\r\n\nAuthorities,   with  HUD's   approval,  were   illegally  and\r\n\nunconstitutionally preventing them from using their Section 8\r\n\nsubsidies for housing outside  the geographical limits of the\r\n\ncity or town within  which the Authority issuing  the subsidy\r\n\nwas  located.    The Authorities  are  quasi-public  entities\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

See  24\r                                                                     \r\n\nC.F.R.   882.103(a) (1995).\r\n\n          In 1977, HUD was  presented with conflicting  legal\r\n\nopinions  from  two  different Massachusetts  public  housing\r\n\nauthorities as  to whether  they could legally  contract with\r\n\nprivate landlords outside  their municipal boundaries.6   HUD\r\n\nasked  the Massachusetts Executive  Office of Communities and\r\n\nDevelopment (\"EOCD\"), the state agency that supervises  local\r\n\npublic  housing authorities, to seek a legal opinion from the\r\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General.   Instead, the EOCD  provided\r\n\nits own legal opinion, which was that a Massachusetts  public\r\n\nhousing authority  could not contract with  private landlords\r                                        \r\n\noutside its municipal  boundaries, except  by agreement  with\r\n\nanother  local  public  housing   authority.    HUD  and  the\r\n\nAuthorities accepted and followed  the EOCD's opinion on this\r\n\nmatter.   The extent of a local authority's \"jurisdiction\" to\r\n\nprovide subsidized housing took on added significance in 1992\r\n\nwhen  Congress amended the portability rules of the Section 8\r\n\nhousing programs.   Plaintiffs say that  the amendment forced\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The Cambridge Housing  Authority, like the plaintiffs  in\r\nthis  case, took  the position  that state  law does  not bar\r\nlocal public housing authorities from contracting anywhere in\r\nthe  Commonwealth,  while  the Arlington  Housing  Authority,\r\nsimilar to  the defendants  in this litigation,  took a  much\r\nnarrower view of Section 8 \"jurisdiction.\"\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthem and others  like them  to seek rental  units within  the\r\n\njurisdiction of  a single authority.7   Unless that authority\r\n\ncould provide  housing beyond its  municipal limits,  tenants\r\n\nlike plaintiffs  were curtailed in their  mobility and choice\r\n\nof housing.   Faced with  this situation, plaintiffs  sued in\r\n\nthe district court under    1983 in April of 1993,  seeking a\r\n\njudicial determination of  their right to use their Section 8\r\n\nhousing subsidies in  any community within the  Commonwealth.\r\n\nTo  expedite a  decision, the  parties agreed that  the facts\r\n\nwould be submitted as  a case stated.

Section 147 of the  Housing and Community Development Act\r\nof  1992 amended  the portability provisions  of 42  U.S.C.  \r\n1437f by providing that:\r\n          \"any   family   not  living   within  the\r\n          jurisdiction of a  public housing  agency\r\n          at the  time that such family applies for\r\n          assistance from such agency shall, during\r\n          the  12-month  period beginning  upon the\r\n          receipt   of   any  tenant-based   rental\r\n          assistance  made  available on  behalf of\r\n          the family, use  such assistance to  rent\r\n          an eligible dwelling unit  located within\r\n          the  jurisdiction  served by  such public\r\n          housing agency.\"   Housing and  Community\r\n          Development  Act      147,  42  U.S.C.   \r\n          1437f(r)(1) (West 1994).\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nviolated   42   U.S.C.      1437f(r)(1),  the   relevant  HUD\r\n\nregulations,  Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and\r\n\n42  U.S.C.   1983.   They also alleged  that the restrictions\r\n\ninterfered  with their  constitutional right to  travel under\r\n\nthe  Fifth and  Fourteenth  Amendments to  the United  States\r\n\nConstitution.\r\n\n          Fearing the  loss of  their Section 8  subsidies if\r\n\nthey could not immediately  find housing within the municipal\r\n\nboundaries of  the  Authority that  issued  their  respective\r\n\nSection   8  certificates,   the   plaintiffs  moved   for  a\r\n\npreliminary  injunction  that   would  toll  or   freeze  the\r\n\nsubsidies' expiration dates.  The need for preliminary relief\r\n\nceased, however, when defendants  agreed not to terminate the\r\n\nplaintiffs' subsidies while the case was pending.\r\n\n          After reviewing submissions and  hearing arguments,\r\n\nthe district  court issued  an oral  opinion on September  9,\r\n\n1993,  followed by a  written decision on  December 12, 1994.\r\n\nSee Williams, 871  F. Supp.  at 527-35.   The district  court\r                        \r\n\nstated in both that, in its view, Massachusetts law permitted\r\n\nstate public  housing authorities to contract  with landlords\r\n\nowning dwellings outside their municipal boundaries.\r\n\n          Less than  a month after the  district court's oral\r\n\nopinion, HUD  issued a directive to  the Massachusetts public\r\n\nhousing authorities informing them that all Section 8 tenants\r\n\ncould henceforth use their  housing subsidies anywhere in the\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nCommonwealth.   HUD,  as the  district court  later declared,\r\n\nWilliams,  926 F. Supp.  at 12, treated  the district court's\r                    \r\n\nruling  as   an  authoritative  declaration   of  state  law,\r\n\nsuperseding  the   contrary  opinion   of  the  EOCD.     The\r\n\nAuthorities also went along.\r\n\n          While the  district court rendered its  own opinion\r\n\nas to an authority's jurisdiction, it also certified the same\r\n\nquestion  to  the  Massachusetts  Supreme   Judicial  Court.8\r\n\nBefore  that court  reached  the matter,  the district  court\r\n\nwithdrew  its  certification,  in  part  because  of  certain\r\n\nchanges in HUD's regulations.  At a November 30, 1995 hearing\r\n\nin  the district court to  determine the status  of the case,\r\n\nHUD  assured the district court that, in spite of its changed\r\n\nregulations,9 it would continue to instruct all Massachusetts\r\n\npublic  housing authorities to abide by  the court's oral and\r\n\nwritten decisions  issued in  plaintiffs'    1983 case.   The\r\n\ndistrict court thereupon dismissed the   1983  action as moot\r\n\nand   plaintiffs   petitioned,   unsuccessfully,  for   their\r\n\nattorneys' fees.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  The district court certified the following question:\r\n          \"Is   a   Massachusetts  Public   Housing\r\n          Authority legally barred from contracting\r\n          with landlords outside the  boundaries of\r\n          the organizing city or town?\"\r\n\n9.

In that action, the court continued,\r\n\nplaintiffs claimed  to have been deprived  of \"rights secured\r\n\nby  federal  statutes,  regulations  and  the  United  States\r\n\nConstitution.\"  Williams, 926 F. Supp. at 13.  In the court's\r                                    \r\n\nview, plaintiffs  never became  entitled to fees  because the\r\n\ncourt never found that they \"had a right under federal law to\r\n\nhave  the Authorities  contract  outside of  their  political\r\n\nboundaries for Section 8 housing.\"  Id.  Rather the import of\r                                                   \r\n\nthe court's  ruling was that  state, not federal  law allowed\r\n\nthe  Authorities  to  contract  outside  of  their  political\r\n\nboundaries.  Id.   As plaintiffs did not vindicate  a federal\r                            \r\n\nright, the  district court believed  that   1988  provided no\r\n\nright to fees.\r\n\n          The  court also  stated, as  a separate  ground for\r\n\ndecision, that it would refrain from awarding attorneys' fees\r\n\nas a matter of discretion, even  assuming plaintiffs could be\r\n\nsaid to have prevailed on a federal right.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n          In reviewing the  district court's denial of  fees,\r\n\nwe  turn first to its ruling that, because plaintiffs did not\r\n\nprevail  on any of their federal claims, they are barred from\r\n\nreceiving  attorneys'  fees under     1988.

The clear tendency of the courts has been to\r\n\napply  the  fees  statute  in  a  more   practical  and  less\r\n\nrestrictive way.\r\n\n          Section  1988 itself nowhere states that attorneys'\r\n\nfees  can be awarded only  to those who  prevail on expressly\r\n\nfederal grounds.  To be sure, the statute specifies that fees\r\n\nare to be  awarded only  \"in\" any of  the enumerated  federal\r\n\ncauses of action, including   1983.  Note 2, supra.  And fees\r                                                              \r\n\ncan  be  allowed  only  to  a  prevailing  party.    But  the\r\n\nattorneys'  fees being requested here  are for services in an\r\n\naction  to  enforce a  provision of     1983 and  (as further\r\n\ndiscussed below) plaintiffs  have, in every  practical sense,\r\n\nprevailed    having, as  a result of their  lawsuit, achieved\r\n\nprecisely the end-relief they wanted, namely the right to use\r\n\ntheir  Section  8  housing subsidies  outside  the  political\r\n\nboundaries of the Authority providing the subsidy.\r\n\n          To uphold the district court's rationale,  we would\r\n\nhave to read into   1988 an implied further requirement that,\r\n\nto be  a prevailing party, it  is necessary not only  to have\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nsecured a significant objective of one's federal lawsuit, but\r\n\nto  have  done so  by obtaining  a  favorable ruling  on some\r\n\nfederal legal  or constitutional claim advanced  in the suit.\r\n\nA theory akin  to this  was rejected seventeen  years ago  in\r\n\nMaherv.

As here,  the favorable interpretation of state\r\n\nlaw  came  as a  consequence of  the    1983  litigation, the\r\n\nfederal court,  as part of that  proceeding, having certified\r\n\nthe  determinative state  law  question to  the state  court,\r\n\nwhich  overturned the commissioner's interpretation.  Also as\r\n\nhere,  the federal claims in  the lawsuit were  mooted by the\r\n\nstate law ruling and were never decided.  \r\n\n          In the  present case, as in  Exeter-West Greenwich,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe  unfavorable  interpretation   of  state  law  that   led\r\n\nplaintiffs to bring the    1983 action was also  certified to\r\n\nthe  highest state  court.

Here, as in Exeter-West Greenwich,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthe federal statutory and constitutional claims made in the  \r\n\n1983  action were  directed  at  overthrowing an  unfavorable\r\n\nstate law ruling.  Whether that ruling was itself correct was\r\n\na  legitimate question for consideration  in the   1983 suit:\r\n\nif,   as   the   district   court   determined,   the  EOCD's\r\n\ninterpretation was  incorrect, there  was no need  to resolve\r\n\nthe federal constitutional claim raised by plaintiffs, a fact\r\n\nnoted   by  the  district  judge  himself  as  a  reason  for\r\n\ncertification.    Williams,  926  F.   Supp.  at  12.10    By\r                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  In the 1994 opinion, the district court stated:\r\n          \"In view of  this Court's  interpretation of  state\r\nlaw,           there  is   no   occasion  to   consider   the\r\nconstitutional           question whether  the 1992 amendment\r\nto 42 U.S.C.             1437f(r) infringes upon the right to\r\ntravel.  A court         should address constitutional issues\r\nonly when a case         cannot be resolved on other grounds.\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\naddressing the  state law  question first, the  federal court\r\n\nfollowed the principle that  a case should not be  decided on\r\n\nconstitutional grounds  if other grounds are  available.  The\r\n\ncertification process  enabled the  federal court to  seek an\r\n\nauthoritative interpretation  of state  law from the  state's\r\n\nhighest court;  but this  proved unnecessary as  the district\r\n\ncourt's own announced view of the state law persuaded HUD and\r\n\nthe  Authorities  to abandon,  without  more,  their previous\r\n\nconstruction, and  to embrace the one plaintiffs wanted.  The\r\n\nstate  law question on which the court ruled was thus closely\r\n\nentwined with  the federal claims, the  court's addressing of\r\n\nit  being an  appropriate  judicial action  taken within  the\r\n\ncontext of the    1983 proceeding itself.  Being  integral to\r\n\nthe latter and to the federal claims therein, it furnished an\r\n\nunexceptionable   basis   for   finding  plaintiffs   to   be\r\n\n\"prevailing  parties\" entitled  to fees  under    1988.

Their  action under  \r\n\n1983  was at  least  a \"catalyst,\"  which  resulted in  their\r\n\nachieving precisely  the result  they sought by  bringing the\r\n\naction.\r\n\n          In order to  qualify for \"prevailing party\"  status\r\n\nunder  a catalyst theory, plaintiffs  must show \"(1) a causal\r\n\nconnection between  the litigation and  the relief  obtained,\r\n\nand  (2)  that  the  fee-target did  not  act  gratuitously.\"\r\n\nGuglietti v.

It was only\r\n\nin the wake of the district court's announced decision to the\r\n\ncontrary  that  HUD reversed  this  policy  by notifying  all\r\n\nMassachusetts   public   housing   authorities   that   their\r\n\n\"jurisdiction,\" for  purposes of  Section 8, extended  to any\r\n\ncommunity  within  the  Commonwealth,  and  by  granting  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  full  portability  rights  under     1437f(r)(1).\r\n\nThere  is  no  suggestion  that  without  the filing  of  the\r\n\nunderlying action,  and the  proceedings spawned by  it, this\r\n\nchange in  Section 8 portability policy  would have occurred.\r\n\nPlaintiffs' lawsuit  was not only a  \"necessary and important\r\n\nfactor\" in  achieving the  desired result,  it seems  to have\r\n\nbeen the key factor.\r\n\n          While  acknowledging that  the plaintiffs  got what\r\n\nthey wanted in their  lawsuit, the Authorities attribute this\r\n\n\"practical\"  success to HUD's \"voluntary\" agreement to change\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nits Section  8 portability policy, a  \"gratuitous gesture\" by\r\n\nthe  fee-target.  But for reasons already stated, there is no\r\n\nreasonable  way that  HUD's  and the  defendant  Authorities'\r\n\nchange  of heart can be  disassociated from the  lawsuit.  We\r\n\naccept that HUD and the Authorities were cooperative once the\r\n\ncourt had  expressed its interpretation  of state law.   They\r\n\nmight  have continued to fight.   One may  applaud their good\r\n\nsense and good will.  Still, a ruling even as to state law by\r\n\nan  experienced district  judge is  a significant  matter, as\r\n\nthese events showed, and the court's ruling was backed by the\r\n\npending  certification to the  highest state court.   HUD and\r\n\nthe  Authorities would  hardly have  accepted the  ruling had\r\n\nthey  doubted its  correctness.    The  filing of  this  case\r\n\ntriggered  a  process before  the  district  court (i.e.  the\r\n\nsubmission   of   papers,  the   holding  of   hearings,  the\r\n\npresentation  of arguments,  etc.) that  led to  the district\r\n\ncourt's decision.  It  was in response to that  decision that\r\n\nHUD, and the Authorities, changed their Section 8 portability\r\n\npolicy  in  Massachusetts.   Plaintiffs  are  thus prevailing\r\n\nparties as that term is used in 42 U.S.C.   1988.\r\n\n                             IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n          Having  found that  the plaintiffs  are \"prevailing\r\n\nparties\" for  purposes of    1988, we now turn  to the second\r\n\nissue  presented  for  review,  to wit,  whether  there  were\r\n\n\"special  circumstances\" in  this case meriting  the district\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\ncourt's denial of  attorneys' fees on discretionary  grounds.\r\n\nWhile    1988 provides that attorneys' fees may be granted to\r\n\nthe prevailing party in the district court's discretion, both\r\n\nthe  legislative history  and case law  since enactment  of  \r\n\n1988 indicate  that prevailing parties may  not ordinarily be\r\n\ndenied fees except in  special circumstances making the award\r\n\nunjust.

We hold, therefore, that\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\nthe  district court  exceeded its  discretion in  denying any\r\n\nfees on the discretionary basis set forth in its opinion.\r\n\n                              V.\r                                          V.\r\n\n          For  all of  the foregoing  reasons, we  vacate the\r\n\ndistrict  court's order  denying the  plaintiffs'  motion for\r\n\nattorneys' fees under    1988.   We  remand the  case to  the\r\n\ndistrict court for  consideration of the fee application in a\r\n\nmanner not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\n          It is so ordered.  Costs for appellant.\r                                                            \r\n\n                             -25-\r\r\n</pre>",
