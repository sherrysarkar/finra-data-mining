This is an appeal brought by\n\nRobert Gosselin, a Chapter 7 debtor, from a district court\n\ndecision that the Eleventh Amendment bars his adversary action\n\nagainst the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We affirm, but we do\n\nnot adopt the district court's reasoning, nor do we reach the\n\nconstitutionality of 11 U.S.C. § 106(a), a Bankruptcy Code\n\nprovision which explicitly abrogates the states' sovereign\n\nimmunity with respect to the bankruptcy court's ability to\n\ndeclare state tax debts dischargeable.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          In 1998 Gosselin filed a petition for bankruptcy under\n\nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.1       11 U.S.C. §§ 701-784 (2000).\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as is common in \"no asset\"\n\ncases, did not file a proof of claim or otherwise participate in\n\nthe original Chapter 7 proceeding. Shortly after initiating his\n\nChapter 7 petition, Gosselin brought an adversary action against\n\nthe Commonwealth in the United States Bankruptcy Court to obtain\n\na   specific   ruling   that   certain    past   due   taxes   to   the\n\nCommonwealth were dischargeable.          The Commonwealth moved to\n\n\n     1    In February 1999, the bankruptcy court entered an order\ndischarging Gosselin's debts.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdismiss   the     proceeding,   asserting     its   Eleventh   Amendment\n\nsovereign immunity against being sued in the courts of the\n\nUnited States without its consent.2\n\n           The     Commonwealth       later    argued     that,      under\n\n§ 523(a)(1)(C), Gosselin's tax debts were not dischargeable\n\nbecause he willfully attempted to evade or defeat the tax. But,\n\nthe Commonwealth argued, the Eleventh Amendment barred the\n\nbankruptcy court from entertaining the substance of Gosselin's\n\nclaim, despite § 106(a)'s authorization of suit in federal court\n\nand   purported    abrogation   of    state   sovereign   immunity    with\n\nrespect to § 523 (and fifty-nine other provisions of the Code).3\n\n\n      2    The Eleventh Amendment states:\n\n      The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to\n      extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted\n      against one of the United States by Citizens of another state .\n      . . .\n\nU.S. Const. amend XI.\n      3    11 U.S.C. § 106 states, in relevant part:\n\n      (a) Notwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity, sovereign\n      immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit to the extent set\n      forth in this section with respect to the following:\n           (1) Sections . . . 523, 524 [and fifty-eight other\n           sections] . . . of this title.\n           (2) The court may hear and determine any issue arising with\n           respect to the application of such sections to governmental\n           units.\n           (3) The court may issue against a governmental unit an\n\n                                     -3-\n\fThe Commonwealth claimed that § 106(a) was an invalid abrogation\n\nof its sovereign immunity.       The bankruptcy court denied the\n\nCommonwealth's motion to dismiss, and later ruled on summary\n\njudgment that the state taxes were discharged. The Commonwealth\n\nappealed and the district court reversed the bankruptcy court\n\nand held that Congress, being constrained by the Eleventh\n\nAmendment, had exceeded its power by enacting § 106(a).     United\n\nStates Dep't of Treasury v. Gosselin, 252 B.R. 854, 858-59 (D.\n\nMass. 2000).     The district court, therefore, reversed the\n\nbankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment and reversed the\n\nbankruptcy court's denial of the Commonwealth's motion to\n\ndismiss.   Id. at 859.\n\n                                II.\n\n           Our review of the district court's order is de novo.\n\nParella v. Retirement Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173\n\nF.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 1999).     We affirm, but without adopting\n\nthe district court's reasoning or reaching the constitutionality\n\nof § 106(a).   We do so because, on appeal, Gosselin's brief has\n\n\n           order, process, or judgment under such sections or the\n           Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure . . . .\n\nThe Code defines \"governmental unit\" to include states. 11 U.S.C. §\n101(27) (2000).\n\n                                -4-\n\fpresented not a single colorable argument for why his suit\n\nagainst the Commonwealth should be allowed to go forward. Other\n\nthan stating, as the issue presented for review, the question of\n\nwhether the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a debtor from bringing\n\nan adversary proceeding against the Commonwealth to have a state\n\ntax debt declared dischargeable, Gosselin's only argument on\n\nappeal is that the state has waived its immunity by statute.\n\nThe argument is raised for the first time on appeal; it is\n\nfrivolous, and we decline to consider it. Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle\n\nParenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 645 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that\n\nfailure to brief an argument constitutes waiver); Piazza v. Aponte\n\nRoque, 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Except in extraordinary\n\ncircumstances . . . a court of appeals will not consider an issue\n\nraised for the first time at oral argument.\"); United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (applying \"the settled\n\nappellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived\"); see also Fed. R. App. P. 28(a).\n\n          Therefore, we affirm the district court's judgment that\n\nGosselin's claim should be dismissed.   However, we need not, and\n\ndo not, adopt the district court's reasoning.     We are loathe to\n\naddress the constitutionality of a statute in the absence of\n\n                                -5-\n\fadequate briefing by the parties, and the United States, by\n\ndeclining our invitation to file a brief, has chosen to shed no\n\nadditional light on the matter.4\n\n          We consider the scope of our opinion to be extremely\n\nlimited given that we affirm only because Gosselin has, in\n\nessence, defaulted by failing to present any colorable argument\n\non appeal.      Accordingly, this opinion would have no preclusive\n\nor precedential effect on a case in which the Commonwealth were\n\nto seek to collect its tax debts and Gosselin were to defend on\n\nthe basis of his general discharge in bankruptcy.            Similarly,\n\nour holding here would not be determinative of any case, brought\n\nunder Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), in which Gosselin or\n\nanyone   else    attempted   to   prevent   a   state    official   from\n\nunlawfully collecting a discharged tax debt.            The issues that\n\nwould be presented by such cases are distinct.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4     Because this is a suit questioning the constitutionality of\na federal statute and the United States is not a party, the party\nraising the constitutional question was obligated to notify the Clerk\nof this court. Fed. R. App. P. 44. Because neither party gave proper\nnotice, this court did so. See 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a) (1994). The United\nStates, after considering the question for some time, has informed us\nthat it does not wish to participate in this matter.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",

Id. at 859.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's order is de novo. Parella v. Retirement Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198432\"><a href=\"/opinion/198432/parella-v-retirement/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir. 1999). We affirm, but without adopting the district court's reasoning or reaching the constitutionality of &#167; 106(a). We do so because, on appeal, Gosselin's brief has presented not a single colorable argument for why his suit against the Commonwealth should be allowed to go forward. Other than stating, as the issue presented for review, the question of whether the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a debtor from bringing an adversary proceeding against the Commonwealth to have a state tax debt declared dischargeable, Gosselin's only argument on appeal is that the state has waived its immunity by statute. The argument is raised for the first time on appeal; it is frivolous, and we decline to consider it. Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768712\"><a href=\"/opinion/768712/zenaida-garc-a-ayala-v-lederle-parenterals-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 645 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that failure to brief an argument constitutes waiver); Piazza v.

R. App. P. 28(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, we affirm the district court's judgment that Gosselin's claim should be dismissed. However, we need not, and do not, adopt the district court's reasoning. We are loathe to address the constitutionality of a statute in the absence of adequate briefing by the parties, and the United States, by declining our invitation to file a brief, has chosen to shed no additional light on the matter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the scope of our opinion to be extremely limited given that we affirm only because Gosselin has, in essence, defaulted by failing to present any colorable argument on appeal. Accordingly, this opinion would have no preclusive or precedential effect on a case in which the Commonwealth were to seek to collect its tax debts and Gosselin were to defend on the basis of his general discharge in bankruptcy. Similarly, our holding here would not be determinative of any case, brought under Ex parte Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span> (1908), in which Gosselin or anyone else attempted to prevent a state official from unlawfully collecting a discharged tax debt. The issues that would be presented by such cases are distinct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  In February 1999, the bankruptcy court entered an order discharging Gosselin's debts.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  The Eleventh Amendment states:</p>\n        <p>The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another state . . . .</p>\n        <p>U.S. Const. amend XI.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  11 U.S.C. &#167; 106 states, in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>(a) Notwithstanding an assertion of sovereign immunity, sovereign immunity is abrogated as to a governmental unit to the extent set forth in this section with respect to the following:</p>\n        <p>(1) Sections . . . 523, 524 [and fifty-eight other sections] . . . of this title.</p>\n        <p>(2) The court may hear and determine any issue arising with respect to the application of such sections to governmental units.</p>\n        <p>(3) The court may issue against a governmental unit an order, process, or judgment under such sections or the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure . . . .</p>\n        <p>The Code defines \"governmental unit\" to include states. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(27) (2000).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  Because this is a suit questioning the constitutionality of a federal statute and the United States is not a party, the party raising the constitutional question was obligated to notify the Clerk of this court.
