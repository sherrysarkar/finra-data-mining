Warren for petitioner.\n   Joseph F. Ciolino, with whom Richard M. Evans, Assistant\nDirector, and Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney General,\nDepartment of Justice were on brief for respondent.\n\nMay 24, 1999\n\n                                Per Curiam.   Petitioners Jos Angel Vsquez\n(\"Vsquez\") and his wife Sarah Elizabeth Vsquez petition for a\nreview of a final order issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals\n(\"Board\") affirming an Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial of their\napplication for political asylum and withholding of deportation. \nThe Board concluded that they had failed to demonstrate a well-\nfounded fear of persecution on any of the statutorily enumerated\ngrounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group or political opinion.  See 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(42)(A);\nCivil v. I.N.S., 140 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1998). Because the\npetitioners failed to meet the less onerous \"well-founded fear\"\nstandard for political asylum, the Board concluded that the\npetitioners could not meet the more rigorous standard required for\na withholding of deportation.  The Board did allow voluntary\ndeparture, however.  Petitioners now appeal to this Court.  As the\nBoard's conclusion is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.\nVsquez was a taxi driver in El Salvador who had the\nmisfortune to unwittingly become a witness to the events leading to\nthe assassination of a lawyer for the Third Brigade Army in El\nSalvador.  In October of 1990, Vsquez was hailed by three men\ndressed in civilian clothes, who, unbeknownst to him, were members\nof the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (\"FMLN\").  The\nthree men (\"the guerrillas\") instructed him to make various stops,\npicking up and discharging passengers.  Ultimately, Vsquez brought\nthem to a building called the \"Juzgados\", where Vsquez heard\nmachine gun shots.  The guerrillas returned to the taxi and ordered\nVsquez to drive them from the scene. \nVsquez did not report this incident to the police,\nhaving been threatened with harm by the guerrillas if he did not\nmaintain silence. The next day, the police brought him in for\nquestioning, initially believing that Vsquez was an accomplice to\nthe crime.  He was interrogated for two days, until he assisted the\npolice by driving them to the house where he dropped off the three\nmen.  Notwithstanding his cooperation, he was committed to prison\nfor a year and a half until he was acquitted of the offense. \nAlthough two of the three guerrillas involved in the\nshooting were ultimately convicted of the crime and imprisoned, the\nthird man remains free. Since he was acquitted, Vsquez claims that\nhe has been threatened by the third guerrilla on a number of\noccasions and that his wife was assaulted by a group of guerrillas\non one occasion.\nOn the basis of these facts, petitioners contend that the\nBoard erred in concluding that Vsquez did not have a well-founded\nfear of persecution on the basis of an imputed political opinion. \nSpecifically, they argue that the guerrillas believed, incorrectly,\nthat Vsquez cooperated with the police investigation because of\nhis opposition to their political position.  Their persecution of\nhim, petitioners argue, stems from their mistaken belief that he\nholds a political opinion in opposition to their movement.  The\nBoard rejected this position, instead concluding that any\n\"persecution\" committed at the hands of the guerrillas was not\nrelated to a political opinion imputed to Vsquez but instead was\nthe unfortunate result of his witnessing events leading to a high\nprofile assassination.\nWe review the Board's findings directly, mindful that \"in\ncontemplation of law [the findings of the IJ] have become the\n[Board's].\"  Aguilar-Sols v. I.N.S., 168 F.3d 565, 570 n. 4 (1st\nCir. 1999).   We review a Board decision to deny an application for\nasylum deferentially.  We will affirm if the Board's conclusion is\n\"supported  by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\nthe record considered as a whole.\" Civil, 140 F.3d at 54 (quoting\nGebremichael v. I.N.S., 10 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 1993)).  We will\nonly reverse where the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable\nfact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\nSee I.N.S v. Elas-Zacaras, 502 U.S. 478, 483-84 (1992).\n\"As a prerequisite to asylum eligibility, an alien bears\nthe burden of establishing that he is a refugee.\" Aguilar-Sols,\n168 F.3d at 569.  A refugee is someone who has been persecuted or\nhas a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of one of the\nfive statutorily enumerated grounds.  See Civil, 140 F.3d at 55;\nRavindran v. I.N.S., 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1992).  The\npetitioner must establish \"both a genuine subjective fear and an\nobjectively reasonable fear of persecution on a protected ground.\"\nCivil, 140 F.3d at 55. \nPetitioners are correct that \"[a]n imputed political\nopinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may\nconstitute a reason for political persecution within the meaning of\nthe Act.\"  Ravindran, 976 F.2d at 760.  The evidence in the record,\nhowever, does not compel the conclusion that the guerrillas imputed\nto Vsquez a pro-government, anti-guerrilla political opinion.  In\nfact, the evidence suggests that the guerrillas threatened Vsquez\nbecause he witnessed events leading to a murder.   None of the\nalleged acts of discrimination suggest a political motivation. \nAlthough the alleged incidents do reveal an intent to potentially\nintimidate and harass, there is no suggestion that the guerrillas'\nacts flowed from a belief that Vsquez was acting out of a\npolitical animus against them.  As explained by the IJ, it \"may\nwell be that the [third guerrilla is] interested in silencing the\nrespondent because he has information that could put this\nindividual in prison for murder[.]\" This conclusion is supported by\nreasonable and substantial evidence, see Civil, 140 F.3d at 54, and\nwe cannot say that the evidence was so compelling that any\nreasonable fact finder could only conclude that Vsquez's\npersecution was because of an imputed political opinion in\nopposition to the FMLN. See Elas-Zacaras, 502 U.S. at 483-84.\nAffirmed.\n",
