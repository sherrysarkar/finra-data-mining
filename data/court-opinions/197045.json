This case  concerns several\r                                            \r\n\nclaims  brought  by  plaintiff-appellant,  Stephen   R.  Marques,\r\n\nagainst the city of  East Providence, Rhode Island, based  on his\r\n\ndischarge while a  probationary employee of  the city.   Marques,\r\n\nwho had refused to continue a work assignment on a boat at a city\r\n\npond  due  to  his   fear  of  capsizing  and  was   subsequently\r\n\nterminated, sued the city  under both state and federal  law; the\r\n\ncity  removed  the case  to federal  court.   The  district court\r\n\ngranted directed verdicts for the city on all claims.   We affirm\r\n\non two claims,  and vacate as to  Marques' claim under  the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Whistleblowers' Act.  \r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r\n\n     Marques was hired as a laborer by the city of East\r\n\nProvidence in June 1993.1  On December 22, 1993, several days\r\n\nbefore the expiration of his six-month probationary period,\r\n\nMarques was assigned to work at Jones Pond, cutting weeds in the\r\n\npond from an aluminum row boat.  Marques, who is unable to swim,\r\n\nexpressed some concerns about the assignment to Gregory Gammell\r\n\n(\"Gammell\"), the Superintendent of the Parks Department, but was\r\n\ntold by Gammell not to worry about it.  On his arrival at Jones\r\n\nPond, Marques noticed that there were no life preservers in the\r\n\nboat, and asked Gammell for one.  Gammell initially questioned\r\n\nMarques' need for the life preserver, but told him he would get\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    We  take the  facts  from the  pleadings  and from  the\r\ntestimony at trial.   See PHC, Inc. v. Pioneer  Healthcare, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n75 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\none; however, this life preserver was not forthcoming.2  Marques\r\n\nnevertheless performed the assignment.\r\n\n     On the following day, December 23, 1993, Marques, who had\r\n\nagain been assigned to duty in the boat cutting reeds, told lead\r\n\nworker Robert Barlow (\"Barlow\") that he was nervous about working\r\n\nin the boat, that he would like a life preserver, and that he had\r\n\nasked for one on the prior day but not received it.  Barlow\r\n\nquestioned the need for a life preserver, given the depth of the\r\n\nwater, but said he would call Gammell.  Gammell arrived, but sans\r\n\nlife preserver, and subsequently left the site.  Marques\r\n\ntestified that he began to feel nauseous during the morning while\r\n\nworking on the boat, which he attributed to motion sickness.  At\r\n\nthe morning break, he therefore told Barlow that he wasn't going\r\n\nback in the boat because he was feeling sick.  Barlow indicated\r\n\nthat if Marques didn't return to the boat, Barlow would call\r\n\nGammell.  During subsequent general conversation between workers\r\n\nat the pond site about the safety of the project, Marques and\r\n\nothers expressed concerns about the lack of life preservers and\r\n\nother safety devices.  Gammell returned to the pond, and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    Testimony  was  presented by  city  witnesses  at trial\r\nindicating  that the depth of  Jones Pond varied  between two and\r\nfive  feet.  The Pond  was created artificially  by dredging, and\r\nmeasures  approximately  300 feet  by  250  feet, with  retaining\r\ncement walls.  We also note that Paul Lemont, the City Manager of\r\nEast Providence, who gave the original order for the work project\r\nat Jones Pond, testified that the weed cutting project could have\r\nbeen  performed by laborers in  a boat, as  actually occurred, or\r\nalternatively by laborers wearing boots.  \r\n          On the other hand, Marques testified  that at one point\r\nduring the December  23rd session, he  lost hold of  a five  foot\r\nrake he  was using; when he grabbed it, the rake was almost fully\r\nsubmerged in the water, and had not yet touched bottom.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ninstructed Marques and Barlow to get in his car.  On their\r\n\narrival at Gammell's office, Gammell instructed Marques to \"punch\r\n\nout\" and then terminated him.3  Marques did not discuss his\r\n\nsafety concerns with Gammell during the car trip or at his\r\n\ntermination.  Gammell informed Marques that he was being\r\n\nterminated because he wouldn't get back in the boat and because\r\n\nof his attitude.  \r\n\n     Marques subsequently met with City Manager Lemont to discuss\r\n\nhis firing.   At this meeting, Marques explained his concerns\r\n\nabout safety and his physical ills to Lemont; however, Lemont\r\n\nlater wrote Marques a letter informing him that the decision to\r\n\nterminate Marques would stand.\r\n\n     Shortly after his termination, Marques began experiencing\r\n\nphysical symptoms such as tightness in his chest and difficulty\r\n\nbreathing, which his physician attributed to situational anxiety\r\n\nbrought on by his firing.  His doctor prescribed medications and\r\n\ncounseling.  Marques also began experiencing marital\r\n\ndifficulties.  \r\n\n     Marques sued the city in state court, alleging violations of\r\n\na number of state statutes, including the Rhode Island\r\n\nWhistleblowers' Act, as well as federal claims including the\r\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.  He also claimed that the city's\r\n\nactions constituted negligent or intentional infliction of\r\n\nemotional distress, and that the city had violated the Rhode\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    During the probationary period, city employees could be\r\nfired for any reason,  with or without cause, and  also could not\r\nfile a grievance with the city regarding a discharge.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nIsland Regulation of Boats law.4  The city removed the case to\r\n\nfederal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.  At\r\n\nthe close of the evidence, the district court granted a directed\r\n\nverdict for the city on all counts.5   This appeal on three of\r\n\nthe claims followed. \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r\n\n     Our review of the directed verdicts on the appealed claims\r\n\nis plenary; as such we must apply the same criteria used by the\r\n\ndistrict court, with all proof and inferences reasonably drawn\r\n\ntherefrom viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. \r\n\nGibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1994).  To\r                                    \r\n\naffirm, we must find that the evidence on each count would permit\r\n\nthoughtful factfinders to reach but one conclusion.  Fashion\r                                                                      \r\n\nHouse v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1088 (1st Cir. 1989). \r                               \r\n\nAfter a thorough review of the record, we affirm the district\r\n\ncourt on the intentional infliction of emotional distress and\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4    The specific statutes under which Marques'  claims were\r\nbrought  are as  follows:  the Rhode  Island Whistleblowers'  Act\r\n(R.I.  Gen. Laws    28-50-1 - 9); the Americans With Disabilities\r\nAct (on the grounds that the city saw him as disabled) (42 U.S.C.\r\n   12100 et seq.); the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act\r\n(R.I. Gen. Laws     28-50-1  - 28-50-9); the  Rhode Island  Civil\r\nRights  Act  (R.I.  Gen. Laws     42-112-1  et  seq.); and  Rhode\r\nIsland's Regulation of Boats law (R.I. Gen. Laws   46-22-1 - 19).\r\n\n     5    Marques voluntarily  dismissed a claim  that the city's\r\nactions  violated Rhode  Island's safe  boating practices  public\r\npolicy.  After the  trial court had granted directed  verdicts on\r\nall the  other claims,  Marques moved  to  reinstate this  count;\r\nhowever,  the district  court denied  this motion.   We  need not\r\naddress  this  issue because  appellant did  not  brief it.   See\r                                                                           \r\nPlayboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Public Service Com'n of Puerto Rico,\r                                                                          \r\n906 F.2d 25, 40 (1990) (appellant waives any issue not adequately\r\nraised in initial brief).\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nRhode Island Regulation of Boats claims, but vacate on the\r\n\nappellant's claim under the Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act.  We\r\n\ndeal first with the most significant claim.\r\n\nA.   Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act Claim\r                                                     \r\n\n     The Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act provides in relevant\r\n\npart that:\r\n\n          An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or\r\n     otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding\r\n     the employee's compensation, terms, location, or\r\n     privileges of employment\r\n          (1)  because the employee [...] reports or is\r\n     about to report to a public body, verbally or in\r\n     writing, a violation which the employee knows or\r\n     reasonably believes has occurred or is about to occur,\r\n     of a law or regulation, or rule promulgated under the\r\n     law of this state, a political subdivision of this\r\n     state, or the United States, unless the employee knows\r\n     or has reason to know that the report is false....6\r\n\nAccordingly, an employee must demonstrate that there was a causal\r\n\nconnection between the report and the termination.\r\n\n     The statute does not explicitly define what constitutes a\r\n\n\"report\" or \"reporting\" a suspected or known violation.  However,\r\n\nit does define \"public body\" as follows:\r\n\n          (4)  \"Public body\" means all of the\r\n     following:[...]\r\n          (iii) A county, city, town, or regional governing\r\n     body, a council, school district, or a board,\r\n     department, commission, agency, or any member or\r\n     employee thereof.7\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6    R.I. Gen. Laws   28-50-3(1) (1995).  The current  Rhode\r\nIsland Whistleblowers' Act was  enacted in 1995, and replaced  an\r\nearlier  version  of  the  Whistleblowers'  Act  that  carried  a\r\ndifferent  statutory  number, (R.I.  Gen. Laws    36-15-1  - 10);\r\nhowever, the terms of this section were unchanged.  \r\n\n     7    R.I. Gen. Laws   28-50-2(4)(iii) (1995).\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     The district court concluded that this statute is\r\n\ninapplicable in the circumstances of this case because Marques'\r\n\nstatements could not be construed as \"reports\" to a \"public\r\n\nbody.\"  The district court reasoned that the statute contemplates\r\n\na situation in which an employee reports or threatens to report a\r\n\nviolation of a law to a third party with jurisdiction over the\r\n\nviolation.  For the district court, Marques' statements were\r\n\nmerely explanations for his refusal to return to the boat, rather\r\n\nthan reports to an appropriate individual or body of known or\r\n\nsuspected violations.  \r\n\n     Marques argues on appeal that the district court gave an\r\n\noverly narrow interpretation to the statute's provisions.  He\r\n\nclaims that his statements to Barlow could fall within the\r\n\nstatute and that both caselaw (albeit from other jurisdictions)\r\n\nand public policy support his view.  The city, on the other hand,\r\n\ncontends that the district court properly construed the\r\n\nprovision; it maintains that Marques made no statements to Barlow\r\n\nor other supervisors that reasonably could be construed as\r\n\nreports of violations to a public body.  \r\n\n     Our task is complicated by the lack of guideposts.  There is\r\n\nno relevant legislative history indicating the intent of Rhode\r\n\nIsland lawmakers concerning the interpretation of these terms. \r\n\nFurthermore, Rhode Island courts have not directly interpreted\r\n\n\"report\" or \"public body\" under the statute.  We do, however,\r\n\nhave the statutory language, which must be construed consistently\r\n\nwith its purpose.  Our review of the language of the statute,\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ntogether with an examination of similar statutes from other\r\n\njurisdictions, with an eye to the public policy underlying such\r\n\nwhistleblowers' statutes, counsels a broader view of the statute\r\n\nthan that adopted by the district court.  \r\n\n     We begin with principles of statutory construction.  Where\r\n\nthe terms of a statute are clear, a court must give the words\r\n\ntheir plain and obvious meaning.  See Ellis v. Rhode Island\r                                                                     \r\n\nPublic Transit Authority, 586 A.2d 1055, 57 (R.I. 1991);\r                                  \r\n\nO'Connell v. Shalala, 79 F.3d 170, 176 (1st Cir. 1996) (courts\r                              \r\n\nare bound to give statutes a practical, commonsense reading).  \r\n\nFurthermore, a statute may not be construed in a manner that\r\n\nresults in absurdities or defeats its underlying purpose.  In re\r                                                                          \r\n\nFalstaff Brewing Corp., 637 A.2d 1047, 1050 (R.I. 1994).  As\r                                \r\n\nnoted, the statute explicitly includes municipal employees in the\r\n\ndefinition of \"public body\"; however, the boundaries of the\r\n\ndefinition of \"report\" are still unclear.  Therefore, we turn to\r\n\nRhode Island's sister states in search of further clarification.8\r\n\n     Similar whistleblowers' statutes are found in Massachusetts,\r\n\nMaine, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.  Of these, the Connecticut\r\n\nstatute bears the closest resemblance to the Rhode Island statute\r\n\nat hand, although it, too, has not been the focus of relevant\r\n\ncaselaw.9  Generally, these whistleblowers' statutes appear to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8    We look  first to those states within  our own circuit,\r\nand  then to the state  (Connecticut) with the  statute that most\r\nresembles the one at issue here.    \r\n\n     9    Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  Ann.      31-51m  (West   1987)(\"No\r\nemployer shall  discharge, discipline, or otherwise  penalize any\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nfall into two broad categories:  statutes like Rhode Island's and\r\n\nConnecticut's, which are broadly drafted, and do not explicitly\r\n\ninclude statements to an employee's supervisor within the rubric\r\n\nof reports to a public body, and more detailed statutes like\r\n\nthose of Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire.  The statutes in\r\n\nthis second category are considerably more complex than those of\r\n\nthe first type; these explicitly include statements to a\r\n\nsupervisor within protected behavior, and indeed, require it as a\r\n\npreliminary reporting step.10  Clearly, under this type of\r\n\nstatute, Marques' statements to Barlow would come under the\r\n\numbrella of protected actions.  Such is not as clearly the case\r\n\nhere, where we must deal with a more broadly drafted statute.  \r\n\n     Marques, confronted with a paucity of Rhode Island\r\n\nauthorities on this issue, points to two cases from other\r\n\njurisdictions dealing with whistleblowers to support his\r\n\nassertion that public policy supports a broad reading of the\r\n\nRhode Island Whistleblowers' Act.  Appeal of Bio Energy Corp.,\r                                                                       \r\n\n607 A.2d 606 (N.H. 1992), concerned an employee who was\r\n\nterminated after bringing to her supervisor's attention a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nemployee  because  the  employee  ...  reports,  verbally  or  in\r\nwriting, a violation  or a  suspected violation of  any state  or\r\nfederal  law   or  regulation  or  any   municipal  ordinance  or\r\nregulation to a public body ....\").  \r\n\n     10   See, e.g., N.H.

The court there found that the New Hampshire\r                     \r\n\nstatute, which mandates an initial report to a supervisor,\r\n\napplies to employees from the point of this initial report.  Id.\r                                                                          \r\n\nat 608-09.  The court noted the dual purposes of the New\r\n\nHampshire Act:  \"to encourage employees to come forward and\r\n\nreport violations without fear of losing their jobs and to ensure\r\n\nthat as many alleged violations as possible are resolved\r\n\ninformally within the workplace.\"  Id. at 609.  Similar purposes,\r                                                \r\n\nMarques argues, undergird the Rhode Island statute.  The city,\r\n\nhowever, distinguishes Bio Energy from our case on the grounds\r                                           \r\n\nthat the Rhode Island statute, unlike the New Hampshire one, does\r\n\nnot contain specific language including supervisors within the\r\n\ngroup to whom reports may be made, and that no intent to do so\r\n\nshould be inferred.  \r\n\n     Bechtel Construction Co. v. Labor Sec'y, 50 F.3d 926, 931-32\r                                                      \r\n\n(11th Cir. 1995), concerned an internal complaint made pursuant\r\n\nto the whistleblowers' provisions of the Energy Reorganization\r\n\nAct, rather than to a state whistleblowers' Act.  There, the\r\n\ncourt broadly construed the Act's terms (which prohibited\r\n\ndischarging or discriminating against employees who assisted with\r\n\nor participated in \"proceedings\") to encompass the actions of an\r\n\nemployee who called violations of procedures for handling\r\n\nradiation-contaminated tools at a nuclear power plant to the\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nattention of his supervisor.  Id. at 931-32.11  Marques argues\r                                           \r\n\nthat public policy counsels a similarly broad reading of the\r\n\nRhode Island statute.  The city, however, maintains that the\r\n\nEnergy Reorganization Act's inclusion of the \"catchall\" phrase\r\n\n\"or any other action\" at the end of the whistleblowers' section\r\n\nin question indicated an intent not present in the Rhode Island\r\n\nstatute to extend the protections afforded employees beyond\r\n\n\"proceedings\" to include internal complaints.  \r\n\n     As the whistleblowers' provisions at issue in Bechtel do not\r                                                                    \r\n\nmirror those at issue in this case, the comparison of the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Whistleblowers' Act to the Energy Reorganization Act,\r\n\nwhile informative, is not dispositive.  But, we take from both\r\n\nthis case and Bio Energy an important and applicable public\r                                  \r\n\npolicy consideration -- that employees should not be discouraged\r\n\nfrom reporting suspected violations initially to supervisors.  We\r\n\nsee no significant policy served by extending whistleblower\r\n\nprotection only to those who carry a complaint beyond the\r\n\ninstitutional wall, denying it to the employee who seeks to\r\n\nimprove operations from within the organization.  The latter\r\n\ncourse appears to us as more likely to lead to prompt resolution\r\n\nof issues related to suspected violations of laws or regulations.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11   The court partially based this finding on the fact that\r\nwhistleblowers' provisions in other regulations such as the Clean\r\nAir Act and  the Federal  Water Pollution Control  Act have  been\r\ndeemed  to include internal complaints.  Bechtel, 50 F.3d at 932.\r                                                          \r\nThe court  also noted that  deference is given  to administrative\r\ninterpretation of regulations under Chevron v. Natural  Resources\r                                                                           \r\nDefense Counsel, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984).\r                               \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n     We therefore conclude that a jury permissibly could find the\r\n\nRhode Island Whistleblowers' Act applicable to statements made by\r\n\nan employee to a supervisor concerning known or suspected\r\n\nviolations of the law.  The terms of the statute specifically\r\n\ndefine a \"public body\" as including \"[a]...city...governing\r\n\nbody...or any...employee thereof.\"  We do not read this language\r\n\nas covering all municipal employees, such as a co-worker, but as\r\n\nincluding a superior charged with carrying out the policies and\r\n\ndecisions of the city.  While the Act does not explicitly address\r\n\nstatements to supervisors, as do other states' whistleblowers'\r\n\nstatutes, the public policy behind these statutes is surely\r\n\nsimilar: to encourage the prompt reporting and early, amicable\r\n\nresolution of potentially dangerous workplace situations, and to\r\n\nprotect those employees who do report such violations from\r\n\nretaliatory action by employers.  \r\n\n     We do not, of course, hold that a verdict for Marques is\r\n\ntherefore mandated; the jury must decide whether the statements\r\n\nhe made fall under a more expansive reading of the statute than\r\n\nthat allowed by the district court, and then whether Marques was\r\n\nactually fired as a result of his statements to Barlow.  However,\r\n\nwe think that the question of whether Marques' statements bring\r\n\nhim within the protection of the Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act\r\n\nwas one for the jury, and not a proper subject for a directed\r\n\nverdict.  \r\n\n     Marques raised concerns about the project twice with Gammell\r\n\non December 22nd:  first, when he initially received the\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nassignment to work in the boat on Jones Pond, and then again, at\r\n\nthe Pond, where he fruitlessly asked Gammell for a life\r\n\npreserver.  Furthermore, Marques testified on direct examination\r\n\nthat on December 23rd, after the morning break, he told Barlow he\r\n\ndid not want to go back in the boat because he felt sick, that he\r\n\ndid not feel conditions in the pond were safe, and that he still\r\n\nhad not gotten a life preserver.  On cross examination, Marques\r\n\nagain testified that he had told Barlow he was not feeling well,\r\n\nthat he was not going back in the boat, and that during general\r\n\nconversation on the shore, he and others discussed the safety of\r\n\nthe project.  Moreover, as we have observed in note 2, supra, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nevidence of the depth of the pond was not so clear that Marques'\r\n\nfear was completely unfounded.  We do not feel that a reasoned\r\n\nfactfinder could have reached but one conclusion on the issue\r\n\nwhether these statements constituted a report of a violation\r\n\ncovered by the Rhode Island Act and whether Marques' termination\r\n\nwas the result of his statements.\r\n\n  Accordingly, we vacate the directed verdict on the Rhode Island\r\n\nWhistleblowers' Act claim and remand it for retrial.\r\n\nB.   Negligent/Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim\r                                                                           \r\n\n     Marques also appeals the district court's grant of a\r\n\ndirected verdict for the city on his claim that the city's\r\n\nactions either negligently or intentionally caused him emotional\r\n\ndistress.  Under Rhode Island law, a plaintiff, to succeed, must\r\n\nshow that 1) the defendant's conduct was intentional or in\r\n\nreckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ndistress, 2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous, 3) there was\r\n\na causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the\r\n\nemotional distress, and 4) the emotional distress in question was\r\n\nsevere.  See Champlin v. Washington Trust Co., 478 A.2d 985, 989\r                                                       \r\n\n(R.I. 1984) (adopting standard of Restatement (Second) of Torts  \r                                                                         \r\n\n46).  Additionally, Rhode Island requires a physical\r\n\nmanifestation of the emotional distress.  Id. at 990.  The\r                                                       \r\n\ndistrict court rejected this claim on the ground that the\r\n\nevidence presented was insufficient to warrant a finding that the\r\n\ncity's actions in terminating Marques were extreme and\r\n\noutrageous.12  We agree.  While being terminated several days shy\r\n\nof the end of his probation period may not have been pleasant for\r\n\nMarques, we do not believe that a jury would properly have found\r\n\non the evidence presented that the conduct of Barlow, Gammell,\r\n\nand Lemont was sufficient to make an \"average member of the\r\n\ncommunity ... exclaim 'Outrageous'.\"  Borden v. Paul Revere Life\r                                                                          \r\n\nIns.

Rhode Island Boating Law\r                                       \r\n\n     Finally, Marques appeals the directed verdict on the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Boating Laws claim.  \r\n\n     R.I. Gen. Laws   46-22-15 provides that \r\n\n     the owner of a vessel shall be liable for any injury or\r\n     damage occasioned by the negligent operation of the\r\n     vessel, whether the negligence consists of a violation\r\n     of the provisions of the statutes of this state, or\r\n     neglecting to observe such ordinary care and such\r\n     operation as the rules of the common law require.\r\n\n     This statute therefore requires \"negligent operation\" of a\r\n\nvessel and that a plaintiff's injuries be proximately caused by\r\n\nthis negligent operation.  Even were negligent operation of the\r\n\nboat in question to be found, as to which we express some doubt,\r\n\nthis claim would nevertheless founder on the proximate cause\r\n\nrequirement: the connection between Marques' injuries, including\r\n\nhis discharge and resulting alleged damages, and the city's\r\n\noperation of the boat on Jones Pond is too attenuated.  We\r\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's ruling on this claim too.  \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r\n\n     The Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act properly may be\r\n\nconstrued to encompass statements made by an employee to a\r\n\nsupervisor concerning known or suspected violations of the law. \r\n\nThis accords with the terms of the statute itself, and with the\r\n\npublic policies underlying this type of statute.  As a jury could\r\n\nhave inferred that Marques' statements to Barlow constituted such\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nWe find the facts of that  case as they related to the employer's\r\nactions clearly  distinguishable in nature and  degree from those\r\nalleged here.  \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n\"reports\" to a \"public body\" under this broader construction of\r\n\nthe statute, and that he was fired as a result of these\r\n\nstatements, we vacate the district court's directed verdict on\r\n\nthis claim.  However, we affirm the district court's judgments on\r\n\nthe negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress claim\r\n\nand on the violation of the Rhode Island Boating Safety Act\r\n\nclaim.  \r\n\nAffirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part.

This case  concerns several\r                                            \r\n\nclaims  brought  by  plaintiff-appellant,  Stephen   R.  Marques,\r\n\nagainst the city of  East Providence, Rhode Island, based  on his\r\n\ndischarge while a  probationary employee of  the city.   Marques,\r\n\nwho had refused to continue a work assignment on a boat at a city\r\n\npond  due  to  his   fear  of  capsizing  and  was   subsequently\r\n\nterminated, sued the city  under both state and federal  law; the\r\n\ncity  removed  the case  to federal  court.   The  district court\r\n\ngranted directed verdicts for the city on all claims.   We affirm\r\n\non two claims,  and vacate as to  Marques' claim under  the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Whistleblowers' Act.  \r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r\n\n     Marques was hired as a laborer by the city of East\r\n\nProvidence in June 1993.1  On December 22, 1993, several days\r\n\nbefore the expiration of his six-month probationary period,\r\n\nMarques was assigned to work at Jones Pond, cutting weeds in the\r\n\npond from an aluminum row boat.  Marques, who is unable to swim,\r\n\nexpressed some concerns about the assignment to Gregory Gammell\r\n\n(\"Gammell\"), the Superintendent of the Parks Department, but was\r\n\ntold by Gammell not to worry about it.  On his arrival at Jones\r\n\nPond, Marques noticed that there were no life preservers in the\r\n\nboat, and asked Gammell for one.  Gammell initially questioned\r\n\nMarques' need for the life preserver, but told him he would get\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    We  take the  facts  from the  pleadings  and from  the\r\ntestimony at trial.   See PHC, Inc. v. Pioneer  Healthcare, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712078\"><a href=\"/opinion/712078/phc-inc-v-pioneer-healthcare-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\none; however, this life preserver was not forthcoming.2  Marques\r\n\nnevertheless performed the assignment.\r\n\n     On the following day, December 23, 1993, Marques, who had\r\n\nagain been assigned to duty in the boat cutting reeds, told lead\r\n\nworker Robert Barlow (\"Barlow\") that he was nervous about working\r\n\nin the boat, that he would like a life preserver, and that he had\r\n\nasked for one on the prior day but not received it.  Barlow\r\n\nquestioned the need for a life preserver, given the depth of the\r\n\nwater, but said he would call Gammell.  Gammell arrived, but sans\r\n\nlife preserver, and subsequently left the site.  Marques\r\n\ntestified that he began to feel nauseous during the morning while\r\n\nworking on the boat, which he attributed to motion sickness.  At\r\n\nthe morning break, he therefore told Barlow that he wasn't going\r\n\nback in the boat because he was feeling sick.  Barlow indicated\r\n\nthat if Marques didn't return to the boat, Barlow would call\r\n\nGammell.  During subsequent general conversation between workers\r\n\nat the pond site about the safety of the project, Marques and\r\n\nothers expressed concerns about the lack of life preservers and\r\n\nother safety devices.  Gammell returned to the pond, and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    Testimony  was  presented by  city  witnesses  at trial\r\nindicating  that the depth of  Jones Pond varied  between two and\r\nfive  feet.  The Pond  was created artificially  by dredging, and\r\nmeasures  approximately  300 feet  by  250  feet, with  retaining\r\ncement walls.  We also note that Paul Lemont, the City Manager of\r\nEast Providence, who gave the original order for the work project\r\nat Jones Pond, testified that the weed cutting project could have\r\nbeen  performed by laborers in  a boat, as  actually occurred, or\r\nalternatively by laborers wearing boots.  \r\n          On the other hand, Marques testified  that at one point\r\nduring the December  23rd session, he  lost hold of  a five  foot\r\nrake he  was using; when he grabbed it, the rake was almost fully\r\nsubmerged in the water, and had not yet touched bottom.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ninstructed Marques and Barlow to get in his car.  On their\r\n\narrival at Gammell's office, Gammell instructed Marques to \"punch\r\n\nout\" and then terminated him.3  Marques did not discuss his\r\n\nsafety concerns with Gammell during the car trip or at his\r\n\ntermination.  Gammell informed Marques that he was being\r\n\nterminated because he wouldn't get back in the boat and because\r\n\nof his attitude.  \r\n\n     Marques subsequently met with City Manager Lemont to discuss\r\n\nhis firing.   At this meeting, Marques explained his concerns\r\n\nabout safety and his physical ills to Lemont; however, Lemont\r\n\nlater wrote Marques a letter informing him that the decision to\r\n\nterminate Marques would stand.\r\n\n     Shortly after his termination, Marques began experiencing\r\n\nphysical symptoms such as tightness in his chest and difficulty\r\n\nbreathing, which his physician attributed to situational anxiety\r\n\nbrought on by his firing.  His doctor prescribed medications and\r\n\ncounseling.  Marques also began experiencing marital\r\n\ndifficulties.  \r\n\n     Marques sued the city in state court, alleging violations of\r\n\na number of state statutes, including the Rhode Island\r\n\nWhistleblowers' Act, as well as federal claims including the\r\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.  He also claimed that the city's\r\n\nactions constituted negligent or intentional infliction of\r\n\nemotional distress, and that the city had violated the Rhode\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    During the probationary period, city employees could be\r\nfired for any reason,  with or without cause, and  also could not\r\nfile a grievance with the city regarding a discharge.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nIsland Regulation of Boats law.4  The city removed the case to\r\n\nfederal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.

We\r\n\ndeal first with the most significant claim.\r\n\nA.   Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act Claim\r                                                     \r\n\n     The Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act provides in relevant\r\n\npart that:\r\n\n          An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or\r\n     otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding\r\n     the employee's compensation, terms, location, or\r\n     privileges of employment\r\n          (1)  because the employee [...] reports or is\r\n     about to report to a public body, verbally or in\r\n     writing, a violation which the employee knows or\r\n     reasonably believes has occurred or is about to occur,\r\n     of a law or regulation, or rule promulgated under the\r\n     law of this state, a political subdivision of this\r\n     state, or the United States, unless the employee knows\r\n     or has reason to know that the report is false....6\r\n\nAccordingly, an employee must demonstrate that there was a causal\r\n\nconnection between the report and the termination.\r\n\n     The statute does not explicitly define what constitutes a\r\n\n\"report\" or \"reporting\" a suspected or known violation.  However,\r\n\nit does define \"public body\" as follows:\r\n\n          (4)  \"Public body\" means all of the\r\n     following:[...]\r\n          (iii) A county, city, town, or regional governing\r\n     body, a council, school district, or a board,\r\n     department, commission, agency, or any member or\r\n     employee thereof.7\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6    R.I. Gen. Laws   28-50-3(1) (1995).  The current  Rhode\r\nIsland Whistleblowers' Act was  enacted in 1995, and replaced  an\r\nearlier  version  of  the  Whistleblowers'  Act  that  carried  a\r\ndifferent  statutory  number, (R.I.  Gen. Laws    36-15-1  - 10);\r\nhowever, the terms of this section were unchanged.  \r\n\n     7    R.I. Gen. Laws   28-50-2(4)(iii) (1995).\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     The district court concluded that this statute is\r\n\ninapplicable in the circumstances of this case because Marques'\r\n\nstatements could not be construed as \"reports\" to a \"public\r\n\nbody.\"  The district court reasoned that the statute contemplates\r\n\na situation in which an employee reports or threatens to report a\r\n\nviolation of a law to a third party with jurisdiction over the\r\n\nviolation.  For the district court, Marques' statements were\r\n\nmerely explanations for his refusal to return to the boat, rather\r\n\nthan reports to an appropriate individual or body of known or\r\n\nsuspected violations.  \r\n\n     Marques argues on appeal that the district court gave an\r\n\noverly narrow interpretation to the statute's provisions.  He\r\n\nclaims that his statements to Barlow could fall within the\r\n\nstatute and that both caselaw (albeit from other jurisdictions)\r\n\nand public policy support his view.  The city, on the other hand,\r\n\ncontends that the district court properly construed the\r\n\nprovision; it maintains that Marques made no statements to Barlow\r\n\nor other supervisors that reasonably could be construed as\r\n\nreports of violations to a public body.  \r\n\n     Our task is complicated by the lack of guideposts.  There is\r\n\nno relevant legislative history indicating the intent of Rhode\r\n\nIsland lawmakers concerning the interpretation of these terms. \r\n\nFurthermore, Rhode Island courts have not directly interpreted\r\n\n\"report\" or \"public body\" under the statute.  We do, however,\r\n\nhave the statutory language, which must be construed consistently\r\n\nwith its purpose.  Our review of the language of the statute,\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ntogether with an examination of similar statutes from other\r\n\njurisdictions, with an eye to the public policy underlying such\r\n\nwhistleblowers' statutes, counsels a broader view of the statute\r\n\nthan that adopted by the district court.  \r\n\n     We begin with principles of statutory construction.  Where\r\n\nthe terms of a statute are clear, a court must give the words\r\n\ntheir plain and obvious meaning.  See Ellis v. Rhode Island\r                                                                     \r\n\nPublic Transit Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2316624\"><a href=\"/opinion/2316624/ellis-v-rhode-island-public-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (R.I. 1991);\r                                  \r\n\nO'Connell v.

As\r                                \r\n\nnoted, the statute explicitly includes municipal employees in the\r\n\ndefinition of \"public body\"; however, the boundaries of the\r\n\ndefinition of \"report\" are still unclear.  Therefore, we turn to\r\n\nRhode Island's sister states in search of further clarification.8\r\n\n     Similar whistleblowers' statutes are found in Massachusetts,\r\n\nMaine, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.  Of these, the Connecticut\r\n\nstatute bears the closest resemblance to the Rhode Island statute\r\n\nat hand, although it, too, has not been the focus of relevant\r\n\ncaselaw.9  Generally, these whistleblowers' statutes appear to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8    We look  first to those states within  our own circuit,\r\nand  then to the state  (Connecticut) with the  statute that most\r\nresembles the one at issue here.    \r\n\n     9    Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  Ann.      31-51m  (West   1987)(\"No\r\nemployer shall  discharge, discipline, or otherwise  penalize any\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nfall into two broad categories:  statutes like Rhode Island's and\r\n\nConnecticut's, which are broadly drafted, and do not explicitly\r\n\ninclude statements to an employee's supervisor within the rubric\r\n\nof reports to a public body, and more detailed statutes like\r\n\nthose of Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire.  The statutes in\r\n\nthis second category are considerably more complex than those of\r\n\nthe first type; these explicitly include statements to a\r\n\nsupervisor within protected behavior, and indeed, require it as a\r\n\npreliminary reporting step.10  Clearly, under this type of\r\n\nstatute, Marques' statements to Barlow would come under the\r\n\numbrella of protected actions.  Such is not as clearly the case\r\n\nhere, where we must deal with a more broadly drafted statute.  \r\n\n     Marques, confronted with a paucity of Rhode Island\r\n\nauthorities on this issue, points to two cases from other\r\n\njurisdictions dealing with whistleblowers to support his\r\n\nassertion that public policy supports a broad reading of the\r\n\nRhode Island Whistleblowers' Act.

There, the\r\n\ncourt broadly construed the Act's terms (which prohibited\r\n\ndischarging or discriminating against employees who assisted with\r\n\nor participated in \"proceedings\") to encompass the actions of an\r\n\nemployee who called violations of procedures for handling\r\n\nradiation-contaminated tools at a nuclear power plant to the\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nattention of his supervisor.

The city, however, maintains that the\r\n\nEnergy Reorganization Act's inclusion of the \"catchall\" phrase\r\n\n\"or any other action\" at the end of the whistleblowers' section\r\n\nin question indicated an intent not present in the Rhode Island\r\n\nstatute to extend the protections afforded employees beyond\r\n\n\"proceedings\" to include internal complaints.  \r\n\n     As the whistleblowers' provisions at issue in Bechtel do not\r                                                                    \r\n\nmirror those at issue in this case, the comparison of the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Whistleblowers' Act to the Energy Reorganization Act,\r\n\nwhile informative, is not dispositive.

We\r\n\nsee no significant policy served by extending whistleblower\r\n\nprotection only to those who carry a complaint beyond the\r\n\ninstitutional wall, denying it to the employee who seeks to\r\n\nimprove operations from within the organization.  The latter\r\n\ncourse appears to us as more likely to lead to prompt resolution\r\n\nof issues related to suspected violations of laws or regulations.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11   The court partially based this finding on the fact that\r\nwhistleblowers' provisions in other regulations such as the Clean\r\nAir Act and  the Federal  Water Pollution Control  Act have  been\r\ndeemed  to include internal complaints.

While the Act does not explicitly address\r\n\nstatements to supervisors, as do other states' whistleblowers'\r\n\nstatutes, the public policy behind these statutes is surely\r\n\nsimilar: to encourage the prompt reporting and early, amicable\r\n\nresolution of potentially dangerous workplace situations, and to\r\n\nprotect those employees who do report such violations from\r\n\nretaliatory action by employers.  \r\n\n     We do not, of course, hold that a verdict for Marques is\r\n\ntherefore mandated; the jury must decide whether the statements\r\n\nhe made fall under a more expansive reading of the statute than\r\n\nthat allowed by the district court, and then whether Marques was\r\n\nactually fired as a result of his statements to Barlow.  However,\r\n\nwe think that the question of whether Marques' statements bring\r\n\nhim within the protection of the Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act\r\n\nwas one for the jury, and not a proper subject for a directed\r\n\nverdict.  \r\n\n     Marques raised concerns about the project twice with Gammell\r\n\non December 22nd:  first, when he initially received the\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nassignment to work in the boat on Jones Pond, and then again, at\r\n\nthe Pond, where he fruitlessly asked Gammell for a life\r\n\npreserver.  Furthermore, Marques testified on direct examination\r\n\nthat on December 23rd, after the morning break, he told Barlow he\r\n\ndid not want to go back in the boat because he felt sick, that he\r\n\ndid not feel conditions in the pond were safe, and that he still\r\n\nhad not gotten a life preserver.  On cross examination, Marques\r\n\nagain testified that he had told Barlow he was not feeling well,\r\n\nthat he was not going back in the boat, and that during general\r\n\nconversation on the shore, he and others discussed the safety of\r\n\nthe project.  Moreover, as we have observed in note 2, supra, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nevidence of the depth of the pond was not so clear that Marques'\r\n\nfear was completely unfounded.  We do not feel that a reasoned\r\n\nfactfinder could have reached but one conclusion on the issue\r\n\nwhether these statements constituted a report of a violation\r\n\ncovered by the Rhode Island Act and whether Marques' termination\r\n\nwas the result of his statements.\r\n\n  Accordingly, we vacate the directed verdict on the Rhode Island\r\n\nWhistleblowers' Act claim and remand it for retrial.\r\n\nB.   Negligent/Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim\r                                                                           \r\n\n     Marques also appeals the district court's grant of a\r\n\ndirected verdict for the city on his claim that the city's\r\n\nactions either negligently or intentionally caused him emotional\r\n\ndistress.  Under Rhode Island law, a plaintiff, to succeed, must\r\n\nshow that 1) the defendant's conduct was intentional or in\r\n\nreckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ndistress, 2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous, 3) there was\r\n\na causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the\r\n\nemotional distress, and 4) the emotional distress in question was\r\n\nsevere.

While being terminated several days shy\r\n\nof the end of his probation period may not have been pleasant for\r\n\nMarques, we do not believe that a jury would properly have found\r\n\non the evidence presented that the conduct of Barlow, Gammell,\r\n\nand Lemont was sufficient to make an \"average member of the\r\n\ncommunity ... exclaim 'Outrageous'.\"  Borden v.

Rhode Island Boating Law\r                                       \r\n\n     Finally, Marques appeals the directed verdict on the Rhode\r\n\nIsland Boating Laws claim.  \r\n\n     R.I. Gen. Laws   46-22-15 provides that \r\n\n     the owner of a vessel shall be liable for any injury or\r\n     damage occasioned by the negligent operation of the\r\n     vessel, whether the negligence consists of a violation\r\n     of the provisions of the statutes of this state, or\r\n     neglecting to observe such ordinary care and such\r\n     operation as the rules of the common law require.\r\n\n     This statute therefore requires \"negligent operation\" of a\r\n\nvessel and that a plaintiff's injuries be proximately caused by\r\n\nthis negligent operation.  Even were negligent operation of the\r\n\nboat in question to be found, as to which we express some doubt,\r\n\nthis claim would nevertheless founder on the proximate cause\r\n\nrequirement: the connection between Marques' injuries, including\r\n\nhis discharge and resulting alleged damages, and the city's\r\n\noperation of the boat on Jones Pond is too attenuated.  We\r\n\ntherefore affirm the district court's ruling on this claim too.  \r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r\n\n     The Rhode Island Whistleblowers' Act properly may be\r\n\nconstrued to encompass statements made by an employee to a\r\n\nsupervisor concerning known or suspected violations of the law. \r\n\nThis accords with the terms of the statute itself, and with the\r\n\npublic policies underlying this type of statute.  As a jury could\r\n\nhave inferred that Marques' statements to Barlow constituted such\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nWe find the facts of that  case as they related to the employer's\r\nactions clearly  distinguishable in nature and  degree from those\r\nalleged here.  \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n\"reports\" to a \"public body\" under this broader construction of\r\n\nthe statute, and that he was fired as a result of these\r\n\nstatements, we vacate the district court's directed verdict on\r\n\nthis claim.  However, we affirm the district court's judgments on\r\n\nthe negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress claim\r\n\nand on the violation of the Rhode Island Boating Safety Act\r\n\nclaim.  \r\n\nAffirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part.
