Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Susan E. Taylor on brief for appellant.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney,     and    Michael\nRicciuti,   Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion    for    Summary\nDisposition for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         May 10, 2001\n\f              Per     Curiam.      Ramon    Oliveras    appeals    from   his\n\nsentence on the ground that the district court erred in\n\nenhancing his base offense level for obstruction of justice\n\nunder       section    3C1.1     of   the    United    States     Sentencing\n\nGuidelines (U.S.S.G.) and in failing to grant his request\n\nfor    a    downward    departure     from   the   guideline      sentencing\n\nrange, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3.                   The government has\n\nfiled a Motion for Summary Disposition, pursuant to Loc. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n              I. Obstruction of Justice\n\n              Oliveras received a two-level enhancement to his\n\nbase       offense    level     pursuant    to   U.S.S.G.   §   3C1.1,    for\n\nwillfully obstructing justice by “providing materially false\n\ninformation to a judge or magistrate.” § 3C1.1, comment.\n\n(n.4(f)).      The defendant admits that he misinformed Pretrial\n\nServices about his name and his place of birth and that he\n\nconfirmed such misinformation at his bail hearing before a\n\nmagistrate judge.         Such conduct has been held by this court\n\nto constitute obstruction of justice within the meaning of\n\n§ 3C1.1. See United States v. Thomas, 86 F.3d 263, 264 (1st\n\nCir. 1996); United States v. Biyaga, 9 F.3d 204, 206 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\f           Oliveras now argues that the district court erred\n\nby granting the enhancement without making a factual finding\n\nthat Oliveras acted willfully.            As the willfulness argument\n\nwas not made below, we will apply the plain error standard\n\nof review. See United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263,\n\n272 (1st Cir. 2001).    This court has not decided “whether [a]\n\nspecific intent requirement should be superimposed on the\n\nexplicit   examples    given      in     the   guideline   commentary.”\n\nThomas, 86 F.3d at 264.       Even if such a requirement exists,\n\nhowever, this court has stated that it “do[es] not demand\n\nthat judges, when explaining the bases for their rulings,\n\n‘be precise to the point of pedantry.’” Id.\n\n           Viewed in context, the district court’s finding\n\nthat   “what   Mr.   Diaz   did    did    constitute    obstruction   of\n\njustice,” implicitly included a finding that Oliveras acted\n\n“willfully.” See United States v. Mafanya, 24 F.3d 412, 415\n\n(2d Cir. 1994)(reasoning that “[c]ommon sense suggests that\n\nthe reason appellant sought to conceal his true identity on\n\nJuly 9, and thus his criminal record, from the magistrate\n\njudge was appellant’s hope of being released on bail”).               In\n\nthe absence of any alternative explanation or motive for\n\ndefendant’s     admittedly        false    statements      to   Pretrial\n\nServices, the district court’s enhancement of Oliveras’ base\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\foffense level for willful obstruction of justice does not\n\nconstitute plain error.\n\n           II. Denial of Downward Departure\n\n           Oliveras argues that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing    to   grant      him   a   downward     departure     from    the\n\nguideline sentencing range, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3,\n\nbecause his criminal history category over-represented the\n\nseriousness      of   his   criminal        history.      “Generally,     an\n\nappellate court lacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing\n\ncourt’s    discretionary      decision       not   to   depart   below   the\n\nguideline sentencing range.            An exception to this general\n\nrule applies when the sentencing court’s decision not to\n\ndepart is based upon its belief that it lacks the authority\n\nor power to depart.” United States v. Mangos, 134 F.3d 460,\n\n465 (1st Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).\n\n           The exception does not apply here.              Nothing in the\n\nrecord indicates that the district court believed it lacked\n\nauthority to depart downward in this case.                   Instead, the\n\nrecord indicates that the district court understood that it\n\nhad authority to depart pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, but\n\nthat it exercised its discretion in declining to make such\n\na departure.     We lack jurisdiction to review this claim. See\n\nUnited States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 40 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           The government’s Motion for Summary Disposition is\n\ngranted.   Oliveras’ sentence is affirmed.
