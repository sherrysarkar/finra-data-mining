Betancourt-Lebron, 68 F.3d 1, 2 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).    The district court dismissed the complaint without\n\nprejudice, as premature under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477\n\n(1994).    We have considered the parties' briefs and the\n\nrecord on appeal.     We affirm, essentially for the reasons\n\nstated in the district court's Memorandum and Order, dated\n\nSeptember 11, 2000.\n\n           On appeal, Jackson refocuses his claim specifically\n\nto the 28 day period between his detention on the armed\n\nrobbery warrant (January 2, 1997) and the grant of his new\n\ntrial motion on the receiving stolen property conviction\n\n(January 30, 1997).      This newly emergent argument was not\n\nmade to the district court below and, therefore, is waived.\n\nSee United States v.
