Upon  careful  review of  the  briefs and\r                           \r\n\nrecord,  we  conclude that  petitioner's     2255 motion  was\r\n\nproperly  dismissed without  a  hearing, essentially  for the\r\n\nreasons  stated by  the district  court.   We add  only these\r\n\ncomments.\r\n\n     1.   We will not consider petitioner's claim, raised for\r\n\nthe first time on appeal, that his attorney had a conflict of\r\n\ninterest.

The district court was not required to give further\r\n\nconsideration   to  the   affidavit  purporting   to  absolve\r\n\npetitioner of  all involvement  in the  crime.   The district\r\n\ncourt correctly  followed this  court's prior ruling  on that\r\n\npoint.  See United  States v.
