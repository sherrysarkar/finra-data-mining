This appeal requires us to\n\ndetermine, for the first time, the extent to which a prospective\n\nwitness's silence after receiving Miranda warnings can be used\n\nas impeachment evidence.             Finding no error in the district\n\ncourt's exclusion of this evidence or in either of the other\n\nrulings    challenged       on    appeal,      we   affirm     the    judgment     of\n\nconviction.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n            The parties, ably represented, have provided us with\n\nan exegetic account of the events leading to the appellant's\n\nindictment.         The   issues    before      us,   however,       are    context-\n\nspecific.    Thus, an apothegmatic summary suffices to place them\n\ninto perspective.         We add more details, as the occasion demands,\n\nin connection with our subsequent discussion of the points on\n\nappeal.\n\n            The evidence showed (or so the jury could have found)\n\nthat defendant-appellant Marc A. Zaccaria contrived a scheme to\n\ncounterfeit United States currency through the use of a state-\n\nof-the-art color copier.            The phony bills were high-quality;\n\nthey     contained,       inter    alia,       replicas      of      the    Treasury\n\nDepartment's latest security strip and a protective coating\n\ndesigned     to     frustrate      the   most       commonly      used     test   for\n\nauthenticity.       The appellant moved the copying operation from\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\flocation       to     location,     and     dealt     with    several      different\n\nindividuals (many of them acquaintances from his days in the\n\nautomobile business) in his endeavor to bring the scheme to a\n\nlucrative climax.\n\n               It is said that all good things come to an end.                 So it\n\nwas   here:         the   Secret    Service      eventually    got   wind    of   the\n\nappellant's nefarious activities. Its ensuing investigation was\n\naided by a number of people who were involved with the appellant\n\nand/or the scheme in one way or another.                  Of this rather motley\n\ncrew,    two    individuals        (both   of     whom   testified   against      the\n\nappellant at trial) are particularly important to the instant\n\nappeal.\n\n               The first, Joseph Morsilli, Sr., helped the appellant\n\nto start his \"copy business.\"                 Morsilli insisted that he had\n\nrelied    on    the    appellant's     representation         that   the    proposed\n\nventure was entirely legitimate.                 The second witness, Ted Blume,\n\nwas close to the appellant and to various other persons who\n\ntestified for, or gave information to, the government.                        Among\n\nBlume's intimates were individuals who the appellant alleged\n\nwere attempting to frame him.\n\n               We shall return to Morsilli and Blume shortly.                     For\n\nnow, we note that, after a six-day trial, the jury found the\n\nappellant guilty of conspiracy to pass counterfeit monetary\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\finstruments, sale of such instruments, and possession of a\n\ncounterfeiting deterrent (the security strips).                  See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 371, 472, 474A(b).              The trial court imposed a forty-eight\n\nmonth incarcerative sentence, to be followed by a five-year\n\nsupervised release term.             This appeal ensued.\n\n\n\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n              On appeal, Zaccaria complains of three evidentiary\n\nrulings.          He claims that each of these rulings was as bogus as\n\nthe bills that the government offered in evidence at his trial.\n\nHe also claims that each ruling constituted reversible error.\n\n              We apply a familiar standard of review.              Every trial\n\npresents a blend of idiosyncratic circumstances, and presiding\n\njudges      must     be   afforded   some   leeway   in   making   evidentiary\n\nrulings.          For the most part, therefore, a district court's\n\nrulings admitting or excluding evidence are evaluated for abuse\n\nof discretion.            E.g., United States v. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d\n\n548, 559 (1st Cir. 1999); Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 20\n\n(1st       Cir.    1999).     We   use   this   benchmark   in   assaying   the\n\nappellant's asseverational array.1\n\n\n       1\n     The government posits that the appropriate standard of\nreview on some or all of these claims is plain error because the\nappellant's arguments were not properly preserved in the trial\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                                   A.\n\n           We deal first with the implications of a witness's\n\ninvocation of his right to remain silent.              The background facts\n\nare these.    In July 1996, Morsilli went to the Secret Service's\n\nProvidence    office   to   provide     fingerprints         and   handwriting\n\nexemplars in compliance with a grand jury subpoena.                        While\n\nthere, he apparently received Miranda warnings, see Miranda v.\n\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966), and thereafter eschewed any\n\nfurther discussion with federal agents.2\n\n           Morsilli    testified      for   the    prosecution        at     the\n\nappellant's   trial,   portraying     himself     as    an    innocent     dupe.\n\nDuring cross-examination, the appellant sought to discredit this\n\ntestimony by showing that Morsilli had declined to speak with\n\nthe agents after having been advised of his constitutional\n\nrights.   The district court sustained the government's objection\n\n\n\n\ncourt.   In this case, however, a more stringent standard of\nreview would not affect our ultimate conclusion.      Thus, we\nassume, favorably to the appellant, that all the issues raised\non appeal were duly preserved.\n    2 We say \"apparently\" because the appellant's claim to that\neffect hinges on a somewhat cryptic note in the agency's case\nfile. The note, purportedly written by an unidentified Secret\nService agent, was vague as to what rights were invoked, when\nthose rights were cited, and whether the note pertained to\nMorsilli, or to his son (who also was summoned to the office\nbecause of his suspected involvement with the appellant), or to\nboth.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fto this line of questioning.           Zaccaria assigns error to this\n\nruling.\n\n           In the appellant's view, Morsilli's invocation of his\n\nright to remain silent during the interview with the Secret\n\nService implies guilt — specifically, his participation in the\n\ncounterfeiting scheme — thus contradicting his trial testimony\n\nand providing fertile ground for impeachment.         This argument for\n\nthe use of silence to impeach has a patina of plausibility, but\n\nit does not withstand close scrutiny.\n\n           We begin our analysis by emphasizing that the issue\n\nbefore us is evidentiary, not constitutional.           The law is now\n\nfirmly settled that an accused's invocation of the right to\n\nremain    silent   is   constitutionally    protected   and   ordinarily\n\ncannot be used against him for impeachment or otherwise as\n\nevidence of guilt.      Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 617-19 (1976);\n\nUnited States v. Daoud, 741 F.2d 478, 480 (1st Cir. 1984).            The\n\nappellant,    however,    does   not    seek   to   impinge   upon   this\n\nconstitutional bulwark.      He points out, correctly, that Morsilli\n\nappeared as a witness, not as a defendant, and argues that the\n\nConstitution therefore interposes no impediment to the proposed\n\nline of cross-examination.        This is a meaningful distinction\n\nand, to its credit, the government concedes the point.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            There    is,        however,       an    evidentiary        dimension       (in\n\naddition to a constitutional dimension) to an invocation of the\n\nright to remain silent.                  The Supreme Court dealt with this\n\nevidentiary dimension in United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171\n\n(1975).      That     case       involved       an    inquiry         into   a    criminal\n\ndefendant's silence at the time of questioning — but the case\n\nwas     decided     the        year    before       the     Doyle      Court      extended\n\nconstitutional protection to a defendant's decision to remain\n\nsilent after receiving advice about his rights.                              Because the\n\nCourt treated the question as a matter of evidence, as must we,\n\nHale affords relevant guidance.\n\n            The Hale Court noted that the admissibility of this\n\nsort of disputed evidence necessarily hinges on the validity of\n\nthe   premise     that         silence    in    the       face   of    questioning       is\n\ninconsistent with — and thus impeaches — a later claim of\n\ninnocence.      Id. at 176.           The Court remarked the dubiousness of\n\nthat premise, stating that \"[i]n most circumstances silence is\n\nso ambiguous that it is of little probative force.\"                               Id.   The\n\nCourt    proceeded        to    mine     the   record       in   search      of    special\n\ncircumstances       that         might     have       rendered         Hale's      silence\n\ninconsistent with a subsequent claim of innocence, and found\n\nnone.     Id. at 177-80.              As a result, the Court concluded that\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fHale's invocation of the right to remain silent had virtually no\n\nprobative value as an inconsistent statement.           Id. at 180.\n\n          The Hale Court then turned to the other pan of the\n\nscales.   Balancing against the lack of probativeness, the Court\n\nfound a substantial likelihood of unfair prejudice should the\n\nshowing of silence be allowed.        \"The danger is that the jury is\n\nlikely to assign much more weight to the defendant's previous\n\nsilence than is warranted.\"        Id.    The resulting combination —\n\nscant probative value and a significant risk of unfair prejudice\n\n— proved deadly:       the Court concluded that information about\n\nHale's invocation of his right to remain silent should not have\n\nbeen allowed into evidence as a means of impeachment.               Id. at\n\n180-81.\n\n          The   same    analytic    framework   pertains   here.3      The\n\nadmissibility   vel    non   of   evidence   anent   Morsilli's    silence\n\ndepends on constructing a balance involving the probative worth\n\nof the evidence and its unfairly prejudicial effect.              See Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403.   Hale teaches that the trial court must start this\n\ntask from a binary premise:        (1) that silence per se generally\n\n\n\n    3There are, of course, potential differences in the\nevidentiary considerations that pertain to a criminal defendant,\non the one hand, and an ordinary witness for the government, on\nthe other hand. While these differences might be important in\nsome circumstances, this case, on the whole, seems a fair\ncongener to Hale.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fhas little or no probative value for impeachment purposes, 422\n\nU.S. at 176; and (2) that evidence of the invocation of the\n\nright to remain silent is inherently prejudicial, id. at 180.\n\nThus, a proffer of such evidence should be rejected unless\n\nspecial circumstances exist in a given case that materially\n\nshift the balance in favor of admissibility.\n\n                 In this instance, the district court understood its\n\nrole       and   methodically   constructed   the   appropriate   balance.\n\nSurveying the record, it found no extraordinary circumstances\n\nand, hence, no basis for making an exception to the usual rule.\n\nWe agree with this determination.           On the facts of this case, as\n\nin Hale, 422 U.S. at 176-80, Morsilli's silence was completely\n\nambiguous.         The appellant does not identify, nor can we discern,\n\nany special trappings that might imbue Morsilli's silence with\n\nunaccustomed probative force.4        Moreover, the appellant does not\n\nseriously dispute that the proffered evidence was freighted with\n\npotential prejudice; there was, after all, a real danger that\n\nthe jury would read considerably more into the witness's close-\n\nmouthedness than reason might warrant.\n\n\n\n       4\n      In this respect, the case at hand is unlike United States\nv. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501 (1st Cir. 1977). There, we found Hale\nnot controlling because the defendant had waived his right to\nsilence and, later, failed to answer questions. Id. at 504. In\nthat context, the defendant's refusal had appreciable probative\nvalue. Id.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            That ends this aspect of the appeal. With Morsilli's\n\nsilence not significantly probative, the likelihood of unfair\n\nprejudice      looming    large,       and    a   record    devoid     of   special\n\ncircumstances,      the   lower    court       plainly     did   not   misuse   its\n\ndiscretion in excluding the proposed line of questioning.                       See\n\nHale, 422 U.S. at 176-81; cf. Grunewald v. United States, 353\n\nU.S. 391, 423-24 (1957) (holding, on evidentiary grounds, that\n\ninquiries regarding an accused's invocation of his privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination when testifying before a grand jury\n\nshould not have been admitted for impeachment purposes).\n\n                                         B.\n\n            We proceed to the appellant's next ground for appeal.\n\nDuring the trial, his counsel sought to question the lead Secret\n\nService agent, Peimer, concerning the administration of (or\n\nfailure to administer) polygraph tests to certain potential\n\nwitnesses.      In launching this initiative, counsel forswore any\n\ninterest in the test results or in the techniques employed in\n\nadministering the tests.           Instead, he explained that he wanted\n\nto pursue whether polygraphs were used as a tool in the course\n\nof   this     investigation,      to    whom      they    were   offered,     which\n\nwitnesses agreed to take them, and which did not.                      Zaccaria's\n\nappellate counsel channels this offer of proof, suggesting that\n\nthis   line    of   inquiry    was      designed     to    probe     \"whether   the\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fgovernment   agents     may    have   ignored   their       own   investigation\n\nmethods to protect their witnesses, or whether the government\n\nfelt that the witnesses were being evasive.\"                Appellant's Brief\n\nat 23.\n\n          The district court found the proposed inquiry wholly\n\nirrelevant, potentially confusing, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nConsequently, it sustained the government's objection.                     Having\n\nconsidered both the ruling and the appellant's claim of error,\n\nwe conclude that the court properly pretermitted the anticipated\n\nline of questioning.\n\n          We begin with bedrock.             The right to cross-examine\n\nadverse   witnesses      in    criminal      cases    is     constitutionally\n\nprotected,   and      courts     historically        have     given      criminal\n\ndefendants   considerable        latitude     in     pursuing     that     right.\n\nNevertheless, cross-examination is not a freestyle exercise,\n\nbut,   rather,   must    be    conducted     within     reasonable        limits.\n\nDelaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986); United States\n\nv. Chaudhry, 850 F.2d 851, 856 (1st Cir. 1988).                          Suitable\n\nboundaries can and should be set by the trial judge.                       As we\n\nwrote on an earlier occasion:\n\n          Defendants cannot run roughshod, doing\n          precisely as they please simply because\n          cross-examination is underway. So long as a\n          reasonably complete picture of the witness'\n          veracity, bias, and motivation is developed,\n          the judge enjoys power and discretion to set\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            appropriate boundaries.   Indeed, the judge\n            has a responsibility to do so.\n\nUnited States v.        Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(citations    omitted).        We    follow     the    Boylan    approach      here,\n\nmindful   that    the    lower      court,    on   the    whole,      treated    the\n\nappellant's wide-ranging cross-examination of Peimer and other\n\ngovernment witnesses very hospitably.\n\n            One border that constrains cross-examination involves\n\nthe question of whether a particular piece of proof is too\n\nremote or peripheral, vis-à-vis the issues in the case, to be\n\nadmitted into evidence.          By and large, the responsibility for\n\npatrolling that border reposes with, and is subject to the sound\n\ndiscretion of, the trial judge.              See Averitt v. Southland Motor\n\nInn, 720 F.2d 1178, 1182 (10th Cir. 1983); Hill v. Rolleri, 615\n\nF.2d 886, 891 (9th Cir. 1980).           The \"polygraph\" questioning is\n\nof that genre:          its relevance to the appellant's guilt or\n\ninnocence is so tenuous as to place it                    at    the   margins    of\n\nallowable    cross-examination          (and,      therefore,         within     the\n\ndiscretion of the presider to admit or exclude).\n\n            The appellant claims that the appearance of remoteness\n\nis   deceiving.         He   argues     poignantly        that     the   proposed\n\ninterrogation was designed to show that the government was\n\nsomehow playing fast and loose (say, by unfairly protecting its\n\nwitnesses,    currying       favor    with     them,     or    tolerating      their\n\n                                      -13-\n\fevasiveness).       But that surmise requires much too attenuated a\n\nchain of inference.         For example, the fact that polygraph tests\n\nultimately were not administered could be attributable to any\n\nnumber of reasons (e.g., administrative oversight, lack of time,\n\nlack of resources, the personal proclivities of a specific\n\nagent, knowledge that the test results would be inadmissible at\n\ntrial, and so on and so forth).                Many (perhaps most) of these\n\npossible reasons have no bearing either on the government's bona\n\nfides or on the issues in this case.                         In the absence of a\n\nparticularized      showing      that    the    government          was   not   turning\n\nsquare   corners,     the     district        court    acted     well      within       its\n\ndiscretion    in    refusing     to     let    defense       counsel      embark       on    a\n\nfishing expedition.         See Bui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 244 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n           The lower court's exclusionary ruling is made all the\n\nmore invulnerable by the subject matter of the proposed inquiry.\n\nTestimony about the government's non-administration of polygraph\n\nexaminations       would    be   apt    to     spark    an     unwarranted         —    and\n\nprofoundly    prejudicial        —    inference       that    the    Secret     Service\n\nagents believed the test results would be harmful to their\n\ncause.   Cf. Wolfel v. Holbrook, 823 F.2d 970, 974-75 (6th Cir.\n\n1987)    (excluding        evidence     of     an     individual's         refusal          to\n\nvolunteer for polygraph testing because such evidence would be\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f\"likely    to    create    a   highly    prejudicial         inference    that   the\n\nresults    of    the    test   would    have     been      unfavorable\").        The\n\nsubstantial likelihood of unfair prejudice associated with this\n\nline of questioning, combined with the speculative nature of the\n\nappellant's      bias   theory,    convinces      us       that    foreclosing   the\n\ninquiry entailed no abuse of discretion.                   See Williams v. Drake,\n\n146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Trial courts have significant\n\nleeway in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence under\n\nthe aegis of Rule 403.\").\n\n\n\n                                         C.\n\n            The appellant's last sortie involves a question on\n\ncross-examination         concerning     whether       a    government     witness,\n\nBlume,    had    ever   sold   drugs     with    Adamo      (another     government\n\nwitness).       Blume replied in the negative, but the prosecutor\n\nnonetheless       objected.       The    district          court    sustained    the\n\nobjection.       The appellant assigns error.               We discern none.\n\n            As    previously      noted,        cross-examiners         cannot    be\n\npermitted to rove at will.               One salubrious limitation that\n\ncourts have developed holds that a party who seeks to cross-\n\nexamine a witness for the purpose of impeaching his credibility\n\ncannot base his queries solely on hunch or innuendo.                       See Bui,\n\n170 F.3d at 243-44; United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1010\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f(1st Cir. 1993).        The appellant's attempt to cross-examine Blume\n\nabout his supposed drug dealing transgressed this principle\n\nbecause    the     questioning            lacked    a   satisfactory            evidentiary\n\nfoundation.       We explain briefly.\n\n            When       the    government          objected      to    the       appellant's\n\nquestion, Judge Lisi asked defense counsel to identify a factual\n\nbasis     for    it.         All    that     counsel      had    to       offer     was     an\n\nunsubstantiated claim that the appellant (who did not plan to\n\ntestify or submit an affidavit) had told him that Blume had\n\nadmitted    participating           in     drug    trafficking        activities          with\n\nAdamo.     Judge Lisi was understandably skeptical.                         She demanded\n\nsome sort of evidentiary corroboration, stating that \"I'm going\n\nto want to see something from your client.                            Until then, the\n\nobjection is sustained.\"             The appellant made no further proffer.\n\n            The    stated          basis     for    the   question          —     counsel's\n\nsecondhand      assertion          that    Blume    had   made       an     admission       to\n\nZaccaria — was too porous to support the weight of so charged a\n\nline of cross-examination.                 As a fundamental proposition, some\n\nproof in the form of concrete facts must underlie any offering\n\nthat can be accepted by a trial court as evidence.                               Cf. 1 John\n\nHenry Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence § 1 (Peter Tillers ed., 1983)\n\n(noting that \"[e]vidence . . . is any matter of fact that is\n\nfurnished to a legal tribunal otherwise than by reasoning or a\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\freference to what is noticed without proof\").      There is little\n\nlaw on the exact dimensions of what constitutes a satisfactory\n\nevidentiary foundation in any given instance.      Thus, the answer\n\ntends to be case-specific.5\n\n          While this standard is difficult to articulate and\n\napply in close cases, it is self-executing at the margins.       This\n\nis such a situation.    The appellant offered no evidence whatever\n\nthat Blume had ever dealt drugs (with Adamo or anyone else).\n\nThis, then, is the paradigmatic example of which Professor\n\nWigmore   warns:        that   on   cross-examination   \"facts     of\n\ndiscreditable conduct [may be] groundlessly asked about in the\n\nhope that though denied they will be assumed by the jury to be\n\nwell founded.\"     1 Wigmore, supra, § 17.   In such circumstances,\n\na firm judicial hand is the best safeguard of the fairness of\n\nthe trial process.\n\n\n    5Our ruling in Bui is instructive. There, the petitioner\nclaimed that he was being framed by a drug lord. 170 F.3d at\n243.   To develop this theory, he sought to cross-examine a\ngovernment witness as to whether the witness knew that he (the\npetitioner) had declined to transport contraband for the drug\nlord. Id. This, the petitioner hoped, would lead the jury to\nconclude that the rebuffed drug lord framed him as retribution\nfor his lack of cooperation.    Id.  We found the petitioner's\nproffer in support of this proposed line of cross-examination\nunacceptable because \"to that point in the trial, there had been\nno evidence even remotely supporting the petitioner's offer of\nproof.\" Id. Given such an \"exiguous record,\" the petitioner\ncould not rewardingly cite himself as the source of the\nfoundational facts — at least in the absence of sworn testimony\nor an affidavit. Id. at 243-44.\n\n                                -17-\n\f            To   say     more    on    this   point    would   serve     no    useful\n\npurpose.     Given       the    complete      lack    of   undergirding       factual\n\nsupport for the appellant's question, it cannot reasonably be\n\nsaid that the trial judge abused her discretion in refusing to\n\nallow further inquiry into the matter of drug trafficking.                        See\n\nBui, 170 F.3d at 243-44; Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.\n\n            In    all    events,       there    is     another,    independently\n\nsufficient reason for rejecting this assignment of error:                       Blume\n\nanswered the question and the district court did not strike his\n\nnegative response.        His denial was, therefore, before the jury.\n\nE.g., United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d 414, 419-20 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (holding that testimony not stricken from the record may\n\nbe regarded by the jury as evidence, notwithstanding parties'\n\nmutual, but mistaken, assumption that the court had stricken\n\nit); Tanner v. United States, 401 F.2d 281, 290-92 (8th Cir.\n\n1968) (explaining, in analogous circumstances, that testimony\n\nnot stricken \"remained before the jury for [its] consideration\"\n\ndespite the sustaining of the opponent's objection).                      In light\n\nof Blume's disclaimer, nothing would have been gained from\n\nfurther questioning.             See Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) (barring the\n\nintroduction of extrinsic evidence for impeachment on collateral\n\nmatters).        Thus,    even    if    the   district     court   had    erred    in\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fsustaining the objection — and we do not believe that it did —\n\nthe error would have been harmless.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n              We need go no further.       The appellant has failed to\n\nshow   that    the   district   court   abused   its   discretion   in   the\n\nexclusion of evidence.          For aught that appears, the appellant\n\nwas fairly tried.       In other words, his conviction is authentic,\n\nnot counterfeit.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f",

Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge][Copyrighted Material Omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Edward J. Romano, by appointment of the court, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Richard W. Rose, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Circuit Judge, Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge, and Lipez, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal requires us to determine, for the first time, the extent to which a prospective witness's silence after receiving Miranda warnings can be used as impeachment evidence. Finding no error in the district court's exclusion of this evidence or in either of the other rulings challenged on appeal, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties, ably represented, have provided us with an exegetic account of the events leading to the appellant's indictment. The issues before us, however, are context-specific. Thus, an apothegmatic summary suffices to place them into perspective. We add more details, as the occasion demands, in connection with our subsequent discussion of the points on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence showed (or so the jury could have found) that defendant-appellant Marc A. Zaccaria contrived a scheme to counterfeit United States currency through the use of a state-of-the-art color copier. The phony bills were high-quality; they contained, inter alia, replicas of the Treasury Department's latest security strip and a protective coating designed to frustrate the most commonly used test for authenticity. The appellant moved the copying operation from location to location, and dealt with several different individuals (many of them acquaintances from his days in the automobile business) in his endeavor to bring the scheme to a lucrative climax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is said that all good things come to an end. So it was here: the Secret Service eventually got wind of the appellant's nefarious activities. Its ensuing investigation was aided by a number of people who were involved with the appellant and/or the scheme in one way or another. Of this rather motley crew, two individuals (both of whom testified against the appellant at trial) are particularly important to the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first, Joseph Morsilli, Sr., helped the appellant to start his \"copy business.\" Morsilli insisted that he had relied on the appellant's representation that the proposed venture was entirely legitimate. The second witness, Ted Blume, was close to the appellant and to various other persons who testified for, or gave information to, the government. Among Blume's intimates were individuals who the appellant alleged were attempting to frame him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We shall return to Morsilli and Blume shortly. For now, we note that, after a six-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty of conspiracy to pass counterfeit monetary instruments, sale of such instruments, and possession of a counterfeiting deterrent (the security strips). See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 472, 474A(b). The trial court imposed a forty-eight month incarcerative sentence, to be followed by a five-year supervised release term. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Zaccaria complains of three evidentiary rulings. He claims that each of these rulings was as bogus as the bills that the government offered in evidence at his trial. He also claims that each ruling constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We apply a familiar standard of review. Every trial presents a blend of idiosyncratic circumstances, and presiding judges must be afforded some leeway in making evidentiary rulings. For the most part, therefore, a district court's rulings admitting or excluding evidence are evaluated for abuse of discretion. E.g., United States v. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 559 (1st Cir. 1999); Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 1999). We use this benchmark in assaying the appellant's asseverational array.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal first with the implications of a witness's invocation of his right to remain silent. The background facts are these. In July 1996, Morsilli went to the Secret Service's Providence office to provide fingerprints and handwriting exemplars in compliance with a grand jury subpoena. While there, he apparently received Miranda warnings, see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966), and thereafter eschewed any further discussion with federal agents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morsilli testified for the prosecution at the appellant's trial, portraying himself as an innocent dupe. During cross-examination, the appellant sought to discredit this testimony by showing that Morsilli had declined to speak with the agents after having been advised of his constitutional rights. The district court sustained the government's objection to this line of questioning. Zaccaria assigns error to this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the appellant's view, Morsilli's invocation of his right to remain silent during the interview with the Secret Service implies guilt -- specifically, his participation in the counterfeiting scheme -- thus contradicting his trial testimony and providing fertile ground for impeachment. This argument for the use of silence to impeach has a patina of plausibility, but it does not withstand close scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by emphasizing that the issue before us is evidentiary, not constitutional. The law is now firmly settled that an accused's invocation of the right to remain silent is constitutionally protected and ordinarily cannot be used against him for impeachment or otherwise as evidence of guilt. Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 617-19 (1976); United States v. Daoud, 741 F.2d 478, 480 (1st Cir. 1984). The appellant, however, does not seek to impinge upon this constitutional bulwark. He points out, correctly, that Morsilli appeared as a witness, not as a defendant, and argues that the Constitution therefore interposes no impediment to the proposed line of cross-examination. This is a meaningful distinction and, to its credit, the government concedes the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, an evidentiary dimension (in addition to a constitutional dimension) to an invocation of the right to remain silent. The Supreme Court dealt with this evidentiary dimension in United States v. Hale, 422 U.S. 171 (1975). That case involved an inquiry into a criminal defendant's silence at the time of questioning -- but the case was decided the year before the Doyle Court extended constitutional protection to a defendant's decision to remain silent after receiving advice about his rights. Because the Court treated the question as a matter of evidence, as must we, Hale affords relevant guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hale Court noted that the admissibility of this sort of disputed evidence necessarily hinges on the validity of the premise that silence in the face of questioning is inconsistent with -- and thus impeaches -- a later claim of innocence. Id. at 176. The Court remarked the dubiousness of that premise, stating that \"[i]n most circumstances silence is so ambiguous that it is of little probative force.\" Id. The Court proceeded to mine the record in search of special circumstances that might have rendered Hale's silence inconsistent with a subsequent claim of innocence, and found none. Id. at 177-80. As a result, the Court concluded that Hale's invocation of the right to remain silent had virtually no probative value as an inconsistent statement. Id. at 180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hale Court then turned to the other pan of the scales. Balancing against the lack of probativeness, the Court found a substantial likelihood of unfair prejudice should the showing of silence be allowed. \"The danger is that the jury is likely to assign much more weight to the defendant's previous silence than is warranted.\" Id. The resulting combination -- scant probative value and a significant risk of unfair prejudice -- proved deadly: the Court concluded that information about Hale's invocation of his right to remain silent should not have been allowed into evidence as a means of impeachment. Id. at 180-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same analytic framework pertains here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The admissibility vel non of evidence anent Morsilli's silence depends on constructing a balance involving the probative worth of the evidence and its unfairly prejudicial effect. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. Hale teaches that the trial court must start this task from a binary premise: (1) that silence per se generally has little or no probative value for impeachment purposes, 422 U.S. at 176; and (2) that evidence of the invocation of the right to remain silent is inherently prejudicial, id. at 180. Thus, a proffer of such evidence should be rejected unless special circumstances exist in a given case that materially shift the balance in favor of admissibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court understood its role and methodically constructed the appropriate balance. Surveying the record, it found no extraordinary circumstances and, hence, no basis for making an exception to the usual rule. We agree with this determination. On the facts of this case, as in Hale, 422 U.S. at 176-80, Morsilli's silence was completely ambiguous. The appellant does not identify, nor can we discern, any special trappings that might imbue Morsilli's silence with unaccustomed probative force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, the appellant does not seriously dispute that the proffered evidence was freighted with potential prejudice; there was, after all, a real danger that the jury would read considerably more into the witness's close-mouthedness than reason might warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the appeal. With Morsilli's silence not significantly probative, the likelihood of unfair prejudice looming large, and a record devoid of special circumstances, the lower court plainly did not misuse its discretion in excluding the proposed line of questioning. SeeHale, 422 U.S. at 176-81; cf. Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 423-24 (1957) (holding, on evidentiary grounds, that inquiries regarding an accused's invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination when testifying before a grand jury should not have been admitted for impeachment purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to the appellant's next ground for appeal. During the trial, his counsel sought to question the lead Secret Service agent, Peimer, concerning the administration of (or failure to administer) polygraph tests to certain potential witnesses. In launching this initiative, counsel forswore any interest in the test results or in the techniques employed in administering the tests. Instead, he explained that he wanted to pursue whether polygraphs were used as a tool in the course of this investigation, to whom they were offered, which witnesses agreed to take them, and which did not. Zaccaria's appellate counsel channels this offer of proof, suggesting that this line of inquiry was designed to probe \"whether the government agents may have ignored their own investigation methods to protect their witnesses, or whether the government felt that the witnesses were being evasive.\" Appellant's Brief at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the proposed inquiry wholly irrelevant, potentially confusing, and unfairly prejudicial. Consequently, it sustained the government's objection. Having considered both the ruling and the appellant's claim of error, we conclude that the court properly pretermitted the anticipated line of questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock. The right to cross-examine adverse witnesses in criminal cases is constitutionally protected, and courts historically have given criminal defendants considerable latitude in pursuing that right. Nevertheless, cross-examination is not a freestyle exercise, but, rather, must be conducted within reasonable limits. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986); United States v. Chaudhry, 850 F.2d 851, 856 (1st Cir. 1988). Suitable boundaries can and should be set by the trial judge. As we wrote on an earlier occasion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants cannot run roughshod, doing precisely as they please simply because cross-examination is underway. So long as a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation is developed, the judge enjoys power and discretion to set appropriate boundaries. Indeed, the judge has a responsibility to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 254 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations omitted). We follow the Boylan approach here, mindful that the lower court, on the whole, treated the appellant's wide-ranging cross-examination of Peimer and other government witnesses very hospitably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One border that constrains cross-examination involves the question of whether a particular piece of proof is too remote or peripheral, vis-a-vis the issues in the case, to be admitted into evidence. By and large, the responsibility for patrolling that border reposes with, and is subject to the sound discretion of, the trial judge. See Averitt v. Southland Motor Inn, 720 F.2d 1178, 1182 (10th Cir. 1983); Hill v. Rolleri, 615 F.2d 886, 891 (9th Cir. 1980). The \"polygraph\" questioning is of that genre: its relevance to the appellant's guilt or innocence is so tenuous as to place it at the margins of allowable cross-examination (and, therefore, within the discretion of the presider to admit or exclude).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant claims that the appearance of remoteness is deceiving. He argues poignantly that the proposed interrogation was designed to show that the government was somehow playing fast and loose (say, by unfairly protecting its witnesses, currying favor with them, or tolerating their evasiveness). But that surmise requires much too attenuated a chain of inference. For example, the fact that polygraph tests ultimately were not administered could be attributable to any number of reasons (e.g., administrative oversight, lack of time, lack of resources, the personal proclivities of a specific agent, knowledge that the test results would be inadmissible at trial, and so on and so forth). Many (perhaps most) of these possible reasons have no bearing either on the government's bona fides or on the issues in this case. In the absence of a particularized showing that the government was not turning square corners, the district court acted well within its discretion in refusing to let defense counsel embark on a fishing expedition. See Bui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 244 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court's exclusionary ruling is made all the more invulnerable by the subject matter of the proposed inquiry. Testimony about the government's non-administration of polygraph examinations would be apt to spark an unwarranted -- and profoundly prejudicial -- inference that the Secret Service agents believed the test results would be harmful to their cause. Cf. Wolfel v. Holbrook, 823 F.2d 970, 974-75 (6th Cir. 1987) (excluding evidence of an individual's refusal to volunteer for polygraph testing because such evidence would be \"likely to create a highly prejudicial inference that the results of the test would have been unfavorable\"). The substantial likelihood of unfair prejudice associated with this line of questioning, combined with the speculative nature of the appellant's bias theory, convinces us that foreclosing the inquiry entailed no abuse of discretion. See Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Trial courts have significant leeway in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence under the aegis of Rule 403.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's last sortie involves a question on cross-examination concerning whether a government witness, Blume, had ever sold drugs with Adamo (another government witness). Blume replied in the negative, but the prosecutor nonetheless objected. The district court sustained the objection. The appellant assigns error. We discern none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, cross-examiners cannot be permitted to rove at will. One salubrious limitation that courts have developed holds that a party who seeks to cross-examine a witness for the purpose of impeaching his credibility cannot base his queries solely on hunch or innuendo. See Bui, 170 F.3d at 243-44; United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1010 (1st Cir. 1993). The appellant's attempt to cross-examine Blume about his supposed drug dealing transgressed this principle because the questioning lacked a satisfactory evidentiary foundation. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the government objected to the appellant's question, Judge Lisi asked defense counsel to identify a factual basis for it. All that counsel had to offer was an unsubstantiated claim that the appellant (who did not plan to testify or submit an affidavit) had told him that Blume had admitted participating in drug trafficking activities with Adamo. Judge Lisi was understandably skeptical. She demanded some sort of evidentiary corroboration, stating that \"I'm going to want to see something from your client. Until then, the objection is sustained.\" The appellant made no further proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stated basis for the question -- counsel's secondhand assertion that Blume had made an admission to Zaccaria -- was too porous to support the weight of so charged a line of cross-examination. As a fundamental proposition, some proof in the form of concrete facts must underlie any offering that can be accepted by a trial court as evidence. Cf. 1 John Henry Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1 (Peter Tillers ed., 1983) (noting that \"[e]vidence . . . is any matter of fact that is furnished to a legal tribunal otherwise than by reasoning or a reference to what is noticed without proof\"). There is little law on the exact dimensions of what constitutes a satisfactory evidentiary foundation in any given instance. Thus, the answer tends to be case-specific.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this standard is difficult to articulate and apply in close cases, it is self-executing at the margins. This is such a situation. The appellant offered no evidence whatever that Blume had ever dealt drugs (with Adamo or anyone else). This, then, is the paradigmatic example of which Professor Wigmore warns: that on cross-examination \"facts of discreditable conduct [may be] groundlessly asked about in the hope that though denied they will be assumed by the jury to be well founded.\" 1 Wigmore, supra, &#167; 17. In such circumstances, a firm judicial hand is the best safeguard of the fairness of the trial process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would serve no useful purpose. Given the complete lack of undergirding factual support for the appellant's question, it cannot reasonably be said that the trial judge abused her discretion in refusing to allow further inquiry into the matter of drug trafficking. SeeBui, 170 F.3d at 243-44; Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, there is another, independently sufficient reason for rejecting this assignment of error: Blume answered the question and the district court did not strike his negative response. His denial was, therefore, before the jury. E.g., United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d 414, 419-20 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that testimony not stricken from the record may be regarded by the jury as evidence, notwithstanding parties' mutual, but mistaken, assumption that the court had stricken it); Tanner v. United States, 401 F.2d 281, 290-92 (8th Cir. 1968) (explaining, in analogous circumstances, that testimony not stricken \"remained before the jury for [its] consideration\" despite the sustaining of the opponent's objection). In light of Blume's disclaimer, nothing would have been gained from further questioning. See Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) (barring the introduction of extrinsic evidence for impeachment on collateral matters). Thus, even if the district court had erred in sustaining the objectionand we do not believe that it did -- the error would have been harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The appellant has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in the exclusion of evidence. For aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried. In other words, his conviction is authentic, not counterfeit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government posits that the appropriate standard of review on some or all of these claims is plain error because the appellant's arguments were not properly preserved in the trial court. In this case, however, a more stringent standard of review would not affect our ultimate conclusion. Thus, we assume, favorably to the appellant, that all the issues raised on appeal were duly preserved.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We say \"apparently\" because the appellant's claim to that effect hinges on a somewhat cryptic note in the agency's case file. The note, purportedly written by an unidentified Secret Service agent, was vague as to what rights were invoked, when those rights were cited, and whether the note pertained to Morsilli, or to his son (who also was summoned to the office because of his suspected involvement with the appellant), or to both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There are, of course, potential differences in the evidentiary considerations that pertain to a criminal defendant, on the one hand, and an ordinary witness for the government, on the other hand. While these differences might be important in some circumstances, this case, on the whole, seems a fair congener to Hale.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In this respect, the case at hand is unlike United States v. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501 (1st Cir. 1977). There, we found Hale not controlling because the defendant had waived his right to silence and, later, failed to answer questions. Id. at 504. In that context, the defendant's refusal had appreciable probative value. Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Our ruling in Bui is instructive. There, the petitioner claimed that he was being framed by a drug lord. 170 F.3d at 243. To develop this theory, he sought to cross-examine a government witness as to whether the witness knew that he (the petitioner) had declined to transport contraband for the drug lord. Id. This, the petitioner hoped, would lead the jury to conclude that the rebuffed drug lord framed him as retribution for his lack of cooperation. Id. We found the petitioner's proffer in support of this proposed line of cross-examination unacceptable because \"to that point in the trial, there had been no evidence even remotely supporting the petitioner's offer of proof.\" Id. Given such an \"exiguous record,\" the petitioner could not rewardingly cite himself as the source of the foundational facts -- at least in the absence of sworn testimony or an affidavit. Id. at 243-44.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Finding no error in the district court's exclusion of this evidence or in either of the other rulings challenged on appeal, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties, ably represented, have provided us with an exegetic account of the events leading to the appellant's indictment. The issues before us, however, are context-specific. Thus, an apothegmatic summary suffices to place them into perspective. We add more details, as the occasion demands, in connection with our subsequent discussion of the points on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence showed (or so the jury could have found) that defendant-appellant Marc A. Zaccaria contrived a scheme to counterfeit United States currency through the use of a state-of-the-art color copier. The phony bills were high-quality; they contained, inter alia, replicas of the Treasury Department's latest security strip and a protective coating designed to frustrate the most commonly used test for authenticity. The appellant moved the copying operation from location to location, and dealt with several different individuals (many of them acquaintances from his days in the automobile business) in his endeavor to bring the scheme to a lucrative climax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is said that all good things come to an end. So it was here: the Secret Service eventually got wind of the appellant's nefarious activities. Its ensuing investigation was aided by a number of people who were involved with the appellant and/or the scheme in one way or another. Of this rather motley crew, two individuals (both of whom testified against the appellant at trial) are particularly important to the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first, Joseph Morsilli, Sr., helped the appellant to start his \"copy business.\" Morsilli insisted that he had relied on the appellant's representation that the proposed venture was entirely legitimate. The second witness, Ted Blume, was close to the appellant and to various other persons who testified for, or gave information to, the government. Among Blume's intimates were individuals who the appellant alleged were attempting to frame him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We shall return to Morsilli and Blume shortly. For now, we note that, after a six-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty of conspiracy to pass counterfeit monetary instruments, sale of such instruments, and possession of a counterfeiting deterrent (the security strips). See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 371, 472, 474A(b). The trial court imposed a forty-eight month incarcerative sentence, to be followed by a five-year supervised release term. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Zaccaria complains of three evidentiary rulings. He claims that each of these rulings was as bogus as the bills that the government offered in evidence at his trial. He also claims that each ruling constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We apply a familiar standard of review. Every trial presents a blend of idiosyncratic circumstances, and presiding judges must be afforded some leeway in making evidentiary rulings. For the most part, therefore, a district court's rulings admitting or excluding evidence are evaluated for abuse of discretion. E.g., United States v. Winchenbach, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198727\"><a href=\"/opinion/198727/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 559 (1st Cir. 1999); Iacobucci v. Boulter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198661\"><a href=\"/opinion/198661/iacobucci-v-town-of-pembroke/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir. 1999). We use this benchmark in assaying the appellant's asseverational array.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal first with the implications of a witness's invocation of his right to remain silent. The background facts are these. In July 1996, Morsilli went to the Secret Service's Providence office to provide fingerprints and handwriting exemplars in compliance with a grand jury subpoena. While there, he apparently received Miranda warnings, see Miranda v. Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 479 (1966), and thereafter eschewed any further discussion with federal agents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morsilli testified for the prosecution at the appellant's trial, portraying himself as an innocent dupe. During cross-examination, the appellant sought to discredit this testimony by showing that Morsilli had declined to speak with the agents after having been advised of his constitutional rights. The district court sustained the government's objection to this line of questioning. Zaccaria assigns error to this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the appellant's view, Morsilli's invocation of his right to remain silent during the interview with the Secret Service implies guilt -- specifically, his participation in the counterfeiting scheme -- thus contradicting his trial testimony and providing fertile ground for impeachment. This argument for the use of silence to impeach has a patina of plausibility, but it does not withstand close scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by emphasizing that the issue before us is evidentiary, not constitutional. The law is now firmly settled that an accused's invocation of the right to remain silent is constitutionally protected and ordinarily cannot be used against him for impeachment or otherwise as evidence of guilt. Doyle v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span>, 617-19 (1976); United States v. Daoud, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440090\"><a href=\"/opinion/440090/united-states-v-suzan-joseph-daoud/\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 480 (1st Cir. 1984). The appellant, however, does not seek to impinge upon this constitutional bulwark. He points out, correctly, that Morsilli appeared as a witness, not as a defendant, and argues that the Constitution therefore interposes no impediment to the proposed line of cross-examination. This is a meaningful distinction and, to its credit, the government concedes the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, an evidentiary dimension (in addition to a constitutional dimension) to an invocation of the right to remain silent. The Supreme Court dealt with this evidentiary dimension in United States v. Hale, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109289\"><a href=\"/opinion/109289/united-states-v-hale/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span> (1975). That case involved an inquiry into a criminal defendant's silence at the time of questioning -- but the case was decided the year before the Doyle Court extended constitutional protection to a defendant's decision to remain silent after receiving advice about his rights. Because the Court treated the question as a matter of evidence, as must we, Hale affords relevant guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hale Court noted that the admissibility of this sort of disputed evidence necessarily hinges on the validity of the premise that silence in the face of questioning is inconsistent with -- and thus impeaches -- a later claim of innocence. Id. at 176. The Court remarked the dubiousness of that premise, stating that \"[i]n most circumstances silence is so ambiguous that it is of little probative force.\" Id. The Court proceeded to mine the record in search of special circumstances that might have rendered Hale's silence inconsistent with a subsequent claim of innocence, and found none. Id. at 177-80. As a result, the Court concluded that Hale's invocation of the right to remain silent had virtually no probative value as an inconsistent statement. Id. at 180.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hale Court then turned to the other pan of the scales. Balancing against the lack of probativeness, the Court found a substantial likelihood of unfair prejudice should the showing of silence be allowed. \"The danger is that the jury is likely to assign much more weight to the defendant's previous silence than is warranted.\" Id. The resulting combination -- scant probative value and a significant risk of unfair prejudice -- proved deadly: the Court concluded that information about Hale's invocation of his right to remain silent should not have been allowed into evidence as a means of impeachment. Id. at 180-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same analytic framework pertains here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The admissibility vel non of evidence anent Morsilli's silence depends on constructing a balance involving the probative worth of the evidence and its unfairly prejudicial effect. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. Hale teaches that the trial court must start this task from a binary premise: (1) that silence per se generally has little or no probative value for impeachment purposes, 422 U.S. at 176; and (2) that evidence of the invocation of the right to remain silent is inherently prejudicial, id. at 180. Thus, a proffer of such evidence should be rejected unless special circumstances exist in a given case that materially shift the balance in favor of admissibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court understood its role and methodically constructed the appropriate balance. Surveying the record, it found no extraordinary circumstances and, hence, no basis for making an exception to the usual rule. We agree with this determination. On the facts of this case, as in Hale, 422 U.S. at 176-80, Morsilli's silence was completely ambiguous. The appellant does not identify, nor can we discern, any special trappings that might imbue Morsilli's silence with unaccustomed probative force.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, the appellant does not seriously dispute that the proffered evidence was freighted with potential prejudice; there was, after all, a real danger that the jury would read considerably more into the witness's close-mouthedness than reason might warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the appeal. With Morsilli's silence not significantly probative, the likelihood of unfair prejudice looming large, and a record devoid of special circumstances, the lower court plainly did not misuse its discretion in excluding the proposed line of questioning. SeeHale, 422 U.S. at 176-81; cf. Grunewald v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105508\"><a href=\"/opinion/105508/grunewald-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 423-24 (1957) (holding, on evidentiary grounds, that inquiries regarding an accused's invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination when testifying before a grand jury should not have been admitted for impeachment purposes).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to the appellant's next ground for appeal. During the trial, his counsel sought to question the lead Secret Service agent, Peimer, concerning the administration of (or failure to administer) polygraph tests to certain potential witnesses. In launching this initiative, counsel forswore any interest in the test results or in the techniques employed in administering the tests. Instead, he explained that he wanted to pursue whether polygraphs were used as a tool in the course of this investigation, to whom they were offered, which witnesses agreed to take them, and which did not. Zaccaria's appellate counsel channels this offer of proof, suggesting that this line of inquiry was designed to probe \"whether the government agents may have ignored their own investigation methods to protect their witnesses, or whether the government felt that the witnesses were being evasive.\" Appellant's Brief at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found the proposed inquiry wholly irrelevant, potentially confusing, and unfairly prejudicial. Consequently, it sustained the government's objection. Having considered both the ruling and the appellant's claim of error, we conclude that the court properly pretermitted the anticipated line of questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock. The right to cross-examine adverse witnesses in criminal cases is constitutionally protected, and courts historically have given criminal defendants considerable latitude in pursuing that right. Nevertheless, cross-examination is not a freestyle exercise, but, rather, must be conducted within reasonable limits. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111625\"><a href=\"/opinion/111625/delaware-v-van-arsdall/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">673</span></a></span>, 679 (1986); United States v. Chaudhry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508420\"><a href=\"/opinion/508420/united-states-v-muzamal-chaudhry-aka-omar-muzamal/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>, 856 (1st Cir. 1988). Suitable boundaries can and should be set by the trial judge. As we wrote on an earlier occasion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants cannot run roughshod, doing precisely as they please simply because cross-examination is underway. So long as a reasonably complete picture of the witness' veracity, bias, and motivation is developed, the judge enjoys power and discretion to set appropriate boundaries. Indeed, the judge has a responsibility to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Boylan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538369\"><a href=\"/opinion/538369/united-states-v-peter-boylan-united-states-of-america-v-john-e-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 254 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations omitted). We follow the Boylan approach here, mindful that the lower court, on the whole, treated the appellant's wide-ranging cross-examination of Peimer and other government witnesses very hospitably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One border that constrains cross-examination involves the question of whether a particular piece of proof is too remote or peripheral, vis-a-vis the issues in the case, to be admitted into evidence. By and large, the responsibility for patrolling that border reposes with, and is subject to the sound discretion of, the trial judge. See Averitt v. Southland Motor Inn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427085\"><a href=\"/opinion/427085/william-michael-averitt-v-southland-motor-inn-of-oklahoma-dba-sheraton/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1178</span></a></span>, 1182 (10th Cir. 1983); Hill v. Rolleri, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></span>, 891 (9th Cir. 1980). The \"polygraph\" questioning is of that genre: its relevance to the appellant's guilt or innocence is so tenuous as to place it at the margins of allowable cross-examination (and, therefore, within the discretion of the presider to admit or exclude).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant claims that the appearance of remoteness is deceiving. He argues poignantly that the proposed interrogation was designed to show that the government was somehow playing fast and loose (say, by unfairly protecting its witnesses, currying favor with them, or tolerating their evasiveness). But that surmise requires much too attenuated a chain of inference. For example, the fact that polygraph tests ultimately were not administered could be attributable to any number of reasons (e.g., administrative oversight, lack of time, lack of resources, the personal proclivities of a specific agent, knowledge that the test results would be inadmissible at trial, and so on and so forth). Many (perhaps most) of these possible reasons have no bearing either on the government's bona fides or on the issues in this case. In the absence of a particularized showing that the government was not turning square corners, the district court acted well within its discretion in refusing to let defense counsel embark on a fishing expedition. See Bui v. DiPaolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198376\"><a href=\"/opinion/198376/bui-v-dipaolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 244 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court's exclusionary ruling is made all the more invulnerable by the subject matter of the proposed inquiry. Testimony about the government's non-administration of polygraph examinations would be apt to spark an unwarranted -- and profoundly prejudicial -- inference that the Secret Service agents believed the test results would be harmful to their cause. Cf. Wolfel v. Holbrook, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491512\"><a href=\"/opinion/491512/dennis-m-wolfel-v-troy-e-holbrook/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>, 974-75 (6th Cir. 1987) (excluding evidence of an individual's refusal to volunteer for polygraph testing because such evidence would be \"likely to create a highly prejudicial inference that the results of the test would have been unfavorable\"). The substantial likelihood of unfair prejudice associated with this line of questioning, combined with the speculative nature of the appellant's bias theory, convinces us that foreclosing the inquiry entailed no abuse of discretion. See Williams v. Drake, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198058\"><a href=\"/opinion/198058/williams-v-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Trial courts have significant leeway in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence under the aegis of Rule 403.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's last sortie involves a question on cross-examination concerning whether a government witness, Blume, had ever sold drugs with Adamo (another government witness). Blume replied in the negative, but the prosecutor nonetheless objected. The district court sustained the objection. The appellant assigns error. We discern none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, cross-examiners cannot be permitted to rove at will. One salubrious limitation that courts have developed holds that a party who seeks to cross-examine a witness for the purpose of impeaching his credibility cannot base his queries solely on hunch or innuendo. See Bui, 170 F.3d at 243-44; United States v. Carty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607110\"><a href=\"/opinion/607110/united-states-v-ralph-h-carty/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1010 (1st Cir. 1993). The appellant's attempt to cross-examine Blume about his supposed drug dealing transgressed this principle because the questioning lacked a satisfactory evidentiary foundation. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the government objected to the appellant's question, Judge Lisi asked defense counsel to identify a factual basis for it. All that counsel had to offer was an unsubstantiated claim that the appellant (who did not plan to testify or submit an affidavit) had told him that Blume had admitted participating in drug trafficking activities with Adamo. Judge Lisi was understandably skeptical. She demanded some sort of evidentiary corroboration, stating that \"I'm going to want to see something from your client. Until then, the objection is sustained.\" The appellant made no further proffer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stated basis for the question -- counsel's secondhand assertion that Blume had made an admission to Zaccaria -- was too porous to support the weight of so charged a line of cross-examination. As a fundamental proposition, some proof in the form of concrete facts must underlie any offering that can be accepted by a trial court as evidence. Cf. 1 John Henry Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence &#167; 1 (Peter Tillers ed., 1983) (noting that \"[e]vidence . . . is any matter of fact that is furnished to a legal tribunal otherwise than by reasoning or a reference to what is noticed without proof\"). There is little law on the exact dimensions of what constitutes a satisfactory evidentiary foundation in any given instance. Thus, the answer tends to be case-specific.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this standard is difficult to articulate and apply in close cases, it is self-executing at the margins. This is such a situation. The appellant offered no evidence whatever that Blume had ever dealt drugs (with Adamo or anyone else). This, then, is the paradigmatic example of which Professor Wigmore warns: that on cross-examination \"facts of discreditable conduct [may be] groundlessly asked about in the hope that though denied they will be assumed by the jury to be well founded.\" 1 Wigmore, supra, &#167; 17. In such circumstances, a firm judicial hand is the best safeguard of the fairness of the trial process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would serve no useful purpose. Given the complete lack of undergirding factual support for the appellant's question, it cannot reasonably be said that the trial judge abused her discretion in refusing to allow further inquiry into the matter of drug trafficking. SeeBui, 170 F.3d at 243-44; Carty, 993 F.2d at 1010.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, there is another, independently sufficient reason for rejecting this assignment of error: Blume answered the question and the district court did not strike his negative response. His denial was, therefore, before the jury. E.g., United States v. Polito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511568\"><a href=\"/opinion/511568/united-states-v-john-d-polito/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 419-20 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that testimony not stricken from the record may be regarded by the jury as evidence, notwithstanding parties' mutual, but mistaken, assumption that the court had stricken it); Tanner v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></span>, 290-92 (8th Cir. 1968) (explaining, in analogous circumstances, that testimony not stricken \"remained before the jury for [its] consideration\" despite the sustaining of the opponent's objection). In light of Blume's disclaimer, nothing would have been gained from further questioning. See Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) (barring the introduction of extrinsic evidence for impeachment on collateral matters). Thus, even if the district court had erred in sustaining the objectionand we do not believe that it did -- the error would have been harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The appellant has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in the exclusion of evidence. For aught that appears, the appellant was fairly tried. In other words, his conviction is authentic, not counterfeit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government posits that the appropriate standard of review on some or all of these claims is plain error because the appellant's arguments were not properly preserved in the trial court. In this case, however, a more stringent standard of review would not affect our ultimate conclusion. Thus, we assume, favorably to the appellant, that all the issues raised on appeal were duly preserved.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We say \"apparently\" because the appellant's claim to that effect hinges on a somewhat cryptic note in the agency's case file. The note, purportedly written by an unidentified Secret Service agent, was vague as to what rights were invoked, when those rights were cited, and whether the note pertained to Morsilli, or to his son (who also was summoned to the office because of his suspected involvement with the appellant), or to both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There are, of course, potential differences in the evidentiary considerations that pertain to a criminal defendant, on the one hand, and an ordinary witness for the government, on the other hand. While these differences might be important in some circumstances, this case, on the whole, seems a fair congener to Hale.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In this respect, the case at hand is unlike United States v. Goldman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349529\"><a href=\"/opinion/349529/united-states-v-joseph-goldman/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1977). There, we found Hale not controlling because the defendant had waived his right to silence and, later, failed to answer questions. Id. at 504. In that context, the defendant's refusal had appreciable probative value. Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Our ruling in Bui is instructive. There, the petitioner claimed that he was being framed by a drug lord. 170 F.3d at 243. To develop this theory, he sought to cross-examine a government witness as to whether the witness knew that he (the petitioner) had declined to transport contraband for the drug lord. Id. This, the petitioner hoped, would lead the jury to conclude that the rebuffed drug lord framed him as retribution for his lack of cooperation. Id. We found the petitioner's proffer in support of this proposed line of cross-examination unacceptable because \"to that point in the trial, there had been no evidence even remotely supporting the petitioner's offer of proof.\" Id. Given such an \"exiguous record,\" the petitioner could not rewardingly cite himself as the source of the foundational facts -- at least in the absence of sworn testimony or an affidavit. Id. at 243-44.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
