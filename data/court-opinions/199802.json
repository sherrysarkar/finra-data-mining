McCallum, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Mark\nC.   Walters,  Assistant   Director,  Office   of  Immigration\nLitigation, U.S. Dep't of Justice, and Arthur L. Rabin, Trial\nAttorney, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                          JANUARY 8, 2002\n\f\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.       This is a petition for review\n\nfiled by Angel Pena, a native and citizen of the Dominican\n\nRepublic.    In it, the petitioner challenges the decision of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) upholding an immigration\n\njudge's denial of his motion to reopen.         The motion to reopen\n\nfollowed several years after the immigration judge's in absentia\n\norder deporting the petitioner under former section 242B(c) of\n\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)\n\n(1994 & Supp. I 1995), repealed by Illegal Immigration Reform\n\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), tit. III,\n\n§306, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996).\n\n            The facts are straightforward.      On May 30, 1990, the\n\npetitioner entered the United States without inspection and was\n\napprehended.    He admitted his illegal entry and the Immigration\n\nand   Naturalization    Service     (INS)    instituted   deportation\n\nproceedings by serving him with an order to show cause (OSC).\n\nThe OSC specifically notified the petitioner that he was to\n\nappear for a hearing before an immigration judge at a \"date,\n\ntime and place to be set by the Immigration Court.\"          The OSC\n\nalso advised him that if he failed to appear, he could be\n\nordered deported in absentia.\n\n            The INS released the petitioner on bond and, on June\n\n28, 1990, sent written notice of the time, date, and place of\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe petitioner's hearing to him at the address he had furnished.\n\nThe notice was returned by the United States Postal Service with\n\na   notation    that    delivery     had   been    attempted     but    that   the\n\naddressee      (the    petitioner)    was    not    known   at    the    address\n\nspecified.      The INS did not make any further attempt to notify\n\nthe petitioner, and he failed to attend the hearing.                      In his\n\nabsence, the immigration judge found by clear, convincing, and\n\nunequivocal evidence that he was deportable on the charges\n\nlimned in the OSC and ordered him deported to the Dominican\n\nRepublic.      Notice of the immigration judge's decision was sent\n\nto the petitioner at the same address.              This notification, too,\n\nwas returned to the sender.\n\n            Several years passed.          The petitioner left the United\n\nStates for a month and was apprehended while attempting to\n\nreenter.     He then tried to reopen his deportation proceedings.\n\nOn June 21, 1999, the immigration judge denied his motion on the\n\nground that, in the original proceeding, \"service was sufficient\n\nand notice was proper.\"       As an alternate ground, the immigration\n\njudge found that the petitioner's departure from the United\n\nStates after the issuance of the deportation order rendered any\n\nattempt to reopen the proceedings susceptible to the bar of 8\n\nC.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1).        On February 28, 2001, the BIA summarily\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\faffirmed the immigration judge's decision.                   This petition for\n\nreview followed.\n\n             We need not tarry.       Notice of the date, time, and place\n\nof the deportation hearing was sent to the petitioner at the\n\naddress he had furnished.            That notice was given in accordance\n\nwith   the    statute   then    in     effect,    INA    §    242B(a)(2)    (now\n\nrepealed), and with the applicable regulations, 8 C.F.R. §\n\n3.15(d)(2) (1996).      As a procedural matter, then, the petitioner\n\n— who never filed a change of address with the INS — has scant\n\nbasis to complain.\n\n             The petitioner attempts to blunt the force of this\n\nconclusion     by   alleging    that     the     INS's   former    system    for\n\nnotifying aliens of deportation hearings (now substantially\n\nrevised)     violated   his    due    process    rights.       This   argument,\n\nhowever, comes too late:        because the petitioner failed to raise\n\nhis due process claim before the immigration judge or the BIA,\n\nhe is precluded from raising it here.               See Mendes v. INS, 197\n\nF.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1999); Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56,\n\n64 (1st Cir. 1999); Martinez-Zelaya v. INS, 841 F.2d 294, 296\n\n(9th Cir. 1988); cf. Athehortua-Vanegas v. INS, 876 F.2d 238,\n\n240 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that, as a predicate to judicial\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\freview, a petitioner must have told the BIA why he contends that\n\nthe immigration judge's decision was wrong).\n\n         We need go no further.1    The petitioner's due process\n\nclaim has not been preserved and the INS appears to have turned\n\nsquare corners by complying literally with the notification\n\nrequirement in effect at the relevant time.    Accordingly, the\n\npetition for review is denied and dismissed.\n\n\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n    1 In particular, we need not reach — and take no view of —\nthe INS's argument that the petitioner, by departing from the\nUnited States and returning to the Dominican Republic after he\nwas ordered deported by the immigration judge, divested both the\nBIA and this court of jurisdiction.\n\n                              -6-\n\f",
