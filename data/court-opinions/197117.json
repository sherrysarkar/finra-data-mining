Rory Holland  sued the City  of\r                                      \r\n\nPortland,  Maine, and two  Portland police officers, Sullivan\r\n\nRizzo  and Bruce  Coffin, for  damages and  injunctive relief\r\n\nunder  42  U.S.C.   1983  and  Maine tort  law  for Holland's\r\n\nallegedly  wrongful false  arrest and  detention.   Following\r\n\ndiscovery, the district court  granted the defendants' motion\r\n\nfor summary  judgment on  all of  Holland's claims.   Holland\r\n\nappeals   from   the   court's   judgment    dismissing   his\r\n\nsection 1983, but not his state law, claim.\r\n\n     The  facts,  taken most  favorably  to  Holland, are  as\r\n\nfollows.   At about 1:20  p.m. on October  18, 1994, Portland\r\n\npolice  radio traffic reported a  robbery at the  Key Bank in\r\n\nCanal Plaza.  The police dispatcher described the suspect  as\r\n\na black male, about 6'2\"  tall, 185 pounds, unshaven, wearing\r\n\na brown jacket, possibly suede, and a black hat, and carrying\r\n\na black leather  briefcase.  The dispatcher reported that the\r\n\nsuspect  had fled  on  foot and  did  not indicate  that  any\r\n\nvehicle had been involved.\r\n\n     Shortly after 2:00  p.m. on  the same  day, Holland  was\r\n\ndriving  a  Subaru to  the  Cumberland  County Courthouse  in\r\n\nPortland.  He drove past  a bicycle patrolman, Daniel Knight,\r\n\nand  turned the  corner.  Knight  had heard  the dispatcher's\r\n\nreport about the robbery.  When he saw the Subaru, he noticed\r\n\nthat  the driver, Holland, was a tall, thin black man wearing\r\n\na brown  or black jacket and  a hat who appeared  to meet the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\ndescription  of the suspect, and he also noticed that the car\r\n\nhad no back window.\r\n\n     Knight reported to the police dispatcher, \"Ten-twenty on\r\n\nRory Holland, he's in the area.\"  Although Knight had not met\r\n\nHolland, he  thought that the Subaru  driver fit descriptions\r\n\nof Holland that  Knight had  seen in police  bulletins.   The\r\n\ndispatcher asked  if Holland's  clothing matched that  of the\r\n\nreported suspect.  Knight did not respond, but the dispatcher\r\n\nimmediately sent  backup police units and  indicated that the\r\n\nsuspect was a \"possible match.\"\r\n\n     After  turning the  corner  Holland parked  his car  and\r\n\nstarted walking across the street towards the courthouse.  He\r\n\nwore a  brown tweed jacket and  a brown leather  hat, and was\r\n\ncarrying a black nylon briefcase  and a white canvas bookbag.\r\n\nKnight  stopped  Holland  in  the crosswalk  and,  addressing\r\n\nHolland  by  name, said  that a  bank  robbery had  just been\r\n\ncommitted and  asked  where Holland  had been.   Knight  also\r\n\nasked about  the contents of Holland's bag.  Holland remained\r\n\nsilent. \r\n\n     Coffin, Rizzo,  and another officer soon  arrived at the\r\n\nscene, and  the officers then  walked up to  Holland, backing\r\n\nhim up to  his car.  Coffin was familiar  with Holland's past\r\n\nhistory   from  information  circulated   within  the  police\r\n\ndepartment and  thought that  the Subaru driver  was Holland.\r\n\nRizzo had  also heard  about Holland in  department briefings\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nand  previously had seen a photograph of Holland.  Coffin and\r\n\nRizzo then began to ask Holland questions concerning the bank\r\n\nrobbery.\r\n\n     Although  Rizzo  told  Holland  that he  was  not  under\r\n\narrest,  and that the police  just wanted to  learn about the\r\n\nbank robbery,  Holland remained silent.  Noticing the missing\r\n\nrear  window in Holland's car,  Rizzo asked Knight if Holland\r\n\nhad  been driving.    When Knight  said  that he  had,  Rizzo\r\n\nallegedly said, \"well, then we  can get him for not having  a\r\n\nlicense  or something or other.\"  Rizzo then said, \"Rory, you\r\n\nknow, I  can arrest you if you don't show me a valid driver's\r\n\nlicense and tell me where you live . . . .\"\r\n\n     Holland continued to remain silent.  Rizzo asked Holland\r\n\nseveral more times to  produce his license and to  tell Rizzo\r\n\nwhere he lived, saying that otherwise Rizzo would  arrest him\r\n\n\"for failure to  identify yourself to me.\"  Eventually, Rizzo\r\n\ntold Holland that he was under arrest.   At that point, Rizzo\r\n\nand Coffin patted down Holland, removed his wallet, and found\r\n\na driver's license in  the wallet that identified  the driver\r\n\nas Rory Holland.  Rizzo then allegedly said,  \"I guess we got\r\n\na license in here, I guess we can't get you for that.\"\r\n\n     Coffin and  Rizzo took Holland to  the Cumberland County\r\n\nJail.  According to Holland, some officers referred to him as\r\n\na  bank robbery suspect.   Holland refused to  speak with the\r\n\nbooking  officer or others at the jail.  Holland was released\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\non  bail after  the police  apprehended another  bank robbery\r\n\nsuspect.   Ultimately, no  charges of any  kind were  pressed\r\n\nagainst Holland.\r\n\n     Thereafter,  Holland  brought the  present  suit against\r\n\nRizzo, Coffin  and the  city.  As  the basis for  his section\r\n\n1983 claim, Holland alleged that his arrest had  violated the\r\n\nFourth Amendment's protection  against unreasonable  searches\r\n\nand  seizures  made  applicable  to the  states  through  the\r\n\nFourteenth  Amendment.   Specifically, the  complaint alleged\r\n\nthat the police lacked  probable cause to arrest him  for any\r\n\nreason,  that the actual charge  was a pretext  to detain him\r\n\nfor questioning about  the bank robbery, and  that the arrest\r\n\nwas retaliation for his refusal to speak.  \r\n\n     In the  course of discovery Holland--who  had previously\r\n\nbeen in disputes with  the Portland police--learned that some\r\n\nweeks  before   the   arrest,  the   police  had   circulated\r\n\ninformation  about him  in  so-called crime  alert bulletins.\r\n\nKnitting  the bulletins  together with the  disputes, Holland\r\n\nsuggested that his arrest  was part of a general  campaign of\r\n\nharassment directed against  him by the police.   Holland did\r\n\nnot amend his complaint.\r\n\n     On  January 25,  1996,  the district  court granted  the\r\n\ndefendants' motion for summary  judgment.  The district court\r\n\nruled that  the police had  probable cause to  arrest Holland\r\n\nfor failing to identify  himself or provide his license.   It\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ncalled  the charge of harassment \"hollow.\"  And it ruled that\r\n\nthe city was not liable because, quite apart from the lack of\r\n\na municipal custom or policy, this arrest had been justified.\r\n\nHolland now appeals.\r\n\n     1.  On review of a grant of summary judgment, this court\r\n\nconsiders the matter de novo, taking the facts most favorably\r                                        \r\n\nto the non-moving party.  St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia,  71\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 20, 24 (1st  Cir. 1995), cert. denied,  116 S. Ct.  2548\r                                                      \r\n\n(1996).   We  begin  by considering  whether  the police  had\r\n\nprobable cause to arrest  Holland--that is, whether the facts\r\n\nknown  to the police  indicated that Holland  had committed a\r\n\ncriminal offense.  The parties agree that Holland was charged\r\n\nwith  violating  29  Me.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.     2501   (later\r\n\nrenumbered) which said:\r\n\n        Whoever, while operating  a vehicle in violation\r\n     of this [motor vehicle regulations] Title, fails or\r\n     refuses, when requested by an officer authorized to\r\n     make arrests, to give  the operator's correct name,\r\n     address  and date of birth  is guilty of  a Class E\r\n     crime.\r\n\n       At first  blush, the literal language  might appear to\r\n\nmake the  officers' authority depend upon  whether the driver\r\n\nwas  actually operating in violation  of state law.   But the\r\n\nMaine Supreme Judicial Court  has interpreted section 2501 to\r\n\npermit an  officer to stop a  driver and ask his  name on the\r\n\nbasis of an  articulable suspicion that  the driver has  done\r\n\nsomething wrong.   State v. Littlefield, 677 A.2d  1055, 1057\r                                                   \r\n\n(Me. 1996).  Indeed, even  if it then becomes clear that  the\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nsuspected violation  had not occurred, the  officer may still\r\n\ninsist  on  seeing  the  driver's  license and  registration.\r\n\nState v. Hill, 606 A.2d 793, 794-95 (Me. 1992).  \r                         \r\n\n     Holland may  not have violated any motor  vehicle law by\r\n\ndriving with a  missing rear  window.  But  the missing  rear\r\n\nwindow,  or  any  other similar  non-cosmetic  damage,  could\r\n\nreasonably  create a suspicion of  such a violation.   See 29\r                                                                      \r\n\nMe.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.    2503(1)(D)  (requiring  that  motor\r\n\nvehicle equipment \"[n]ot pose a hazard . . . .\").  Thus, when\r\n\nthe officers asked Holland  to identify himself, section 2501\r\n\nrequired  Holland to provide  his name, address,  and date of\r\n\nbirth--or face arrest.  See 17-A Me. Rev. Stat.  Ann.   15(B)\r                                       \r\n\n(authorizing  arrest  for  Class  E crimes  committed  in  an\r\n\nofficer's presence).\r\n\n     Holland does  not challenge the initial  stop, see Terry\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), nor argue that the statute itself\r                   \r\n\nis unconstitutional.  Cf. California  v. Byers, 402 U.S.  424\r                                                          \r\n\n(1971).  He  instead argues that the police  had no reason to\r\n\nrequest his name since they already knew it, citing Rodriguez\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Comas,  888 F.2d 899 (1st  Cir. 1989).  But  where the law\r                    \r\n\nrequires  the motorist  to supply  his name,  the police  can\r\n\nreasonably  insist  upon confirmation.   Further,  the police\r\n\nalso sought  Holland's  present address,  which  the  statute\r\n\nrequired  him to provide, and there is no indication that the\r\n\npolice had this information.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     Holland's reliance on  Rodriquez is  misplaced.   There,\r                                                 \r\n\nRodriguez  was arrested on a charge of obstruction of justice\r\n\nbecause he declined  to provide  his name and  address to  an\r\n\nofficer.   Rodriquez was well known to the officer, and there\r\n\nwas no separate statute--such  as Maine's motor vehicle law--\r\n\nrequiring that he provide  his name and address.   This court\r\n\nheld only that the refusal could not even arguably constitute\r\n\n\"obstruction of  justice\" where  the refusal to  provide this\r\n\nalready-known information neither could nor did  obstruct the\r\n\nofficer's investigation.  888 F.2d at 902.\r\n\n     Quoting language from  other cases, Holland  also claims\r\n\nthat police officers  may not  arrest a suspect  if they  can\r\n\nobtain the  information that  they seek through  a reasonable\r\n\ninvestigation.   See Sevigny  v. Dicksey,  846 F.2d  953 (4th\r                                                    \r\n\nCir.  1988); BeVier v. Hucal,  806 F.2d 123  (7th Cir. 1986).\r                                        \r\n\nBut  these  cases impose  no  such  limitation; rather,  they\r\n\ndemand  that officers  undertake reasonable  investigation to\r\n\ndetermine whether probable cause  exists to arrest a suspect.\r                             \r\n\nSevigny, 846 F.2d at  957-58; BeVier, 806 F.2d at 127.  Here,\r                                                \r\n\nHolland  committed  the  offense   in  the  presence  of  the\r\n\nofficers.\r\n\n     2.   Although  Holland  devotes  much  of his  brief  to\r\n\ndisputing  the police claim of probable cause, he has a fall-\r\n\nback contention less easily  resolved.  Fairly construing his\r\n\narguments,  we  take him  to  challenge the  validity  of his\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\narrest  even  assuming  probable  cause  (which  he  disputes\r\n\nstrongly  but we  find to be  established).  In  sum, he says\r\n\nthat the police  nominally arrested him for  refusing to give\r\n\nhis  name and address but  that this was  a \"pretext\" because\r\n\nthe arrest was motivated by other, more sinister objectives.\r\n\n     On Holland's  version of events, which  must be credited\r\n\nat  this stage,  see St.  Hilaire,  71 F.3d  at 24,  there is\r                                             \r\n\nreason for thinking that  the police did not care  much about\r\n\nthe  missing car window or Holland's failure to give his name\r\n\nor address.  Indeed,  a jury, after a full  trial, might well\r\n\nfind  that  the  police  arrested  Holland  for  a  technical\r\n\nviolation  in order  to pursue  their investigation  into the\r\n\nbank robbery,  suspecting Holland  of complicity  but perhaps\r\n\nlacking enough evidence to arrest him on this charge.\r\n\n     The term \"pretext\" is sometimes used, as Holland uses it\r\n\nhere,  with the  assertion that  the police  may not  make an\r\n\narrest otherwise based on probable cause when  their true aim\r\n\nis  to forward  some  other investigation.    But aside  from\r\n\ndicta, it is  hard to  find recent holdings  to support  this\r\n\nproposition; one  exception is the Eleventh  Circuit.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.  Valdez, 931 F.2d  1448, 1450-51 (11th  Cir. 1991).\r                             \r\n\nOur  own  circuit,  like  several others,  has  rejected  the\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\ninquiry into motive.  United States  v. McCambridge, 551 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n865, 869-70 (1st Cir. 1977).1\r\n\n     In all  events, the  Supreme Court recently  settled the\r\n\nmatter in Whren  v. United  States, 116 S.

There, the  Court explicitly  rejected the very  test\r\n\nused by the Eleventh Circuit in Valdez which asks whether the\r                                                  \r\n\nofficer  \"would\" have  made  the stop  or  arrest absent  the\r\n\n\"other\" motive.  See  id. at 1774-75; see also  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

On the one\r\n\nhand,  motor vehicle  operation  often gives  rise to  fairly\r\n\nminor  violations, making it easy  for the police  to find an\r\n\nexcuse; on  the  other hand,  the  violation does  provide  a\r\n\nbright  line standard  while an  inquiry into  actual motive,\r\n\ndirectly or indirectly, invites all kinds  of diversion.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWhren, 116 S. Ct. at 1774-75.

See\r                                                                         \r\n1 LaFave, Search and  Seizure   1.4(e), at 120-21  &amp; n.61 (3d\r                                         \r\ned. 1996).\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\ninvestigate another crime, may not seem  all that sinister to\r\n\nthe Justices, who were unanimous in Whren.\r                                                     \r\n\n     How  far  Whren would  extend  in  the face  of  dubious\r                                \r\n\nmotives or other constitutional  concerns is a more difficult\r\n\nquestion,  and one  not entirely  avoidable here.   Holland's\r\n\nversion  of events suggests that the police aimed not only to\r\n\nhold  him for further investigation  but also that the arrest\r                                                         \r\n\nitself was  retaliation for  his refusal to  answer questions\r\n\nabout the robbery.  According to Holland, after he refused to\r\n\nanswer any questions about the bank  robbery, Rizzo said that\r\n\nbecause  Holland had been driving, \"well, then we can get him\r\n\nfor not having  a license  or something or  other.\"   Holland\r\n\nfurther asserted  that Rizzo  was \"obviously upset  and angry\r\n\nwith me  that I would  not speak  with him at  all about  the\r\n\nrobbery.\"\r\n\n     Holland's  brief barely refers  to the  Fifth Amendment;\r\n\nand the  law on  the relationship between  police questioning\r\n\nand   the   privilege   against  self-incrimination   is   an\r\n\nembarrassing tangle.   Historically, the privilege and police\r\n\nquestioning were unconnected, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence   2252,\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 328-29  (McNaughton rev.  ed. 1961);  and the  more modern\r\n\nblurring of lines has left unclear whether the privilege  can\r\n\never be  violated by such questioning  where no incriminating\r\n\nstatement is thereafter used  in a proceeding.  See  Wiley v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nMayor and City Council of Baltimore, 48 F.3d 773, 777-78 (4th\r                                               \r\n\nCir.)

Ct. 89 (1995).2\r                                           \r\n\n     Even  if the  Fifth Amendment  is put  to one  side, the\r\n\ndefendants  do  not  suggest   that  Holland  had  any  legal\r\n\nobligation to  answer questions  about the robbery.   Compare\r                                                                         \r\n\nBrown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 52-53  (1979).  While the police\r                          \r\n\ndid not purport  to arrest Holland for refusing to cooperate,\r\n\nthe facts might permit  a jury to think  that this was  their\r\n\nunderlying  motivation.    Yet  assuming  this  premise,  the\r\n\nquestion  remains  whether  such   a  motive  for  an  arrest\r\n\notherwise justified  by probable cause alters  the message of\r\n\nWhren.\r                 \r\n\n     In  our view, it does not.  The police, prosecutors, and\r\n\ncourts constantly make judgments--including decisions  not to\r\n\nprosecute or to permit or impose a reduced sentence--based on\r\n\nan assessment  of an individual's cooperation.   The decision\r\n\nto arrest,  where probable  cause exists, is  a discretionary\r\n\none informed  by many  considerations.   And  any attempt  to\r\n\nuntangle  the  ascribed motive  from  a skein  of  others, in\r\n\nprompting an  arrest justified  by objective  probable cause,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Of course,  Holland never  asserted the  privilege when\r\nquestioned, as  is customarily required.    The Supreme Court\r\nhas  said that  this  requirement may  not  apply in  police-\r\nstation  questioning  or  like  interrogation,  Minnesota  v.\r                                                                     \r\nMurphy, 465  U.S. 420, 429-30 (1984),  but shortly thereafter\r                  \r\nit ruled that one held briefly  in a traffic stop was not \"in\r\ncustody\" for purposes  of Miranda.  Berkemer v.  McCarty, 468\r                                                                    \r\nU.S. 420, 440 (1984).\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nwould  invite  exactly  the  inquiry into  police  motivation\r\n\ncondemned by Whren.\r                              \r\n\n     Actual motive sometimes does play a role in section 1983\r\n\nactions.   E.g., Waters  v.  Churchill, 511  U.S. 661  (1994)\r                                                  \r\n\n(discharge  in retaliation  for exercise  of  First Amendment\r\n\nrights).   But in evaluating  arrests, the Supreme  Court has\r\n\ngiven  primacy  to  the   Fourth  Amendment's  own  objective\r\n\nstandards,  even  where other  constitutional bases  might be\r\n\ninvoked.  Thus, the Court recently rejected an attempt to use\r\n\nsubstantive  due process  as a  more favorable  framework for\r\n\nassessing a claim, at least insofar  as it was deemed one for\r\n\nunlawful detention.  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 274-75\r                                                   \r\n\n(1994).\r\n\n     This does not mean  that probable cause forecloses every\r\n\npossible  challenge  to an  arrest.    Whren itself  strongly\r                                                        \r\n\nimplies  that an  equal  protection challenge  to an  arrest,\r\n\ndespite probable  cause existing, might  yet be  entertained,\r\n\nalthough the court does not say what facts would be needed to\r\n\nsupport such a challenge.  116 S. Ct. at 1774.   An objective\r\n\nshowing  that (for example)  only blacks or  Asians were ever\r\n\narrested for a specific,  widely committed offense would pose\r\n\na different  case than Whren.   See  Yick Wo v.  Hopkins, 118\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 356 (1886).\r\n\n     This brings us to Holland's final claim of  ascribing an\r\n\nillicit  motive for the arrest.  It is evident from Holland's\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\ndeposition that he himself  thinks (based on prior incidents)\r\n\nthat he was a target of general police harassment, resting in\r\n\npart  on the  fact he  is black.   But  the racial  charge is\r                                                              \r\n\nunsubstantiated  by anything we can find in the record and is\r\n\nnot  directly urged in Holland's appellate brief.  We note it\r\n\nonly to stress that our decision does not reach the difficult\r\n\nissues  that might  be raised  by a  substantiated  charge of\r\n\nracial discrimination.   Compare United States v.  Armstrong,\r                                                                        \r\n\n116 S. Ct. 1480, 1486-88 (1996).\r\n\n     Putting aside racial motives,  we note that the district\r\n\ncourt deemed  the entire  harassment  charge unsupported  and\r\n\ndeclined to discuss it at length.   On the other hand, if one\r\n\naccepts  Holland's deposition testimony, there were obviously\r\n\nprior incidents and some  ongoing tension between Holland and\r\n\nthe police.  In addition, Holland's name had  been circulated\r\n\nwithin  the police department,  although that  standing alone\r\n\nwould  not  be wrongful.   See  Paul v.  Davis, 424  U.S. 693\r                                                          \r\n\n(1976); United States v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 428 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1995).\r\n\n     But  even  if assuming  that  a  jury  might think  that\r\n\nHolland had  been harassed in the  past, we do not  see how a\r\n\nreasonable jury could decide  that this was the cause  of his\r\n\narrest  in this instance.   Such a charge  is contradicted by\r\n\nHolland's  own precise version of what the police said at the\r\n\narrest.   That  version indicates  that the  police officers'\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nimmediate reasons for  the arrest  were, at  worst, a  belief\r\n\nthat  Holland was  a suspect  in  the bank  robbery, possibly\r\n\naggravated  by  his  refusal  to cooperate  or  disclose  his\r\n\nwhereabouts at the time.\r\n\n     We  must say in candor that Holland would have an uphill\r\n\nroad  to climb  even if  he had  plausibly claimed  that some\r\n\ngeneral  police  animosity lay  behind  this  arrest.   Given\r\n\nWhren,  any plaintiff is  going to  have difficulty  in using\r                 \r\n\nsubjective  motive to  attack  an arrest  which is  otherwise\r\n\nobjectively justified by probable  cause.  But the variations\r\n\nin  facts, and certain extreme possibilities, caution against\r\n\ndeciding too much in the abstract.\r\n\n     3.   The  claim  of  municipal  liability in  this  case\r\n\ndepended  on  Holland's  claim  that  the  officers  violated\r\n\nHolland's constitutional rights by arresting him as a part of\r\n\ntheir campaign  of harassment.   Holland sought  to implicate\r\n\nthe  city, under Monell v. New York City Department of Social\r                                                                         \r\n\nServices, 436  U.S. 658,  694 (1978),  by  charging that  the\r                    \r\n\nharassment grew  out of an officially  established program of\r\n\ntargeting suspects, including the circulation  of information\r\n\nabout them.\r\n\n      Whatever  \"custom  or   policy\"  the   city  may   have\r\n\nmaintained   toward  individuals   that  the   police  deemed\r\n\nsuspicious, Holland  cannot show that  it was \"the  cause of,\r\n\nand moving force behind,\" his arrest  in this case.  Foley v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nCity of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 1991).  Further, we\r                          \r\n\nhave  concluded that  the  arrest was  itself lawful  because\r\n\nprobable cause  existed and Holland has  offered no supported\r\n\nbasis for overcoming Whren.  Thus, the claim against the city\r                                      \r\n\nwas properly dismissed.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n",

Following discovery, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all of Holland's claims.  Holland appeals from the court's judgment dismissing his section 1983, but not his state law, claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, taken most favorably to Holland, are as follows.  At about 1:20 p.m. on October 18, 1994, Portland police radio traffic reported a robbery at the Key Bank in Canal Plaza.  The police dispatcher described the suspect as a black male, about 6'2\"' tall, 185 pounds, unshaven, wearing a brown jacket, possibly suede, and a black hat, and carrying a black leather briefcase.  The dispatcher reported that the suspect had fled on foot and did not indicate that any vehicle had been involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after 2:00 p.m. on the same day, Holland was driving a Subaru to the Cumberland County Courthouse in Portland.  He drove past a bicycle patrolman, Daniel Knight, and turned the corner.  Knight had heard the dispatcher's report about the robbery.  When he saw the Subaru, he noticed that the driver, Holland, was a tall, thin black man wearing a brown or black jacket and a hat who appeared to meet the description of the suspect, and he also noticed that the car had no back window.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight reported to the police dispatcher, \"Ten-twenty on Rory Holland, he's in the area.\"   Although Knight had not met Holland, he thought that the Subaru driver fit descriptions of Holland that Knight had seen in police bulletins.  The dispatcher asked if Holland's clothing matched that of the reported suspect.  Knight did not respond, but the dispatcher immediately sent backup police units and indicated that the suspect was a \"possible match.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After turning the corner Holland parked his car and started walking across the street towards the courthouse.  He wore a brown tweed jacket and a brown leather hat, and was carrying a black nylon briefcase and a white canvas book bag.  Knight stopped Holland in the crosswalk and, addressing Holland by name, said that a bank robbery had just been committed and asked where Holland had been.  Knight also asked about the contents of Holland's bag.  Holland remained silent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coffin, Rizzo, and another officer soon arrived at the scene, and the officers then walked up to Holland, backing him up to his car.  Coffin was familiar with Holland's past history from information circulated within the police department and thought that the Subaru driver was Holland.  Rizzo had also heard about Holland in department briefings and previously had seen a photograph of Holland.  Coffin and Rizzo then began to ask Holland questions concerning the bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rizzo told Holland that he was not under arrest, and that the police just wanted to learn about the bank robbery, Holland remained silent.  Noticing the missing rear window in Holland's car, Rizzo asked Knight if Holland had been driving.  When Knight said that he had, Rizzo allegedly said, \"well, then we can get him for not having a license or something or other.\"   Rizzo then said, \"Rory, you know, I can arrest you if you don't show me a valid driver's license and tell me where you live....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland continued to remain silent.  Rizzo asked Holland several more times to produce his license and to tell Rizzo where he lived, saying that otherwise Rizzo would arrest him \"for failure to identify yourself to me.\"   Eventually, Rizzo told Holland that he was under arrest.  At that point, Rizzo and Coffin patted down Holland, removed his wallet, and found a driver's license in the wallet that identified the driver as Rory Holland.  Rizzo then allegedly said, \"I guess we got a license in here, I guess we can't get you for that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coffin and Rizzo took Holland to the Cumberland County Jail.  According to Holland, some officers referred to him as a bank robbery suspect.  Holland refused to speak with the booking officer or others at the jail.  Holland was released on bail after the police apprehended another bank robbery suspect.  Ultimately, no charges of any kind were pressed against Holland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Holland brought the present suit against Rizzo, Coffin and the city.  As the basis for his section 1983 claim, Holland alleged that his arrest had violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him for any reason, that the actual charge was a pretext to detain him for questioning about the bank robbery, and that the arrest was retaliation for his refusal to speak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of discovery Holland--who had previously been in disputes with the Portland police--learned that some weeks before the arrest, the police had circulated information about him in so-called crime alert bulletins.  Knitting the bulletins together with the disputes, Holland suggested that his arrest was part of a general campaign of harassment directed against him by the police.  Holland did not amend his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1996, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The district court ruled that the police had probable cause to arrest Holland for failing to identify himself or provide his license.  It called the charge of harassment \"hollow.\"   And it ruled that the city was not liable because, quite apart from the lack of a municipal custom or policy, this arrest had been justified.  Holland now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. On review of a grant of summary judgment, this court considers the matter de novo, taking the facts most favorably to the non-moving party.  St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2548, 135 L.Ed.2d 1068 (1996).  We begin by considering whether the police had probable cause to arrest Holland--that is, whether the facts known to the police indicated that Holland had committed a criminal offense.  The parties agree that Holland was charged with violating 29 Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2501 (later renumbered) which said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever, while operating a vehicle in violation of this [motor vehicle regulations] Title, fails or refuses, when requested by an officer authorized to make arrests, to give the operator's correct name, address and date of birth is guilty of a Class E crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, the literal language might appear to make the officers' authority depend upon whether the driver was actually operating in violation of state law.  But the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted section 2501 to permit an officer to stop a driver and ask his name on the basis of an articulable suspicion that the driver has done something wrong.  State v. Littlefield, 677 A.2d 1055, 1057 (Me.1996).  Indeed, even if it then becomes clear that the suspected violation had not occurred, the officer may still insist on seeing the driver's license and registration.  State v. Hill, 606 A.2d 793, 794-95 (Me.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland may not have violated any motor vehicle law by driving with a missing rear window.  But the missing rear window, or any other similar non-cosmetic damage, could reasonably create a suspicion of such a violation.  See 29 Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2503(1)(D) (requiring that motor vehicle equipment \"[n]ot pose a hazard....\").  Thus, when the officers asked Holland to identify himself, section 2501 required Holland to provide his name, address, and date of birth--or face arrest.  See 17-A Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 15(B) (authorizing arrest for Class E crimes committed in an officer's presence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland does not challenge the initial stop, see Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), nor argue that the statute itself is unconstitutional.  Cf. California v. Byers, 402 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 1535, 29 L.Ed.2d 9 (1971).  He instead argues that the police had no reason to request his name since they already knew it, citing Rodriguez v. Comas, 888 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1989).  But where the law requires the motorist to supply his name, the police can reasonably insist upon confirmation.  Further, the police also sought Holland's present address, which the statute required him to provide, and there is no indication that the police had this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland's reliance on Rodriguez is misplaced.  There, Rodriguez was arrested on a charge of obstruction of justice because he declined to provide his name and address to an officer.  Rodriguez was well known to the officer, and there was no separate statute--such as Maine's motor vehicle law--requiring that he provide his name and address.  This court held only that the refusal could not even arguably constitute \"obstruction of justice\" where the refusal to provide this already-known information neither could nor did obstruct the officer's investigation.  888 F.2d at 902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quoting language from other cases, Holland also claims that police officers may not arrest a suspect if they can obtain the information that they seek through a reasonable investigation.  See Sevigny v. Dicksey, 846 F.2d 953 (4th Cir.1988);  BeVier v. Hucal, 806 F.2d 123 (7th Cir.1986).  But these cases impose no such limitation;  rather, they demand that officers undertake reasonable investigation to determine whether probable cause exists to arrest a suspect.  Sevigny, 846 F.2d at 957-58;  BeVier, 806 F.2d at 127.   Here, Holland committed the offense in the presence of the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Although Holland devotes much of his brief to disputing the police claim of probable cause, he has a fall-back contention less easily resolved.  Fairly construing his arguments, we take him to challenge the validity of his arrest even assuming probable cause (which he disputes strongly but we find to be established).  In sum, he says that the police nominally arrested him for refusing to give his name and address but that this was a \"pretext\" because the arrest was motivated by other, more sinister objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Holland's version of events, which must be credited at this stage, see St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24, there is reason for thinking that the police did not care much about the missing car window or Holland's failure to give his name or address.  Indeed, a jury, after a full trial, might well find that the police arrested Holland for a technical violation in order to pursue their investigation into the bank robbery, suspecting Holland of complicity but perhaps lacking enough evidence to arrest him on this charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"pretext\" is sometimes used, as Holland uses it here, with the assertion that the police may not make an arrest otherwise based on probable cause when their true aim is to forward some other investigation.  But aside from dicta, it is hard to find recent holdings to support this proposition;  one exception is the Eleventh Circuit.  United States v. Valdez, 931 F.2d 1448, 1450-51 (11th Cir.1991).  Our own circuit, like several others, has rejected the inquiry into motive.  United States v. McCambridge, 551 F.2d 865, 869-70 (1st Cir.1977).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the Supreme Court recently settled the matter in Whren v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), holding that \"[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\"  Id. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.   There, the Court explicitly rejected the very test used by the Eleventh Circuit in Valdez which asks whether the officer \"would\" have made the stop or arrest absent the \"other\" motive.  See id. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774-75;  see also United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 221 n. 1, 94 S.Ct. 467, 470 n. 1, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (lawful traffic violation arrest was not unconstitutional, despite claim that it was \"a mere pretext for a narcotics search\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conflicting policy concerns are obvious.  On the one hand, motor vehicle operation often gives rise to fairly minor violations, making it easy for the police to find an excuse;  on the other hand, the violation does provide a bright line standard while an inquiry into actual motive, directly or indirectly, invites all kinds of diversion.  See Whren, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774-75.   Further, \"pretextual\" stops or arrests, where probable cause exists and the motive is to investigate another crime, may not seem all that sinister to the Justices, who were unanimous in Whren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How far Whren would extend in the face of dubious motives or other constitutional concerns is a more difficult question, and one not entirely avoidable here.  Holland's version of events suggests that the police aimed not only to hold him for further investigation but also that the arrest itself was retaliation for his refusal to answer questions about the robbery.  According to Holland, after he refused to answer any questions about the bank robbery, Rizzo said that because Holland had been driving, \"well, then we can get him for not having a license or something or other.\"   Holland further asserted that Rizzo was \"obviously upset and angry with me that I would not speak with him at all about the robbery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland's brief barely refers to the Fifth Amendment;  and the law on the relationship between police questioning and the privilege against self-incrimination is an embarrassing tangle.  Historically, the privilege and police questioning were unconnected, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2252, at 328-29 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961);  and the more modern blurring of lines has left unclear whether the privilege can ever be violated by such questioning where no incriminating statement is thereafter used in a proceeding.  See Wiley v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 48 F.3d 773, 777-78 (4th Cir.)  (Powell, J.) cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 89, 133 L.Ed.2d 45 (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Fifth Amendment is put to one side, the defendants do not suggest that Holland had any legal obligation to answer questions about the robbery.  Compare Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 52-53, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 2641-42, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979).  While the police did not purport to arrest Holland for refusing to cooperate, the facts might permit a jury to think that this was their underlying motivation.  Yet assuming this premise, the question remains whether such a motive for an arrest otherwise justified by probable cause alters the message of Whren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, it does not.  The police, prosecutors, and courts constantly make judgments--including decisions not to prosecute or to permit or impose a reduced sentence--based on an assessment of an individual's cooperation.  The decision to arrest, where probable cause exists, is a discretionary one informed by many considerations.  And any attempt to untangle the ascribed motive from a skein of others, in prompting an arrest justified by objective probable cause, would invite exactly the inquiry into police motivation condemned by Whren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Actual motive sometimes does play a role in section 1983 actions.  E.g., Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 114 S.Ct. 1878, 128 L.Ed.2d 686 (1994) (discharge in retaliation for exercise of First Amendment rights).  But in evaluating arrests, the Supreme Court has given primacy to the Fourth Amendment's own objective standards, even where other constitutional bases might be invoked.  Thus, the Court recently rejected an attempt to use substantive due process as a more favorable framework for assessing a claim, at least insofar as it was deemed one for unlawful detention.  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 274-75, 114 S.Ct. 807, 813-14, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not mean that probable cause forecloses every possible challenge to an arrest.  Whren itself strongly implies that an equal protection challenge to an arrest, despite probable cause existing, might yet be entertained, although the court does not say what facts would be needed to support such a challenge.  --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.   An objective showing that (for example) only blacks or Asians were ever arrested for a specific, widely committed offense would pose a different case than Whren.   See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Holland's final claim of ascribing an illicit motive for the arrest.  It is evident from Holland's deposition that he himself thinks (based on prior incidents) that he was a target of general police harassment, resting in part on the fact he is black.  But the racial charge is unsubstantiated by anything we can find in the record and is not directly urged in Holland's appellate brief.  We note it only to stress that our decision does not reach the difficult issues that might be raised by a substantiated charge of racial discrimination.  Compare United States v. Armstrong, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 1486-88, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside racial motives, we note that the district court deemed the entire harassment charge unsupported and declined to discuss it at length.  On the other hand, if one accepts Holland's deposition testimony, there were obviously prior incidents and some ongoing tension between Holland and the police.  In addition, Holland's name had been circulated within the police department, although that standing alone would not be wrongful.  See Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976);  United States v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 428 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if assuming that a jury might think that Holland had been harassed in the past, we do not see how a reasonable jury could decide that this was the cause of his arrest in this instance.  Such a charge is contradicted by Holland's own precise version of what the police said at the arrest.  That version indicates that the police officers' immediate reasons for the arrest were, at worst, a belief that Holland was a suspect in the bank robbery, possibly aggravated by his refusal to cooperate or disclose his whereabouts at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must say in candor that Holland would have an uphill road to climb even if he had plausibly claimed that some general police animosity lay behind this arrest.  Given Whren, any plaintiff is going to have difficulty in using subjective motive to attack an arrest which is otherwise objectively justified by probable cause.  But the variations in facts, and certain extreme possibilities, caution against deciding too much in the abstract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The claim of municipal liability in this case depended on Holland's claim that the officers violated Holland's constitutional rights by arresting him as a part of their campaign of harassment.  Holland sought to implicate the city, under Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), by charging that the harassment grew out of an officially established program of targeting suspects, including the circulation of information about them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever \"custom or policy\" the city may have maintained toward individuals that the police deemed suspicious, Holland cannot show that it was \"the cause of, and moving force behind,\" his arrest in this case.  Foley v. City of Lowell, 948 F.2d 10, 14 (1st Cir.1991).  Further, we have concluded that the arrest was itself lawful because probable cause existed and Holland has offered no supported basis for overcoming Whren. Thus, the claim against the city was properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To the annoyance of commentators, the dominant view in the circuits has favored a strictly objective test as to whether probable cause justifies a search or an arrest.  See 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 1.4(e), at 120-21 &amp; n. 61 (3d ed. 1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Of course, Holland never asserted the privilege when questioned, as is customarily required.  The Supreme Court has said that this requirement may not apply in police-station questioning or like interrogation, Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1143-44, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984), but shortly thereafter it ruled that one held briefly in a traffic stop was not \"in custody\" for purposes of Miranda.  Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3150, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Following discovery, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all of Holland's claims.  Holland appeals from the court's judgment dismissing his section 1983, but not his state law, claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, taken most favorably to Holland, are as follows.  At about 1:20 p.m. on October 18, 1994, Portland police radio traffic reported a robbery at the Key Bank in Canal Plaza.  The police dispatcher described the suspect as a black male, about 6'2\"' tall, 185 pounds, unshaven, wearing a brown jacket, possibly suede, and a black hat, and carrying a black leather briefcase.  The dispatcher reported that the suspect had fled on foot and did not indicate that any vehicle had been involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after 2:00 p.m. on the same day, Holland was driving a Subaru to the Cumberland County Courthouse in Portland.  He drove past a bicycle patrolman, Daniel Knight, and turned the corner.  Knight had heard the dispatcher's report about the robbery.  When he saw the Subaru, he noticed that the driver, Holland, was a tall, thin black man wearing a brown or black jacket and a hat who appeared to meet the description of the suspect, and he also noticed that the car had no back window.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Knight reported to the police dispatcher, \"Ten-twenty on Rory Holland, he's in the area.\"   Although Knight had not met Holland, he thought that the Subaru driver fit descriptions of Holland that Knight had seen in police bulletins.  The dispatcher asked if Holland's clothing matched that of the reported suspect.  Knight did not respond, but the dispatcher immediately sent backup police units and indicated that the suspect was a \"possible match.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After turning the corner Holland parked his car and started walking across the street towards the courthouse.  He wore a brown tweed jacket and a brown leather hat, and was carrying a black nylon briefcase and a white canvas book bag.  Knight stopped Holland in the crosswalk and, addressing Holland by name, said that a bank robbery had just been committed and asked where Holland had been.  Knight also asked about the contents of Holland's bag.  Holland remained silent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coffin, Rizzo, and another officer soon arrived at the scene, and the officers then walked up to Holland, backing him up to his car.  Coffin was familiar with Holland's past history from information circulated within the police department and thought that the Subaru driver was Holland.  Rizzo had also heard about Holland in department briefings and previously had seen a photograph of Holland.  Coffin and Rizzo then began to ask Holland questions concerning the bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Rizzo told Holland that he was not under arrest, and that the police just wanted to learn about the bank robbery, Holland remained silent.  Noticing the missing rear window in Holland's car, Rizzo asked Knight if Holland had been driving.  When Knight said that he had, Rizzo allegedly said, \"well, then we can get him for not having a license or something or other.\"   Rizzo then said, \"Rory, you know, I can arrest you if you don't show me a valid driver's license and tell me where you live....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland continued to remain silent.  Rizzo asked Holland several more times to produce his license and to tell Rizzo where he lived, saying that otherwise Rizzo would arrest him \"for failure to identify yourself to me.\"   Eventually, Rizzo told Holland that he was under arrest.  At that point, Rizzo and Coffin patted down Holland, removed his wallet, and found a driver's license in the wallet that identified the driver as Rory Holland.  Rizzo then allegedly said, \"I guess we got a license in here, I guess we can't get you for that.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coffin and Rizzo took Holland to the Cumberland County Jail.  According to Holland, some officers referred to him as a bank robbery suspect.  Holland refused to speak with the booking officer or others at the jail.  Holland was released on bail after the police apprehended another bank robbery suspect.  Ultimately, no charges of any kind were pressed against Holland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, Holland brought the present suit against Rizzo, Coffin and the city.  As the basis for his section 1983 claim, Holland alleged that his arrest had violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him for any reason, that the actual charge was a pretext to detain him for questioning about the bank robbery, and that the arrest was retaliation for his refusal to speak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of discovery Holland--who had previously been in disputes with the Portland police--learned that some weeks before the arrest, the police had circulated information about him in so-called crime alert bulletins.  Knitting the bulletins together with the disputes, Holland suggested that his arrest was part of a general campaign of harassment directed against him by the police.  Holland did not amend his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1996, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  The district court ruled that the police had probable cause to arrest Holland for failing to identify himself or provide his license.  It called the charge of harassment \"hollow.\"   And it ruled that the city was not liable because, quite apart from the lack of a municipal custom or policy, this arrest had been justified.  Holland now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. On review of a grant of summary judgment, this court considers the matter de novo, taking the facts most favorably to the non-moving party.  St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709033\"><a href=\"/opinion/709033/kathy-st-hilaire-etc-v-city-of-laconia/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></span> (1996).  We begin by considering whether the police had probable cause to arrest Holland--that is, whether the facts known to the police indicated that Holland had committed a criminal offense.  The parties agree that Holland was charged with violating 29 Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2501 (later renumbered) which said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever, while operating a vehicle in violation of this [motor vehicle regulations] Title, fails or refuses, when requested by an officer authorized to make arrests, to give the operator's correct name, address and date of birth is guilty of a Class E crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, the literal language might appear to make the officers' authority depend upon whether the driver was actually operating in violation of state law.  But the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted section 2501 to permit an officer to stop a driver and ask his name on the basis of an articulable suspicion that the driver has done something wrong.  State v. Littlefield, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2089355\"><a href=\"/opinion/2089355/state-v-littlefield/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></a></span>, 1057 (Me.1996).  Indeed, even if it then becomes clear that the suspected violation had not occurred, the officer may still insist on seeing the driver's license and registration.  State v. Hill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2383149\"><a href=\"/opinion/2383149/state-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span>, 794-95 (Me.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland may not have violated any motor vehicle law by driving with a missing rear window.  But the missing rear window, or any other similar non-cosmetic damage, could reasonably create a suspicion of such a violation.  See 29 Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 2503(1)(D) (requiring that motor vehicle equipment \"[n]ot pose a hazard....\").  Thus, when the officers asked Holland to identify himself, section 2501 required Holland to provide his name, address, and date of birth--or face arrest.  See 17-A Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 15(B) (authorizing arrest for Class E crimes committed in an officer's presence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland does not challenge the initial stop, see Terry v.

Comas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531323\"><a href=\"/opinion/531323/jose-denis-rodriguez-v-juan-comas/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989).  But where the law requires the motorist to supply his name, the police can reasonably insist upon confirmation.  Further, the police also sought Holland's present address, which the statute required him to provide, and there is no indication that the police had this information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland's reliance on Rodriguez is misplaced.  There, Rodriguez was arrested on a charge of obstruction of justice because he declined to provide his name and address to an officer.  Rodriguez was well known to the officer, and there was no separate statute--such as Maine's motor vehicle law--requiring that he provide his name and address.  This court held only that the refusal could not even arguably constitute \"obstruction of justice\" where the refusal to provide this already-known information neither could nor did obstruct the officer's investigation.  888 F.2d at 902.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quoting language from other cases, Holland also claims that police officers may not arrest a suspect if they can obtain the information that they seek through a reasonable investigation.  See Sevigny v. Dicksey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506075\"><a href=\"/opinion/506075/diana-pepper-sevigny-v-andrew-f-dicksey-individually-and-the-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1988);  BeVier v.

But these cases impose no such limitation;  rather, they demand that officers undertake reasonable investigation to determine whether probable cause exists to arrest a suspect.  Sevigny, 846 F.2d at 957-58;  BeVier, 806 F.2d at 127.   Here, Holland committed the offense in the presence of the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Although Holland devotes much of his brief to disputing the police claim of probable cause, he has a fall-back contention less easily resolved.  Fairly construing his arguments, we take him to challenge the validity of his arrest even assuming probable cause (which he disputes strongly but we find to be established).  In sum, he says that the police nominally arrested him for refusing to give his name and address but that this was a \"pretext\" because the arrest was motivated by other, more sinister objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Holland's version of events, which must be credited at this stage, see St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24, there is reason for thinking that the police did not care much about the missing car window or Holland's failure to give his name or address.  Indeed, a jury, after a full trial, might well find that the police arrested Holland for a technical violation in order to pursue their investigation into the bank robbery, suspecting Holland of complicity but perhaps lacking enough evidence to arrest him on this charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"pretext\" is sometimes used, as Holland uses it here, with the assertion that the police may not make an arrest otherwise based on probable cause when their true aim is to forward some other investigation.  But aside from dicta, it is hard to find recent holdings to support this proposition;  one exception is the Eleventh Circuit.  United States v. Valdez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"560427\"><a href=\"/opinion/560427/united-states-v-jesus-i-valdez/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1448</span></a></span>, 1450-51 (11th Cir.1991).  Our own circuit, like several others, has rejected the inquiry into motive.  United States v.

There, the Court explicitly rejected the very test used by the Eleventh Circuit in Valdez which asks whether the officer \"would\" have made the stop or arrest absent the \"other\" motive.  See id. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774-75;  see also United States v.

On the one hand, motor vehicle operation often gives rise to fairly minor violations, making it easy for the police to find an excuse;  on the other hand, the violation does provide a bright line standard while an inquiry into actual motive, directly or indirectly, invites all kinds of diversion.  See Whren, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774-75.   Further, \"pretextual\" stops or arrests, where probable cause exists and the motive is to investigate another crime, may not seem all that sinister to the Justices, who were unanimous in Whren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How far Whren would extend in the face of dubious motives or other constitutional concerns is a more difficult question, and one not entirely avoidable here.  Holland's version of events suggests that the police aimed not only to hold him for further investigation but also that the arrest itself was retaliation for his refusal to answer questions about the robbery.  According to Holland, after he refused to answer any questions about the bank robbery, Rizzo said that because Holland had been driving, \"well, then we can get him for not having a license or something or other.\"   Holland further asserted that Rizzo was \"obviously upset and angry with me that I would not speak with him at all about the robbery.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Holland's brief barely refers to the Fifth Amendment;  and the law on the relationship between police questioning and the privilege against self-incrimination is an embarrassing tangle.  Historically, the privilege and police questioning were unconnected, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2252, at 328-29 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961);  and the more modern blurring of lines has left unclear whether the privilege can ever be violated by such questioning where no incriminating statement is thereafter used in a proceeding.

Compare Brown v. Texas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110128\"><a href=\"/opinion/110128/brown-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 52-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110128\"><a href=\"/opinion/110128/brown-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span> (1979).  While the police did not purport to arrest Holland for refusing to cooperate, the facts might permit a jury to think that this was their underlying motivation.  Yet assuming this premise, the question remains whether such a motive for an arrest otherwise justified by probable cause alters the message of Whren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, it does not.  The police, prosecutors, and courts constantly make judgments--including decisions not to prosecute or to permit or impose a reduced sentence--based on an assessment of an individual's cooperation.  The decision to arrest, where probable cause exists, is a discretionary one informed by many considerations.  And any attempt to untangle the ascribed motive from a skein of others, in prompting an arrest justified by objective probable cause, would invite exactly the inquiry into police motivation condemned by Whren.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Actual motive sometimes does play a role in section 1983 actions.  E.g., Waters v. Churchill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087950/waters-v-churchill/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087950\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087950/waters-v-churchill/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span> (1994) (discharge in retaliation for exercise of First Amendment rights).  But in evaluating arrests, the Supreme Court has given primacy to the Fourth Amendment's own objective standards, even where other constitutional bases might be invoked.  Thus, the Court recently rejected an attempt to use substantive due process as a more favorable framework for assessing a claim, at least insofar as it was deemed one for unlawful detention.  Albright v. Oliver, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112924\"><a href=\"/opinion/112924/albright-v-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 274-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112924\"><a href=\"/opinion/112924/albright-v-oliver/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whren itself strongly implies that an equal protection challenge to an arrest, despite probable cause existing, might yet be entertained, although the court does not say what facts would be needed to support such a challenge.  --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1774.   An objective showing that (for example) only blacks or Asians were ever arrested for a specific, widely committed offense would pose a different case than Whren.   See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is evident from Holland's deposition that he himself thinks (based on prior incidents) that he was a target of general police harassment, resting in part on the fact he is black.  But the racial charge is unsubstantiated by anything we can find in the record and is not directly urged in Holland's appellate brief.  We note it only to stress that our decision does not reach the difficult issues that might be raised by a substantiated charge of racial discrimination.  Compare United States v. Armstrong, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On the other hand, if one accepts Holland's deposition testimony, there were obviously prior incidents and some ongoing tension between Holland and the police.  In addition, Holland's name had been circulated within the police department, although that standing alone would not be wrongful.  See Paul v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109402\"><a href=\"/opinion/109402/paul-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Such a charge is contradicted by Holland's own precise version of what the police said at the arrest.  That version indicates that the police officers' immediate reasons for the arrest were, at worst, a belief that Holland was a suspect in the bank robbery, possibly aggravated by his refusal to cooperate or disclose his whereabouts at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must say in candor that Holland would have an uphill road to climb even if he had plausibly claimed that some general police animosity lay behind this arrest.  Given Whren, any plaintiff is going to have difficulty in using subjective motive to attack an arrest which is otherwise objectively justified by probable cause.  But the variations in facts, and certain extreme possibilities, caution against deciding too much in the abstract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The claim of municipal liability in this case depended on Holland's claim that the officers violated Holland's constitutional rights by arresting him as a part of their campaign of harassment.  Holland sought to implicate the city, under Monell v. New York City Department of Social Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span> (1978), by charging that the harassment grew out of an officially established program of targeting suspects, including the circulation of information about them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever \"custom or policy\" the city may have maintained toward individuals that the police deemed suspicious, Holland cannot show that it was \"the cause of, and moving force behind,\" his arrest in this case.  Foley v. City of Lowell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571252\"><a href=\"/opinion/571252/michael-j-foley-v-city-of-lowell-massachusetts-michael-j-foley-v-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1991).  Further, we have concluded that the arrest was itself lawful because probable cause existed and Holland has offered no supported basis for overcoming Whren. Thus, the claim against the city was properly dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To the annoyance of commentators, the dominant view in the circuits has favored a strictly objective test as to whether probable cause justifies a search or an arrest.  See 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 1.4(e), at 120-21 &amp; n. 61 (3d ed. 1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Of course, Holland never asserted the privilege when questioned, as is customarily required.  The Supreme Court has said that this requirement may not apply in police-station questioning or like interrogation, Minnesota v. Murphy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 429-30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
