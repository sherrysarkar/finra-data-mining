Initially,\r\n\nMarshall was acquitted on the  conspiracy count, but the jury\r\n\ndeadlocked on  the possession with  intent charge.   A second\r\n\ntrial,  limited  to the  charge  of  possession with  intent,\r\n\nresulted in a guilty  verdict.  Marshall was sentenced  to 72\r\n\nmonths' incarceration.\r\n\n           Marshall argues on appeal that his conviction  was\r\n\nbrought about  by a  series of errors:  the district  court's\r\n\ndenial of his  motion to  suppress, its failure  to make  the\r\n\npolice produce  a tape recorder and tape which may or may not\r\n\nhave  been in  the hotel  room, and  its limitation  of cross\r\n\nexamination; a DEA agent's inconsistent  testimony before the\r\n\ngrand  jury  and at  trial;  and improper  statements  by the\r\n\nprosecutor in his closing argument.   We reject these  claims\r\n\nand affirm the conviction.   The issue which merits  the most\r\n\ndiscussion is the contention about the \"missing evidence.\"\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          We outline the  facts only as necessary  to set the\r\n\nframework for the issues, because Marshall does not challenge\r\n\nthe  overall sufficiency  of  the evidence.    To the  extent\r\n\nMarshall  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  to\r\n\nsupport the  trial judge's  determination against him  on the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nmotion to suppress,  the evidence is  described in the  light\r\n\nmost  favorable   to  the  government.     United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHernandez, 1997 WL 109200, *1 (1st Cir. Mar. 17, 1997).\r                     \r\n\n          On the  morning of November 30,  1994, a Providence\r\n\npolice lieutenant received  a phone call from  the manager of\r\n\nthe  Day's Hotel in Providence.  The manager reported that he\r\n\nsuspected there  was drug  activity in  Room 312 involving  a\r\n\nRichard   Marshall   and  explained   the  reasons   for  his\r\n\nsuspicions.    The  federal Drug  Enforcement  Administration\r\n\n(\"DEA\")  was brought  into  the case.    The officers  did  a\r\n\nbackground check  on  Richard Marshall  and  came up  with  a\r\n\ncriminal record and a  photograph.  They drove to  the hotel,\r\n\nwhere  the manager confirmed there  had been a  heavy flow of\r\n\ntraffic  in  and  out  of  Marshall's  room,  identified  the\r\n\nphotograph as being of Marshall, and said Marshall had listed\r\n\nhis  car as a Mercedes  Benz on the  hotel registration card.\r\n\nWhile  the officers were in the lot looking for the Mercedes,\r\n\nMarshall  appeared.   The officers identified  themselves and\r\n\nasked if they  could speak  with him.   Marshall agreed,  and\r\n\nwhen they said  there had been complaints about  the activity\r\n\nin his room, he said he had \"his girl\" in the room. \r\n\n          The officers asked which  was his car, and Marshall\r\n\npointed  to a  Toyota, which  had a  different license  plate\r\n\nnumber than the one  he had listed on the  registration card.\r\n\nThe officers asked  permission to look  in the car;  Marshall\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nagreed,  and they searched the car  but found no drugs.  When\r\n\nasked, Marshall  denied ever  having been arrested,  but when\r\n\nshown his arrest record, started to chuckle.\r\n\n          The officers  asked Marshall  if he minded  if they\r\n\nwent to his room.  He said he did not mind  and repeated that\r\n\nhis girl was there.  They all went  up to the room.  Although\r\n\nMarshall  had his  room key,  he knocked  on the  door before\r\n\nopening it.\r\n\n          There  was no  woman  in  the  room.    There  was,\r\n\nhowever,  a  man,  Thomas  Dantzler,  soon to  become  a  co-\r\n\ndefendant.   In addition,  there was a  paper bag  protruding\r\n\nfrom  between the mattress and the  box springs of one of the\r\n\nbeds.  The bag contained  almost 200 grams of heroin,  with a\r\n\nstreet value of about $26,000.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          We address Marshall's claims seriatim.\r                                                           \r\n\nExculpatory Evidence Claim\r                                      \r\n\n          Marshall  asserts  that  he  had  a  micro-cassette\r\n\nrecorder, switched to the  \"on\" position, in the room  at the\r\n\ntime of his arrest,  that the tape captured what  happened in\r\n\nthe  room both before and  during the arrival  of the police,\r\n\nand  that the  tape  would exculpate  him.   It  would  prove\r\n\nexculpatory in at  least two  senses, he submits:   it  would\r\n\nshow that he  and Dantzler  were in fact  talking about  rock\r\n\nconcert promotions, not  drug dealing, and  it would tend  to\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nsupport his version of  the facts -- which  differs radically\r\n\nfrom  the  officers'  version   --  relevant  to  his  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  claims.    There  is  some  room  for  skepticism:\r\n\nwhatever his  conversation with  Dantzler, the drugs  were in\r\n\nhis room, and on the motion to suppress, the court found that\r\n\nhe had consented to  the officers' request to enter  his room\r\n\nbefore they entered the room.  Nonetheless, the government is\r                  \r\n\nobligated  to  produce exculpatory  evidence to  a defendant.\r\n\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\r                             \r\n\n          We set the factual  stage.  Marshall testified that\r\n\nhe recorded  his conversation  with Dantzler about  a concert\r\n\nthey  were  promoting and  that  he  left the  tape  recorder\r\n\nrunning when he left the hotel room to go to the parking lot.\r\n\nThis was done,  he said,  to keep track  of whether  Dantzler\r\n\nused  his telephone.  He  says the recorder  would still have\r\n\nbeen running when he returned to the room and that one of the\r\n\ndetectives picked it up and made a remark about it.\r\n\n          The officers who  were present in  Marshall's hotel\r\n\nroom  tell  a  different story.    DEA  Agent Mansolillo  and\r\n\nDetective Cross both testified  that they did not see  a tape\r\n\nrecorder  in the room.  Detective Lauro indicated that he saw\r\n\na \"narrow\" \"electronic device\" in the room, which he  thought\r\n\n\"might have  been a tape  recorder.\"  Detective  Lauro denied\r\n\npicking  it up  or  saying anything  about  it.   The  fourth\r\n\nofficer,  Detective Gerstmeyer, though cross-examined at some\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nlength by defense  counsel, was  never asked  whether he  had\r\n\nseen  a tape  recorder.   The officers  did seize  some small\r\n\nelectronic equipment (two beepers, two portable phones, and a\r\n\nsmall calculator), but none of them remembered seizing a tape\r\n\nrecorder.\r\n\n          Agent  Mansolillo took  control  of  the drugs  and\r\n\nother seized  evidence, but unfortunately did  not prepare an\r\n\ninventory.   Later, both  the prosecutor and  defense counsel\r\n\nexamined  that evidence and did  not find a  tape recorder or\r\n\ntape.    The  court  asked  the  prosecutor  whether  he  had\r\n\nspecifically questioned the officers  on the existence of the\r\n\nrecorder;  he replied that he  had not.   The court requested\r\n\nthat the prosecutor  do so.   The prosecutor  did check,  but\r\n\nwith only two of the four officers.  The court instructed the\r\n\nprosecutor  to go back and check with the other two officers;\r\n\nthe prosecutor failed to  do so, but defense counsel  did not\r\n\npursue the issue any further.  The judge stated that he could\r\n\nnot require the government to produce something which it said\r\n\nit  did  not have.    Defense counsel  did  cross-examine the\r\n\nofficers  about  the tape  recorder  and  argued the  missing\r\n\nevidence theory to the jury.\r\n\n          Marshall's  exculpatory  evidence argument  has two\r\n\npredicates:   that the recorder and tape existed and that the\r\n\ncontents of the tape were exculpatory.  His claim flounders.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Marshall  does  not argue  that the  government did\r\n\npossess  the tape recorder and  tape and destroyed  it in bad\r\n\nfaith.   Cf. Arizona v. Youngblood,  488 U.S. 51 (1988).   He\r                                              \r\n\ndoes not  even argue  that  the government  removed the  tape\r\n\nrecorder and tape from the hotel  room.  He simply says  that\r\n\nthe  recorder was there, the government  agents were aware of\r\n\nit, the agents were the ones who seized the evidence, and the\r\n\ntape should have been produced.\r\n\n          United States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990 (1st Cir. 1993),\r                                            \r\n\nwhich the government cites  as dispositive, does not directly\r\n\naddress the issue here.  In  Femia, there was no dispute over\r                                              \r\n\nwhether certain  tape recordings  existed; the issue  was the\r\n\nconsequences of the  government's inadvertent destruction  of\r\n\nthe tapes.\r\n\n          The government also cites United States v. Pedraza,\r                                                                        \r\n\n27  F.3d  1515 (10th  Cir.  1994), which  is  more pertinent.\r\n\nThere the defendants claimed  that a government informant had\r\n\ntaped  certain calls  and that  the government had  failed to\r\n\nproduce  the tape recordings of  the calls.   Id. at 1526-27.\r                                                             \r\n\nThe  court  concluded  that the  defendants  \"have  presented\r\n\ninsufficient evidence  that the  government either  failed to\r\n\nturn over 'missing tapes,'  or that it destroyed them  in bad\r\n\nfaith.  The fact  of the matter is, [defendants]  have failed\r\n\nto  produce any  convincing  evidence that  these tapes  ever\r\n\nexisted.\"  Id.  at 1527.  The defendants' claim  was based on\r                          \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nan equivocal  statement from the informant  that he attempted\r\n\nto record all the calls.\r\n\n          Like the  court in Pedraza, we  think the defendant\r                                                \r\n\nhere bore the initial burden of persuading the district court\r\n\nthat  there  was reason  to  believe  the recorder  and  tape\r\n\nexisted.  He did not do so.  Absent a rare case in  which the\r\n\ngovernment  may be in a better position than the defendant to\r\n\ndisprove the existence of evidence claimed to be exculpatory,\r\n\nthere  is   no  unfairness  in  placing  the  burden  on  the\r\n\ndefendant.  It  is difficult for  the government to  disprove\r\n\nthe existence of  something and easy for defendants  to claim\r\n\nthat  something  existed and  was  exculpatory  but that  the\r\n\ngovernment failed to preserve it.\r\n\n          Placing the initial burden on the defendant is also\r\n\nconsistent with  the general law in the  area.  Even where it\r\n\nis  undisputed  that \"missing  evidence\"  exists,  it is  the\r\n\ndefendant's  burden to  show that  the evidence  is material,\r\n\nthat is,  that \"there is  a reasonable probability  that, had\r\n\nthe evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the\r\n\nproceeding  would have  been  different.\"   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nBagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985).\r                  \r\n\n          Defendants also  bear a  two-part burden to  show a\r\n\nconstitutional   violation  when  the   government  fails  to\r\n\npreserve evidence on their  behalf.  California v. Trombetta,\r                                                                        \r\n\n467  U.S. 479  (1984) (breath  alcohol test).    The \"missing\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nevidence\"  must  possess  an  \"exculpatory   value  that  was\r\n\napparent before the  evidence was destroyed\" and must  be \"of\r\n\nsuch  a nature that the  defendant would be  unable to obtain\r\n\ncomparable  evidence  by other  reasonably  available means.\"\r\n\nId. at 489;  see also Femia,  9 F.3d at  993.  In Arizona  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nYoungblood,  the Court imposed a third  burden on a defendant\r                      \r\n\nwhere   the   potentially  exculpatory   evidence   has  been\r\n\ndestroyed: that of showing the government acted  in bad faith\r\n\nin  destroying the evidence.   488  U.S. at  58.   Under this\r\n\nprecedent, absent some unusual situation, the initial  burden\r\n\nis  on  the defendant  to show  the  evidence existed.   That\r\n\nburden was not satisfied here.\r\n\n          The  related  evidentiary claim  that  the district\r\n\ncourt  improperly limited the  cross-examination of Detective\r\n\nLauro, as beyond the scope of direct, is without merit.\r\n\nFourth Amendment Claims\r                                   \r\n\n          Marshall makes two Fourth Amendment  arguments: (1)\r\n\nthat he did not  consent to have  the police enter his  room,\r\n\nand therefore all evidence that came from the room was seized\r\n\nillegally, and (2) that he  was under de facto arrest.   Both\r\n\ncontentions require  that Marshall's version of  the facts be\r\n\naccepted and the government's version rejected.  The district\r\n\ncourt's factual determinations depended in large part on whom\r\n\nthe court believed, as the testimony of the witnesses painted\r\n\ntwo very different scenarios.  The district court disbelieved\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nMarshall's version.  Factual findings by the judge may not be\r\n\nreversed   unless  clearly  erroneous.     United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCleveland, 1997 WL 61397, *7 (1st Cir. Feb. 18, 1997).  There\r                     \r\n\ncan  be no  clear error  where factual  findings turn  on the\r\n\ncredibility  of the  witnesses who  appear before  the judge.\r\n\nUnited States v. Cruz Jimenez, 894 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                         \r\n\nDefendant  having consented,  there  is  no Fourth  Amendment\r\n\nissue  regarding  the  seized  evidence.   United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nZapata, 18 F.3d 971 (1st Cir. 1994). \r                  \r\n\n          The  district  court  also  disbelieved  Marshall's\r\n\ntestimony  on which he relies for the de facto arrest theory.\r\n\nThere being no  error in the finding  that Marshall consented\r\n\nto the  officers' request  to  enter his  room, the  district\r\n\ncourt's  conclusion that  there  was no  de  facto arrest  is\r\n\nhardly clear error.\r\n\n          For  the same reasons, we  uphold the denial of the\r\n\nmotion  to  suppress the  drugs.   The  trial judge  chose to\r\n\nbelieve  the  testimony  of  the  officers,  who  provided  a\r\n\nsufficient predicate.\r\n\nMotion to Suppress Marshall's Statements.\r                                                    \r\n\n          Marshall   argues  that   the   court  abused   its\r\n\ndiscretion  in  refusing  to  hear  his  motion  to  suppress\r\n\nstatements he made before  the drugs were found in  his room.\r\n\nThe district court found that Marshall had waived this motion\r\n\nby failing to make it in a timely fashion.  We agree. \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          Marshall  filed the  motion to  suppress statements\r\n\ntwo months after  the date  the motions were  due.   Marshall\r\n\nalso  did  not  object  to  the  statements  when  they  were\r\n\nintroduced into evidence.   Because Marshall  failed properly\r\n\nto raise the  issue in the district court, we do not consider\r\n\nit.  United States v. Nunez, 19 F.3d 719 (1st Cir. 1994).  We\r                                       \r\n\nadd  that the motion is  premised on Marshall's argument that\r\n\nhe did not give consent  to enter his room and, as  a result,\r\n\nhe was in custody and should have been informed of his rights\r\n\nunder  Miranda v. Arizona, 384  U.S. 436 (1966).   Thus, even\r                                     \r\n\nhad there  not been  waiver, the argument  would have  failed\r\n\nbecause  the  court  determined  the  consent  issue  against\r\n\nMarshall.\r\n\nGrand Jury Testimony\r                                \r\n\n          The testimony given by DEA  Agent Mansolillo varied\r\n\nslightly  at trial from the testimony he had given before the\r\n\ngrand jury about exactly where the bag of drugs was found and\r\n\nabout  the  sequence  of   actions  by  a  Providence  police\r\n\nlieutenant who was  in the  room.  The  agent was  thoroughly\r\n\ncross-examined  on the  point.   It appears  that this  is an\r\n\ninstance of  confusion or mistake  in the agent's  grand jury\r\n\ntestimony,  and there is nothing  in the record  before us to\r\n\nsuggest  perjury.   The dispute  about where  the drugs  were\r\n\nfound  in the room was largely  immaterial to the indictment:\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nwhether the drugs  were under  the mattress or  not does  not\r\n\nundermine the charge of possession with intent to distribute.\r\n\n          Even  if there  were  an error  in  the grand  jury\r\n\nprocess, and we do not suggest there was one, defendant had a\r\n\nfair  trial,  and  the  verdict  renders  any  error  at  the\r\n\npreliminary stage  harmless now.  United  States v. Mechanik,\r                                                                        \r\n\n475 U.S. 66, 72-73 (1986).\r\n\nProsecutor's Closing Argument\r                                         \r\n\n          To   understand   Marshall's   objection   to   the\r\n\nprosecutor's summation,  the procedural history  of the  case\r\n\nmust  be recalled.  This  is Marshall's second  trial; in the\r\n\nfirst  trial, he was acquitted  of a charge  of conspiracy to\r\n\ndistribute drugs.\r\n\n          Marshall  says  that   the  prosecutor   improperly\r\n\naccused him of a conspiracy in the face of an acquittal, that\r\n\nthe  prosecutor relied on facts not in evidence, and that the\r\n\nprosecutor improperly vouched for a  witness.  The first  two\r\n\npoints are related.  \r\n\n          While   the  prosecutor   never   used   the   word\r\n\n\"conspiracy,\"  and  never  referred  to the  prior  trial  or\r\n\ncharges, Marshall says  that he  did so in  essence with  the\r\n\nfollowing argument:\r\n\n          I submit to you that the two of them were\r\n          working   together   and  this   is  what\r\n          happened.   That the drugs  were flown in\r\n          from Chicago that day.\r\n\n          . . . .\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          The defendant met Dantzler, the other man\r\n          who  brought the  drugs in  from Chicago.\r\n          And they set up together in that room and\r\n          the plan, I submit  to you, was for them,\r\n          for Marshall to be the middleman for  the\r\n          sale of  those  drugs, the  wholesale  of\r\n          those drugs to people in Providence.\r\n\n          Marshall relies  on United  States v. McBride,  862\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 1316  (8th Cir. 1988),  where the Eighth  Circuit upheld\r\n\nthe trial  court's discretionary ruling awarding  a new trial\r\n\ndue to  three trial  errors.   One of  the errors involved  a\r\n\nstatement  made  by  a  prosecutor in  final  argument  which\r\n\nappeared  to  refer to  counts  previously  dismissed and  to\r\n\nconflict with  the  evidence.    Id.  at  1318.    Marshall's\r                                                \r\n\nargument  is not  frivolous, but,  on balance,  we think  the\r\n\nprosecution  did  not exceed  the  bounds.   The  presence of\r\n\nDantzler in the room and the quantity of drugs fairly support\r\n\nthe  \"with intent  to distribute\"  portion of  the possession\r\n\ncharge.\r\n\n          The  prosecutor's  words  suggested,  we  think,  a\r\n\npermissible  inference from  the evidence produced  at trial,\r\n\nand  were  not a  reference to  the  conspiracy charge.   The\r\n\nstatement was within the allowable scope of argument.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212 (1st Cir. 1994).  Even\r                                     \r\n\nif the prosecutor's remarks were an improper veiled reference\r\n\nto   the  conspiracy  charge,   they  were  not  sufficiently\r\n\negregious to warrant a reversal of the verdict.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          The   argument  about  improperly  vouching  for  a\r\n\nwitness  is  based on  three  portions  of the  prosecution's\r\n\nclosing:\r\n\n          Mr.  Marshall, in  effect,  has  said  by\r\n          telling the version he is  saying, he, in\r\n          effect, has said to  you, the police  are\r\n          not telling  you  the truth.   That  they\r\n          have  come in  here  and  taken the  oath\r\n          about  what  happened,  and they  haven't\r\n          told you the truth under oath.\r\n\n          . . . .\r\n\n          They say, I submit to you, they have told\r\n          the    story    the    way    it    truly\r\n          unfolded . . . .\r\n\n          . . . .\r\n\n          So, I ask you  in choosing between  these\r\n          versions think carefully  about what  the\r\n          police  could have  done  if  these  men,\r\n          Steven Cross,  Detective Lauro, Detective\r\n          Gerstmeyer, Detective Mansolillo had been\r\n          people  who  would  deliberately come  in\r\n          here and  tell you  the truth.   Yes, you\r\n          will hear undoubtedly  in summation  that\r\n          Detective  Mansolillo  made a  mistake in\r\n          the  Grand Jury.   People  make mistakes,\r\n          and he corrected it here.  All right.\r\n\nDefendant  did not object to  what he now  attacks as witness\r\n\nvouching,  and so  our review  in this  context is  for plain\r\n\nerror.  United States v. Grabiec, 96 F.3d  549, 550 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1996); United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1187-88 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir.  1993).   These  first two  comments  do not,  we think,\r\n\namount to  improper vouching.  United  States v. Cruz-Kuilan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n75 F.3d  59, 62  (1st  Cir. 1996)  (holding  that it  is  not\r\n\nvouching  for  prosecutor to  say  that jury  should  come to\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nbelieve  on the evidence that the events occurred the way the\r\n\ngovernment's witnesses said they did).\r\n\n          The  last statement  is  simply too  garbled to  be\r\n\nvouching.  We  assume what  the prosecutor meant  to say  was\r\n\nthat the Providence  police would not permit  its officers to\r\n\ndeliberately tell lies.   He said, as  best we can tell,  the\r\n\nopposite.  Defendant has  no complaint.  Even if  the remarks\r\n\nwere  inappropriate,  an  inappropriate  comment   is  not  a\r\n\nreversible  error unless  it is  likely to have  affected the\r\n\noutcome  of   the  trial.     United  States   v.  Cartagena-\r                                                                         \r\n\nCarrasquillo,  70  F.3d 706,  713  (1st  Cir.  1995).   These\r                        \r\n\ncomments did not likely affect the outcome of the trial.\r\n\n          It is an oft-heard complaint that the prosecutor is\r\n\nputting  his personal endorsement on the scale.  Of course he\r\n\nshould not do so, but there are two sides to this.  Not every\r\n\nfactual  recitation in the  prosecutor's argument  must start\r\n\nwith a personal  disclaimer.   It is one  thing to  emphasize\r\n\npersonal endorsement.   It is  another for the  prosecutor to\r\n\nrefer  to the  evidence  in factual  form  as he  goes  along\r\n\nwithout  constant qualification.   The  line, of  course, may\r\n\nsometimes be close.  But an excellent test is whether counsel\r\n\ncontemporaneously  thinks  the  line  has been  crossed,  and\r\n\nobjects, which,  in turn, enables  the court to  instruct the\r\n\njury.   In the absence of such objections, plain error review\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nis  called for.  There is no  plain error here.

Initially, Marshall was acquitted on the conspiracy count, but the jury deadlocked on the possession with intent charge.  A second trial, limited to the charge of possession with intent, resulted in a guilty verdict.  Marshall was sentenced to 72 months' incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall argues on appeal that his conviction was brought about by a series of errors:  the district court's denial of his motion to suppress, its failure to make the police produce a tape recorder and tape which may or may not have been in the hotel room, and its limitation of cross examination;  a DEA agent's inconsistent testimony before the grand jury and at trial;  and improper statements by the prosecutor in his closing argument.  We reject these claims and affirm the conviction.  The issue which merits the most discussion is the contention about the \"missing evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We outline the facts only as necessary to set the framework for the issues, because Marshall does not challenge the overall sufficiency of the evidence.  To the extent Marshall challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial judge's determination against him on the motion to suppress, the evidence is described in the light most favorable to the government.  United States v. Hernandez, 109 F.3d 13, 14 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of November 30, 1994, a Providence police lieutenant received a phone call from the manager of the Day's Hotel in Providence.  The manager reported that he suspected there was drug activity in Room 312 involving a Richard Marshall and explained the reasons for his suspicions.  The federal Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") was brought into the case.  The officers did a background check on Richard Marshall and came up with a criminal record and a photograph.  They drove to the hotel, where the manager confirmed there had been a heavy flow of traffic in and out of Marshall's room, identified the photograph as being of Marshall, and said Marshall had listed his car as a Mercedes Benz on the hotel registration card.  While the officers were in the lot looking for the Mercedes, Marshall appeared.  The officers identified themselves and asked if they could speak with him.  Marshall agreed, and when they said there had been complaints about the activity in his room, he said he had \"his girl\" in the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers asked which was his car, and Marshall pointed to a Toyota, which had a different license plate number than the one he had listed on the registration card.  The officers asked permission to look in the car;  Marshall agreed, and they searched the car but found no drugs.  When asked, Marshall denied ever having been arrested, but when shown his arrest record, started to chuckle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers asked Marshall if he minded if they went to his room.  He said he did not mind and repeated that his girl was there.  They all went up to the room.  Although Marshall had his room key, he knocked on the door before opening it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no woman in the room.  There was, however, a man, Thomas Dantzler, soon to become a co-defendant.  In addition, there was a paper bag protruding from between the mattress and the box springs of one of the beds.  The bag contained almost 200 grams of heroin, with a street value of about $26,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address Marshall's claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Exculpatory Evidence Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall asserts that he had a micro-cassette recorder, switched to the \"on\" position, in the room at the time of his arrest, that the tape captured what happened in the room both before and during the arrival of the police, and that the tape would exculpate him.  It would prove exculpatory in at least two senses, he submits:  it would show that he and Dantzler were in fact talking about rock concert promotions, not drug dealing, and it would tend to support his version of the facts--which differs radically from the officers' version--relevant to his Fourth Amendment claims.  There is some room for skepticism:  whatever his conversation with Dantzler, the drugs were in his room, and on the motion to suppress, the court found that he had consented to the officers' request to enter his room before they entered the room.  Nonetheless, the government is obligated to produce exculpatory evidence to a defendant.  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set the factual stage.  Marshall testified that he recorded his conversation with Dantzler about a concert they were promoting and that he left the tape recorder running when he left the hotel room to go to the parking lot.  This was done, he said, to keep track of whether Dantzler used his telephone.  He says the recorder would still have been running when he returned to the room and that one of the detectives picked it up and made a remark about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers who were present in Marshall's hotel room tell a different story.  DEA Agent Mansolillo and Detective Cross both testified that they did not see a tape recorder in the room.  Detective Lauro indicated that he saw a \"narrow\" \"electronic device\" in the room, which he thought \"might have been a tape recorder.\"   Detective Lauro denied picking it up or saying anything about it.  The fourth officer, Detective Gerstmeyer, though cross-examined at some length by defense counsel, was never asked whether he had seen a tape recorder.  The officers did seize some small electronic equipment (two beepers, two portable phones, and a small calculator), but none of them remembered seizing a tape recorder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Mansolillo took control of the drugs and other seized evidence, but unfortunately did not prepare an inventory.  Later, both the prosecutor and defense counsel examined that evidence and did not find a tape recorder or tape.  The court asked the prosecutor whether he had specifically questioned the officers on the existence of the recorder;  he replied that he had not.  The court requested that the prosecutor do so.  The prosecutor did check, but with only two of the four officers.  The court instructed the prosecutor to go back and check with the other two officers;  the prosecutor failed to do so, but defense counsel did not pursue the issue any further.  The judge stated that he could not require the government to produce something which it said it did not have.  Defense counsel did cross-examine the officers about the tape recorder and argued the missing evidence theory to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall's exculpatory evidence argument has two predicates:  that the recorder and tape existed and that the contents of the tape were exculpatory.  His claim flounders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall does not argue that the government did possess the tape recorder and tape and destroyed it in bad faith.  Cf. Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988).  He does not even argue that the government removed the tape recorder and tape from the hotel room.  He simply says that the recorder was there, the government agents were aware of it, the agents were the ones who seized the evidence, and the tape should have been produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Femia, 9 F.3d 990 (1st Cir.1993), which the government cites as dispositive, does not directly address the issue here.  In Femia, there was no dispute over whether certain tape recordings existed;  the issue was the consequences of the government's inadvertent destruction of the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also cites United States v. Pedraza, 27 F.3d 1515 (10th Cir.1994), which is more pertinent.  There the defendants claimed that a government informant had taped certain calls and that the government had failed to produce the tape recordings of the calls.  Id. at 1526-27.   The court concluded that the defendants \"have presented insufficient evidence that the government either failed to turn over 'missing tapes,' or that it destroyed them in bad faith.  The fact of the matter is, [defendants] have failed to produce any convincing evidence that these tapes ever existed.\"  Id. at 1527.   The defendants' claim was based on an equivocal statement from the informant that he attempted to record all the calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the court in Pedraza, we think the defendant here bore the initial burden of persuading the district court that there was reason to believe the recorder and tape existed.  He did not do so.  Absent a rare case in which the government may be in a better position than the defendant to disprove the existence of evidence claimed to be exculpatory, there is no unfairness in placing the burden on the defendant.  It is difficult for the government to disprove the existence of something and easy for defendants to claim that something existed and was exculpatory but that the government failed to preserve it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placing the initial burden on the defendant is also consistent with the general law in the area.  Even where it is undisputed that \"missing evidence\" exists, it is the defendant's burden to show that the evidence is material, that is, that \"there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also bear a two-part burden to show a constitutional violation when the government fails to preserve evidence on their behalf.  California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984) (breath alcohol test).  The \"missing evidence\" must possess an \"exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed\" and must be \"of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\"  Id. at 489, 104 S.Ct. at 2534;  see also Femia, 9 F.3d at 993.   In Arizona v. Youngblood, the Court imposed a third burden on a defendant where the potentially exculpatory evidence has been destroyed:  that of showing the government acted in bad faith in destroying the evidence.  488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. at 337-38.   Under this precedent, absent some unusual situation, the initial burden is on the defendant to show the evidence existed.  That burden was not satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The related evidentiary claim that the district court improperly limited the cross-examination of Detective Lauro, as beyond the scope of direct, is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Fourth Amendment Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall makes two Fourth Amendment arguments:  (1) that he did not consent to have the police enter his room, and therefore all evidence that came from the room was seized illegally, and (2) that he was under de facto arrest.  Both contentions require that Marshall's version of the facts be accepted and the government's version rejected.  The district court's factual determinations depended in large part on whom the court believed, as the testimony of the witnesses painted two very different scenarios.  The district court disbelieved Marshall's version.  Factual findings by the judge may not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.  United States v. Cleveland, 106 F.3d 1056, 1063-64 (1st Cir. 1997).  There can be no clear error where factual findings turn on the credibility of the witnesses who appear before the judge.  United States v. Cruz Jimenez, 894 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1990).  Defendant having consented, there is no Fourth Amendment issue regarding the seized evidence.  United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also disbelieved Marshall's testimony on which he relies for the de facto arrest theory.  There being no error in the finding that Marshall consented to the officers' request to enter his room, the district court's conclusion that there was no de facto arrest is hardly clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons, we uphold the denial of the motion to suppress the drugs.  The trial judge chose to believe the testimony of the officers, who provided a sufficient predicate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Motion to Suppress Marshall's Statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall argues that the court abused its discretion in refusing to hear his motion to suppress statements he made before the drugs were found in his room.  The district court found that Marshall had waived this motion by failing to make it in a timely fashion.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall filed the motion to suppress statements two months after the date the motions were due.  Marshall also did not object to the statements when they were introduced into evidence.  Because Marshall failed properly to raise the issue in the district court, we do not consider it.  United States v. Nunez, 19 F.3d 719 (1st Cir.1994).  We add that the motion is premised on Marshall's argument that he did not give consent to enter his room and, as a result, he was in custody and should have been informed of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  Thus, even had there not been waiver, the argument would have failed because the court determined the consent issue against Marshall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Grand Jury Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony given by DEA Agent Mansolillo varied slightly at trial from the testimony he had given before the grand jury about exactly where the bag of drugs was found and about the sequence of actions by a Providence police lieutenant who was in the room.  The agent was thoroughly cross-examined on the point.  It appears that this is an instance of confusion or mistake in the agent's grand jury testimony, and there is nothing in the record before us to suggest perjury.  The dispute about where the drugs were found in the room was largely immaterial to the indictment:  whether the drugs were under the mattress or not does not undermine the charge of possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there were an error in the grand jury process, and we do not suggest there was one, defendant had a fair trial, and the verdict renders any error at the preliminary stage harmless now.  United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 72-73, 106 S.Ct. 938, 942-43, 89 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Prosecutor's Closing Argument</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To understand Marshall's objection to the prosecutor's summation, the procedural history of the case must be recalled.  This is Marshall's second trial;  in the first trial, he was acquitted of a charge of conspiracy to distribute drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall says that the prosecutor improperly accused him of a conspiracy in the face of an acquittal, that the prosecutor relied on facts not in evidence, and that the prosecutor improperly vouched for a witness.  The first two points are related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the prosecutor never used the word \"conspiracy,\" and never referred to the prior trial or charges, Marshall says that he did so in essence with the following argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>I submit to you that the two of them were working together and this is what happened.  That the drugs were flown in from Chicago that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>The defendant met Dantzler, the other man who brought the drugs in from Chicago.  And they set up together in that room and the plan, I submit to you, was for them, for Marshall to be the middleman for the sale of those drugs, the wholesale of those drugs to people in Providence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall relies on United States v. McBride, 862 F.2d 1316 (8th Cir.1988), where the Eighth Circuit upheld the trial court's discretionary ruling awarding a new trial due to three trial errors.  One of the errors involved a statement made by a prosecutor in final argument which appeared to refer to counts previously dismissed and to conflict with the evidence.  Id. at 1318.   Marshall's argument is not frivolous, but, on balance, we think the prosecution did not exceed the bounds.  The presence of Dantzler in the room and the quantity of drugs fairly support the \"with intent to distribute\" portion of the possession charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's words suggested, we think, a permissible inference from the evidence produced at trial, and were not a reference to the conspiracy charge.  The statement was within the allowable scope of argument.  United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212 (1st Cir.1994).  Even if the prosecutor's remarks were an improper veiled reference to the conspiracy charge, they were not sufficiently egregious to warrant a reversal of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument about improperly vouching for a witness is based on three portions of the prosecution's closing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>Mr. Marshall, in effect, has said by telling the version he is saying, he, in effect, has said to you, the police are not telling you the truth.  That they have come in here and taken the oath about what happened, and they haven't told you the truth under oath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>They say, I submit to you, they have told the story the way it truly unfolded....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>So, I ask you in choosing between these versions think carefully about what the police could have done if these men, Steven Cross, Detective Lauro, Detective Gerstmeyer, Detective Mansolillo had been people who would deliberately come in here and tell you the truth.  Yes, you will hear undoubtedly in summation that Detective Mansolillo made a mistake in the Grand Jury.  People make mistakes, and he corrected it here.  All right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant did not object to what he now attacks as witness vouching, and so our review in this context is for plain error.  United States v. Grabiec, 96 F.3d 549, 550 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1187-88 (1st Cir.1993).  These first two comments do not, we think, amount to improper vouching.  United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that it is not vouching for prosecutor to say that jury should come to believe on the evidence that the events occurred the way the government's witnesses said they did).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last statement is simply too garbled to be vouching.  We assume what the prosecutor meant to say was that the Providence police would not permit its officers to deliberately tell lies.  He said, as best we can tell, the opposite.  Defendant has no complaint.  Even if the remarks were inappropriate, an inappropriate comment is not a reversible error unless it is likely to have affected the outcome of the trial.  United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, 70 F.3d 706, 713 (1st Cir.1995).  These comments did not likely affect the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an oft-heard complaint that the prosecutor is putting his personal endorsement on the scale.  Of course he should not do so, but there are two sides to this.  Not every factual recitation in the prosecutor's argument must start with a personal disclaimer.  It is one thing to emphasize personal endorsement.  It is another for the prosecutor to refer to the evidence in factual form as he goes along without constant qualification.  The line, of course, may sometimes be close.  But an excellent test is whether counsel contemporaneously thinks the line has been crossed, and objects, which, in turn, enables the court to instruct the jury.  In the absence of such objections, plain error review is called for.  There is no plain error here.  See Grabiec, 96 F.3d at 550.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Initially, Marshall was acquitted on the conspiracy count, but the jury deadlocked on the possession with intent charge.  A second trial, limited to the charge of possession with intent, resulted in a guilty verdict.  Marshall was sentenced to 72 months' incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall argues on appeal that his conviction was brought about by a series of errors:  the district court's denial of his motion to suppress, its failure to make the police produce a tape recorder and tape which may or may not have been in the hotel room, and its limitation of cross examination;  a DEA agent's inconsistent testimony before the grand jury and at trial;  and improper statements by the prosecutor in his closing argument.  We reject these claims and affirm the conviction.  The issue which merits the most discussion is the contention about the \"missing evidence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We outline the facts only as necessary to set the framework for the issues, because Marshall does not challenge the overall sufficiency of the evidence.  To the extent Marshall challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial judge's determination against him on the motion to suppress, the evidence is described in the light most favorable to the government.  United States v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197246\"><a href=\"/opinion/197246/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of November 30, 1994, a Providence police lieutenant received a phone call from the manager of the Day's Hotel in Providence.  The manager reported that he suspected there was drug activity in Room 312 involving a Richard Marshall and explained the reasons for his suspicions.  The federal Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") was brought into the case.  The officers did a background check on Richard Marshall and came up with a criminal record and a photograph.  They drove to the hotel, where the manager confirmed there had been a heavy flow of traffic in and out of Marshall's room, identified the photograph as being of Marshall, and said Marshall had listed his car as a Mercedes Benz on the hotel registration card.  While the officers were in the lot looking for the Mercedes, Marshall appeared.  The officers identified themselves and asked if they could speak with him.  Marshall agreed, and when they said there had been complaints about the activity in his room, he said he had \"his girl\" in the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers asked which was his car, and Marshall pointed to a Toyota, which had a different license plate number than the one he had listed on the registration card.  The officers asked permission to look in the car;  Marshall agreed, and they searched the car but found no drugs.  When asked, Marshall denied ever having been arrested, but when shown his arrest record, started to chuckle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers asked Marshall if he minded if they went to his room.  He said he did not mind and repeated that his girl was there.  They all went up to the room.  Although Marshall had his room key, he knocked on the door before opening it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no woman in the room.  There was, however, a man, Thomas Dantzler, soon to become a co-defendant.  In addition, there was a paper bag protruding from between the mattress and the box springs of one of the beds.  The bag contained almost 200 grams of heroin, with a street value of about $26,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address Marshall's claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Exculpatory Evidence Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall asserts that he had a micro-cassette recorder, switched to the \"on\" position, in the room at the time of his arrest, that the tape captured what happened in the room both before and during the arrival of the police, and that the tape would exculpate him.  It would prove exculpatory in at least two senses, he submits:  it would show that he and Dantzler were in fact talking about rock concert promotions, not drug dealing, and it would tend to support his version of the facts--which differs radically from the officers' version--relevant to his Fourth Amendment claims.  There is some room for skepticism:  whatever his conversation with Dantzler, the drugs were in his room, and on the motion to suppress, the court found that he had consented to the officers' request to enter his room before they entered the room.  Nonetheless, the government is obligated to produce exculpatory evidence to a defendant.  Brady v. Maryland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Marshall testified that he recorded his conversation with Dantzler about a concert they were promoting and that he left the tape recorder running when he left the hotel room to go to the parking lot.  This was done, he said, to keep track of whether Dantzler used his telephone.  He says the recorder would still have been running when he returned to the room and that one of the detectives picked it up and made a remark about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers who were present in Marshall's hotel room tell a different story.  DEA Agent Mansolillo and Detective Cross both testified that they did not see a tape recorder in the room.  Detective Lauro indicated that he saw a \"narrow\" \"electronic device\" in the room, which he thought \"might have been a tape recorder.\"   Detective Lauro denied picking it up or saying anything about it.  The fourth officer, Detective Gerstmeyer, though cross-examined at some length by defense counsel, was never asked whether he had seen a tape recorder.  The officers did seize some small electronic equipment (two beepers, two portable phones, and a small calculator), but none of them remembered seizing a tape recorder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Mansolillo took control of the drugs and other seized evidence, but unfortunately did not prepare an inventory.  Later, both the prosecutor and defense counsel examined that evidence and did not find a tape recorder or tape.  The court asked the prosecutor whether he had specifically questioned the officers on the existence of the recorder;  he replied that he had not.  The court requested that the prosecutor do so.  The prosecutor did check, but with only two of the four officers.  The court instructed the prosecutor to go back and check with the other two officers;  the prosecutor failed to do so, but defense counsel did not pursue the issue any further.  The judge stated that he could not require the government to produce something which it said it did not have.  Defense counsel did cross-examine the officers about the tape recorder and argued the missing evidence theory to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall's exculpatory evidence argument has two predicates:  that the recorder and tape existed and that the contents of the tape were exculpatory.  His claim flounders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall does not argue that the government did possess the tape recorder and tape and destroyed it in bad faith.  Cf. Arizona v. Youngblood, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Femia, there was no dispute over whether certain tape recordings existed;  the issue was the consequences of the government's inadvertent destruction of the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also cites United States v.

There the defendants claimed that a government informant had taped certain calls and that the government had failed to produce the tape recordings of the calls.  Id. at 1526-27.   The court concluded that the defendants \"have presented insufficient evidence that the government either failed to turn over 'missing tapes,' or that it destroyed them in bad faith.  The fact of the matter is, [defendants] have failed to produce any convincing evidence that these tapes ever existed.\"  Id. at 1527.

He did not do so.  Absent a rare case in which the government may be in a better position than the defendant to disprove the existence of evidence claimed to be exculpatory, there is no unfairness in placing the burden on the defendant.  It is difficult for the government to disprove the existence of something and easy for defendants to claim that something existed and was exculpatory but that the government failed to preserve it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Placing the initial burden on the defendant is also consistent with the general law in the area.

The \"missing evidence\" must possess an \"exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed\" and must be \"of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\"  Id. at 489, 104 S.Ct. at 2534;  see also Femia, 9 F.3d at 993.   In Arizona v. Youngblood, the Court imposed a third burden on a defendant where the potentially exculpatory evidence has been destroyed:  that of showing the government acted in bad faith in destroying the evidence.  488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. at 337-38.   Under this precedent, absent some unusual situation, the initial burden is on the defendant to show the evidence existed.  That burden was not satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The related evidentiary claim that the district court improperly limited the cross-examination of Detective Lauro, as beyond the scope of direct, is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Fourth Amendment Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall makes two Fourth Amendment arguments:  (1) that he did not consent to have the police enter his room, and therefore all evidence that came from the room was seized illegally, and (2) that he was under de facto arrest.  Both contentions require that Marshall's version of the facts be accepted and the government's version rejected.  The district court's factual determinations depended in large part on whom the court believed, as the testimony of the witnesses painted two very different scenarios.  The district court disbelieved Marshall's version.  Factual findings by the judge may not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.  United States v. Cleveland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197214\"><a href=\"/opinion/197214/united-states-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></a></span>, 1063-64 (1st Cir. 1997).  There can be no clear error where factual findings turn on the credibility of the witnesses who appear before the judge.  United States v. Cruz Jimenez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535250\"><a href=\"/opinion/535250/united-states-v-jose-m-cruz-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1990).  Defendant having consented, there is no Fourth Amendment issue regarding the seized evidence.  United States v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also disbelieved Marshall's testimony on which he relies for the de facto arrest theory.  There being no error in the finding that Marshall consented to the officers' request to enter his room, the district court's conclusion that there was no de facto arrest is hardly clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the same reasons, we uphold the denial of the motion to suppress the drugs.  The trial judge chose to believe the testimony of the officers, who provided a sufficient predicate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Motion to Suppress Marshall's Statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall argues that the court abused its discretion in refusing to hear his motion to suppress statements he made before the drugs were found in his room.  The district court found that Marshall had waived this motion by failing to make it in a timely fashion.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall filed the motion to suppress statements two months after the date the motions were due.  Marshall also did not object to the statements when they were introduced into evidence.  Because Marshall failed properly to raise the issue in the district court, we do not consider it.  United States v. Nunez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195254\"><a href=\"/opinion/195254/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).  We add that the motion is premised on Marshall's argument that he did not give consent to enter his room and, as a result, he was in custody and should have been informed of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, even had there not been waiver, the argument would have failed because the court determined the consent issue against Marshall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Grand Jury Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony given by DEA Agent Mansolillo varied slightly at trial from the testimony he had given before the grand jury about exactly where the bag of drugs was found and about the sequence of actions by a Providence police lieutenant who was in the room.  The agent was thoroughly cross-examined on the point.  It appears that this is an instance of confusion or mistake in the agent's grand jury testimony, and there is nothing in the record before us to suggest perjury.  The dispute about where the drugs were found in the room was largely immaterial to the indictment:  whether the drugs were under the mattress or not does not undermine the charge of possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if there were an error in the grand jury process, and we do not suggest there was one, defendant had a fair trial, and the verdict renders any error at the preliminary stage harmless now.

This is Marshall's second trial;  in the first trial, he was acquitted of a charge of conspiracy to distribute drugs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall says that the prosecutor improperly accused him of a conspiracy in the face of an acquittal, that the prosecutor relied on facts not in evidence, and that the prosecutor improperly vouched for a witness.  The first two points are related.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the prosecutor never used the word \"conspiracy,\" and never referred to the prior trial or charges, Marshall says that he did so in essence with the following argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>I submit to you that the two of them were working together and this is what happened.  That the drugs were flown in from Chicago that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>The defendant met Dantzler, the other man who brought the drugs in from Chicago.  And they set up together in that room and the plan, I submit to you, was for them, for Marshall to be the middleman for the sale of those drugs, the wholesale of those drugs to people in Providence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall relies on United States v.

One of the errors involved a statement made by a prosecutor in final argument which appeared to refer to counts previously dismissed and to conflict with the evidence.  Id. at 1318.   Marshall's argument is not frivolous, but, on balance, we think the prosecution did not exceed the bounds.  The presence of Dantzler in the room and the quantity of drugs fairly support the \"with intent to distribute\" portion of the possession charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor's words suggested, we think, a permissible inference from the evidence produced at trial, and were not a reference to the conspiracy charge.  The statement was within the allowable scope of argument.  United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195633\"><a href=\"/opinion/195633/united-states-v-ovalle-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).  Even if the prosecutor's remarks were an improper veiled reference to the conspiracy charge, they were not sufficiently egregious to warrant a reversal of the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument about improperly vouching for a witness is based on three portions of the prosecution's closing:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>Mr. Marshall, in effect, has said by telling the version he is saying, he, in effect, has said to you, the police are not telling you the truth.  That they have come in here and taken the oath about what happened, and they haven't told you the truth under oath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>They say, I submit to you, they have told the story the way it truly unfolded....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>So, I ask you in choosing between these versions think carefully about what the police could have done if these men, Steven Cross, Detective Lauro, Detective Gerstmeyer, Detective Mansolillo had been people who would deliberately come in here and tell you the truth.  Yes, you will hear undoubtedly in summation that Detective Mansolillo made a mistake in the Grand Jury.  People make mistakes, and he corrected it here.  All right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant did not object to what he now attacks as witness vouching, and so our review in this context is for plain error.  United States v.

These first two comments do not, we think, amount to improper vouching.  United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196554\"><a href=\"/opinion/196554/united-states-v-cruz-quilan/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that it is not vouching for prosecutor to say that jury should come to believe on the evidence that the events occurred the way the government's witnesses said they did).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last statement is simply too garbled to be vouching.  We assume what the prosecutor meant to say was that the Providence police would not permit its officers to deliberately tell lies.  He said, as best we can tell, the opposite.  Defendant has no complaint.  Even if the remarks were inappropriate, an inappropriate comment is not a reversible error unless it is likely to have affected the outcome of the trial.  United States v. Cartagena-Carrasquillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196443\"><a href=\"/opinion/196443/united-states-v-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 713 (1st Cir.1995).  These comments did not likely affect the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an oft-heard complaint that the prosecutor is putting his personal endorsement on the scale.  Of course he should not do so, but there are two sides to this.  Not every factual recitation in the prosecutor's argument must start with a personal disclaimer.  It is one thing to emphasize personal endorsement.  It is another for the prosecutor to refer to the evidence in factual form as he goes along without constant qualification.  The line, of course, may sometimes be close.  But an excellent test is whether counsel contemporaneously thinks the line has been crossed, and objects, which, in turn, enables the court to instruct the jury.  In the absence of such objections, plain error review is called for.  There is no plain error here.
