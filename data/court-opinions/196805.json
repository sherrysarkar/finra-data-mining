LeBlanc\r\n\nseeks  review  of the  district  court's  order granting  the\r\n\nFDIC's motion for  summary judgment.  The district court held\r\n\nthat  the  defenses  and  counterclaims   LeBlanc  raised  in\r\n\nresponse  to  the  FDIC's  affirmative suit  to  recover  the\r\n\ndeficiency  owed  on  a mortgage  note  he  and his  company,\r\n\nLeBlanc  Associates,  (collectively  \"LeBlanc\")  executed  on\r\n\nJanuary 5,  1989, were barred  by both Massachusetts  law and\r\n\nthe  D'Oench doctrine.    We  affirm  this decision,  but  on\r                        \r\n\nslightly  different grounds  than  those  articulated by  the\r\n\ndistrict   court.

Levy v. FDIC, 7\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir. 1993).  In 1987, appellant acquired\r\n\nthe 54-acre parcel at issue in this case.   The parcel, which\r\n\nis located in Falmouth,  Massachusetts, and abuts a 900-acre,\r\n\npartially-completed,  residential  community called  Falmouth\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nWoods, is accessible by  only one road, Falmouth  Woods Road.\r\n\nThough appellant purchased the parcel without first obtaining\r\n\na  right  of way  over Falmouth  Woods  Road, his  intent was\r\n\nultimately  to acquire  such an easement  and to  develop his\r\n\nparcel   into  a  six-lot,   multifamily  subdivision  called\r\n\nProspect Hills.  At the time LeBlanc purchased  the property,\r\n\nboth the Falmouth Woods  development and Falmouth Woods Road,\r\n\nwhich  fronts  the LeBlanc  parcel's  western  boundary, were\r\n\nowned by the Falmouth Woods Development Corporation (\"FWDC\"),\r\n\na Massachusetts corporation.\r\n\n          On January  5, 1989, to finance  development of the\r\n\nProspect Hills  parcel, LeBlanc  obtained a $750,000.00  loan\r\n\nfrom  the Bank of New England South, N.A., which later merged\r\n\ninto Bank of New England, N.A. (\"BNE\").  The loan, which both\r\n\nparties agree was not conditioned upon LeBlanc's acquiring an\r\n\neasement  across  Falmouth  Woods  Road,  was  secured  by  a\r\n\npersonal guaranty note executed by LeBlanc and  a mortgage on\r\n\nthe 54-acre parcel.   Payment on the note  was to be monthly,\r\n\nbeginning in February  of 1989, with  the provision that  the\r\n\nprincipal balance, plus accrued  and unpaid interest, were to\r\n\nbe paid by January 4, 1992.     \r\n\n          LeBlanc  obtained  approval and  a  permit  for the\r\n\nProspect  Hills subdivision from  the Falmouth Planning Board\r\n\nand, in  the Fall of 1989, began meeting with FWDC to discuss\r\n\nsecuring  access rights  over  Falmouth Woods  Road.   During\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nnegotiations,  FWDC  verbally  agreed  to  grant  LeBlanc  an\r\n\neasement for utilities and right of way across Falmouth Woods\r\n\nRoad.   A written agreement regarding  the easement, however,\r\n\nwas never prepared.  Before the sale of the easement could be\r\n\nrecorded, FWDC began experiencing financial  difficulties and\r\n\nfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March of 1990.  \r\n\n          BNE,  which had  loaned FWDC  $28 million  prior to\r\n\nextending LeBlanc the loan to develop Prospect  Hills and, as\r\n\na  result, held  a mortgage  in the Falmouth  Woods property,\r\n\nsought and obtained relief from the  automatic stay placed on\r\n\nFWDC's  estate as  a result  of the  bankruptcy filing.   BNE\r\n\noperated  the  Falmouth  Woods  property as  a  mortgagee  in\r\n\npossession, briefly continuing service  at the Falmouth Woods\r\n\ngolf  course, and  tried to  sell Falmouth  Woods subdivision\r\n\nlots.   It eventually  foreclosed  its mortgage and purchased\r\n\nthe  property at  the subsequent  foreclosure sale.   Because\r\n\nFWDC's mortgage did not include the fee  interest in Falmouth\r\n\nWoods Road, the foreclosure sale purchase left BNE with title\r\n\nto Falmouth Woods and  an easement over Falmouth  Woods Road.\r\n\nThe fee  interest in  the road remained  with the  bankruptcy\r\n\ntrustee assigned to manage FWDC's assets.\r\n\n          The Falmouth Woods  property changed hands  several\r\n\ntimes  after  BNE's   foreclosure-sale  purchase,   thwarting\r\n\nLeBlanc's efforts  to obtain an easement  over Falmouth Woods\r\n\nRoad.  In  September 1990, BNE transferred the Falmouth Woods\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nproperty   to  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Falmouth  Land\r\n\nCompany (\"FLC\").   In  January 1991, the  Comptroller of  the\r\n\nCurrency of the United States of America (\"COC\") declared BNE\r\n\ninsolvent  and appointed the FDIC  receiver of BNE.   The COC\r\n\nalso chartered  the New Bank  of New England,  N.A. (\"NBNE\"),\r\n\npursuant to 12 U.S.C.   1821(n), as  a bridge bank to acquire\r\n\nthe assets formerly held  by BNE.   Thus, NBNE held title  to\r\n\nthe FWDC property, as well as LeBlanc's  $750,000.00 note and\r\n\nguaranty from January to July of 1991.  \r\n\n          On  July  13,  1991,  the COC  dissolved  NBNE  and\r\n\nappointed  the FDIC as receiver  of the bank,  pursuant to 12\r\n\nU.S.C.   1821(n)(12).  The  FDIC then acquired Falmouth Woods\r\n\nand  assumed the note and the mortgage on the LeBlanc parcel.\r\n\nOn August 13,  1991, the FDIC took title to  the fee interest\r\n\nin  Falmouth  Woods  Road  in  the  name  of  FLC,  the  NBNE\r\n\nsubsidiary.  NBNE  had purchased the fee interest in Falmouth\r\n\nWoods Road from the FWDC's bankruptcy trustee in May 1991.  \r\n\n          LeBlanc pursued his  easement request with  each of\r\n\nFalmouth Woods's  owners because  the Prospect Hills  parcel,\r\n\ninitially appraised at $1,980,000.00, was virtually worthless\r\n\nwithout  access to  Falmouth Woods  Road.   Negotiations with\r\n\nBNE,  FLC, and Oak Tree Capitol (\"Oak Tree\"), a company which\r\n\nfunctioned  as  asset manager  for  both  FLC and  BNE,  were\r\n\nunsuccessful.   Attempts to obtain  a right of  way from NBNE\r\n\nand the  FDIC were also unsuccessful,  primarily because both\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nentities   engaged   in  actions   which   blocked  LeBlanc's\r\n\nacquisition efforts.    NBNE contested  LeBlanc's efforts  to\r\n\nresolve his road access problems through direct  negotiations\r\n\nwith   the  FWDC   bankruptcy  trustee  and   was  ultimately\r\n\nsuccessful  in outbidding  LeBlanc  for the  fee interest  in\r\n\nFalmouth Woods  Road.   According to LeBlanc,  NBNE officials\r\n\nalso  misrepresented the  fact that  they were  marketing the\r\n\nFalmouth  Woods  property without  reservation  of  rights or\r\n\nnotice  of  claims.     LeBlanc  further  asserts  that  NBNE\r\n\nattempted to accelerate payment  on his note by  declining to\r\n\nhonor a  loan commitment made to  another LeBlanc development\r\n\nentity, DDM  Development Corporation  (\"DDM\"), and making  an\r\n\neasement across Falmouth Woods Road contingent upon increased\r\n\ncollateralization of  the note  or a reduction  in principal.\r\n\nLeBlanc  imputes a  similar  bad intent  to  the FDIC,  which\r\n\nfailed to convey him an easement during work-out negotiations\r\n\non the note.   \r\n\n          Payments on LeBlanc's $750,000.00 note were current\r\n\nand regular until the Fall of 1991.  Then, in  a November 13,\r\n\n1991,  letter, LeBlanc informed the FDIC, which held title to\r\n\nFalmouth Woods and Falmouth Woods Road at that time, that its\r\n\nrefusal  to convey  the  requested easement  entitled him  to\r\n\ndiscontinue  payments on  the  $750,000.00 note  and that  he\r\n\nwould  not  resume payments  until  the  easement matter  was\r\n\nresolved.  On  November 21, 1991, the FDIC made  a demand for\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nfull payment of the  outstanding note balance.   When LeBlanc\r\n\nfailed  to make the requested payment, the FDIC, on August 7,\r\n\n1992,  foreclosed and  sold the  Prospect Hills  property for\r\n\n$235,000.00 at  auction.   Appellant's son, Mark  LeBlanc, as\r\n\nTrustee  of   the  McAuliffe  Nominee  Trust,  purchased  the\r\n\nproperty.  The deficiency due on LeBlanc's note,  the subject\r\n\nof the instant appeal, has not yet been paid.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                      PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r                                  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r                                                    \r\n\n          On June 19, 1992,  the FDIC filed an action  in the\r\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking the\r\n\ndeficiency balance  on LeBlanc's note.   On August  21, 1992,\r\n\nLeBlanc  filed  an  answer   and  three  count  counterclaim,\r\n\nalleging that the FDIC's refusal to grant LeBlanc an easement\r\n\nacross  Falmouth Woods Road violated  state law.   Count I of\r\n\nthe counterclaim alleged that the FDIC's actions breached the\r\n\nimplied covenant of good faith  and fair dealing implicit  in\r\n\nall contracts made under  Massachusetts law.  See Mass.  Gen.\r                                                             \r\n\nL.  ch. 106    1-203 (1990).   Count  II alleged  a breach of\r\n\ncontract under Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 106   9-106,  which governs\r\n\nsecured transactions.   Count III  raised claims in  tort for\r\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\n\n          On  February 17, 1993,  before a  magistrate judge,\r\n\nthe FDIC  moved for judgment  on the  pleadings, pursuant  to\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P.  12(c), and argued that the  federal estoppel\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\ndoctrine  established  by  the  Supreme Court's  decision  in\r\n\nD'Oench, Duhme  &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. at 447, and 12 U.S.C.\r                                         \r\n\n   1823(e) barred  LeBlanc  from asserting  his defenses  and\r\n\nthree  counterclaims.  LeBlanc contended that neither section\r\n\n1823(e)  nor  the common  law  D'Oench  doctrine it  codifies\r                                                  \r\n\npreempted  his  counterclaims.   He  maintained  that,  under\r\n\nMassachusetts  common law  and  the  Uniform Commercial  Code\r\n\n(\"UCC\"), the duties allegedly breached by the  FDIC arose out\r\n\nof the performance and administration of the note and not out\r\n\nof an unauthorized side agreement.\r\n\n          In  a May  13,  1993, order,  the magistrate  judge\r\n\nallowed,  in part, and denied, in part, the FDIC's Rule 12(c)\r\n\nmotion.    The court  found  that  the principal  allegations\r\n\nraised by LeBlanc's counterclaims rested on an \"implied\" and,\r\n\nunder the D'Oench doctrine, unenforceable \"agreement that the\r                             \r\n\nFDIC affirmatively assist LeBlanc  . . . in [his]  attempt to\r\n\nacquire  a right  of  way over  the  road.\"   It,  therefore,\r\n\ndismissed  those   allegations  in   counts  I  and   III  of\r\n\nappellant's  counterclaim which  relied  on  that  agreement,\r\n\nholding  that  all other  allegations,  taken  as true,  were\r\n\nlegally sufficient to survive Rule 12(c).\r\n\n          The  magistrate  judge  ruled  that   count  II  of\r\n\nappellant's counterclaim,  which was  based on Mass.  Gen. L.\r\n\nch. 106    9-507  and focused  on the FDIC's  conduct at  the\r\n\nAugust  1991  foreclosure auction,  survived  the Rule  12(c)\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nmotion  because,  unlike  counts  I  and III,  it  was  based\r\n\nexclusively on state law.   She did not, however,  attempt to\r\n\nresolve  that   claim  because  she   found  the  information\r\n\navailable  to  her  insufficient  to  decide  the  commercial\r\n\nreasonableness of the FDIC's  foreclosure actions.   Finally,\r\n\nthe magistrate judge rejected the FDIC's claim that a federal\r\n\ncommon law rule barring LeBlanc's claims should be fashioned.\r\n\nShe  found  that  LeBlanc's  counterclaim   was  procedurally\r\n\ndeficient because he failed to seek leave to name the FDIC as\r\n\na counterclaim-defendant in its corporate capacity.\r\n\n          On August  13, 1993,  the district court  issued an\r\n\norder  accepting  the  Report   and  Recommendation  of   the\r\n\nmagistrate  judge,  with  two modifications.    It  dismissed\r\n\nLeBlanc's  counterclaims against  the FDIC  in its  corporate\r\n\ncapacity  and reserved  the  issue of  which party  bears the\r\n\nburden of proof on matters of \"commercial reasonableness\" for\r\n\nlater  determination.  The  FDIC filed  a motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment against LeBlanc on July 22, 1994.  \r\n\n          On October  27, 1994, the district  court issued an\r\n\norder  allowing   summary  judgment  for  the   FDIC  on  its\r\n\naffirmative  claim for  the deficiency  due on  the note  and\r\n\npost-judgment interest.   The district court  agreed with the\r\n\nmagistrate  judge's determination  that the  federal estoppel\r\n\ndoctrine barred  much of LeBlanc's answer  and concluded that\r\n\n\"LeBlanc  has  presented no  defense  that  would excuse  his\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ndefault.\"  The court also granted the FDIC's summary judgment\r\n\nmotion with respect to appellant's  three-count counterclaim.\r\n\nIt   reaffirmed  the   magistrate  judge's   conclusion  that\r\n\nappellant's counterclaims were barred to the extent that they\r\n\nwere  based on  a  side agreement  or  affirmative duty  and,\r\n\nconsequently,  only considered  the  state  law issues  which\r\n\nsurvived the magistrate judge's order.  \r\n\n          Without  deciding  whether   D'Oench  and   section\r                                                          \r\n\n1823(e) permit  claims based on terms implied in an agreement\r\n\nas  a matter  of  state law,  the  district court  held  that\r\n\nappellant's allegations,  even if true, did  not constitute a\r\n\nbreach  of  the  implied  covenant of  good  faith  and  fair\r\n\ndealing.   Noting  that Massachusetts law  does not  impose a\r\n\nduty to enter into a contract, the court rejected appellant's\r\n\nclaims that it was inappropriate for the FDIC to compete with\r\n\nLeBlanc or to  use the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road as\r\n\na bargaining chip in its negotiations with appellant.\r\n\n          The court  also held that LeBlanc's  claim that the\r\n\nFDIC failed  to handle  its secured collateral,  the Prospect\r\n\nHills parcel, in accordance with  Mass. Gen. L. ch. 106    9-\r\n\n507, could  not stand  because that  statute does  not govern\r\n\nsecured  transactions  where the  security is  real property.\r\n\nFinally,  the  district  court  granted  summary judgment  on\r\n\nappellant's  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress\r\n\ncounterclaim.   It concluded that  the FDIC's actions did not\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\namount to extreme and  outrageous behavior within the meaning\r\n\nof Massachusetts  tort law,  though it acknowledged  that the\r\n\nFDIC's actions in attempting to trade an easement in Falmouth\r\n\nWoods   Road  \"may  [have]  constitute[d]  rather  hard-nosed\r\n\nbusiness.\"   The court entered  its judgment on  May 8, 1995,\r\n\nand this appeal followed.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n                          DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          We review  the  district court's  grant of  summary\r\n\njudgment de  novo, EEOC v.

On appeal, LeBlanc\r\n\nargues that the district  court erroneously held that D'Oench\r                                                                         \r\n\nand section  1823(e) barred  his  defense that  the FDIC,  as\r\n\nreceiver  of NBNE,  breached  its obligation  to perform  the\r\n\nterms of  the loan agreement in good faith, see Mass. Gen. L.\r                                                           \r\n\nch. 106    1-203, by competing with him for  the fee interest\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nin  Falmouth Woods  Road.   He contends  that his  defense of\r\n\neconomic coercion concerns the  value of the $750,000.00 note\r\n\nand not his failed attempts to secure a right of way.   \r\n\n          On this point, we discern no error in the  district\r\n\ncourt's analysis.  Without deciding whether breach of implied\r\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing claims  are generally\r\n\nprecluded  by D'Oench,  we hold  that the  particular defense\r                                 \r\n\nadvanced in this case is  barred.  Appellant's defense  rests\r\n\non an unwritten or implied agreement regarding a right of way\r\n\nover Falmouth Woods Road and not the terms of the $750,000.00\r\n\nnote. \r\n\n          The   common   law   D'Oench   doctrine   \"prevents\r                                                  \r\n\nplaintiffs  from  asserting  as  either a  claim  or  defense\r\n\nagainst the  FDIC oral agreements or  'arrangements.'\"  Adams\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The\r\n\nproblem  with  this  is that  nothing  in  the  terms of  the\r\n\n$750,000.00  note can be  read to create  such a duty  on the\r\n\npart  of the  FDIC.    LeBlanc,  in  fact,  admits  that  the\r\n\n$750,000.00  note was contingent  neither upon  his obtaining\r\n\nnor  the  FDIC or  its  predecessors  providing an  easement.\r\n\nAccordingly, this attempt to shift the risk LeBlanc knowingly\r\n\nassumed  when  he  purchased the  land-locked  Prospect Hills\r\n\nproperty  to  the  FDIC, and  consequently,  to  unsuspecting\r\n\ncreditors  and depositors,  must fail.

He  also alleges  that the  FDIC's failure  to\r\n\nextend  him an  easement  across Falmouth  Woods Road  during\r\n\nwork-out negotiations constitutes a breach ofthe agreement.  \r\n\n          There is an  argument that D'Oench  precludes these\r                                                        \r\n\nclaims,  at least  to  the extent  that  they rely  upon  any\r\n\nspecifics in  the negotiations  between the borrower  and the\r\n\nbank, even if the specifics are not formally agreements.

But  even if  we assume  that\r                   \r\n\nD'Oench does not  bar LeBlanc's breach of an implied covenant\r                   \r\n\nof  good faith and fair  dealing counterclaims --  and, as we\r\n\nindicated  in  the previous  section,  we  are certainly  not\r\n\ndeciding that question here -- appellant has not convinced us\r\n\nthat there  is any  general obligation under  state law  that\r\n\nrequired  the bank (in the  absence of an  agreement) to take\r\n\nthe affirmative  steps appellant now claims  should have been\r\n\ntaken.  \r\n\n          We detect  no bad faith  in the FDIC's  decision to\r\n\nwithhold  DDM project  funds or  to make  an  easement across\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nFalmouth Woods Road contingent upon  additional collateral or\r\n\na  reduction in principal.   Though the  FDIC's dealings with\r\n\nLeBlanc were arguably \"hard-nosed,\" there is no evidence that\r\n\nthe FDIC's actions  deprived LeBlanc of  the benefits of  the\r\n\nloan  agreement.   See  Anthony's  Pier,  411 Mass.  at  471.\r                                                   \r\n\nLeBlanc neither disputes that he received the proceeds of the\r\n\n$750,000.00  loan nor  suggests  that the  FDIC took  adverse\r\n\nactions on the note before his November 1992 default.  \r\n\n          LeBlanc's arguments are  complaints about the terms\r\n\non which the FDIC proposed to  execute or continue agreements\r\n\nwith him.  But  having engaged in rigorous bargaining  of his\r\n\nown,  LeBlanc cannot now contend  that it was  unfair for the\r\n\nFDIC to bargain  for more security  on the $750,000.00  note.\r\n\nThe  FDIC had  no duty  at all  under the  loan agreement  to\r\n\nextend appellant an easement, let alone to provide him one on\r\n\nterms which were more  favorable to him.  Nothing  prevents a\r\n\nparty to a bargain from engaging in  hard-nosed dealings, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nSchwanbeck v.

L. Rev. 369, 372-73 (1980).  As the district\r                 \r\n\ncourt astutely  observed,  \"the  FDIC  owned  something  that\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nLeBlanc  wanted, and it was  permissible for the  FDIC to use\r\n\nthat 'something' as a bargaining chip in order to obtain what\r\n\nit wanted, namely more security on the $750,000.00 note.\"  \r\n\n          Finally,  we reject  LeBlanc's claim that  the FDIC\r\n\nbreached its obligation to perform in good faith during work-\r\n\nout negotiations with appellant.  Massachusetts law implies a\r\n\nduty  of  good faith  and  fair  dealing  in  every  existing\r\n\ncontract.  See Anthony's  Pier, 411 Mass. at 472;  Fortune v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nNat'l Cash  Register Co., 373 Mass. 96 (1977); Schwanbeck, 31\r                                                                     \r\n\nMass.  App.  Ct.  at 397  n.6.    At  the time  the  work-out\r\n\nnegotiations occurred, however, there was no contract between\r\n\nthe FDIC and LeBlanc.   LeBlanc's November 1992 default ended\r\n\nthe contractual relationship he  theretofore enjoyed with the\r\n\nFDIC.   We, therefore, hold that LeBlanc's claim fails to the\r\n\nextent that it relies on the loan agreement.  That claim also\r\n\nfails  to  the  extent that  it  rests  on  an obligation  to\r\n\nnegotiate  new contracts in good faith.  We are not convinced\r\n\nthat  the  loan  agreement  contained  any  such  contractual\r\n\nobligation, see  Schwanbeck v.

LeBlanc seeks review of the district court's order granting the FDIC's motion for summary judgment.   The district court held that the defenses and counterclaims LeBlanc raised in response to the FDIC's affirmative suit to recover the deficiency owed on a mortgage note he and his company, LeBlanc Associates, (collectively \"LeBlanc\") executed on January 5, 1989, were barred by both Massachusetts law and the D'Oench doctrine.   We affirm this decision, but on slightly different grounds than those articulated by the district court.   Title 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 provides jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purpose of reviewing the district court's grant of summary judgment, we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Levy v. FDIC, 7 F.3d 1054, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).   In 1987, appellant acquired the 54-acre parcel at issue in this case.   The parcel, which is located in Falmouth, Massachusetts, and abuts a 900-acre, partially-completed, residential community called Falmouth Woods, is accessible by only one road, Falmouth Woods Road.  Though appellant purchased the parcel without first obtaining a right of way over Falmouth Woods Road, his intent was ultimately to acquire such an easement and to develop his parcel into a six-lot, multifamily subdivision called Prospect Hills.   At the time LeBlanc purchased the property, both the Falmouth Woods development and Falmouth Woods Road, which fronts the LeBlanc parcel's western boundary, were owned by the Falmouth Woods Development Corporation (\"FWDC\"), a Massachusetts corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1989, to finance development of the Prospect Hills parcel, LeBlanc obtained a $750,000.00 loan from the Bank of New England South, N.A., which later merged into Bank of New England, N.A.  (\"BNE\").  The loan, which both parties agree was not conditioned upon LeBlanc's acquiring an easement across Falmouth Woods Road, was secured by a personal guaranty note executed by LeBlanc and a mortgage on the 54-acre parcel.   Payment on the note was to be monthly, beginning in February of 1989, with the provision that the principal balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, were to be paid by January 4, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc obtained approval and a permit for the Prospect Hills subdivision from the Falmouth Planning Board and, in the Fall of 1989, began meeting with FWDC to discuss securing access rights over Falmouth Woods Road.  During negotiations, FWDC verbally agreed to grant LeBlanc an easement for utilities and right of way across Falmouth Woods Road.  A written agreement regarding the easement, however, was never prepared.   Before the sale of the easement could be recorded, FWDC began experiencing financial difficulties and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March of 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BNE, which had loaned FWDC $28 million prior to extending LeBlanc the loan to develop Prospect Hills and, as a result, held a mortgage in the Falmouth Woods property, sought and obtained relief from the automatic stay placed on FWDC's estate as a result of the bankruptcy filing.   BNE operated the Falmouth Woods property as a mortgagee in possession, briefly continuing service at the Falmouth Woods golf course, and tried to sell Falmouth Woods subdivision lots.   It eventually foreclosed its mortgage and purchased the property at the subsequent foreclosure sale.   Because FWDC's mortgage did not include the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road, the foreclosure sale purchase left BNE with title to Falmouth Woods and an easement over Falmouth Woods Road.  The fee interest in the road remained with the bankruptcy trustee assigned to manage FWDC's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Falmouth Woods property changed hands several times after BNE's foreclosure-sale purchase, thwarting LeBlanc's efforts to obtain an easement over Falmouth Woods Road.  In September 1990, BNE transferred the Falmouth Woods property to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Falmouth Land Company (\"FLC\").   In January 1991, the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (\"COC\") declared BNE insolvent and appointed the FDIC receiver of BNE.  The COC also chartered the New Bank of New England, N.A.  (\"NBNE\"), pursuant to 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(n), as a bridge bank to acquire the assets formerly held by BNE.  Thus, NBNE held title to the FWDC property, as well as LeBlanc's $750,000.00 note and guaranty from January to July of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 13, 1991, the COC dissolved NBNE and appointed the FDIC as receiver of the bank, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(n)(12).   The FDIC then acquired Falmouth Woods and assumed the note and the mortgage on the LeBlanc parcel.   On August 13, 1991, the FDIC took title to the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road in the name of FLC, the NBNE subsidiary.   NBNE had purchased the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road from the FWDC's bankruptcy trustee in May 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc pursued his easement request with each of Falmouth Woods's owners because the Prospect Hills parcel, initially appraised at $1,980,000.00, was virtually worthless without access to Falmouth Woods Road.  Negotiations with BNE, FLC, and Oak Tree Capitol (\"Oak Tree\"), a company which functioned as asset manager for both FLC and BNE, were unsuccessful.   Attempts to obtain a right of way from NBNE and the FDIC were also unsuccessful, primarily because both entities engaged in actions which blocked LeBlanc's acquisition efforts.   NBNE contested LeBlanc's efforts to resolve his road access problems through direct negotiations with the FWDC bankruptcy trustee and was ultimately successful in outbidding LeBlanc for the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road.  According to LeBlanc, NBNE officials also misrepresented the fact that they were marketing the Falmouth Woods property without reservation of rights or notice of claims.   LeBlanc further asserts that NBNE attempted to accelerate payment on his note by declining to honor a loan commitment made to another LeBlanc development entity, DDM Development Corporation (\"DDM\"), and making an easement across Falmouth Woods Road contingent upon increased collateralization of the note or a reduction in principal.   LeBlanc imputes a similar bad intent to the FDIC, which failed to convey him an easement during work-out negotiations on the note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Payments on LeBlanc's $750,000.00 note were current and regular until the Fall of 1991.   Then, in a November 13, 1991, letter, LeBlanc informed the FDIC, which held title to Falmouth Woods and Falmouth Woods Road at that time, that its refusal to convey the requested easement entitled him to discontinue payments on the $750,000.00 note and that he would not resume payments until the easement matter was resolved.   On November 21, 1991, the FDIC made a demand for full payment of the outstanding note balance.   When LeBlanc failed to make the requested payment, the FDIC, on August 7, 1992, foreclosed and sold the Prospect Hills property for $235,000.00 at auction.   Appellant's son, Mark LeBlanc, as Trustee of the McAuliffe Nominee Trust, purchased the property.   The deficiency due on LeBlanc's note, the subject of the instant appeal, has not yet been paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1992, the FDIC filed an action in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking the deficiency balance on LeBlanc's note.   On August 21, 1992, LeBlanc filed an answer and three count counterclaim, alleging that the FDIC's refusal to grant LeBlanc an easement across Falmouth Woods Road violated state law.   Count I of the counterclaim alleged that the FDIC's actions breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in all contracts made under Massachusetts law.   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 1-203 (1990).   Count II alleged a breach of contract under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 9-106, which governs secured transactions.   Count III raised claims in tort for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 17, 1993, before a magistrate judge, the FDIC moved for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), and argued that the federal estoppel doctrine established by the Supreme Court's decision in D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. at 447, 62 S.Ct. at 676, and 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e) barred LeBlanc from asserting his defenses and three counterclaims.   LeBlanc contended that neither section 1823(e) nor the common law D'Oench doctrine it codifies preempted his counterclaims.   He maintained that, under Massachusetts common law and the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\"), the duties allegedly breached by the FDIC arose out of the performance and administration of the note and not out of an unauthorized side agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a May 13, 1993, order, the magistrate judge allowed, in part, and denied, in part, the FDIC's Rule 12(c) motion.   The court found that the principal allegations raised by LeBlanc's counterclaims rested on an \"implied\" and, under the D'Oench doctrine, unenforceable \"agreement that the FDIC affirmatively assist LeBlanc ... in [his] attempt to acquire a right of way over the road.\"   It, therefore, dismissed those allegations in counts I and III of appellant's counterclaim which relied on that agreement, holding that all other allegations, taken as true, were legally sufficient to survive Rule 12(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ruled that count II of appellant's counterclaim, which was based on Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 9-507 and focused on the FDIC's conduct at the August 1991 foreclosure auction, survived the Rule 12(c) motion because, unlike counts I and III, it was based exclusively on state law.   She did not, however, attempt to resolve that claim because she found the information available to her insufficient to decide the commercial reasonableness of the FDIC's foreclosure actions.   Finally, the magistrate judge rejected the FDIC's claim that a federal common law rule barring LeBlanc's claims should be fashioned.   She found that LeBlanc's counterclaim was procedurally deficient because he failed to seek leave to name the FDIC as a counterclaim-defendant in its corporate capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1993, the district court issued an order accepting the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, with two modifications.   It dismissed LeBlanc's counterclaims against the FDIC in its corporate capacity and reserved the issue of which party bears the burden of proof on matters of \"commercial reasonableness\" for later determination.   The FDIC filed a motion for summary judgment against LeBlanc on July 22, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 27, 1994, the district court issued an order allowing summary judgment for the FDIC on its affirmative claim for the deficiency due on the note and post-judgment interest.   The district court agreed with the magistrate judge's determination that the federal estoppel doctrine barred much of LeBlanc's answer and concluded that \"LeBlanc has presented no defense that would excuse his default.\"   The court also granted the FDIC's summary judgment motion with respect to appellant's three-count counterclaim.   It reaffirmed the magistrate judge's conclusion that appellant's counterclaims were barred to the extent that they were based on a side agreement or affirmative duty and, consequently, only considered the state law issues which survived the magistrate judge's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without deciding whether D'Oench and section 1823(e) permit claims based on terms implied in an agreement as a matter of state law, the district court held that appellant's allegations, even if true, did not constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   Noting that Massachusetts law does not impose a duty to enter into a contract, the court rejected appellant's claims that it was inappropriate for the FDIC to compete with LeBlanc or to use the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also held that LeBlanc's claim that the FDIC failed to handle its secured collateral, the Prospect Hills parcel, in accordance with Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 9-507, could not stand because that statute does not govern secured transactions where the security is real property.   Finally, the district court granted summary judgment on appellant's intentional infliction of emotional distress counterclaim.   It concluded that the FDIC's actions did not amount to extreme and outrageous behavior within the meaning of Massachusetts tort law, though it acknowledged that the FDIC's actions in attempting to trade an easement in Falmouth Woods Road \"may [have] constitute[d] rather hard-nosed business.\"   The court entered its judgment on May 8, 1995, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, EEOC v. Green, 76 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1996), but may affirm on any independently sufficient ground.  Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992);  see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).   We do not consider the issues presented by appellant's intentional infliction of emotional distress and Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106, &#167; 9-507 counterclaims.   Appellant failed to heed our oft-articulated warning that \"issues averted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, [will be] deemed waived for purposes of appeal.\"  Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir.1994);  see also Executive Leasing v. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, 48 F.3d 66, 68 (1st Cir.)  (On appeal, \"[w]e will not rely upon arguments and allegations that are developed only in the district court pleadings.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 171, 133 L.Ed.2d 112 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we consider those counterclaim I issues which the district court held hinged on an affirmative obligation or implied agreement that the FDIC assist appellant in obtaining a right of way over Falmouth Woods Road.  Appellant did not object to the magistrate's decision and, therefore, waived his right to appeal the district court's order on this question.   See Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150-51 (1st Cir.1994);  see also 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(C);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b).   We concern ourselves solely with LeBlanc's defense to the FDIC's affirmative claims and those counterclaim I arguments which the district court held survived D'Oench and section 1823(e).   For the sake of convenience, we use \"FDIC\" to refer to both the FDIC in its capacity as receiver and its predecessors in interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>LeBlanc's Defense to the FDIC's Affirmative Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on the FDIC's claim for the deficiency due on the $750,000.00 note and entered judgment in favor of the FDIC in the amount of $686,942.78, plus post-judgment interest.   On appeal, LeBlanc argues that the district court erroneously held that D'Oench and section 1823(e) barred his defense that the FDIC, as receiver of NBNE, breached its obligation to perform the terms of the loan agreement in good faith, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 1-203, by competing with him for the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road.  He contends that his defense of economic coercion concerns the value of the $750,000.00 note and not his failed attempts to secure a right of way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this point, we discern no error in the district court's analysis.   Without deciding whether breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims are generally precluded by D'Oench, we hold that the particular defense advanced in this case is barred.   Appellant's defense rests on an unwritten or implied agreement regarding a right of way over Falmouth Woods Road and not the terms of the $750,000.00 note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common law D'Oench doctrine \"prevents plaintiffs from asserting as either a claim or defense against the FDIC oral agreements or 'arrangements.' \"  Adams v. Zimmerman, 73 F.3d 1164, 1168 (1st Cir.1996)(quoting Timberland Design, Inc. v. First Serv.  Bank for Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 48-50 (1st Cir.1991)).   Its statutory codification, section 1823(e), \"bars anyone from asserting against the FDIC any 'agreement' that is not in writing and is not properly recorded in the records of the bank.\"   Id.;  see also 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).   Section 1823(e), as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>No agreement which tends to diminish or defeat the interest of the Corporation in any asset acquired by it under this section or section 1821 of this title, either as security for a loan or by purchase or as receiver of any insured depository institution, shall be valid against the Corporation unless such agreement--(1) is in writing, (2) was executed by the depository institution and any person claiming an adverse interest thereunder, including the obligor, contemporaneously with the acquisition of the asset by the depository institution, (3) was approved by the board of directors of the depository institution or its loan committee, which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board or committee, and (4) has been, continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the depository institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).   Though there is some disagreement as to whether D'Oench and section 1823(e) should be read as coextensive, see Adams, 73 F.3d at 1168-69 n. 2, all courts agree that they serve the same purpose:  to \"prohibi[t] all secret agreements that tend to make the FDIC susceptible to fraudulent arrangements.\"  Timberland Design, Inc. v.

Bank for Sav., 932 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of agreements precluded by D'Oench and section 1823(e) is expansive.   See Adams, 73 F.3d at 1169.   It includes promises to perform, as well as fraudulent misrepresentations or warranties, whether the FDIC had knowledge of the fraud or misrepresentation at the time it acquired the asset or not.  Langley v. FDIC, 484 U.S. 86, 91-94, 108 S.Ct. 396, 401-03, 98 L.Ed.2d 340 (1987).

The problem with this is that nothing in the terms of the $750,000.00 note can be read to create such a duty on the part of the FDIC.  LeBlanc, in fact, admits that the $750,000.00 note was contingent neither upon his obtaining nor the FDIC or its predecessors providing an easement.   Accordingly, this attempt to shift the risk LeBlanc knowingly assumed when he purchased the land-locked Prospect Hills property to the FDIC, and consequently, to unsuspecting creditors and depositors, must fail.   See Timberland, 932 F.2d at 48.   Permitting appellant to proceed on the basis of an unrecorded agreement would undermine the accuracy of NBNE's records and further complicate the FDIC's task of valuing NBNE's assets.   Compare Desmond v. FDIC, 798 F.Supp. 829, 839 (D.Mass.1992);  see also Langley, 484 U.S. at 92, 108 S.Ct. at 401-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>LeBlanc's Counterclaim for Breach of an Implied Covenant of</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Good Faith and Fair Dealing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc avers that the FDIC, as receiver of NBNE, breached its obligation to perform the terms of the $750,000.00 loan agreement in good faith in three regards.   He contends that the FDIC deprived him of the fruits of his bargain, see Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assoc., 411 Mass. 451, 471, 583 N.E.2d 806 (1991), by withholding funds due him on the DDM construction project and by making an easement across Falmouth Woods Road contingent upon provision of additional collateral or a reduction in note principal and utilizing artificially low appraisals of the Prospect Hills development.   He also alleges that the FDIC's failure to extend him an easement across Falmouth Woods Road during work-out negotiations constitutes a breach of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an argument that D'Oench precludes these claims, at least to the extent that they rely upon any specifics in the negotiations between the borrower and the bank, even if the specifics are not formally agreements.   See Langley, 484 U.S. at 91-94, 108 S.Ct. at 401-03.   But even if we assume that D'Oench does not bar LeBlanc's breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counterclaims--and, as we indicated in the previous section, we are certainly not deciding that question here--appellant has not convinced us that there is any general obligation under state law that required the bank (in the absence of an agreement) to take the affirmative steps appellant now claims should have been taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We detect no bad faith in the FDIC's decision to withhold DDM project funds or to make an easement across Falmouth Woods Road contingent upon additional collateral or a reduction in principal.   Though the FDIC's dealings with LeBlanc were arguably \"hard-nosed,\" there is no evidence that the FDIC's actions deprived LeBlanc of the benefits of the loan agreement.   See Anthony's Pier, 411 Mass. at 471, 583 N.E.2d 806.   LeBlanc neither disputes that he received the proceeds of the $750,000.00 loan nor suggests that the FDIC took adverse actions on the note before his November 1992 default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc's arguments are complaints about the terms on which the FDIC proposed to execute or continue agreements with him.   But having engaged in rigorous bargaining of his own, LeBlanc cannot now contend that it was unfair for the FDIC to bargain for more security on the $750,000.00 note.   The FDIC had no duty at all under the loan agreement to extend appellant an easement, let alone to provide him one on terms which were more favorable to him.   Nothing prevents a party to a bargain from engaging in hard-nosed dealings, see Schwanbeck v. Federal-Mogul Corp., 31 Mass.App.Ct. 390, 405, 578 N.E.2d 789 (1991), rev'd on other grounds, 412 Mass. 703, 706, 592 N.E.2d 1289 (1992), or even from attempting to capture opportunities foregone at the formation of one contract--i.e., the loan agreement--by negotiating another--i.e., the easement.   See Burton, Breach of Contract and the Common Law Duty to Perform in Good Faith, 94 Harv.  L.Rev. 369, 372-73 (1980).   As the district court astutely observed, \"the FDIC owned something that LeBlanc wanted, and it was permissible for the FDIC to use that 'something' as a bargaining chip in order to obtain what it wanted, namely more security on the $750,000.00 note.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject LeBlanc's claim that the FDIC breached its obligation to perform in good faith during work-out negotiations with appellant.   Massachusetts law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every existing contract.   See Anthony's Pier, 411 Mass. at 472, 583 N.E.2d 806;  Fortune v. Nat'l Cash Register Co., 373 Mass. 96, 364 N.E.2d 1251 (1977);  Schwanbeck, 31 Mass.App.Ct. at 397 n. 6, 578 N.E.2d 789.  At the time the work-out negotiations occurred, however, there was no contract between the FDIC and LeBlanc.   LeBlanc's November 1992 default ended the contractual relationship he theretofore enjoyed with the FDIC.  We, therefore, hold that LeBlanc's claim fails to the extent that it relies on the loan agreement.   That claim also fails to the extent that it rests on an obligation to negotiate new contracts in good faith.   We are not convinced that the loan agreement contained any such contractual obligation, see Schwanbeck v. Federal-Mogul Corp., 412 Mass. 703, 706, 592 N.E.2d 1289 (1992), and do not find, for that matter, any evidence that the FDIC entered into work-out negotiations with an ulterior purpose or bad motives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment. The judgment sum of the district court is affirmed.   There will be added to that sum, $686,942.78, such post-judgment interest as is due.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court held that the defenses and counterclaims LeBlanc raised in response to the FDIC's affirmative suit to recover the deficiency owed on a mortgage note he and his company, LeBlanc Associates, (collectively \"LeBlanc\") executed on January 5, 1989, were barred by both Massachusetts law and the D'Oench doctrine.   We affirm this decision, but on slightly different grounds than those articulated by the district court.

Levy v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194983\"><a href=\"/opinion/194983/levy-v-weinhold/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></a></span>, 1056 (1st Cir.1993).   In 1987, appellant acquired the 54-acre parcel at issue in this case.   The parcel, which is located in Falmouth, Massachusetts, and abuts a 900-acre, partially-completed, residential community called Falmouth Woods, is accessible by only one road, Falmouth Woods Road.  Though appellant purchased the parcel without first obtaining a right of way over Falmouth Woods Road, his intent was ultimately to acquire such an easement and to develop his parcel into a six-lot, multifamily subdivision called Prospect Hills.   At the time LeBlanc purchased the property, both the Falmouth Woods development and Falmouth Woods Road, which fronts the LeBlanc parcel's western boundary, were owned by the Falmouth Woods Development Corporation (\"FWDC\"), a Massachusetts corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1989, to finance development of the Prospect Hills parcel, LeBlanc obtained a $750,000.00 loan from the Bank of New England South, N.A., which later merged into Bank of New England, N.A.  (\"BNE\").  The loan, which both parties agree was not conditioned upon LeBlanc's acquiring an easement across Falmouth Woods Road, was secured by a personal guaranty note executed by LeBlanc and a mortgage on the 54-acre parcel.   Payment on the note was to be monthly, beginning in February of 1989, with the provision that the principal balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, were to be paid by January 4, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc obtained approval and a permit for the Prospect Hills subdivision from the Falmouth Planning Board and, in the Fall of 1989, began meeting with FWDC to discuss securing access rights over Falmouth Woods Road.  During negotiations, FWDC verbally agreed to grant LeBlanc an easement for utilities and right of way across Falmouth Woods Road.  A written agreement regarding the easement, however, was never prepared.   Before the sale of the easement could be recorded, FWDC began experiencing financial difficulties and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March of 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BNE, which had loaned FWDC $28 million prior to extending LeBlanc the loan to develop Prospect Hills and, as a result, held a mortgage in the Falmouth Woods property, sought and obtained relief from the automatic stay placed on FWDC's estate as a result of the bankruptcy filing.   BNE operated the Falmouth Woods property as a mortgagee in possession, briefly continuing service at the Falmouth Woods golf course, and tried to sell Falmouth Woods subdivision lots.   It eventually foreclosed its mortgage and purchased the property at the subsequent foreclosure sale.   Because FWDC's mortgage did not include the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road, the foreclosure sale purchase left BNE with title to Falmouth Woods and an easement over Falmouth Woods Road.  The fee interest in the road remained with the bankruptcy trustee assigned to manage FWDC's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Falmouth Woods property changed hands several times after BNE's foreclosure-sale purchase, thwarting LeBlanc's efforts to obtain an easement over Falmouth Woods Road.  In September 1990, BNE transferred the Falmouth Woods property to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Falmouth Land Company (\"FLC\").   In January 1991, the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States of America (\"COC\") declared BNE insolvent and appointed the FDIC receiver of BNE.  The COC also chartered the New Bank of New England, N.A.  (\"NBNE\"), pursuant to 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(n), as a bridge bank to acquire the assets formerly held by BNE.  Thus, NBNE held title to the FWDC property, as well as LeBlanc's $750,000.00 note and guaranty from January to July of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 13, 1991, the COC dissolved NBNE and appointed the FDIC as receiver of the bank, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(n)(12).   The FDIC then acquired Falmouth Woods and assumed the note and the mortgage on the LeBlanc parcel.   On August 13, 1991, the FDIC took title to the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road in the name of FLC, the NBNE subsidiary.   NBNE had purchased the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road from the FWDC's bankruptcy trustee in May 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc pursued his easement request with each of Falmouth Woods's owners because the Prospect Hills parcel, initially appraised at $1,980,000.00, was virtually worthless without access to Falmouth Woods Road.  Negotiations with BNE, FLC, and Oak Tree Capitol (\"Oak Tree\"), a company which functioned as asset manager for both FLC and BNE, were unsuccessful.   Attempts to obtain a right of way from NBNE and the FDIC were also unsuccessful, primarily because both entities engaged in actions which blocked LeBlanc's acquisition efforts.   NBNE contested LeBlanc's efforts to resolve his road access problems through direct negotiations with the FWDC bankruptcy trustee and was ultimately successful in outbidding LeBlanc for the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road.  According to LeBlanc, NBNE officials also misrepresented the fact that they were marketing the Falmouth Woods property without reservation of rights or notice of claims.   LeBlanc further asserts that NBNE attempted to accelerate payment on his note by declining to honor a loan commitment made to another LeBlanc development entity, DDM Development Corporation (\"DDM\"), and making an easement across Falmouth Woods Road contingent upon increased collateralization of the note or a reduction in principal.   LeBlanc imputes a similar bad intent to the FDIC, which failed to convey him an easement during work-out negotiations on the note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Payments on LeBlanc's $750,000.00 note were current and regular until the Fall of 1991.   Then, in a November 13, 1991, letter, LeBlanc informed the FDIC, which held title to Falmouth Woods and Falmouth Woods Road at that time, that its refusal to convey the requested easement entitled him to discontinue payments on the $750,000.00 note and that he would not resume payments until the easement matter was resolved.   On November 21, 1991, the FDIC made a demand for full payment of the outstanding note balance.   When LeBlanc failed to make the requested payment, the FDIC, on August 7, 1992, foreclosed and sold the Prospect Hills property for $235,000.00 at auction.   Appellant's son, Mark LeBlanc, as Trustee of the McAuliffe Nominee Trust, purchased the property.   The deficiency due on LeBlanc's note, the subject of the instant appeal, has not yet been paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 19, 1992, the FDIC filed an action in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking the deficiency balance on LeBlanc's note.   On August 21, 1992, LeBlanc filed an answer and three count counterclaim, alleging that the FDIC's refusal to grant LeBlanc an easement across Falmouth Woods Road violated state law.   Count I of the counterclaim alleged that the FDIC's actions breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in all contracts made under Massachusetts law.   See Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 1-203 (1990).   Count II alleged a breach of contract under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 9-106, which governs secured transactions.   Count III raised claims in tort for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 17, 1993, before a magistrate judge, the FDIC moved for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), and argued that the federal estoppel doctrine established by the Supreme Court's decision in D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. at 447, 62 S.Ct. at 676, and 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e) barred LeBlanc from asserting his defenses and three counterclaims.   LeBlanc contended that neither section 1823(e) nor the common law D'Oench doctrine it codifies preempted his counterclaims.   He maintained that, under Massachusetts common law and the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\"), the duties allegedly breached by the FDIC arose out of the performance and administration of the note and not out of an unauthorized side agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a May 13, 1993, order, the magistrate judge allowed, in part, and denied, in part, the FDIC's Rule 12(c) motion.   The court found that the principal allegations raised by LeBlanc's counterclaims rested on an \"implied\" and, under the D'Oench doctrine, unenforceable \"agreement that the FDIC affirmatively assist LeBlanc ... in [his] attempt to acquire a right of way over the road.\"   It, therefore, dismissed those allegations in counts I and III of appellant's counterclaim which relied on that agreement, holding that all other allegations, taken as true, were legally sufficient to survive Rule 12(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge ruled that count II of appellant's counterclaim, which was based on Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 9-507 and focused on the FDIC's conduct at the August 1991 foreclosure auction, survived the Rule 12(c) motion because, unlike counts I and III, it was based exclusively on state law.   She did not, however, attempt to resolve that claim because she found the information available to her insufficient to decide the commercial reasonableness of the FDIC's foreclosure actions.   Finally, the magistrate judge rejected the FDIC's claim that a federal common law rule barring LeBlanc's claims should be fashioned.   She found that LeBlanc's counterclaim was procedurally deficient because he failed to seek leave to name the FDIC as a counterclaim-defendant in its corporate capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 13, 1993, the district court issued an order accepting the Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, with two modifications.   It dismissed LeBlanc's counterclaims against the FDIC in its corporate capacity and reserved the issue of which party bears the burden of proof on matters of \"commercial reasonableness\" for later determination.   The FDIC filed a motion for summary judgment against LeBlanc on July 22, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 27, 1994, the district court issued an order allowing summary judgment for the FDIC on its affirmative claim for the deficiency due on the note and post-judgment interest.   The district court agreed with the magistrate judge's determination that the federal estoppel doctrine barred much of LeBlanc's answer and concluded that \"LeBlanc has presented no defense that would excuse his default.\"   The court also granted the FDIC's summary judgment motion with respect to appellant's three-count counterclaim.   It reaffirmed the magistrate judge's conclusion that appellant's counterclaims were barred to the extent that they were based on a side agreement or affirmative duty and, consequently, only considered the state law issues which survived the magistrate judge's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without deciding whether D'Oench and section 1823(e) permit claims based on terms implied in an agreement as a matter of state law, the district court held that appellant's allegations, even if true, did not constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.   Noting that Massachusetts law does not impose a duty to enter into a contract, the court rejected appellant's claims that it was inappropriate for the FDIC to compete with LeBlanc or to use the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also held that LeBlanc's claim that the FDIC failed to handle its secured collateral, the Prospect Hills parcel, in accordance with Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 9-507, could not stand because that statute does not govern secured transactions where the security is real property.   Finally, the district court granted summary judgment on appellant's intentional infliction of emotional distress counterclaim.   It concluded that the FDIC's actions did not amount to extreme and outrageous behavior within the meaning of Massachusetts tort law, though it acknowledged that the FDIC's actions in attempting to trade an easement in Falmouth Woods Road \"may [have] constitute[d] rather hard-nosed business.\"   The court entered its judgment on May 8, 1995, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, EEOC v.

Appellant did not object to the magistrate's decision and, therefore, waived his right to appeal the district court's order on this question.   See Henley Drilling Co. v.

We concern ourselves solely with LeBlanc's defense to the FDIC's affirmative claims and those counterclaim I arguments which the district court held survived D'Oench and section 1823(e).   For the sake of convenience, we use \"FDIC\" to refer to both the FDIC in its capacity as receiver and its predecessors in interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>LeBlanc's Defense to the FDIC's Affirmative Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment on the FDIC's claim for the deficiency due on the $750,000.00 note and entered judgment in favor of the FDIC in the amount of $686,942.78, plus post-judgment interest.   On appeal, LeBlanc argues that the district court erroneously held that D'Oench and section 1823(e) barred his defense that the FDIC, as receiver of NBNE, breached its obligation to perform the terms of the loan agreement in good faith, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 106 &#167; 1-203, by competing with him for the fee interest in Falmouth Woods Road.  He contends that his defense of economic coercion concerns the value of the $750,000.00 note and not his failed attempts to secure a right of way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this point, we discern no error in the district court's analysis.   Without deciding whether breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims are generally precluded by D'Oench, we hold that the particular defense advanced in this case is barred.   Appellant's defense rests on an unwritten or implied agreement regarding a right of way over Falmouth Woods Road and not the terms of the $750,000.00 note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common law D'Oench doctrine \"prevents plaintiffs from asserting as either a claim or defense against the FDIC oral agreements or 'arrangements.' \"  Adams v.

Though there is some disagreement as to whether D'Oench and section 1823(e) should be read as coextensive, see Adams, 73 F.3d at 1168-69 n. 2, all courts agree that they serve the same purpose:  to \"prohibi[t] all secret agreements that tend to make the FDIC susceptible to fraudulent arrangements.\"  Timberland Design, Inc. v.

The problem with this is that nothing in the terms of the $750,000.00 note can be read to create such a duty on the part of the FDIC.  LeBlanc, in fact, admits that the $750,000.00 note was contingent neither upon his obtaining nor the FDIC or its predecessors providing an easement.   Accordingly, this attempt to shift the risk LeBlanc knowingly assumed when he purchased the land-locked Prospect Hills property to the FDIC, and consequently, to unsuspecting creditors and depositors, must fail.   See Timberland, 932 F.2d at 48.   Permitting appellant to proceed on the basis of an unrecorded agreement would undermine the accuracy of NBNE's records and further complicate the FDIC's task of valuing NBNE's assets.   Compare Desmond v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></span>, 839 (D.Mass.1992);  see also Langley, 484 U.S. at 92, 108 S.Ct. at 401-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>LeBlanc's Counterclaim for Breach of an Implied Covenant of</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Good Faith and Fair Dealing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc avers that the FDIC, as receiver of NBNE, breached its obligation to perform the terms of the $750,000.00 loan agreement in good faith in three regards.   He contends that the FDIC deprived him of the fruits of his bargain, see Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assoc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2172105\"><a href=\"/opinion/2172105/anthonys-pier-four-inc-v-hbc-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, 471, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2172105\"><a href=\"/opinion/2172105/anthonys-pier-four-inc-v-hbc-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span> (1991), by withholding funds due him on the DDM construction project and by making an easement across Falmouth Woods Road contingent upon provision of additional collateral or a reduction in note principal and utilizing artificially low appraisals of the Prospect Hills development.   He also alleges that the FDIC's failure to extend him an easement across Falmouth Woods Road during work-out negotiations constitutes a breach of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an argument that D'Oench precludes these claims, at least to the extent that they rely upon any specifics in the negotiations between the borrower and the bank, even if the specifics are not formally agreements.   See Langley, 484 U.S. at 91-94, 108 S.Ct. at 401-03.   But even if we assume that D'Oench does not bar LeBlanc's breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counterclaims--and, as we indicated in the previous section, we are certainly not deciding that question here--appellant has not convinced us that there is any general obligation under state law that required the bank (in the absence of an agreement) to take the affirmative steps appellant now claims should have been taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We detect no bad faith in the FDIC's decision to withhold DDM project funds or to make an easement across Falmouth Woods Road contingent upon additional collateral or a reduction in principal.   Though the FDIC's dealings with LeBlanc were arguably \"hard-nosed,\" there is no evidence that the FDIC's actions deprived LeBlanc of the benefits of the loan agreement.   See Anthony's Pier, 411 Mass. at 471, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2172105\"><a href=\"/opinion/2172105/anthonys-pier-four-inc-v-hbc-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>.   LeBlanc neither disputes that he received the proceeds of the $750,000.00 loan nor suggests that the FDIC took adverse actions on the note before his November 1992 default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LeBlanc's arguments are complaints about the terms on which the FDIC proposed to execute or continue agreements with him.   But having engaged in rigorous bargaining of his own, LeBlanc cannot now contend that it was unfair for the FDIC to bargain for more security on the $750,000.00 note.   The FDIC had no duty at all under the loan agreement to extend appellant an easement, let alone to provide him one on terms which were more favorable to him.   Nothing prevents a party to a bargain from engaging in hard-nosed dealings, see Schwanbeck v. Federal-Mogul Corp., 31 Mass.App.Ct. 390, 405, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2089045\"><a href=\"/opinion/2089045/schwanbeck-v-federal-mogul-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span> (1991), rev'd on other grounds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2237409\"><a href=\"/opinion/2237409/schwanbeck-v-federal-mogul-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 706, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2237409\"><a href=\"/opinion/2237409/schwanbeck-v-federal-mogul-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span> (1992), or even from attempting to capture opportunities foregone at the formation of one contract--i.e., the loan agreement--by negotiating another--i.e., the easement.   See Burton, Breach of Contract and the Common Law Duty to Perform in Good Faith, 94 Harv.  L.Rev. 369, 372-73 (1980).   As the district court astutely observed, \"the FDIC owned something that LeBlanc wanted, and it was permissible for the FDIC to use that 'something' as a bargaining chip in order to obtain what it wanted, namely more security on the $750,000.00 note.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject LeBlanc's claim that the FDIC breached its obligation to perform in good faith during work-out negotiations with appellant.   Massachusetts law implies a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every existing contract.   See Anthony's Pier, 411 Mass. at 472, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2172105\"><a href=\"/opinion/2172105/anthonys-pier-four-inc-v-hbc-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>;  Fortune v.

At the time the work-out negotiations occurred, however, there was no contract between the FDIC and LeBlanc.   LeBlanc's November 1992 default ended the contractual relationship he theretofore enjoyed with the FDIC.  We, therefore, hold that LeBlanc's claim fails to the extent that it relies on the loan agreement.   That claim also fails to the extent that it rests on an obligation to negotiate new contracts in good faith.   We are not convinced that the loan agreement contained any such contractual obligation, see Schwanbeck v. Federal-Mogul Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2237409\"><a href=\"/opinion/2237409/schwanbeck-v-federal-mogul-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 706, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2237409\"><a href=\"/opinion/2237409/schwanbeck-v-federal-mogul-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span> (1992), and do not find, for that matter, any evidence that the FDIC entered into work-out negotiations with an ulterior purpose or bad motives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.
