Song, Special Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nChief, Criminal Division, and Frank J. Bustamonte, Special\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 6, 2002\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge. The efforts of a number of persons\n\nto halt the Navy's use of the island of Vieques for bombing and\n\nother live-fire exercises sometimes have gone beyond what the law\n\npermits.      These   excesses,   and   the    federal   courts'        necessary\n\ninvolvement    in   bringing   lawbreakers     to    account,    have    spawned\n\nconsiderable    public   controversy.         This   appeal     stems    from   an\n\nincident related to that controversy.                In it, the appellant,\n\nattorney Adalina De Jesús-Morales, asks us to annul sanctions\n\nimposed against her by the district court in the course of a\n\nVieques protest case.     As the recent history of appeals indicates,\n\nthe district court has done an admirable job in handling a sudden\n\ninflux of several hundred protesters' cases under the microscope of\n\npervasive media attention; but in this unusual instance, taking\n\ndirect account of the need to assure robust advocacy in criminal\n\nmatters, we find no legally sufficient basis for the imposition of\n\nsanctions (and, therefore, vacate the challenged order).\n\n           The background facts are not disputed. The Navy has used\n\nVieques for live-fire exercises for upward of sixty years.                      Its\n\nactivities have become increasingly unpopular over that span (at\n\nleast among some groups) and protests have erupted from time to\n\ntime. E.g., United States v. Parrilla Bonilla, 648 F.2d 1373, 1374\n\n(1st Cir. 1981).      A fatal accident (involving an employee of the\n\nNavy) occurred in 1999.        This accident drove the dissonance to a\n\nnew pitch.     As a result, the federal district court has been\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fdeluged with criminal trespass cases brought against protesters who\n\nwere arrested after they entered either the naval base situated on\n\nthe island of Vieques or the areas associated therewith.                      See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Ventura-Meléndez, 275 F.3d 9, 16-18 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); United States v. Maxwell, 254 F.3d 21, 23-24 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Sharpton, 252 F.3d 536, 538-39 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam).          This massive infusion of cases has thronged\n\nthe already congested docket of a busy court.\n\n            After the initial batch of arrests — 465 in all — the\n\nchief    judge   of    the   district     court   acted   quickly   to   marshal\n\navailable judicial resources. Although the court's standard praxis\n\ncalled for the random assignment of criminal cases,1 the chief\n\njudge entered an order dated June 28, 2000 (the Presentment Order),\n\nwhich directed that all Vieques cases be brought to the chief judge\n\nupon filing      for   assignment    by    him    to   available   district    and\n\nmagistrate judges in a rotating sequence (the mechanics of which\n\nwere not specified).          The Presentment Order bore only the chief\n\njudge's signature.\n\n            In April of 2001, another wave of protests occurred and\n\nan additional 181 criminal trespass cases were filed.                 The chief\n\njudge granted the government's ex parte motion to consolidate and\n\n\n\n     1\n      In terms, the operative local rule, D.P.R. R. 302.4, speaks\nonly of civil cases. The parties agree, however, that the district\ncourt traditionally has applied this rule to criminal cases as\nwell.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe cases were segregated into clusters (by arresting officer).\n\nThe consolidations left some of the judges with multiple groups of\n\ndefendants and others with few or none.               To alleviate this unequal\n\ndistribution, the senior active judge, temporarily at the court's\n\nhelm   in    the    chief    judge's       absence,   ordered      groups   of   cases\n\nreassigned to equalize the judges' workloads.\n\n             Although these arrangements proved more efficient in\n\ncertain respects,           they   created    a   number   of   anomalies.        Some\n\ndefendants found themselves lumped with other defendants who had\n\nbeen arrested at different times and/or places.                        When certain\n\ndefendants complained that they had not received prior notice of\n\nthe government's motion to consolidate, and that, at any rate, the\n\nconsolidation order violated the joinder provisions of Federal Rule\n\nof   Criminal      Procedure       8(b),    the   chief    judge    rejected     their\n\nimportunings.        He did, however, issue an order explaining in some\n\ndetail the rationale for the Presentment Order, the consolidation\n\norder, and the ensuing reassignment of groups of cases. See United\n\nStates      v.    Ayala    Ayala,    No.     01-211    (D.P.R.      June    5,   2001)\n\n(unpublished order).           He also explained that the terms of the\n\nPresentment Order were no longer in vogue, but, rather, that\n\nVieques cases were being assigned randomly by the clerk's office,\n\nand then reassigned by him only when necessary to ensure efficient\n\nhandling.        See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f          The    appellant   represented   a   codefendant   (Zoraida\n\nFigueroa-Arenas) charged in the very case that yielded the June 5\n\norder. She also represented a second defendant (Juan Nuñez-Reynes)\n\nwho had been charged in another case arising out of the most recent\n\nspate of protests.   Both groups of cases had been shifted to the\n\nchief judge's calendar by virtue of the consolidation order.       On\n\nJune 14, 2001, the appellant (acting on behalf of both clients)\n\nmoved to dismiss the pending charges or, in the alternative, for\n\nreassignment.2 Noting that the statute authorizing district courts\n\nto promulgate local rules, 28 U.S.C. § 137, requires that the chief\n\njudge respect these rules and assign the cases as provided therein,\n\nthe motion papers asserted that an assignment system cannot deviate\n\nfrom that established by the court's local rules without the\n\nconsent of the judicial council for the circuit in which the\n\ndistrict sits.   Because the Presentment Order did not explain the\n\nsource of the chief judge's ostensible authority to contravene this\n\nstatute, the motion argued that the ad hoc assignment system for\n\nVieques cases was fatally flawed.      The motion elaborated on this\n\nthesis, stating in part:\n\n          According to the Local Rules of this Court\n          regarding the assignment of cases, Rule 302.4\n          and Rule 302.8, civil and criminal case[s]\n          must be assigned by lot. The chief judge in\n          this case has usurped the authority of his\n\n\n     2\n      Although the motion did not elaborate on the prayer for\nalternative relief, the appellant presumably had in mind returning\nthe cases to the judges who originally had drawn them.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            fellow judges and taken control of the\n            assignment system for criminal cases. . . .\n\n            . . . .\n\n            . . . .    The recent order of June 5, 2001\n            suggests that, contrary to [the Presentment\n            Order], Vieques trespass cases are being\n            assigned randomly by the clerk's office and\n            then   referred to    the  Chief   Judge   for\n            reassignment.   Either way, the interference\n            with the normal practice of the Court\n            regarding case[] assignments [is] unlawful and\n            must be voided as the Chief Judge does not\n            have the authority to alter this practice\n            within the district.\n\n            The next day, the appellant appeared before the chief\n\njudge for a scheduling conference in the Figueroa-Arenas matter.\n\nThe conference was held in chambers, with a court reporter present.\n\nThe chief judge expressed concern about the statements contained in\n\nthe motion, characterizing those statements as an unfair attack on\n\nthe court.    Despite the appellant's disclaimer of any defamatory\n\nintent, the chief judge placed her under oath to inquire into the\n\nfactual foundation for the statements.      The appellant defended her\n\nhandiwork as a good-faith interpretation of the Presentment Order,\n\nthe district court's praxis, and the governing law.           She admitted,\n\nhowever, that she had done no independent investigation into the\n\nfacts (i.e., that she had not contacted the other judges in the\n\ndistrict to    ascertain   whether   they   had   consented    to   the   new\n\nsystem).3    The chief judge took no action at that moment.\n\n\n      3\n       The district court's local rules permit reassignment of cases\nin   certain circumstances, e.g., if both the transferor and\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           Four days later, the chief judge denied the pending\n\nmotion.   United States v. Figueroa-Arenas, 150 F. Supp. 2d 333,\n\n335-36 (D.P.R. 2001).    He simultaneously denounced the allegations\n\ncontained in the motion as unfounded, declared that the appellant\n\nhad failed to conduct a suitable investigation before making those\n\nallegations, and worried aloud that the allegations would lead \"to\n\nthe diminution of public confidence in the Court as an impartial\n\narbiter of the law, especially when such false allegations find\n\ntheir way into the media.\"         Id. at 338.       Concluding that the\n\nappellant's actions constituted \"misconduct\" because she had made\n\nstatements impugning the integrity of a judge in reckless disregard\n\nof the truth, the chief judge exercised the court's inherent power\n\nand ordered her to pay a $500 fine.      Id.\n\n           On July 6, 2001, Figueroa-Arenas was convicted on the\n\nunderlying charge.      This timely appeal of the sanctions order\n\nensued.   In it, the appellant argues that she did not have adequate\n\nnotice of the specific charges leveled against her; that the in-\n\nchambers colloquy at the status conference did not constitute a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard on the matter; and that, in all\n\nevents, she did not commit any sanctionable misconduct.\n\n           We review the imposition of sanctions for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.     McClane,   Graf,   Raulerson     &   Middleton,   P.A.   v.\n\n\n\ntransferee judge assent to the reassignment.         See D.P.R. R. 302.2,\n302.7-302.9.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fRechberger, 280 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir. 2002); Jones v. Winnepesaukee\n\nRealty, 990 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).          It is common ground that if\n\na   trial   judge   is   to   manage    a    crowded   calendar    fairly   and\n\nefficiently, members of the bar must comport themselves in a\n\nprofessional manner.      When a lawyer goes too far — that is, when a\n\nlawyer's conduct is vexatious, oppressive, or undertaken in bad\n\nfaith — the judge must be accorded considerable latitude in dealing\n\nwith such excesses.      Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin, 60 F.3d 8, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1995). Despite this imperative, however, a judge's power\n\nto sanction an attorney is not unbridled — and that power cannot be\n\nused to chill vigorous but legitimate advocacy.                   See Kale v.\n\nCombined Ins. Co., 861 F.2d 746, 760 (1st Cir. 1988); In re\n\nBithoney, 486 F.2d 319, 322 (1st Cir. 1973).            In short, sanctions\n\nare an integral part of the judicial armamentarium, but a judge\n\nshould resort to them only when reasonably necessary — and then\n\nwith due circumspection. See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32,\n\n44 (1991).     We think it follows that, in an appeal from the\n\nimposition of sanctions, substantial respect is owed to the trial\n\ncourt's first-hand appraisal, but that respect \"is not to be\n\nconfused with automatic acquiescence.\"           United States v. One 1987\n\nBMW 325, 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            In the ordinary case, the due process issues raised by\n\nthe appellant (which implicate notice and the opportunity to be\n\nheard) might form a logical starting point for our analysis. Here,\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fhowever, we find the issue of whether the appellant committed any\n\nsanctionable misconduct to be dispositive.              Accordingly, we begin\n\n— and end — with that issue.\n\n            Our decision in United States v. Cooper (In re Zalkind),\n\n872 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1989), helps to set the stage.                    There, an\n\nattorney, reacting to comments made by the trial judge, filed a\n\nrecusal motion.        Id.    at   2.     The   judge   took    umbrage   at    the\n\nallegations       contained   in    the    motion   papers      and    eventually\n\nsanctioned the attorney for knowingly making false accusations.\n\nId.   On appeal, we noted that a lawyer has a right to file a\n\nrecusal motion, even though it offends the judge or puts him in an\n\nunflattering light, \"when facts arise which suggest the judge has\n\nexhibited bias or prejudice.\"           Id. at 4.   Finding that the record\n\ncontained    an    adequate    factual     predicate,     and    did   not     show\n\nmisrepresentation or bad faith on counsel's part, we vacated the\n\nsanctions order.      Id. at 4-5.\n\n            Even though the case at hand does not involve a recusal\n\nmotion, the principles that informed our decision in Cooper are\n\nfully applicable here.        The pivotal question is whether the record\n\nfurnishes adequate support for the chief judge's determination that\n\nthe appellant acted recklessly or in bad faith when she filed the\n\nmotion to dismiss or reassign.            We think it does not.\n\n            On its face, the Presentment Order did not reflect that\n\nthe chief judge was acting with the approval of either the circuit\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fcouncil    or   the   affected     judges.    These    omissions     raised   a\n\nreasonable doubt about the chief judge's authority, acting alone,\n\nto exempt a particular class of cases from the random lottery and\n\nto reassign those cases in some other sequence.              The appellant\n\nseized upon this doubt and wove a colorable argument from it.              She\n\npointed out, correctly, that under the district court's local rules\n\nand its standard praxis, assignment of cases ordinarily is by lot;\n\nand cases, once assigned, usually require the consent of both the\n\ntransferor      and   transferee    judges   as   a   precondition    to   any\n\nadministrative reassignment.           The appellant also noted, again\n\ncorrectly, that the enabling statute, 28 U.S.C. § 137, requires the\n\nchief judge to enforce the local rules as written (at least in the\n\nabsence of leave from the circuit council to chart a different\n\ncourse).     Given this factual and legal predicate, the appellant's\n\ncharacterization of the reassignment of her clients' cases as\n\nirregular was within the bounds of legitimate advocacy. So too her\n\nrelated argument that reassignment pursuant to the Presentment\n\nOrder and the consolidation order was ultra vires.\n\n            This conclusion is reinforced by the inclusion, in the\n\nmotion papers, of citations to a plenitude of decided cases. E.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Pearson, 203 F.3d 1243, 1255-67 (10th Cir. 2000);\n\nCruz v. Abbate, 812 F.2d 571, 573 (9th Cir. 1987); Utah-Idaho Sugar\n\nCo. v. Ritter, 461 F.2d 1100, 1103-04 (10th Cir. 1972).                 These\n\ndecisions gave the appellant's position a patina of plausibility.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fIn Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, for example, the chief judge of the\n\ndistrict court took for himself some cases that previously had been\n\nassigned to a judge assuming senior status.       461 F.2d at 1102.   An\n\naffected party petitioned for mandamus, and the Tenth Circuit\n\ngranted the writ.      The court wrote:\n\n          [U]nder the terms of 28 U.S.C. § 137, it is\n          unquestioned that the division of the court's\n          business in a multi-judge district is the\n          responsibility of the judges and not the\n          responsibility of the chief judge acting\n          unilaterally. The latter's duty is to insure\n          that the agreed upon rules are enforced and\n          are administered so as to carry out their\n          purposes, but it is not his duty to promulgate\n          rules without the approval of his fellow\n          judges . . . .\n\nId. at 1103 (footnote omitted).       The Tenth Circuit concluded that\n\nthe chief judge could not unilaterally deviate from the district\n\ncourt's local rules \"until such time as it clearly appears that he\n\nis   acting    with    the   full   concurrence   of   the   [appropriate\n\nauthority].\"    Id.4\n\n          A lawyer should be allowed to argue that a case was\n\nwrongly assigned or transferred when circumstances give rise to a\n\nplausible assertion to that effect.         Given the facts of record\n\nhere, the absence of any factual misrepresentations, and the\n\ncolorable legal argument advanced, we conclude that the appellant\n\n\n     4\n      In 1972, when the Tenth Circuit decided Utah-Idaho Sugar\nCompany, the judges of the district court, acting collectively, had\nthe power to modify, rescind, or grant exceptions from the local\nrules. 461 F.2d at 1013. That power is now vested in the circuit\ncouncil. See 28 U.S.C. § 332(d)(4).\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdid not act in objective bad faith in filing the motion.                       See\n\nCooper, 872 F.2d at 4 (suggesting that an attorney has a duty to\n\nfile a motion that may help his client as long as the factual\n\nproffer supporting the motion is tendered \"in good faith and\n\n[contains] no factual misrepresentations\"); In re Bithoney, 486\n\nF.2d at 322 (recognizing the need to allow \"breathing room for the\n\nfullest possible exercise of the advocacy function\"). Although the\n\ncourt below was free to point out the flaws in the appellant's\n\nreasoning,    distinguish        the   cases   on   which    she    relied,    and\n\nultimately deny the requested remedy, the motion nonetheless was an\n\nappropriate    vehicle     for    advancing    facially     legitimate      issues\n\nsuggested by the record.\n\n             To the extent that the sanctions order can be read to\n\naccuse the appellant of acting in subjective bad faith, that\n\naccusation too lacks record support. Nothing in the wording of the\n\nmotion or     in   the   appellant's     responses   to     the    chief   judge's\n\nquestions indicates either that an improper motive inspired the\n\nfiling or that she believed that what she had asserted was false.\n\nTo cinch matters, the appellant came to this case with clean hands\n\n— insofar as we can tell from the record, she had no prior history\n\nof contumacious conduct — and the motion itself was couched in\n\nrespectful (albeit fervent) language.           While words such as \"usurp\"\n\nand \"unlawful\" might impugn a jurist's character in some contexts,\n\nthe appellant appears to have used them only to argue that the\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fcourt had overstepped the limits of its authority.   In that sense,\n\nthe motion was little more than a challenge to the chief judge's\n\nexercise of jurisdiction, and, as such, was appropriate.\n\n          The government has one last string to its bow.        It\n\nattempts to justify sanctions based on the chief judge's finding\n\nthat the appellant failed to conduct a proper investigation into\n\nthe provenance of the Presentment Order.   Assuming, for argument's\n\nsake, that the appellant had a duty to investigate the allegations\n\nset forth in the motion, cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) (imposing such\n\nan obligation in the civil context),5 we deem her investigation\n\nreasonable under the circumstances.   She verified the contents of\n\nthe Presentment Order, determined that it remained unrevoked,\n\nfactored in the effect of the supplementary order issued by the\n\nsenior active judge in the chief judge's absence, and considered\n\nthe chief judge's explanatory order of June 5, 2001.    To require\n\nmore would be to place an undue burden on defense counsel in a\n\ncriminal case.   See In re Order to Show Cause, 741 F. Supp. 1379,\n\n1383 (N.D.

These excesses, and the federal courts' necessary involvement in bringing lawbreakers to account, have spawned considerable public controversy. This appeal stems from an incident related to that controversy. In it, the appellant, attorney Adalina De Jes&#250;s-Morales, asks us to annul sanctions imposed against her by the district court in the course of a Vieques protest case. As the recent history of appeals indicates, the district court has done an admirable job in handling a sudden influx of several hundred protesters' cases under the microscope of pervasive media attention; but in this unusual instance, taking direct account of the need to assure robust advocacy in criminal matters, we find no legally sufficient basis for the imposition of sanctions (and, therefore, vacate the challenged order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are not disputed. The Navy has used Vieques for live-fire exercises for upward of sixty years. Its activities have become increasingly unpopular over that span (at least among some groups) and protests have erupted from time to time. <i>E.g., United States v. Parrilla Bonilla,</i> 648 F.2d 1373, 1374 (1st Cir.1981). A fatal accident (involving an employee of the Navy) occurred in 1999. This accident drove the dissonance to a new pitch. As a result, the federal district court has been deluged with criminal trespass cases brought against protesters who were arrested after they entered either the naval base situated on the island of Vieques or the areas associated therewith. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ventura-Mel&#233;ndez,</i> 275 F.3d 9, 16-18 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d 21, 23-24 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Sharpton,</i> 252 F.3d 536, 538-39 (1st Cir.2001) (per curiam). This massive infusion of cases has thronged the already congested docket of a busy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the initial batch of arrests &#8212; 465 in all &#8212; the chief judge of the district court acted quickly to marshal available judicial resources. Although the court's standard praxis called for the random assignment of criminal cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the chief judge entered an order dated June 28, 2000 (the Presentment Order), which directed that all Vieques cases be brought to the chief judge upon filing for assignment by him to available district and magistrate judges in a rotating sequence (the mechanics of which were not specified). The Presentment Order bore only the chief judge's signature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 2001, another wave of protests occurred and an additional 181 criminal trespass cases were filed. The chief judge granted the government's ex parte motion to consolidate and the cases were segregated into clusters (by arresting officer). The consolidations left some of the judges with multiple groups of defendants and others with few or none. To alleviate this unequal distribution, the senior active judge, temporarily at the court's helm in the chief judge's absence, ordered groups of cases reassigned to equalize the judges' workloads.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these arrangements proved more efficient in certain respects, they created a number of anomalies. Some defendants found themselves lumped with other defendants who had been arrested at different times and/or places. When certain defendants complained that they had not received prior notice of the government's motion to consolidate, and that, at any rate, the consolidation order violated the joinder provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(b), the chief judge rejected their importunings. He did, however, issue an order explaining in some detail the rationale for the Presentment Order, the consolidation order, and the ensuing reassignment of groups of cases. <i>See United States v. Ayala Ayala,</i> No. 01-211 (D.P.R. June 5, 2001) (unpublished order). He also explained that the terms of the Presentment Order were no longer in vogue, but, rather, that Vieques cases were being assigned randomly by the clerk's office, and then reassigned by him only when necessary to ensure efficient handling. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant represented a codefendant (Zoraida Figueroa-Arenas) charged in the very case that yielded the June 5 order. She also represented a second defendant (Juan Nu&#241;ez-Reynes) who had been charged in another case arising out of the most recent spate of protests. Both groups of cases had been shifted to the chief judge's calendar by virtue of the consolidation order. On June 14, 2001, the appellant (acting on behalf of both clients) moved to dismiss the pending charges or, in the alternative, for reassignment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Noting that the statute authorizing district courts to promulgate local rules, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 137, requires that the chief judge respect these rules and assign the cases as provided therein, the motion papers asserted that an assignment system cannot deviate from that established by the court's local rules without the consent of the judicial council for the circuit in which the district sits. Because the Presentment Order did not explain the source of the chief judge's ostensible authority to contravene this statute, the motion argued that the ad hoc assignment system for Vieques cases was fatally flawed. The motion elaborated on this thesis, stating in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Local Rules of this Court regarding the assignment of cases, Rule 302.4 and Rule 302.8, civil and criminal case[s] must be assigned by lot. The chief judge in this case has usurped the authority of his fellow judges and taken control of the assignment system for criminal cases....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">.... The recent order of June 5, 2001 suggests that, contrary to [the Presentment Order], Vieques trespass cases are being assigned randomly by the clerk's office and then referred to the Chief Judge for reassignment. Either way, the interference with the normal practice of the Court regarding case[ ] assignments [is] unlawful and must be voided as the Chief Judge does not have the authority to alter this practice within the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the appellant appeared before the chief judge for a scheduling conference in the Figueroa-Arenas matter. The conference was held in chambers, with a court reporter present. The chief judge expressed concern about the statements contained in the motion, characterizing those statements as an unfair attack on the court. Despite the appellant's disclaimer of any defamatory intent, the chief judge placed her under oath to inquire into the factual foundation for the statements. The appellant defended her handiwork as a good-faith interpretation of the Presentment Order, the district court's praxis, and the governing law. She admitted, however, that she had done no independent investigation into the facts (i.e., that she had not contacted the other judges in the district to ascertain whether they had consented to the new system).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The chief judge took no action at that moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four days later, the chief judge denied the pending motion. <i>United States v. Figueroa-Arenas,</i> 150 F.Supp.2d 333, 335-36 (D.P.R.2001). He simultaneously denounced the allegations contained in the motion as unfounded, declared that the appellant had failed to conduct a suitable investigation before making those allegations, and worried aloud that the allegations would lead \"to the diminution of public confidence in the Court as an impartial arbiter of the law, especially when such false allegations find their way into the media.\" <i>Id.</i> at 338. Concluding that the appellant's actions constituted \"misconduct\" because she had made statements impugning the integrity of a judge in reckless disregard of the truth, the chief judge exercised the court's inherent power and ordered her to pay a $500 fine. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 2001, Figueroa-Arenas was convicted on the underlying charge. This timely appeal of the sanctions order ensued. In it, the appellant argues that she did not have adequate notice of the specific charges leveled against her; that the in-chambers colloquy at the status conference did not constitute a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the matter; and that, in all events, she did not commit any sanctionable misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion. <i>McLane, Graf, Raulerson &amp; Middleton, P.A. v. Rechberger,</i> 280 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,</i> 990 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993). It is common ground that if a trial judge is to manage a crowded calendar fairly and efficiently, members of the bar must comport themselves in a professional manner. When a lawyer goes too far &#8212; that is, when a lawyer's conduct is vexatious, oppressive, or undertaken in bad faith &#8212; the judge must be accorded considerable latitude in dealing with such excesses. <i>Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin,</i> 60 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.1995). Despite this imperative, however, a judge's power to sanction an attorney is not unbridled &#8212; and that power cannot be used to chill vigorous but legitimate advocacy. <i>See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co.,</i> 861 F.2d 746, 760 (1st Cir.1988); <i>In re Bithoney,</i> 486 F.2d 319, 322 (1st Cir.1973). In short, sanctions are an integral part of the judicial armamentarium, but a judge should resort to them only when reasonably necessary &#8212; and then with due circumspection. <i>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 32, 44, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). We think it follows that, in an appeal from the imposition of sanctions, substantial respect is owed to the trial court's first-hand appraisal, but that respect \"is not to be confused with automatic acquiescence.\" <i>United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinary case, the due process issues raised by the appellant (which implicate notice and the opportunity to be heard) might form a logical starting point for our analysis. Here, however, we find the issue of whether the appellant committed any sanctionable misconduct to be dispositive. Accordingly, we begin &#8212; and end &#8212; with that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in <i>United States v. Cooper (In re Zalkind),</i> 872 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1989), helps to set the stage. There, an attorney, reacting to comments made by the trial judge, filed a recusal motion. <i>Id.</i> at 2. The judge took umbrage at the allegations contained in the motion papers and eventually sanctioned the attorney for knowingly making false accusations. <i>Id.</i> On appeal, we noted that a lawyer has a right to file a recusal motion, even though it offends the judge or puts him in an unflattering light, \"when facts arise which suggest the judge has exhibited bias or prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 4. Finding that the record contained an adequate factual predicate, and did not show misrepresentation or bad faith on counsel's part, we vacated the sanctions order. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the case at hand does not involve a recusal motion, the principles that informed our decision in <i>Cooper</i> are fully applicable here. The pivotal question is whether the record furnishes adequate support for the chief judge's determination that the appellant acted recklessly or in bad faith when she filed the motion to dismiss or reassign. We think it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its face, the Presentment Order did not reflect that the chief judge was acting with the approval of either the circuit council or the affected judges. These omissions raised a reasonable doubt about the chief judge's authority, acting alone, to exempt a particular class of cases from the random lottery and to reassign those cases in some other sequence. The appellant seized upon this doubt and wove a colorable argument from it. She pointed out, correctly, that under the district court's local rules and its standard praxis, assignment of cases ordinarily is by lot; and cases, once assigned, usually require the consent of both the transferor and transferee judges as a precondition to any administrative reassignment. The appellant also noted, again correctly, that the enabling statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 137, requires the chief judge to enforce the local rules as written (at least in the absence of leave from the circuit council to chart a different course). Given this factual and legal predicate, the appellant's characterization of the reassignment of her clients' cases as irregular was within the bounds of legitimate advocacy. So too her related argument that reassignment pursuant to the Presentment Order and the consolidation order was <i>ultra vires.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by the inclusion, in the motion papers, of citations to a plenitude of decided cases. <i>E.g., United States v. Pearson,</i> 203 F.3d 1243, 1255-67 (10th Cir.2000); <i>Cruz v. Abbate,</i> 812 F.2d 571, 573 (9th Cir.1987); <i>Utah-Idaho Sugar Co. v. Ritter,</i> 461 F.2d 1100, 1103-04 (10th Cir.1972). These decisions gave the appellant's position a patina of plausibility. In <i>Utah-Idaho Sugar Company,</i> for example, the chief judge of the district court took for himself some cases that previously had been assigned to a judge assuming senior status. 461 F.2d at 1102. An affected party petitioned for mandamus, and the Tenth Circuit granted the writ. The court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[U]nder the terms of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 137, it is unquestioned that the division of the court's business in a multi-judge district is the responsibility of the judges and not the responsibility of the chief judge acting unilaterally. The latter's duty is to insure that the agreed upon rules are enforced and are administered so as to carry out their purposes, but it is not his duty to promulgate rules without the approval of his fellow judges....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1103 (footnote omitted). The Tenth Circuit concluded that the chief judge could not unilaterally deviate from the district court's local rules \"until such time as it clearly appears that he is acting with the full concurrence of the [appropriate authority].\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lawyer should be allowed to argue that a case was wrongly assigned or transferred when circumstances give rise to a plausible assertion to that effect. Given the facts of record here, the absence of any factual misrepresentations, and the colorable legal argument advanced, we conclude that the appellant did not act in objective bad faith in filing the motion. <i>See Cooper,</i> 872 F.2d at 4 (suggesting that an attorney has a duty to file a motion that may help his client as long as the factual proffer supporting the motion is tendered \"in good faith and [contains] no factual misrepresentations\"); <i>In re Bithoney,</i> 486 F.2d at 322 (recognizing the need to allow \"breathing room for the fullest possible exercise of the advocacy function\"). Although the court below was free to point out the flaws in the appellant's reasoning, distinguish the cases on which she relied, and ultimately deny the requested remedy, the motion nonetheless was an appropriate vehicle for advancing facially legitimate issues suggested by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the sanctions order can be read to accuse the appellant of acting in <i>subjective</i> bad faith, that accusation too lacks record support. Nothing in the wording of the motion or in the appellant's responses to the chief judge's questions indicates either that an improper motive inspired the filing or that she believed that what she had asserted was false. To cinch matters, the appellant came to this case with clean hands &#8212; insofar as we can tell from the record, she had no prior history of contumacious conduct &#8212; and the motion itself was couched in respectful (albeit fervent) language. While words such as \"usurp\" and \"unlawful\" might impugn a jurist's character in some contexts, the appellant appears to have used them only to argue that the court had overstepped the limits of its authority. In that sense, the motion was little more than a challenge to the chief judge's exercise of jurisdiction, and, as such, was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has one last string to its bow. It attempts to justify sanctions based on the chief judge's finding that the appellant failed to conduct a proper investigation into the provenance of the Presentment Order. Assuming, for argument's sake, that the appellant had a duty to investigate the allegations set forth in the motion, <i>cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b) (imposing such an obligation in the civil context),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we deem her investigation reasonable under the circumstances. She verified the contents of the Presentment Order, determined that it remained unrevoked, factored in the effect of the supplementary order issued by the senior active judge in the chief judge's absence, and considered the chief judge's explanatory order of June 5, 2001. To require more would be to place an undue burden on defense counsel in a criminal case. <i>See In re Order to Show Cause,</i> 741 F.Supp. 1379, 1383 (N.D.Cal.1990) (noting that, when preparing motions in a criminal case, it is not defense counsel's responsibility \"to perform the role of the court or the jury to decide ultimate truth\"). We thus conclude that the appellant's conduct was within the permissible bounds of vigorous advocacy, and, therefore, that sanctions are unsustainable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have one final observation. The motion papers filed by the appellant do not accuse the chief judge of manipulation; they merely make the plausible (if ultimately unavailing) legal argument that he lacked the authority to take the steps that he took. To the contrary, the record is not only devoid of any suggestion that the chief judge used the assignment power for an invidious purpose, but, indeed, reveals that at all relevant times he was endeavoring to position the court to cope with an unanticipated deluge of cases that unexpectedly had strained the institutional resources of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

These excesses, and the federal courts' necessary involvement in bringing lawbreakers to account, have spawned considerable public controversy. This appeal stems from an incident related to that controversy. In it, the appellant, attorney Adalina De Jes&#250;s-Morales, asks us to annul sanctions imposed against her by the district court in the course of a Vieques protest case. As the recent history of appeals indicates, the district court has done an admirable job in handling a sudden influx of several hundred protesters' cases under the microscope of pervasive media attention; but in this unusual instance, taking direct account of the need to assure robust advocacy in criminal matters, we find no legally sufficient basis for the imposition of sanctions (and, therefore, vacate the challenged order).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are not disputed. The Navy has used Vieques for live-fire exercises for upward of sixty years. Its activities have become increasingly unpopular over that span (at least among some groups) and protests have erupted from time to time. <i>E.g., United States v. Parrilla Bonilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390416\"><a href=\"/opinion/390416/united-states-v-antulio-parrilla-bonilla-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1373</span></a></span>, 1374 (1st Cir.1981). A fatal accident (involving an employee of the Navy) occurred in 1999. This accident drove the dissonance to a new pitch. As a result, the federal district court has been deluged with criminal trespass cases brought against protesters who were arrested after they entered either the naval base situated on the island of Vieques or the areas associated therewith. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Ventura-Mel&#233;ndez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775956\"><a href=\"/opinion/775956/united-states-v-mar-a-del-carmen-ventura-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 16-18 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Maxwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199478\"><a href=\"/opinion/199478/united-states-v-maxwell-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23-24 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Sharpton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199452\"><a href=\"/opinion/199452/united-states-v-sharpton/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 538-39 (1st Cir.2001) (per curiam). This massive infusion of cases has thronged the already congested docket of a busy court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the initial batch of arrests &#8212; 465 in all &#8212; the chief judge of the district court acted quickly to marshal available judicial resources. Although the court's standard praxis called for the random assignment of criminal cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the chief judge entered an order dated June 28, 2000 (the Presentment Order), which directed that all Vieques cases be brought to the chief judge upon filing for assignment by him to available district and magistrate judges in a rotating sequence (the mechanics of which were not specified). The Presentment Order bore only the chief judge's signature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 2001, another wave of protests occurred and an additional 181 criminal trespass cases were filed. The chief judge granted the government's ex parte motion to consolidate and the cases were segregated into clusters (by arresting officer). The consolidations left some of the judges with multiple groups of defendants and others with few or none. To alleviate this unequal distribution, the senior active judge, temporarily at the court's helm in the chief judge's absence, ordered groups of cases reassigned to equalize the judges' workloads.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these arrangements proved more efficient in certain respects, they created a number of anomalies. Some defendants found themselves lumped with other defendants who had been arrested at different times and/or places. When certain defendants complained that they had not received prior notice of the government's motion to consolidate, and that, at any rate, the consolidation order violated the joinder provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(b), the chief judge rejected their importunings. He did, however, issue an order explaining in some detail the rationale for the Presentment Order, the consolidation order, and the ensuing reassignment of groups of cases. <i>See United States v. Ayala Ayala,</i> No. 01-211 (D.P.R. June 5, 2001) (unpublished order). He also explained that the terms of the Presentment Order were no longer in vogue, but, rather, that Vieques cases were being assigned randomly by the clerk's office, and then reassigned by him only when necessary to ensure efficient handling. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant represented a codefendant (Zoraida Figueroa-Arenas) charged in the very case that yielded the June 5 order. She also represented a second defendant (Juan Nu&#241;ez-Reynes) who had been charged in another case arising out of the most recent spate of protests. Both groups of cases had been shifted to the chief judge's calendar by virtue of the consolidation order. On June 14, 2001, the appellant (acting on behalf of both clients) moved to dismiss the pending charges or, in the alternative, for reassignment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Noting that the statute authorizing district courts to promulgate local rules, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 137, requires that the chief judge respect these rules and assign the cases as provided therein, the motion papers asserted that an assignment system cannot deviate from that established by the court's local rules without the consent of the judicial council for the circuit in which the district sits. Because the Presentment Order did not explain the source of the chief judge's ostensible authority to contravene this statute, the motion argued that the ad hoc assignment system for Vieques cases was fatally flawed. The motion elaborated on this thesis, stating in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Local Rules of this Court regarding the assignment of cases, Rule 302.4 and Rule 302.8, civil and criminal case[s] must be assigned by lot. The chief judge in this case has usurped the authority of his fellow judges and taken control of the assignment system for criminal cases....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">.... The recent order of June 5, 2001 suggests that, contrary to [the Presentment Order], Vieques trespass cases are being assigned randomly by the clerk's office and then referred to the Chief Judge for reassignment. Either way, the interference with the normal practice of the Court regarding case[ ] assignments [is] unlawful and must be voided as the Chief Judge does not have the authority to alter this practice within the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the appellant appeared before the chief judge for a scheduling conference in the Figueroa-Arenas matter. The conference was held in chambers, with a court reporter present. The chief judge expressed concern about the statements contained in the motion, characterizing those statements as an unfair attack on the court. Despite the appellant's disclaimer of any defamatory intent, the chief judge placed her under oath to inquire into the factual foundation for the statements. The appellant defended her handiwork as a good-faith interpretation of the Presentment Order, the district court's praxis, and the governing law. She admitted, however, that she had done no independent investigation into the facts (i.e., that she had not contacted the other judges in the district to ascertain whether they had consented to the new system).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The chief judge took no action at that moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four days later, the chief judge denied the pending motion. <i>United States v. Figueroa-Arenas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2468360\"><a href=\"/opinion/2468360/united-states-v-figueroa-arenas/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 335-36 (D.P.R.2001). He simultaneously denounced the allegations contained in the motion as unfounded, declared that the appellant had failed to conduct a suitable investigation before making those allegations, and worried aloud that the allegations would lead \"to the diminution of public confidence in the Court as an impartial arbiter of the law, especially when such false allegations find their way into the media.\" <i>Id.</i> at 338. Concluding that the appellant's actions constituted \"misconduct\" because she had made statements impugning the integrity of a judge in reckless disregard of the truth, the chief judge exercised the court's inherent power and ordered her to pay a $500 fine. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 2001, Figueroa-Arenas was convicted on the underlying charge. This timely appeal of the sanctions order ensued. In it, the appellant argues that she did not have adequate notice of the specific charges leveled against her; that the in-chambers colloquy at the status conference did not constitute a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the matter; and that, in all events, she did not commit any sanctionable misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion. <i>McLane, Graf, Raulerson &amp; Middleton, P.A. v. Rechberger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199831\"><a href=\"/opinion/199831/mclane-graf-v-rechberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603794\"><a href=\"/opinion/603794/catherine-m-jones-v-winnepesaukee-realty/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1993). It is common ground that if a trial judge is to manage a crowded calendar fairly and efficiently, members of the bar must comport themselves in a professional manner. When a lawyer goes too far &#8212; that is, when a lawyer's conduct is vexatious, oppressive, or undertaken in bad faith &#8212; the judge must be accorded considerable latitude in dealing with such excesses. <i>Whitney Bros. Co. v. Sprafkin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196192\"><a href=\"/opinion/196192/whitney-bros-co-v-sprafkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1995). Despite this imperative, however, a judge's power to sanction an attorney is not unbridled &#8212; and that power cannot be used to chill vigorous but legitimate advocacy. <i>See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514584\"><a href=\"/opinion/514584/carl-kale-v-combined-insurance-company-of-america-carl-kale-v-combined/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>, 760 (1st Cir.1988); <i>In re Bithoney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"314127\"><a href=\"/opinion/314127/in-the-matter-of-samuel-a-bithoney/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 322 (1st Cir.1973). In short, sanctions are an integral part of the judicial armamentarium, but a judge should resort to them only when reasonably necessary &#8212; and then with due circumspection. <i>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span> (1991). We think it follows that, in an appeal from the imposition of sanctions, substantial respect is owed to the trial court's first-hand appraisal, but that respect \"is not to be confused with automatic acquiescence.\" <i>United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600264\"><a href=\"/opinion/600264/no-92-1827/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 657 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinary case, the due process issues raised by the appellant (which implicate notice and the opportunity to be heard) might form a logical starting point for our analysis. Here, however, we find the issue of whether the appellant committed any sanctionable misconduct to be dispositive. Accordingly, we begin &#8212; and end &#8212; with that issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in <i>United States v. Cooper (In re Zalkind),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521036\"><a href=\"/opinion/521036/united-states-v-jonathan-cooper-in-re-norman-zalkind/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989), helps to set the stage. There, an attorney, reacting to comments made by the trial judge, filed a recusal motion. <i>Id.</i> at 2. The judge took umbrage at the allegations contained in the motion papers and eventually sanctioned the attorney for knowingly making false accusations. <i>Id.</i> On appeal, we noted that a lawyer has a right to file a recusal motion, even though it offends the judge or puts him in an unflattering light, \"when facts arise which suggest the judge has exhibited bias or prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 4. Finding that the record contained an adequate factual predicate, and did not show misrepresentation or bad faith on counsel's part, we vacated the sanctions order. <i>Id.</i> at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the case at hand does not involve a recusal motion, the principles that informed our decision in <i>Cooper</i> are fully applicable here. The pivotal question is whether the record furnishes adequate support for the chief judge's determination that the appellant acted recklessly or in bad faith when she filed the motion to dismiss or reassign. We think it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its face, the Presentment Order did not reflect that the chief judge was acting with the approval of either the circuit council or the affected judges. These omissions raised a reasonable doubt about the chief judge's authority, acting alone, to exempt a particular class of cases from the random lottery and to reassign those cases in some other sequence. The appellant seized upon this doubt and wove a colorable argument from it. She pointed out, correctly, that under the district court's local rules and its standard praxis, assignment of cases ordinarily is by lot; and cases, once assigned, usually require the consent of both the transferor and transferee judges as a precondition to any administrative reassignment. The appellant also noted, again correctly, that the enabling statute, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 137, requires the chief judge to enforce the local rules as written (at least in the absence of leave from the circuit council to chart a different course). Given this factual and legal predicate, the appellant's characterization of the reassignment of her clients' cases as irregular was within the bounds of legitimate advocacy. So too her related argument that reassignment pursuant to the Presentment Order and the consolidation order was <i>ultra vires.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is reinforced by the inclusion, in the motion papers, of citations to a plenitude of decided cases. <i>E.g., United States v. Pearson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159242\"><a href=\"/opinion/159242/united-states-v-pearson-eric/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>, 1255-67 (10th Cir.2000); <i>Cruz v. Abbate,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483635\"><a href=\"/opinion/483635/peter-c-cruz-v-the-honorable-paul-j-abbate-and-the-people-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 573 (9th Cir.1987); <i>Utah-Idaho Sugar Co. v. Ritter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"304001\"><a href=\"/opinion/304001/utah-idaho-sugar-company-a-utah-corporation-v-the-honorable-willis-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></a></span>, 1103-04 (10th Cir.1972). These decisions gave the appellant's position a patina of plausibility. In <i>Utah-Idaho Sugar Company,</i> for example, the chief judge of the district court took for himself some cases that previously had been assigned to a judge assuming senior status. 461 F.2d at 1102. An affected party petitioned for mandamus, and the Tenth Circuit granted the writ. The court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[U]nder the terms of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 137, it is unquestioned that the division of the court's business in a multi-judge district is the responsibility of the judges and not the responsibility of the chief judge acting unilaterally. The latter's duty is to insure that the agreed upon rules are enforced and are administered so as to carry out their purposes, but it is not his duty to promulgate rules without the approval of his fellow judges....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1103 (footnote omitted). The Tenth Circuit concluded that the chief judge could not unilaterally deviate from the district court's local rules \"until such time as it clearly appears that he is acting with the full concurrence of the [appropriate authority].\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lawyer should be allowed to argue that a case was wrongly assigned or transferred when circumstances give rise to a plausible assertion to that effect. Given the facts of record here, the absence of any factual misrepresentations, and the colorable legal argument advanced, we conclude that the appellant did not act in objective bad faith in filing the motion. <i>See Cooper,</i> 872 F.2d at 4 (suggesting that an attorney has a duty to file a motion that may help his client as long as the factual proffer supporting the motion is tendered \"in good faith and [contains] no factual misrepresentations\"); <i>In re Bithoney,</i> 486 F.2d at 322 (recognizing the need to allow \"breathing room for the fullest possible exercise of the advocacy function\"). Although the court below was free to point out the flaws in the appellant's reasoning, distinguish the cases on which she relied, and ultimately deny the requested remedy, the motion nonetheless was an appropriate vehicle for advancing facially legitimate issues suggested by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the sanctions order can be read to accuse the appellant of acting in <i>subjective</i> bad faith, that accusation too lacks record support. Nothing in the wording of the motion or in the appellant's responses to the chief judge's questions indicates either that an improper motive inspired the filing or that she believed that what she had asserted was false. To cinch matters, the appellant came to this case with clean hands &#8212; insofar as we can tell from the record, she had no prior history of contumacious conduct &#8212; and the motion itself was couched in respectful (albeit fervent) language. While words such as \"usurp\" and \"unlawful\" might impugn a jurist's character in some contexts, the appellant appears to have used them only to argue that the court had overstepped the limits of its authority. In that sense, the motion was little more than a challenge to the chief judge's exercise of jurisdiction, and, as such, was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has one last string to its bow. It attempts to justify sanctions based on the chief judge's finding that the appellant failed to conduct a proper investigation into the provenance of the Presentment Order. Assuming, for argument's sake, that the appellant had a duty to investigate the allegations set forth in the motion, <i>cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b) (imposing such an obligation in the civil context),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> we deem her investigation reasonable under the circumstances. She verified the contents of the Presentment Order, determined that it remained unrevoked, factored in the effect of the supplementary order issued by the senior active judge in the chief judge's absence, and considered the chief judge's explanatory order of June 5, 2001. To require more would be to place an undue burden on defense counsel in a criminal case. <i>See In re Order to Show Cause,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1379</span></span>, 1383 (N.D.Cal.1990) (noting that, when preparing motions in a criminal case, it is not defense counsel's responsibility \"to perform the role of the court or the jury to decide ultimate truth\"). We thus conclude that the appellant's conduct was within the permissible bounds of vigorous advocacy, and, therefore, that sanctions are unsustainable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have one final observation. The motion papers filed by the appellant do not accuse the chief judge of manipulation; they merely make the plausible (if ultimately unavailing) legal argument that he lacked the authority to take the steps that he took. To the contrary, the record is not only devoid of any suggestion that the chief judge used the assignment power for an invidious purpose, but, indeed, reveals that at all relevant times he was endeavoring to position the court to cope with an unanticipated deluge of cases that unexpectedly had strained the institutional resources of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.
