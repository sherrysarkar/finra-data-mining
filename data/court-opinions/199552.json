Appellant Brian Kvorjak\n\nclaims that his former employer, the Maine Department of Labor,\n\nwrongfully failed to accommodate his disability when it refused\n\nto allow him to work at home after his office closed and his\n\nposition was relocated to a distant facility.              The district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment for the defendants on his federal\n\nand   state   claims,1   concluding   that   he   had   failed   to   offer\n\n\n\n      1 Appellant brought suit under the Americans with\nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the Maine Human\nRights Act (\"MHRA\"), 5 M.R.S.A. §§ 4551-4633. The Supreme Court\nruled earlier this year that the Eleventh Amendment immunizes\nstates from claims for money damages under Title I of the ADA.\nSee Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 121 S. Ct. 955,\n967-68 (2001); Acevedo Lopez v. Police Dep't of Com. of P.R.,\n247 F.3d 26, 28 (lst Cir. 2001). This case remains viable under\nboth the MHRA and the Rehabilitation Act, however, and the\nstandards applicable to each of the three statutes have been\nviewed as essentially the same.     See Oliveras-Sifre v. P.R.\nDep't of Health, 214 F.3d 23, 25 n.2 (lst Cir. 2000); Feliciano\nv. State of Rhode Island, 160 F.3d 780, 788-89 (lst Cir. 1998);\nSoileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 928 F. Supp. 37, 45 (D. Me.\n1996), aff'd, 105 F.3d 12, 14 (lst Cir. 1997).    Thus, while we\nexplicitly refer to the ADA because it has been the primary\nfocus in the litigation to this point, and because of the\napplicability of its accompanying body of recent case law, our\ndiscussion here in fact applies solely to the Rehabilitation Act\nand MHRA claims.\n     Similarly for the sake of simplicity, we generally refer to\ndefendants collectively as \"the State,\" although in addition to\nthe State itself, appellant sued the Maine Department of Labor,\nand the department's commissioner, Valerie Landry.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fevidence sufficient to demonstrate that he could accomplish\n\n\"essential\" aspects          of   his     job   at   home.   See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n12111(8).          After a close review of the record and caselaw, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n                            I. Factual Background2\n\n       Appellant is partially paralyzed as a result of spina\n\nbifida, a condition he has had since birth.                     The condition\n\nlimits his ability to walk, causes problems with his bowels and\n\nbladder, and at times triggers pain when he sits, stands or lies\n\ndown. Despite these difficulties, appellant successfully worked\n\nfor various state agencies in Maine for twenty-two years, the\n\nlast       seven    and   one-half   as    a    claims   adjudicator   for   the\n\nDepartment of Labor's Division of Unemployment Field Services\n\n(the \"Division\").          In that most recent position, he was assigned\n\nto an office in Rockland, Maine, a ten-minute commute from his\n\nhome.\n\n       In the mid-1990s, the Division decided to cut expenses by\n\nclosing fifteen field offices, including the Rockland office,\n\nand shifting services to three call centers in other parts of\n\n\n       2\n      Portions of this background are drawn almost verbatim from\nthe well stated \"Facts\" section of the magistrate judge's\nopinion.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fthe state.     To assist with the transfer, the Division sent out\n\ntwo surveys asking employees if they would consider relocating\n\nto a call center.    In both surveys, appellant indicated that he\n\nwould be able to work in a call center and listed Bangor as his\n\nprimary choice.\n\n    Before the transfer in 1997, however, appellant drove the\n\nninety-minute commute from his home to Bangor on two consecutive\n\ndays.    The    lengthy   drive   resulted   in   substantial   pain.\n\nRealizing that he could not commute three hours every day, he\n\napplied for a disability pension and asked that he be permitted\n\nto use his accumulated sick time until his pension request was\n\nprocessed.     The State denied his request to use sick time, and\n\nappellant contacted the Disability Rights Center (the \"Center\").\n\n    After consultation with the Center, appellant in May 1997\n\nrequested the accommodation of working at home on a full-time,\n\npermanent basis.3 He supplemented his request with a letter from\n\nhis physician stating that the commute to Bangor every day would\n\nhave a detrimental impact on his health.     The doctor also stated\n\nthat \"any effort that can be made to allow him to work locally\n\nwould be highly appropriate and medically indicated.\"\n\n\n    3 Appellant initially wrote to the Department of Labor that,\nin addition to working at home, he was \"willing to consider any\nreasonable accommodations which will result in my continued\nemployment,\" but the record reflects that he later rejected any\noption other than at-home work. See infra note 9.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f       The Division rejected appellant's request, stating that the\n\nDepartment of Labor had checked with the New England Business\n\nand    Technical   Assistance    Center      and   the   Equal    Employment\n\nOpportunity Commission and had \"concluded that commuting to the\n\njob is not a covered activity under [the] ADA.\"             It noted that\n\nit had received other requests from Division employees to work\n\nat home because of the office consolidation, and had denied all\n\nof them.     The State, however, did offer to pay relocation costs\n\nif appellant moved closer to a call center, a benefit provided\n\nto    all   re-assigned   employees,   and    also   offered     to   pay   for\n\ntemporary housing.4       Appellant declined to move, and he was laid\n\noff on June 18, 1997.      That same day, Kathleen Dunford, director\n\nof the Office of Human Resources for the Department, offered in\n\na telephone conversation to assist him in finding another local\n\njob.\n\n       In October 1997, the State notified appellant of a job\n\nopening in Bangor for a claims adjudicator — the same position\n\nhe had left four months earlier.         Appellant expressed interest,\n\nbut again requested the accommodation of working at home.                   The\n\n\n       4\n       The State also was prepared to help arrange for support\nservices during appellant's relocation, although it is not clear\nthat this offer was communicated to him. In his deposition, he\nsaid he was unaware of an offer for relocation assistance beyond\nthat received by other employees.      The offer for temporary\nhousing, however, was explicitly noted in a memorandum to an\ninvestigator for the Maine Human Rights Commission (\"MHRC\").\n\n                                   -5-\n\frequest     again    was     denied.           Appellant       subsequently              filed\n\ncomplaints with the MHRC challenging both the original layoff\n\nand the later failure to re-hire him.                      The State continued to\n\nmaintain that it had no obligation to ameliorate appellant's\n\ncommuting difficulties; in its view, he was no different from\n\nnon-disabled employees who sought the same accommodation of\n\nworking at home because of the inconvenience of relocating.                                See\n\n5 M.R.S.A. § 4573-A (\"This subchapter does not prohibit an\n\nemployer from discharging . . . an individual with physical or\n\nmental disability . . . if the individual, because of the\n\nphysical or mental disability, is unable to . . . be at, remain\n\nat or go to or from the place where the duties of employment are\n\nto be performed.\").             The MHRC investigator, however, without\n\ndetermining       whether       appellant       could      perform          the    essential\n\nfunctions    of     the    job    at    home     (relying         on    a    supervisor's\n\nstatement    that     the       job    could    be   restructured             if    the    law\n\nrequired), found reasonable grounds to believe that appellant\n\nhad been subjected to unlawful disability discrimination.\n\n    Appellant filed his lawsuit in June 1999, asserting that the\n\nState's   rejection        of    his    request      to    work    at       home    violated\n\nfederal and state disability laws.                        In a motion for summary\n\njudgment,     the    State       argued     that      it     was       not    obliged       to\n\naccommodate    appellant         because       his   request       to       work    at    home\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fstemmed not from his disability but from a personal preference\n\nagainst moving, and it emphasized that appellant could not in\n\nany   event    perform      the   essential     functions      of    the    claims\n\nadjudicator position at home.             The district court accepted the\n\nmagistrate     judge's     recommendation      that    summary      judgment       be\n\ngranted for defendants, and this appeal followed.                   We review the\n\ndistrict court's decision de novo, assessing the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to appellant, the nonmoving party.                    Reed v.\n\nLePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 257 (lst Cir. 2001).\n\n                         II. The Interactive Process\n\n      Before delving into the substance of the accommodation\n\nissue, we address appellant's contention that the State violated\n\nthe ADA by failing to utilize an informal, interactive process\n\nto make an individualized assessment of his needs and abilities.\n\nThe statute's implementing regulations state that it \"may\" be\n\nnecessary     for   an    employer   to     initiate   a    dialogue       with    an\n\nemployee in order to determine an appropriate accommodation.\n\nSee   29   C.F.R.    §    1630.2(o)(3).       Courts    have   construed          the\n\nregulation     as   imposing      various    levels    of   obligation.           See\n\nBarnett v. United States, 228 F.3d 1105, 1111-14 (9th Cir. 2000)\n\n(en banc) (citing cases), petition for cert. granted in part sub\n\nnom US Airways v. Barnett, 69 U.S.L.W. 3665 (U.S. Apr. 16, 2001)\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f(No. 00-1250).5 Even in the most rigorous version, however, such\n\nas the Ninth Circuit's \"mandatory obligation\" in all cases, see\n\nHumphrey v. Mem. Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir.\n\n2001), petition for cert. filed, 69 U.S.L.W. 3792 (U.S. June 13,\n\n2001) (No. 00-1860), liability nonetheless depends on a finding\n\nthat, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties\n\ncould have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable\n\nthe disabled person to perform the job's essential functions,\n\nsee Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139; Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1115-16.\n\n    This court has not taken so categorical a stand on the\n\ninteractive process, preferring instead to resolve the issue on\n\na case-by-case basis.       See Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251\n\nF.3d 21, 27 (lst Cir. 2001);        Ward v.    Mass. Health Research\n\nInst., Inc., 209 F.3d 29, 33 n.4 (lst Cir. 2000); Jacques v.\n\nClean-Up   Group,   Inc.,   96   F.3d   506,   515   (lst   Cir.   1996).\n\nAlthough we have noted that there may be situations in which\n\nfailure to engage in the process \"would constitute a failure to\n\nprovide reasonable accommodation that amounts to a violation of\n\nthe ADA,\" Jacques, 96 F.3d at 515;         see also Garcia-Ayala v.\n\nLederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 648 n.12 (lst Cir.\n\n\n\n    5 The Court granted certiorari to consider whether the ADA\nrequires an employer to disregard its seniority system in\nreassigning a disabled employee who is seeking a reasonable\naccommodation.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f2000) (reversing summary judgment for employer and granting\n\njudgment for employee where company had \"simply rejected the\n\nrequest for the accommodation without further discussion,\" but\n\nnot deciding the interactive process issue), we also consider\n\nsuch an omission \"of no moment\" if the record forecloses a\n\nfinding that the plaintiff could perform the duties of the job,\n\nwith or without reasonable accommodation,          see Soto-Ocasio v.\n\nFed. Exp. Corp., 150 F.3d 14, 19 (lst Cir. 1998).\n\n     This being the status of the law, appellant has failed to\n\ndemonstrate   an   actionable   failure    to   engage   in   interactive\n\ncommunication.     As we explain in the following section, the\n\nrecord cannot support a finding that he is able to perform the\n\nessential functions of the claims adjudicator position at his\n\nhome.    In addition, we do not view the circumstances here to\n\nconstitute the extreme failure to engage in meaningful dialogue\n\nthat appellant attempts to depict.        When appellant asked to work\n\nat home because of the new commuting distance, the State had no\n\nreason to suspect that his disability also posed issues related\n\nto office work.    He had been performing the claims adjudicator\n\nposition at the Rockland office with little or no accommodation\n\nfor more than seven years,6 and, indeed, the doctor who submitted\n\n\n     6  Appellant   stated   that  he   never   requested   any\naccommodation, while the State maintains that it allowed him to\ntake more than the standard number of breaks during the day.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fa letter of support for his request saw \"[no] problem with him\n\nengaging in the type of activities he has been doing . . . .\"7\n\n       In a setting of institutional change, with requests to work\n\nat home from other employees also seeking to avoid the commute,\n\nand after inquiry into statutory requirements,8 the State's\n\ndecision to reject an accommodation based on appellant's commute\n\ndoes not demonstrate a disregard for its obligations under the\n\nADA.       It is unsurprising that state officials would out-of-hand\n\nreject such an accommodation if it were not required by the ADA,\n\nout    of     a   legitimate   concern     that   allowing   him   such   an\n\narrangement would set a precedent for other employees.\n\n       Moreover, the State did communicate with appellant, making\n\nefforts to accommodate his disability with offers to help him\n\nboth relocate and search for a new job in the Rockland area.              In\n\naddition, after the MHRC's adverse finding in December 1998, the\n\nDepartment of Labor offered him a job in an office in Rockland.\n\nBy that time, however, appellant felt he could no longer work in\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       Another of appellant's doctors, Stephan Bamberger,\ntestified in his deposition in November 1999 that there was no\nmedical reason why he could not move to Bangor.\n       8\n       We do not address here whether the advice given to the\nState – that the ADA does not cover commuting issues – was\ncorrect.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fan office,9 reflecting a shift in his focus from the single issue\n\nof his inability to commute to the additional problems presented\n\nby office work.     The State, however, also had gone beyond the\n\nissue of the commute to assert that the essential functions of\n\nappellant's job could not be performed at his home.\n\n     This is not to say that the State's behavior was ideal.              A\n\nface-to-face    discussion   might   have   allowed   a   more   complete\n\nunderstanding of the needs and issues on both sides and avoided\n\nappellant's     understandable   sense      of   frustration     and   ill\n\ntreatment. 10      Appellant,    too,    however,     must     bear    some\n\nresponsibility for inadequate communication.              His counsel at\n\noral argument made clear that his exceptional job performance\n\nfor at least a portion of his tenure as a claims adjudicator was\n\n\n     9 In his deposition, he stated that he learned from a\nmedical consultation that continued full-time office work would\naccelerate his physical deterioration. It was at that time, he\nsaid, \"when I made the firm determination that I would not work\nagain unless it was in the home.\"        Dr. Stephan Bamberger\ntestified in deposition that a ten-minute commute – as appellant\nhad had in Rockland – would not significantly affect the\nlongevity of his working life, but that working in an office\nwould pose difficulties because of his pain and incontinence.\n\n     10  For   example,   the  State   raised   concerns   about\nconfidentiality and expense related to at-home work, but did not\nfully explore them with appellant or his counsel. Similarly,\nthe State internally concluded before rejecting appellant's\nrequest to work at home that the essential functions of a claims\nadjudicator could not be performed at home, but it did not\naddress that issue in its communications with appellant or his\ncounsel until much later.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fnot without significant physical sacrifices.                       Yet, so far as the\n\nrecord       shows,    the   State     had     no    reason        to    know   of     the\n\nextraordinary         measures   he    had   been         taking    to   minimize      the\n\ndifficulties of working at the Rockland office.                          See Reed, 244\n\nF.3d    at    261   (employee's       request       for    accommodation        must    be\n\n\"'sufficiently direct and specific'\" to provide employer with\n\nnotice of disability-based need); EEOC Interpretive Guidance, 29\n\nC.F.R. Pt. 1630, app. at § 1630.9 (\"In general, . . . it is the\n\nresponsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the\n\nemployer that an accommodation is needed.\").11                           Had the State\n\nunderstood at the outset that appellant's need for accommodation\n\nwas not, in fact, limited to commuting, there is no reason to\n\ndoubt that the interaction would have progressed differently.\n\n       In sum, the circumstances here do not show an egregious\n\nfailure to engage in the interactive process.                           We now turn to\n\nconsider whether the law required the State to provide appellant\n\nthe accommodation of working at home.\n\n       III. Essential Functions and Reasonable Accommodation\n\n       To obtain relief under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate\n\nthat:\n\n\n       11\n       We recognize that at least some of appellant's silence\nstemmed from a desire to retain a level of privacy concerning\nhis physical difficulties. An employer, however, cannot be held\nresponsible for knowing information about a disability that an\nemployee deliberately chooses to withhold.\n\n                                        -12-\n\f       (1) he was disabled within the meaning of the Act; (2)\n       he was a qualified individual, i.e. able to perform\n       the essential functions of the position with or\n       without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he was\n       discharged because of his disability.\n\nWard, 209 F.3d at 33.    The State concedes that appellant meets\n\nthe statutory definition of disability.       The dispute centers on\n\nthe second inquiry, whether he was a qualified individual under\n\nthe ADA.12    The particular question we face here is whether\n\nappellant can \"perform the essential functions of the position\"\n\nif given the accommodation he seeks, working at home.               The\n\ndistrict court concluded as a matter of law that he could not,\n\nbased on the State's evidence that several important functions\n\nperformed by claims adjudicators could not be accomplished in\n\nappellant's   home.    Appellant   contends   that   the   State   both\n\nunderestimates what reasonably can be done in a home setting and\n\nimproperly characterizes as \"essential\" certain functions that\n\nrequire an office setting.\n\n       We recently have confirmed that the plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of proposing an accommodation that would enable him to\n\nperform his job effectively and is, at least on the face of\n\nthings, reasonable.     Phelps, 251 F.3d at 26; Reed, 244 F.3d at\n\n258.    This necessarily entails a showing that the accommodation\n\n\n       12\n        Because we conclude that appellant fails to establish\nthat he is a qualified individual, we, like the district court,\ndo not reach the third element of the prima facie case.\n\n                               -13-\n\f\"would effectively enable [him] to perform [his] job,\" Reed, 244\n\nF.3d at 259.       As a starting point, therefore, appellant must\n\noffer evidence that he can perform the essential functions of a\n\nclaims adjudicator at home.            This turns out to be both the\n\nbeginning and the end of our analysis.\n\n    An \"essential function\" is a fundamental job duty of the\n\nposition at issue.         See Ward, 209 F.3d at 34; 29 C.F.R. §\n\n1630.2(n)(1).      The term does not include \"marginal\" tasks, but\n\nmay encompass \"individual or idiosyncratic characteristics\" of\n\nthe job, Ward, 209 F.3d at 34 (quoting Laurin v. Providence\n\nHosp., 150 F.3d 52, 56-57, 59 n.6 (lst Cir. 1998)).                    In the\n\nabsence of evidence of discriminatory animus, courts generally\n\ngive \"substantial weight\" to the employer's judgment as to what\n\nfunctions are essential.           Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).\n\nOther   evidence    also     is    relevant,     including:     \"written   job\n\ndescriptions, consequences of not requiring the function, work\n\nexperience of past incumbents, and work experience of current\n\nincumbents.\"         Ward,   209    F.3d    at   34   (citing   29   C.F.R.   §\n\n1630.2(n)(3)).\n\n    The record contains both a \"Task Statement\" for the claims\n\nadjudicator position at a processing center and a list labeled\n\n\"Essential Functions of a Claims Adjudicator,\" the latter of\n\nwhich is simply a shortened version of the former.                   The task\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fstatement contains nine items, and six of them are identified as\n\nessential functions in the other document. The first three\n\n\"essential\" tasks generally describe the job of adjudicating\n\nclaims - what we shall call the \"adjudicator function\"13 — and\n\nthe   other    three   involve   the   provision   of   information   and\n\nguidance to a variety of individuals both inside and outside the\n\nDivision – in our shorthand, the \"advisor function.\"14\n\n\n      13   These three tasks are:\n\n      1. Interview claimants, employers, and witnesses by\n      telephone to obtain relevant facts in order to\n      determine a claimant's eligibility for compensation\n      and which employer account, if any, is to be charged.\n\n      2. Writes clear and concise decisions in order to\n      enable interested parties to determine the basis for\n      unemployment compensation benefits determination and\n      which employer account, if any, will be charged.\n\n      3. Enters decisions and related data into p.c. in\n      order to produce a written record of the decision.\n      14   These three duties are:\n\n      4. Explains laws, regulations, commission rules,\n      precedents,   and   department   policies    regarding\n      eligibility,   disqualifications   and    appeals   to\n      claimants, employers, and the general public in order\n      to provide information on the program.\n\n      5. Discusses disposition of the claim with claimants,\n      employers, and/or their authorized representatives in\n      order to provide information on the basis for the\n      determination and on the process of initiation of an\n      appeal.\n\n      6. Assists claims specialists and employment security\n      aides in functions of their respective classifications\n\n                                    -15-\n\f    Appellant focuses on the adjudicator function and maintains\n\nthat there is at least a factual dispute as to whether it can be\n\nperformed by him at his home.        He plausibly contends that he\n\ncould conduct interviews by telephone at home, write decisions,\n\nand enter all necessary data into a personal computer.           Although\n\nthe State has raised concerns about the confidentiality of\n\nrecords that might be needed in the decision-making process, its\n\ncounsel acknowledged at oral argument that that concern perhaps\n\ncould be met if it were the only obstacle.          Indeed, it appears\n\nthat other Department of Labor decision-makers routinely work at\n\nhome with confidential documents, albeit not on a full time\n\nbasis.   Moreover,   there   is    no    evidence   that   the   benefits\n\ndecisions must be made on extremely tight deadlines, and gaining\n\naccess to records kept at the office or within the Division's\n\nsecure computer system would thus seem logistically feasible.15\n\n\n    which relates [sic] to adjudication activities.\n    15 On the other hand, the State maintains that such research\nwould be difficult for an at-home employee to manage without\nimposing an undue burden on employees at the office because it\nrequires physical access to paper files, as well as access to\nthe unemployment insurance database. An at-home employee thus\nwould have to rely on others to find, copy, and mail needed\ndocuments.   As of December 1999, the Division's call centers\nwere supported by only two clerical staff people. Laura Boyett,\ndirector of the Division, reported in an affidavit that both\nindividuals are \"fully occupied with their present duties and do\nnot have time to take on additional duties.\" See 42 U.S.C. §\n12112(b)(5)(A) (an employer need not provide an accommodation\nthat would impose \"an undue hardship\").\n\n                                  -16-\n\f    Although adjudicating claims may be the core function of\n\nappellant's former position — hence its \"claims adjudicator\"\n\ntitle — the advisor function looms large in both the written\n\ntask statement and the testimonial evidence presented by the\n\nState.   In a lengthy affidavit, Boyett described the transition\n\nof the Division's services from decentralized field offices,\n\nsuch as the one in which appellant worked in Rockland, to the\n\n\"call    center    model,\"       which    consolidated        the    Division's\n\noperations in three offices serving a statewide clientele.                    In\n\nthe call center system, unemployment claims are submitted via\n\ntelephone and routed automatically to one of the three centers\n\nin a manner intended to equalize workloads among the locations.\n\n    Claims adjudicators are \"the most senior, non-supervisory\n\ntechnical   resource\"      at    the   call   centers,   and    one    function\n\nresulting   from    that        experienced    status    is     to    serve   as\n\n\"Adjudicator of the Day\" approximately once a week.                      Boyett\n\nexplained the role as follows:\n\n    Adjudicators of the Day are the primary people\n    responsible    for   trouble-shooting   and    problem\n    resolution for that day.    Their names are posted in\n    visible locations within the call centers so that\n    claims staff know who to go to with questions and\n    problems.   They remain accessible so that they can\n    help  other   employees   at   the  other   employees'\n    workstations   if  needed.      For  example,   claims\n    adjudicators might help another employee conduct\n    research on the computer database, plug into an\n    employee's telephone to assist with a telephone call,\n    or take a portion of a call at their own workstation\n\n                                       -17-\n\f     to resolve a problem before transferring the call back\n     to the other employee or terminating the call.\n\nBoyett further stated that, since the change to call centers,\n\nclaims     adjudicators     have   more     often    served      as   a   technical\n\nresource for other employees because the number of supervisors\n\nwas reduced from seventeen to six statewide, making them less\n\navailable for individual questions.                  Although some of this\n\nassistance could be provided by phone, \"it is primarily provided\n\nin person because it usually requires jointly reviewing written\n\nmaterials, including forms, documents, law sections, primary\n\ncommission cases and claim cards.\"                  Claims adjudicators also\n\nparticipate in the technical training of claims staff at the\n\ncall centers.16\n\n     In essence, Boyett's affidavit depicts claims adjudicators\n\nas   key    players    on   a   team    whose     function       is   to    provide\n\ninformation    and    assistance       to   the   public    in    utilizing     the\n\nunemployment insurance system.              The system often relies on on-\n\nthe-spot collaborative efforts among the call center's various\n\nemployees,     and    claims    adjudicators        are    particularly       vital\n\n\n\n     16 Boyett stated that \"[t]he call center environment\nprovides an ability to offer staff training more frequently\nbecause each center has the capability of covering for another\ncenter while training is taking place. Staff training is now\ngiven high priority because one of the goals of the call center\ntransition is to improve consistency in procedures and\napplication of law throughout the state.\"\n\n                                       -18-\n\fparticipants because of their high level of technical skill.\n\nSee    29     C.F.R.       §    1630.2(n)(2)(ii)       (a   job   function          may   be\n\nconsidered essential \"because of the limited number of employees\n\navailable among whom the performance of that job function can be\n\ndistributed\").         The State's position is that, by definition, the\n\nadvisor function includes training and joint problem-solving\n\nthat        could    not       be   accomplished      effectively        by    a    claims\n\nadjudicator          based      outside    of   the    call   center.          See     EEOC\n\nEnforcement          Guidance:         Reasonable      Accommodation          and    Undue\n\nHardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 1999 WL\n\n33103142,       at    *34       n.93   (March   1,    1999)   (\"Courts        that     have\n\nrejected working at home as a reasonable accommodation focus on\n\nevidence that personal contact, interaction, and coordination\n\nare needed for a specific position.\") (citing cases).17\n\n       In     response         to   the   State's     evidence    that    the       advisor\n\nfunction is an \"essential\" part of a claims adjudicator's job,\n\n\n       17\n       We have focused on the claims adjudicator's duties as\nadvisor to other call center staff because that role, by itself,\ndemonstrates that the position cannot be performed at home.\nOther aspects of the advisor function – specifically, providing\nexplanations and information to the public and to those using\nthe unemployment compensation system – might be feasible in a\nhome if the technology cost were not prohibitive. There is much\ndiscussion in the record about the possibility of connecting\nappellant's home phone to the Division's call center, but we\nneed not explore that issue because of our conclusion that the\nrecord otherwise unequivocally proves that a claims adjudicator\nmust work at the center to perform essential aspects of the\nadvisor function.\n\n                                            -19-\n\fappellant offers no specific facts showing that this role either\n\nis not essential or could be performed by him at home.                       He\n\nemphasizes a statement made by Gail Thayer, director of the\n\nBureau    of    Unemployment      Compensation       (which      includes    the\n\nDivision), that \"if the law requires it, the [State] could\n\nrestructure Mr. Kvorjak's job to enable him to work at home.\"\n\nThayer did not state, however, that the resulting position would\n\ninclude all of a claims adjudicator's essential functions, and,\n\nindeed, she testified at her deposition that she did not, in\n\nfact, envision that such a restructuring would retain all of the\n\nimportant elements of appellant's job.              The law does not require\n\nan   employer    to   \"accommodate        a    disability   by   foregoing    an\n\nessential function of the position or by reallocating essential\n\nfunctions to make other workers' jobs more onerous.\"                Feliciano,\n\n160 F.3d at 785; see also Phelps, 251 F.3d at 26; Laurin, 150\n\nF.3d at 56, 60.\n\n       Appellant's other contentions regarding the State's evidence\n\nare no more forceful.            He complains that numerous functions\n\nlisted as essential in the State's summary judgment materials\n\nwere    both   new    to   the   case    and    peripheral    to   the   claims\n\nadjudicator's job, and their legitimacy must be resolved by a\n\nfactfinder.     The simple response to the tardiness claim is that\n\nthe advisor role derives directly from the list of duties in the\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fTask Statement,18 which was used as an exhibit before the MHRC.\n\nAlthough the Boyett affidavit spells out in detail for the first\n\ntime the many ways in which a claims adjudicator is expected to\n\nperform the advisor function, the possibility that a particular\n\nadvisory task is unimportant or reasonably could be performed at\n\nan individual's home does not undermine the State's position\n\nthat        the      claims       adjudicator's            in-office        role   as\n\neducator/trainer/advisor is essential.\n\n       Appellant offers no evidence suggesting that, despite the\n\nwritten      task     statement       and    the     departmental      expectations\n\noutlined      in    the   Boyett      affidavit,      the    advisor    function    in\n\nactuality         comprises      an   insignificant         portion    of   a   claims\n\nadjudicator's job.          His own knowledge of the position is limited\n\nto his experience working in a field office and thus provides an\n\ninsufficient basis to rebut Boyett's assertion that the advisor\n\nfunction      became      more    important        after    the   consolidation     of\n\n\n\n\n       18\n       Item 6 on the list of essential functions, see note 14\nsupra, refers to the assistance provided by claims adjudicators\nto other claims staff members. This item embraces most of the\nsupervisory and educational tasks that Boyett attributed to\nclaims adjudicators.\n\n                                            -21-\n\fservices in call centers. 19 Appellant could have, but did not,\n\ndepose current claims adjudicators about their duties.\n\n    Finally, appellant tries to make much of the fact that two\n\nDepartment of Labor employees have been permitted to work at\n\nhome.         The    evidence     shows   significantly         distinguishable\n\ncircumstances: (1) the employees, who both experienced allergic-\n\ntype reactions to substances in their office building, are being\n\npermitted to work at home only until the Department is able to\n\nconstruct a \"clean room\" at the workplace; and (2) neither is a\n\nclaims adjudicator — one's job is to organize files and the\n\nother    is    a    tax   specialist    whose       primary   duty   is   to   call\n\nemployers who owe unemployment taxes.                    The fact that these\n\nemployees      work       at   home   lends    no    support    to   appellant's\n\ncontention that he could perform the essential functions of a\n\nclaims adjudicator at home.\n\n                                  IV. Conclusion\n\n    The record demonstrates without meaningful dispute that the\n\nessential functions of a claims adjudicator cannot be performed\n\nat an individual employee's home.              We therefore affirm the grant\n\nof summary judgment for defendants.\n\n\n\n    19 In his answers to defendants' interrogatories, appellant\nacknowledged that even at the field office he would \"cover for\nother workers by performing the duties of a receptionist and\ncovered for my boss and others, etc.\"\n\n                                        -22-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n            Dissent follows.\n\n\n\n\n                  -23-\n\f               Schwarzer, Senior District Judge, dissenting:\n\n               I respectfully dissent.          The problem with this case is\n\nthat the State had made up its mind to reject Kvorjak’s request\n\nto work at home without even considering whether a reasonable\n\naccommodation could be worked out.                   Thus, in responding to his\n\ninitial    request,       the    State    rejected     it    on    the   ground    that\n\n“commuting to the job is not a covered activity under ADA.”\n\n        It did not consider any of Kvorjak’s medical information\n\n(nor    did     it   request    any),     and   it    did    not    conduct    a   cost\n\nassessment of his working from home.                 Instead, the State advised\n\nKvorjak’s counsel that it was not interested in having him work\n\nat home, and it is clear from the record that no accommodation\n\nwas ever considered.            Until the commencement of the litigation,\n\nthe State adhered to this initial position.                        It was only when\n\nthe     State    filed    its    motion    for   summary          judgment    that   it\n\npresented, by way of the affidavit of Laura Boyett, a litany of\n\nreasons why Kvorjak would not be able to perform the essential\n\nfunctions of his job at home.               This court has said that “[a]n\n\nemployee’s request for a reasonable accommodation requires a\n\ngreat deal of communication between the employee and employer .\n\n.   .   both    parties    bear    responsibility           for    determining     what\n\naccommodation is necessary.”              Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437,\n\n444 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting               Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne Cmty.\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fSch., 100 F.3d 1281, 1285 (7th Cir. 1996)); see also Garcia-\n\nAyala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 648 n.12 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).        Here there was essentially none.\n\n\n\n       This   is    not    a    case    in    which    the    omission     of    such\n\ncommunication can be said to be of no moment.                  Cf. Soto-Casio v.\n\nFed. Express Corp., 150 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998).                      The State\n\ndoes have a duty to “mak[e] reasonable accommodations . . .\n\nunless [it] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose\n\nan undue hardship on the operation of [its] business.”                             42\n\nU.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).               Kvorjak’s supervisor’s testimony on\n\ndeposition,        that    if   the     law     required     his   job   could     be\n\nrestructured to enable him to work at home and confidentiality\n\nconcerns and connections with the call center could be resolved,\n\nraises a triable issue.           Moreover, the State’s adamant refusal\n\nfrom the outset to consider and discuss accommodation raises a\n\ntriable issue as to whether it complied with its obligation\n\nunder the ADA.        What the State did here is precisely what the\n\nemployer did in Garcia-Ayala: “It simply rejected the request\n\nfor the accommodation without further discussion and it did so\n\nwithout pointing to any facts making the accommodation harmful\n\nto its business needs.”               Garcia-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 648 n.12.\n\nThis   “may   well    be    [a]   situation[]         in   which   the   employer’s\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\ffailure to engage in an informal interactive process would\n\nconstitute a failure to provide reasonable accommodation that\n\namounts to a violation of the ADA.”   Jacques v. Clean-Up Group,\n\nInc., 96 F.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir. 1996).1\n\n\n\n    I would reverse and remand for trial.\n\n\n\n\n    1I note parenthetically that the request to work at home\ncannot be regarded as outlandish. See Langon v. Dep’t of Health\nand Human Servs., 959 F.2d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding\nthat agency must consider accommodating a computer programmer\nwith multiple sclerosis by allowing her to work at home); see\nalso Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 530 (D.C.

Factual Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant is partially paralyzed as a result of spina bifida, a condition he has had since birth. The condition limits his ability to walk, causes problems with his bowels and bladder, and at times triggers pain when he sits, stands or lies down. Despite these difficulties, appellant successfully worked for various state agencies in Maine for twenty-two years, the last seven and one-half as a claims adjudicator for the Department of Labor's Division of Unemployment Field Services (the \"Division\"). In that most recent position, he was assigned to an office in Rockland, Maine, a ten-minute commute from his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1990s, the Division decided to cut expenses by closing fifteen field offices, including the Rockland office, and shifting services to three call centers in other parts of the state. To assist with the transfer, the Division sent out two surveys asking employees if they would consider relocating to a call center. In both surveys, appellant indicated that he would be able to work in a call center and listed Bangor as his primary choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the transfer in 1997, however, appellant drove the ninety-minute commute from his home to Bangor on two consecutive days. The lengthy drive resulted in substantial pain. Realizing that he could not commute three hours every day, he applied for a disability pension and asked that he be permitted to use his accumulated sick time until his pension request was processed. The State denied his request to use sick time, and appellant contacted the Disability Rights Center (the \"Center\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After consultation with the Center, appellant in May 1997 requested the accommodation of working at home on a full-time, permanent basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He supplemented his request with a letter from his physician stating that the commute to Bangor every day would have a detrimental impact on his health. The doctor also stated that \"any effort that can be made to allow him to work locally would be highly appropriate and medically indicated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Division rejected appellant's request, stating that the Department of Labor had checked with the New England Business and Technical Assistance Center and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and had \"concluded that commuting to the job is not a covered activity under [the] ADA.\" It noted that it had received other requests from Division employees to work at home because of the office consolidation, and had denied all of them. The State, however, did offer to pay relocation costs if appellant moved closer to a call center, a benefit provided to all re-assigned employees, and also offered to pay for temporary housing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Appellant declined to move, and he was laid off on June 18, 1997. That same day, Kathleen Dunford, director of the Office of Human Resources for the Department, offered in a telephone conversation to assist him in finding another local job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1997, the State notified appellant of a job opening in Bangor for a claims adjudicator -- the same position he had left four months earlier. Appellant expressed interest, but again requested the accommodation of working at home. The request again was denied. Appellant subsequently filed complaints with the MHRC challenging both the original layoff and the later failure to re-hire him. The State continued to maintain that it had no obligation to ameliorate appellant's commuting difficulties; in its view, he was no different from non-disabled employees who sought the same accommodation of working at home because of the inconvenience of relocating. See 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4573-A (\"This subchapter does not prohibit an employer from discharging . . . an individual with physical or mental disability . . . if the individual, because of the physical or mental disability, is unable to . . . be at, remain at or go to or from the place where the duties of employment are to be performed.\"). The MHRC investigator, however, without determining whether appellant could perform the essential functions of the job at home (relying on a supervisor's statement that the job could be restructured if the law required), found reasonable grounds to believe that appellant had been subjected to unlawful disability discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant filed his lawsuit in June 1999, asserting that the State's rejection of his request to work at home violated federal and state disability laws. In a motion for summary judgment, the State argued that it was not obliged to accommodate appellant because his request to work at home stemmed not from his disability but from a personal preference against moving, and it emphasized that appellant could not in any event perform the essential functions of the claims adjudicator position at home. The district court accepted the magistrate judge's recommendation that summary judgment be granted for defendants, and this appeal followed. We review the district court's decision de novo, assessing the facts in the light most favorable to appellant, the nonmoving party. Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 257 (lst Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. The Interactive Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before delving into the substance of the accommodation issue, we address appellant's contention that the State violated the ADA by failing to utilize an informal, interactive process to make an individualized assessment of his needs and abilities. The statute's implementing regulations state that it \"may\" be necessary for an employer to initiate a dialogue with an employee in order to determine an appropriate accommodation. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(o)(3). Courts have construed the regulation as imposing various levels of obligation. See Barnett v. United States, 228 F.3d 1105, 1111-14 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (citing cases), petition for cert. granted in part sub nom US Airways v. Barnett, 69 U.S.L.W. 3665 (U.S. Apr. 16, 2001) (No. 00-1250).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Even in the most rigorous version, however, such as the Ninth Circuit's \"mandatory obligation\" in all cases, see Humphrey v. Mem. Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001), petition for cert. filed, 69 U.S.L.W. 3792 (U.S. June 13, 2001) (No. 00-1860), liability nonetheless depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the disabled person to perform the job's essential functions, see Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139; Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1115-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not taken so categorical a stand on the interactive process, preferring instead to resolve the issue on a case-by-case basis. See Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 27 (lst Cir. 2001); Ward v. Mass. Health Research Inst., Inc., 209 F.3d 29, 33 n.4 (lst Cir. 2000); Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 515 (lst Cir. 1996). Although we have noted that there may be situations in which failure to engage in the process \"would constitute a failure to provide reasonable accommodation that amounts to a violation of the ADA,\" Jacques, 96 F.3d at 515; see also Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 648 n.12 (lst Cir. 2000) (reversing summary judgment for employer and granting judgment for employee where company had \"simply rejected the request for the accommodation without further discussion,\" but not deciding the interactive process issue), we also consider such an omission \"of no moment\" if the record forecloses a finding that the plaintiff could perform the duties of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation, see Soto-Ocasio v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 150 F.3d 14, 19 (lst Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This being the status of the law, appellant has failed to demonstrate an actionable failure to engage in interactive communication. As we explain in the following section, the record cannot support a finding that he is able to perform the essential functions of the claims adjudicator position at his home. In addition, we do not view the circumstances here to constitute the extreme failure to engage in meaningful dialogue that appellant attempts to depict. When appellant asked to work at home because of the new commuting distance, the State had no reason to suspect that his disability also posed issues related to office work. He had been performing the claims adjudicator position at the Rockland office with little or no accommodation for more than seven years,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and, indeed, the doctor who submitted a letter of support for his request saw \"[no] problem with him engaging in the type of activities he has been doing . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a setting of institutional change, with requests to work at home from other employees also seeking to avoid the commute, and after inquiry into statutory requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the State's decision to reject an accommodation based on appellant's commute does not demonstrate a disregard for its obligations under the ADA. It is unsurprising that state officials would out-of-hand reject such an accommodation if it were not required by the ADA, out of a legitimate concern that allowing him such an arrangement would set a precedent for other employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the State did communicate with appellant, making efforts to accommodate his disability with offers to help him both relocate and search for a new job in the Rockland area. In addition, after the MHRC's adverse finding in December 1998, the Department of Labor offered him a job in an office in Rockland. By that time, however, appellant felt he could no longer work in an office,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> reflecting a shift in his focus from the single issue of his inability to commute to the additional problems presented by office work. The State, however, also had gone beyond the issue of the commute to assert that the essential functions of appellant's job could not be performed at his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that the State's behavior was ideal. A face-to-face discussion might have allowed a more complete understanding of the needs and issues on both sides and avoided appellant's understandable sense of frustration and ill treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Appellant, too, however, must bear some responsibility for inadequate communication. His counsel at oral argument made clear that his exceptional job performance for at least a portion of his tenure as a claims adjudicator was not without significant physical sacrifices. Yet, so far as the record shows, the State had no reason to know of the extraordinary measures he had been taking to minimize the difficulties of working at the Rockland office. See Reed, 244 F.3d at 261 (employee's request for accommodation must be \"'sufficiently direct and specific'\" to provide employer with notice of disability-based need); EEOC Interpretive Guidance, 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, app. at &#167; 1630.9 (\"In general, . . . it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Had the State understood at the outset that appellant's need for accommodation was not, in fact, limited to commuting, there is no reason to doubt that the interaction would have progressed differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the circumstances here do not show an egregious failure to engage in the interactive process. We now turn to consider whether the law required the State to provide appellant the accommodation of working at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Essential Functions and Reasonable Accommodation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain relief under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) he was disabled within the meaning of the Act; (2) he was a qualified individual, i.e. able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he was discharged because of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ward, 209 F.3d at 33. The State concedes that appellant meets the statutory definition of disability. The dispute centers on the second inquiry, whether he was a qualified individual under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The particular question we face here is whether appellant can \"perform the essential functions of the position\" if given the accommodation he seeks, working at home. The district court concluded as a matter of law that he could not, based on the State's evidence that several important functions performed by claims adjudicators could not be accomplished in appellant's home. Appellant contends that the State both underestimates what reasonably can be done in a home setting and improperly characterizes as \"essential\" certain functions that require an office setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently have confirmed that the plaintiff bears the burden of proposing an accommodation that would enable him to perform his job effectively and is, at least on the face of things, reasonable. Phelps, 251 F.3d at 26; Reed, 244 F.3d at 258. This necessarily entails a showing that the accommodation \"would effectively enable [him] to perform [his] job,\" Reed, 244 F.3d at 259. As a starting point, therefore, appellant must offer evidence that he can perform the essential functions of a claims adjudicator at home. This turns out to be both the beginning and the end of our analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An \"essential function\" is a fundamental job duty of the position at issue. See Ward, 209 F.3d at 34; 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(n)(1). The term does not include \"marginal\" tasks, but may encompass \"individual or idiosyncratic characteristics\" of the job, Ward, 209 F.3d at 34 (quoting Laurin v. Providence Hosp., 150 F.3d 52, 56-57, 59 n.6 (lst Cir. 1998)). In the absence of evidence of discriminatory animus, courts generally give \"substantial weight\" to the employer's judgment as to what functions are essential. Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8). Other evidence also is relevant, including: \"written job descriptions, consequences of not requiring the function, work experience of past incumbents, and work experience of current incumbents.\" Ward, 209 F.3d at 34 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(n)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains both a \"Task Statement\" for the claims adjudicator position at a processing center and a list labeled \"Essential Functions of a Claims Adjudicator,\" the latter of which is simply a shortened version of the former. The task statement contains nine items, and six of them are identified as essential functions in the other document. The first three \"essential\" tasks generally describe the job of adjudicating claims - what we shall call the \"adjudicator function\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> -- and the other three involve the provision of information and guidance to a variety of individuals both inside and outside the Division - in our shorthand, the \"advisor function.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant focuses on the adjudicator function and maintains that there is at least a factual dispute as to whether it can be performed by him at his home. He plausibly contends that he could conduct interviews by telephone at home, write decisions, and enter all necessary data into a personal computer. Although the State has raised concerns about the confidentiality of records that might be needed in the decision-making process, its counsel acknowledged at oral argument that that concern perhaps could be met if it were the only obstacle. Indeed, it appears that other Department of Labor decision-makers routinely work at home with confidential documents, albeit not on a full time basis. Moreover, there is no evidence that the benefits decisions must be made on extremely tight deadlines, and gaining access to records kept at the office or within the Division's secure computer system would thus seem logistically feasible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although adjudicating claims may be the core function of appellant's former position -- hence its \"claims adjudicator\" title -- the advisor function looms large in both the written task statement and the testimonial evidence presented by the State. In a lengthy affidavit, Boyett described the transition of the Division's services from decentralized field offices, such as the one in which appellant worked in Rockland, to the \"call center model,\" which consolidated the Division's operations in three offices serving a statewide clientele. In the call center system, unemployment claims are submitted via telephone and routed automatically to one of the three centers in a manner intended to equalize workloads among the locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims adjudicators are \"the most senior, non-supervisory technical resource\" at the call centers, and one function resulting from that experienced status is to serve as \"Adjudicator of the Day\" approximately once a week. Boyett explained the role as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adjudicators of the Day are the primary people responsible for trouble-shooting and problem resolution for that day. Their names are posted in visible locations within the call centers so that claims staff know who to go to with questions and problems. They remain accessible so that they can help other employees at the other employees' workstations if needed. For example, claims adjudicators might help another employee conduct research on the computer database, plug into an employee's telephone to assist with a telephone call, or take a portion of a call at their own workstation to resolve a problem before transferring the call back to the other employee or terminating the call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boyett further stated that, since the change to call centers, claims adjudicators have more often served as a technical resource for other employees because the number of supervisors was reduced from seventeen to six statewide, making them less available for individual questions. Although some of this assistance could be provided by phone, \"it is primarily provided in person because it usually requires jointly reviewing written materials, including forms, documents, law sections, primary commission cases and claim cards.\" Claims adjudicators also participate in the technical training of claims staff at the call centers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Boyett's affidavit depicts claims adjudicators as key players on a team whose function is to provide information and assistance to the public in utilizing the unemployment insurance system. The system often relies on on-the-spot collaborative efforts among the call center's various employees, and claims adjudicators are particularly vital participants because of their high level of technical skill. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(n)(2)(ii) (a job function may be considered essential \"because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed\"). The State's position is that, by definition, the advisor function includes training and joint problem-solving that could not be accomplished effectively by a claims adjudicator based outside of the call center. See EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 1999 WL 33103142, at *34 n.93 (March 1, 1999) (\"Courts that have rejected working at home as a reasonable accommodation focus on evidence that personal contact, interaction, and coordination are needed for a specific position.\") (citing cases).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the State's evidence that the advisor function is an \"essential\" part of a claims adjudicator's job, appellant offers no specific facts showing that this role either is not essential or could be performed by him at home. He emphasizes a statement made by Gail Thayer, director of the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation (which includes the Division), that \"if the law requires it, the [State] could restructure Mr. Kvorjak's job to enable him to work at home.\" Thayer did not state, however, that the resulting position would include all of a claims adjudicator's essential functions, and, indeed, she testified at her deposition that she did not, in fact, envision that such a restructuring would retain all of the important elements of appellant's job. The law does not require an employer to \"accommodate a disability by foregoing an essential function of the position or by reallocating essential functions to make other workers' jobs more onerous.\" Feliciano, 160 F.3d at 785; see also Phelps, 251 F.3d at 26; Laurin, 150 F.3d at 56, 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's other contentions regarding the State's evidence are no more forceful. He complains that numerous functions listed as essential in the State's summary judgment materials were both new to the case and peripheral to the claims adjudicator's job, and their legitimacy must be resolved by a fact finder. The simple response to the tardiness claim is that the advisor role derives directly from the list of duties in the Task Statement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> which was used as an exhibit before the MHRC. Although the Boyett affidavit spells out in detail for the first time the many ways in which a claims adjudicator is expected to perform the advisor function, the possibility that a particular advisory task is unimportant or reasonably could be performed at an individual's home does not undermine the State's position that the claims adjudicator's in-office role as educator/trainer/advisor is essential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant offers no evidence suggesting that, despite the written task statement and the departmental expectations outlined in the Boyett affidavit, the advisor function in actuality comprises an insignificant portion of a claims adjudicator's job. His own knowledge of the position is limited to his experience working in a field office and thus provides an insufficient basis to rebut Boyett's assertion that the advisor function became more important after the consolidation of services in call centers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Appellant could have, but did not, depose current claims adjudicators about their duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant tries to make much of the fact that two Department of Labor employees have been permitted to work at home. The evidence shows significantly distinguishable circumstances: (1) the employees, who both experienced allergic-type reactions to substances in their office building, are being permitted to work at home only until the Department is able to construct a \"clean room\" at the workplace; and (2) neither is a claims adjudicator -- one's job is to organize files and the other is a tax specialist whose primary duty is to call employers who owe unemployment taxes. The fact that these employees work at home lends no support to appellant's contention that he could perform the essential functions of a claims adjudicator at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates without meaningful dispute that the essential functions of a claims adjudicator cannot be performed at an individual employee's home. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellant brought suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, and the Maine Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"), 5 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 4551-4633.

This case remains viable under both the MHRA and the Rehabilitation Act, however, and the standards applicable to each of the three statutes have been viewed as essentially the same.

Thus, while we explicitly refer to the ADA because it has been the primary focus in the litigation to this point, and because of the applicability of its accompanying body of recent case law, our discussion here in fact applies solely to the Rehabilitation Act and MHRA claims.</p>\n        <p>Similarly for the sake of simplicity, we generally refer to defendants collectively as \"the State,\" although in addition to the State itself, appellant sued the Maine Department of Labor, and the department's commissioner, Valerie Landry.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Portions of this background are drawn almost verbatim from the well stated \"Facts\" section of the magistrate judge's opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Appellant initially wrote to the Department of Labor that, in addition to working at home, he was \"willing to consider any reasonable accommodations which will result in my continued employment,\" but the record reflects that he later rejected any option other than at-home work.

It was at that time, he said, \"when I made the firm determination that I would not work again unless it was in the home.\" Dr. Stephan Bamberger testified in deposition that a ten-minute commute - as appellant had had in Rockland - would not significantly affect the longevity of his working life, but that working in an office would pose difficulties because of his pain and incontinence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> For example, the State raised concerns about confidentiality and expense related to at-home work, but did not fully explore them with appellant or his counsel. Similarly, the State internally concluded before rejecting appellant's request to work at home that the essential functions of a claims adjudicator could not be performed at home, but it did not address that issue in its communications with appellant or his counsel until much later.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We recognize that at least some of appellant's silence stemmed from a desire to retain a level of privacy concerning his physical difficulties.

An at-home employee thus would have to rely on others to find, copy, and mail needed documents. As of December 1999, the Division's call centers were supported by only two clerical staff people. Laura Boyett, director of the Division, reported in an affidavit that both individuals are \"fully occupied with their present duties and do not have time to take on additional duties.\" See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A) (an employer need not provide an accommodation that would impose \"an undue hardship\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Boyett stated that \"[t]he call center environment provides an ability to offer staff training more frequently because each center has the capability of covering for another center while training is taking place.

Other aspects of the advisor function - specifically, providing explanations and information to the public and to those using the unemployment compensation system - might be feasible in a home if the technology cost were not prohibitive. There is much discussion in the record about the possibility of connecting appellant's home phone to the Division's call center, but we need not explore that issue because of our conclusion that the record otherwise unequivocally proves that a claims adjudicator must work at the center to perform essential aspects of the advisor function.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Item 6 on the list of essential functions, see note 14 supra, refers to the assistance provided by claims adjudicators to other claims staff members.

The problem with this case is that the State had made up its mind to reject Kvorjak's request to work at home without even considering whether a reasonable accommodation could be worked out. Thus, in responding to his initial request, the State rejected it on the ground that \"commuting to the job is not a covered activity under ADA.\" It did not consider any of Kvorjak's medical information (nor did it request any), and it did not conduct a cost assessment of his working from home. Instead, the State advised Kvorjak's counsel that it was not interested in having him work at home, and it is clear from the record that no accommodation was ever considered. Until the commencement of the litigation, the State adhered to this initial position. It was only when the State filed its motion for summary judgment that it presented, by way of the affidavit of Laura Boyett, a litany of reasons why Kvorjak would not be able to perform the essential functions of his job at home. This court has said that \"[a]n employee's request for a reasonable accommodation requires a great deal of communication between the employee and employer . . . both parties bear responsibility for determining what accommodation is necessary.\" Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne Cmty. Sch., 100 F.3d 1281, 1285 (7th Cir. 1996)); see also Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 648 n.12 (1st Cir. 2000). Here there was essentially none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case in which the omission of such communication can be said to be of no moment. Cf. Soto-Casio v. Fed. Express Corp., 150 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998). The State does have a duty to \"mak[e] reasonable accommodations . . . unless [it] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of [its] business.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A). Kvorjak's supervisor's testimony on deposition, that if the law required his job could be restructured to enable him to work at home and confidentiality concerns and connections with the call center could be resolved, raises a triable issue. Moreover, the State's adamant refusal from the outset to consider and discuss accommodation raises a triable issue as to whether it complied with its obligation under the ADA. What the State did here is precisely what the employer did in Garcia-Ayala: \"It simply rejected the request for the accommodation without further discussion and it did so without pointing to any facts making the accommodation harmful to its business needs.\" Garcia-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 648 n.12. This \"may well be [a] situation[] in which the employer's failure to engage in an informal interactive process would constitute a failure to provide reasonable accommodation that amounts to a violation of the ADA.\" Jacques v. Clean-Up Group, Inc., 96 F.3d 506, 515 (1st Cir. 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> I note parenthetically that the request to work at home cannot be regarded as outlandish.

The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on his federal and state claims,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> concluding that he had failed to offer evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he could accomplish \"essential\" aspects of his job at home. See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8). After a close review of the record and case law, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Factual Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant is partially paralyzed as a result of spina bifida, a condition he has had since birth. The condition limits his ability to walk, causes problems with his bowels and bladder, and at times triggers pain when he sits, stands or lies down. Despite these difficulties, appellant successfully worked for various state agencies in Maine for twenty-two years, the last seven and one-half as a claims adjudicator for the Department of Labor's Division of Unemployment Field Services (the \"Division\"). In that most recent position, he was assigned to an office in Rockland, Maine, a ten-minute commute from his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1990s, the Division decided to cut expenses by closing fifteen field offices, including the Rockland office, and shifting services to three call centers in other parts of the state. To assist with the transfer, the Division sent out two surveys asking employees if they would consider relocating to a call center. In both surveys, appellant indicated that he would be able to work in a call center and listed Bangor as his primary choice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the transfer in 1997, however, appellant drove the ninety-minute commute from his home to Bangor on two consecutive days. The lengthy drive resulted in substantial pain. Realizing that he could not commute three hours every day, he applied for a disability pension and asked that he be permitted to use his accumulated sick time until his pension request was processed. The State denied his request to use sick time, and appellant contacted the Disability Rights Center (the \"Center\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After consultation with the Center, appellant in May 1997 requested the accommodation of working at home on a full-time, permanent basis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He supplemented his request with a letter from his physician stating that the commute to Bangor every day would have a detrimental impact on his health. The doctor also stated that \"any effort that can be made to allow him to work locally would be highly appropriate and medically indicated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Division rejected appellant's request, stating that the Department of Labor had checked with the New England Business and Technical Assistance Center and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and had \"concluded that commuting to the job is not a covered activity under [the] ADA.\" It noted that it had received other requests from Division employees to work at home because of the office consolidation, and had denied all of them. The State, however, did offer to pay relocation costs if appellant moved closer to a call center, a benefit provided to all re-assigned employees, and also offered to pay for temporary housing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Appellant declined to move, and he was laid off on June 18, 1997. That same day, Kathleen Dunford, director of the Office of Human Resources for the Department, offered in a telephone conversation to assist him in finding another local job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1997, the State notified appellant of a job opening in Bangor for a claims adjudicator -- the same position he had left four months earlier. Appellant expressed interest, but again requested the accommodation of working at home. The request again was denied. Appellant subsequently filed complaints with the MHRC challenging both the original layoff and the later failure to re-hire him. The State continued to maintain that it had no obligation to ameliorate appellant's commuting difficulties; in its view, he was no different from non-disabled employees who sought the same accommodation of working at home because of the inconvenience of relocating. See 5 M.R.S.A. &#167; 4573-A (\"This subchapter does not prohibit an employer from discharging . . . an individual with physical or mental disability . . . if the individual, because of the physical or mental disability, is unable to . . . be at, remain at or go to or from the place where the duties of employment are to be performed.\"). The MHRC investigator, however, without determining whether appellant could perform the essential functions of the job at home (relying on a supervisor's statement that the job could be restructured if the law required), found reasonable grounds to believe that appellant had been subjected to unlawful disability discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant filed his lawsuit in June 1999, asserting that the State's rejection of his request to work at home violated federal and state disability laws. In a motion for summary judgment, the State argued that it was not obliged to accommodate appellant because his request to work at home stemmed not from his disability but from a personal preference against moving, and it emphasized that appellant could not in any event perform the essential functions of the claims adjudicator position at home. The district court accepted the magistrate judge's recommendation that summary judgment be granted for defendants, and this appeal followed. We review the district court's decision de novo, assessing the facts in the light most favorable to appellant, the nonmoving party. Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199356\"><a href=\"/opinion/199356/reed-v-lepage-bakeries/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 257 (lst Cir. 2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. The Interactive Process</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before delving into the substance of the accommodation issue, we address appellant's contention that the State violated the ADA by failing to utilize an informal, interactive process to make an individualized assessment of his needs and abilities. The statute's implementing regulations state that it \"may\" be necessary for an employer to initiate a dialogue with an employee in order to determine an appropriate accommodation. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(o)(3). Courts have construed the regulation as imposing various levels of obligation. See Barnett v.

As we explain in the following section, the record cannot support a finding that he is able to perform the essential functions of the claims adjudicator position at his home. In addition, we do not view the circumstances here to constitute the extreme failure to engage in meaningful dialogue that appellant attempts to depict. When appellant asked to work at home because of the new commuting distance, the State had no reason to suspect that his disability also posed issues related to office work. He had been performing the claims adjudicator position at the Rockland office with little or no accommodation for more than seven years,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and, indeed, the doctor who submitted a letter of support for his request saw \"[no] problem with him engaging in the type of activities he has been doing . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a setting of institutional change, with requests to work at home from other employees also seeking to avoid the commute, and after inquiry into statutory requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the State's decision to reject an accommodation based on appellant's commute does not demonstrate a disregard for its obligations under the ADA. It is unsurprising that state officials would out-of-hand reject such an accommodation if it were not required by the ADA, out of a legitimate concern that allowing him such an arrangement would set a precedent for other employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the State did communicate with appellant, making efforts to accommodate his disability with offers to help him both relocate and search for a new job in the Rockland area. In addition, after the MHRC's adverse finding in December 1998, the Department of Labor offered him a job in an office in Rockland. By that time, however, appellant felt he could no longer work in an office,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> reflecting a shift in his focus from the single issue of his inability to commute to the additional problems presented by office work. The State, however, also had gone beyond the issue of the commute to assert that the essential functions of appellant's job could not be performed at his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that the State's behavior was ideal. A face-to-face discussion might have allowed a more complete understanding of the needs and issues on both sides and avoided appellant's understandable sense of frustration and ill treatment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Appellant, too, however, must bear some responsibility for inadequate communication. His counsel at oral argument made clear that his exceptional job performance for at least a portion of his tenure as a claims adjudicator was not without significant physical sacrifices. Yet, so far as the record shows, the State had no reason to know of the extraordinary measures he had been taking to minimize the difficulties of working at the Rockland office. See Reed, 244 F.3d at 261 (employee's request for accommodation must be \"'sufficiently direct and specific'\" to provide employer with notice of disability-based need); EEOC Interpretive Guidance, 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, app. at &#167; 1630.9 (\"In general, . . . it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Had the State understood at the outset that appellant's need for accommodation was not, in fact, limited to commuting, there is no reason to doubt that the interaction would have progressed differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the circumstances here do not show an egregious failure to engage in the interactive process. We now turn to consider whether the law required the State to provide appellant the accommodation of working at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. Essential Functions and Reasonable Accommodation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain relief under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) he was disabled within the meaning of the Act; (2) he was a qualified individual, i.e. able to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he was discharged because of his disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ward, 209 F.3d at 33. The State concedes that appellant meets the statutory definition of disability. The dispute centers on the second inquiry, whether he was a qualified individual under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The particular question we face here is whether appellant can \"perform the essential functions of the position\" if given the accommodation he seeks, working at home. The district court concluded as a matter of law that he could not, based on the State's evidence that several important functions performed by claims adjudicators could not be accomplished in appellant's home. Appellant contends that the State both underestimates what reasonably can be done in a home setting and improperly characterizes as \"essential\" certain functions that require an office setting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently have confirmed that the plaintiff bears the burden of proposing an accommodation that would enable him to perform his job effectively and is, at least on the face of things, reasonable. Phelps, 251 F.3d at 26; Reed, 244 F.3d at 258. This necessarily entails a showing that the accommodation \"would effectively enable [him] to perform [his] job,\" Reed, 244 F.3d at 259. As a starting point, therefore, appellant must offer evidence that he can perform the essential functions of a claims adjudicator at home. This turns out to be both the beginning and the end of our analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An \"essential function\" is a fundamental job duty of the position at issue. See Ward, 209 F.3d at 34; 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(n)(1). The term does not include \"marginal\" tasks, but may encompass \"individual or idiosyncratic characteristics\" of the job, Ward, 209 F.3d at 34 (quoting Laurin v. Providence Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756419\"><a href=\"/opinion/756419/sharon-laurin-v-the-providence-hospital-and-massachusetts-nurses/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 56-57, 59 n.6 (lst Cir. 1998)). In the absence of evidence of discriminatory animus, courts generally give \"substantial weight\" to the employer's judgment as to what functions are essential. Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8). Other evidence also is relevant, including: \"written job descriptions, consequences of not requiring the function, work experience of past incumbents, and work experience of current incumbents.\" Ward, 209 F.3d at 34 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(n)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record contains both a \"Task Statement\" for the claims adjudicator position at a processing center and a list labeled \"Essential Functions of a Claims Adjudicator,\" the latter of which is simply a shortened version of the former. The task statement contains nine items, and six of them are identified as essential functions in the other document. The first three \"essential\" tasks generally describe the job of adjudicating claims - what we shall call the \"adjudicator function\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> -- and the other three involve the provision of information and guidance to a variety of individuals both inside and outside the Division - in our shorthand, the \"advisor function.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant focuses on the adjudicator function and maintains that there is at least a factual dispute as to whether it can be performed by him at his home. He plausibly contends that he could conduct interviews by telephone at home, write decisions, and enter all necessary data into a personal computer. Although the State has raised concerns about the confidentiality of records that might be needed in the decision-making process, its counsel acknowledged at oral argument that that concern perhaps could be met if it were the only obstacle. Indeed, it appears that other Department of Labor decision-makers routinely work at home with confidential documents, albeit not on a full time basis. Moreover, there is no evidence that the benefits decisions must be made on extremely tight deadlines, and gaining access to records kept at the office or within the Division's secure computer system would thus seem logistically feasible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although adjudicating claims may be the core function of appellant's former position -- hence its \"claims adjudicator\" title -- the advisor function looms large in both the written task statement and the testimonial evidence presented by the State. In a lengthy affidavit, Boyett described the transition of the Division's services from decentralized field offices, such as the one in which appellant worked in Rockland, to the \"call center model,\" which consolidated the Division's operations in three offices serving a statewide clientele. In the call center system, unemployment claims are submitted via telephone and routed automatically to one of the three centers in a manner intended to equalize workloads among the locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims adjudicators are \"the most senior, non-supervisory technical resource\" at the call centers, and one function resulting from that experienced status is to serve as \"Adjudicator of the Day\" approximately once a week. Boyett explained the role as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adjudicators of the Day are the primary people responsible for trouble-shooting and problem resolution for that day. Their names are posted in visible locations within the call centers so that claims staff know who to go to with questions and problems. They remain accessible so that they can help other employees at the other employees' workstations if needed. For example, claims adjudicators might help another employee conduct research on the computer database, plug into an employee's telephone to assist with a telephone call, or take a portion of a call at their own workstation to resolve a problem before transferring the call back to the other employee or terminating the call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boyett further stated that, since the change to call centers, claims adjudicators have more often served as a technical resource for other employees because the number of supervisors was reduced from seventeen to six statewide, making them less available for individual questions. Although some of this assistance could be provided by phone, \"it is primarily provided in person because it usually requires jointly reviewing written materials, including forms, documents, law sections, primary commission cases and claim cards.\" Claims adjudicators also participate in the technical training of claims staff at the call centers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In essence, Boyett's affidavit depicts claims adjudicators as key players on a team whose function is to provide information and assistance to the public in utilizing the unemployment insurance system. The system often relies on on-the-spot collaborative efforts among the call center's various employees, and claims adjudicators are particularly vital participants because of their high level of technical skill. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(n)(2)(ii) (a job function may be considered essential \"because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed\"). The State's position is that, by definition, the advisor function includes training and joint problem-solving that could not be accomplished effectively by a claims adjudicator based outside of the call center. See EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33103142</span></span>, at *34 n.93 (March 1, 1999) (\"Courts that have rejected working at home as a reasonable accommodation focus on evidence that personal contact, interaction, and coordination are needed for a specific position.\") (citing cases).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the State's evidence that the advisor function is an \"essential\" part of a claims adjudicator's job, appellant offers no specific facts showing that this role either is not essential or could be performed by him at home. He emphasizes a statement made by Gail Thayer, director of the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation (which includes the Division), that \"if the law requires it, the [State] could restructure Mr. Kvorjak's job to enable him to work at home.\" Thayer did not state, however, that the resulting position would include all of a claims adjudicator's essential functions, and, indeed, she testified at her deposition that she did not, in fact, envision that such a restructuring would retain all of the important elements of appellant's job. The law does not require an employer to \"accommodate a disability by foregoing an essential function of the position or by reallocating essential functions to make other workers' jobs more onerous.\" Feliciano, 160 F.3d at 785; see also Phelps, 251 F.3d at 26; Laurin, 150 F.3d at 56, 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's other contentions regarding the State's evidence are no more forceful. He complains that numerous functions listed as essential in the State's summary judgment materials were both new to the case and peripheral to the claims adjudicator's job, and their legitimacy must be resolved by a fact finder. The simple response to the tardiness claim is that the advisor role derives directly from the list of duties in the Task Statement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> which was used as an exhibit before the MHRC. Although the Boyett affidavit spells out in detail for the first time the many ways in which a claims adjudicator is expected to perform the advisor function, the possibility that a particular advisory task is unimportant or reasonably could be performed at an individual's home does not undermine the State's position that the claims adjudicator's in-office role as educator/trainer/advisor is essential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant offers no evidence suggesting that, despite the written task statement and the departmental expectations outlined in the Boyett affidavit, the advisor function in actuality comprises an insignificant portion of a claims adjudicator's job. His own knowledge of the position is limited to his experience working in a field office and thus provides an insufficient basis to rebut Boyett's assertion that the advisor function became more important after the consolidation of services in call centers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Appellant could have, but did not, depose current claims adjudicators about their duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant tries to make much of the fact that two Department of Labor employees have been permitted to work at home. The evidence shows significantly distinguishable circumstances: (1) the employees, who both experienced allergic-type reactions to substances in their office building, are being permitted to work at home only until the Department is able to construct a \"clean room\" at the workplace; and (2) neither is a claims adjudicator -- one's job is to organize files and the other is a tax specialist whose primary duty is to call employers who owe unemployment taxes. The fact that these employees work at home lends no support to appellant's contention that he could perform the essential functions of a claims adjudicator at home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record demonstrates without meaningful dispute that the essential functions of a claims adjudicator cannot be performed at an individual employee's home. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment for defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellant brought suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12213, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, and the Maine Human Rights Act (\"MHRA\"), 5 M.R.S.A. &#167;&#167; 4551-4633.

Thus, while we explicitly refer to the ADA because it has been the primary focus in the litigation to this point, and because of the applicability of its accompanying body of recent case law, our discussion here in fact applies solely to the Rehabilitation Act and MHRA claims.</p>\n        <p>Similarly for the sake of simplicity, we generally refer to defendants collectively as \"the State,\" although in addition to the State itself, appellant sued the Maine Department of Labor, and the department's commissioner, Valerie Landry.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Portions of this background are drawn almost verbatim from the well stated \"Facts\" section of the magistrate judge's opinion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Appellant initially wrote to the Department of Labor that, in addition to working at home, he was \"willing to consider any reasonable accommodations which will result in my continued employment,\" but the record reflects that he later rejected any option other than at-home work.

It was at that time, he said, \"when I made the firm determination that I would not work again unless it was in the home.\" Dr. Stephan Bamberger testified in deposition that a ten-minute commute - as appellant had had in Rockland - would not significantly affect the longevity of his working life, but that working in an office would pose difficulties because of his pain and incontinence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> For example, the State raised concerns about confidentiality and expense related to at-home work, but did not fully explore them with appellant or his counsel. Similarly, the State internally concluded before rejecting appellant's request to work at home that the essential functions of a claims adjudicator could not be performed at home, but it did not address that issue in its communications with appellant or his counsel until much later.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We recognize that at least some of appellant's silence stemmed from a desire to retain a level of privacy concerning his physical difficulties.

An at-home employee thus would have to rely on others to find, copy, and mail needed documents. As of December 1999, the Division's call centers were supported by only two clerical staff people. Laura Boyett, director of the Division, reported in an affidavit that both individuals are \"fully occupied with their present duties and do not have time to take on additional duties.\" See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A) (an employer need not provide an accommodation that would impose \"an undue hardship\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Boyett stated that \"[t]he call center environment provides an ability to offer staff training more frequently because each center has the capability of covering for another center while training is taking place. Staff training is now given high priority because one of the goals of the call center transition is to improve consistency in procedures and application of law throughout the state.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> We have focused on the claims adjudicator's duties as advisor to other call center staff because that role, by itself, demonstrates that the position cannot be performed at home. Other aspects of the advisor function - specifically, providing explanations and information to the public and to those using the unemployment compensation system - might be feasible in a home if the technology cost were not prohibitive. There is much discussion in the record about the possibility of connecting appellant's home phone to the Division's call center, but we need not explore that issue because of our conclusion that the record otherwise unequivocally proves that a claims adjudicator must work at the center to perform essential aspects of the advisor function.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> Item 6 on the list of essential functions, see note 14 supra, refers to the assistance provided by claims adjudicators to other claims staff members.

The problem with this case is that the State had made up its mind to reject Kvorjak's request to work at home without even considering whether a reasonable accommodation could be worked out. Thus, in responding to his initial request, the State rejected it on the ground that \"commuting to the job is not a covered activity under ADA.\" It did not consider any of Kvorjak's medical information (nor did it request any), and it did not conduct a cost assessment of his working from home. Instead, the State advised Kvorjak's counsel that it was not interested in having him work at home, and it is clear from the record that no accommodation was ever considered. Until the commencement of the litigation, the State adhered to this initial position. It was only when the State filed its motion for summary judgment that it presented, by way of the affidavit of Laura Boyett, a litany of reasons why Kvorjak would not be able to perform the essential functions of his job at home. This court has said that \"[a]n employee's request for a reasonable accommodation requires a great deal of communication between the employee and employer . . . both parties bear responsibility for determining what accommodation is necessary.\" Criado v.

Cf. Soto-Casio v. Fed. Express Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198055\"><a href=\"/opinion/198055/soto-ocasio-v-federal-express/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1998). The State does have a duty to \"mak[e] reasonable accommodations . . . unless [it] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of [its] business.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12112(b)(5)(A). Kvorjak's supervisor's testimony on deposition, that if the law required his job could be restructured to enable him to work at home and confidentiality concerns and connections with the call center could be resolved, raises a triable issue. Moreover, the State's adamant refusal from the outset to consider and discuss accommodation raises a triable issue as to whether it complied with its obligation under the ADA. What the State did here is precisely what the employer did in Garcia-Ayala: \"It simply rejected the request for the accommodation without further discussion and it did so without pointing to any facts making the accommodation harmful to its business needs.\" Garcia-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 648 n.12.
