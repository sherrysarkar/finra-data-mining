This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Felix  DeWeldon   is  a  well-known  sculptor  and  art\r\n\ncollector.   He  owned three  paintings  valued at  $26,000.   He\r\n\ndisplayed  these, and  other collection-grade  paintings, on  the\r\n\nwalls of  his home--Beacon  Rock, in Newport,  Rhode Island.   He\r\n\ndeclared  bankruptcy in 1991.   In 1992, Deweldon, Ltd. purchased\r\n\nall  Felix  DeWeldon's  personal  property  from  the  bankruptcy\r\n\ntrustee.   In  1993,  Nancy  Wardell,  the  sole  shareholder  of\r\n\nDeWeldon, Ltd.,  sold all her  DeWeldon, Ltd. stock to  the Byron\r\n\nPreservation Trust, which  in turn sold Felix DeWeldon  an option\r\n\nto repurchase the  paintings and a contractual  right to continue\r\n\nto retain  possession of the paintings until  the option expired.\r\n\nAt all times, Felix DeWeldon continued to possess and display the\r\n\npaintings  at Beacon  Rock.   In 1994,  his son  Byron approached\r\n\nRobert McKean, an acquaintance, and  told him that his father was\r\n\ninterested  in selling some  of his paintings.  McKean viewed the\r\n\npaintings at Beacon Rock and subsequently purchased the paintings\r\n\nat issue for  $50,000.  DeWeldon, Ltd. sued in  district court to\r\n\nrecover the paintings.   The district court entered  judgment for\r\n\nMcKean.  For the following reasons, we affirm.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          We conclude that the evidence sufficiently  establishes\r\n\nthe following facts found by  the district court.  Felix DeWeldon\r\n\nwas a \"well-known artist\" and \"collector.\"   After DeWeldon, Ltd.\r\n\npurchased Felix DeWeldon's paintings from his  bankruptcy estate,\r\n\nFrederick Crevoiserat, director of DeWeldon, Ltd., entrusted  the\r\n\npaintings to Felix DeWeldon as custodian.  DeWeldon, Ltd. allowed\r\n\nFelix DeWeldon to maintain possession of the paintings; it put no\r\n\nsigns  on the  premises,  nor  tags or  labels  on the  paintings\r\n\nthemselves to  indicate that Felix  DeWeldon no longer  owned the\r\n\npaintings.  The paintings remained on the walls of Beacon Rock.\r\n\n          McKean  viewed the  paintings on  the  walls at  Beacon\r\n\nRock.  The only  tags on the back of the  paintings were those of\r\n\nChristie's--the auction house.1   McKean inquired  of Christie's,\r\n\nand was informed that the paintings  had not sold at auction  and\r\n\nDeWeldon had  \"re-purchased\" them.2   McKean paid  more than  the\r\n\nappraised value  of the paintings  and Felix DeWeldon gave  him a\r\n\nbill of sale.\r\n\n          In June of 1993, a  Mr. Panteleakis recorded a UCC lien\r\n\nin  Newport, Rhode  Island  claiming a  security interest  in the\r\n\npaintings.3  The  lien had been granted by DeWeldon,  Ltd. of 646\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  At some time prior to the filing of bankruptcy, Felix DeWeldon\r\nhad commissioned Christie's to auction the paintings.\r\n\n2   This term of  art in the trade  means that DeWeldon had taken\r\nthe paintings back when they did not sell at auction.\r\n\n3  Apparently  Mr. Panteleakis had underwritten  DeWeldon, Ltd.'s\r\npurchase of DeWeldon's personal property.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nBellevue Ave, not by Felix  DeWeldon of 145 Harrison Ave.   There\r\n\nis  no  evidence  of  any  recorded  interest  in the  paintings,\r\n\nsecurity or otherwise, having been granted by Felix DeWeldon.\r\n\n          In December of 1993, DeWeldon, Ltd. sued Felix DeWeldon\r\n\nseeking possession  of the  paintings.   The  Rhode Island  court\r\n\ndenied  the  relief   based  upon  Felix  DeWeldon's   option  to\r\n\nrepurchase and right  of possession, but enjoined  Felix DeWeldon\r\n\nfrom transferring or removing the paintings from Beacon Rock.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          The  district court  concluded  from  these facts  that\r\n\nDeWeldon,  Ltd.  is equitably  estopped  from  asserting, against\r\n\nMcKean, its  ownership interest  in the paintings.   We  need not\r\n\nreview  this holding,  as we  conclude that  the judgment  of the\r\n\ndistrict court may be affirmed on other grounds under the laws of\r\n\nRhode Island.4\r\n\n          As  a general rule,  a seller cannot  pass better title\r\n\nthan he has  himself.  Nevertheless, the  Uniform Commercial Code\r\n\n(UCC)  as adopted  by Rhode  Island  provides that  an owner  who\r\n\nentrusts  items to a  merchant who  deals in  goods of  that kind\r\n\ngives him or her power to transfer all rights of the entruster to\r\n\na buyer in the ordinary course of business.  R.I. Gen. Laws   6A-\r\n\n2-403(2).5     \"'Entrusting'  includes   any  delivery  and   any\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   We may  affirm the judgment  on any  independently sufficient\r\nground  established by the record of  the case.  Ticketmaster-New\r                                                                           \r\nYork, Inc.  v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201,  204 (1st Cir. 1994); Inmates\r                                                                           \r\nof Suffolk County Jail v. Rufo, 12 F.3d 286, 291 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                        \r\n\n5  Rhode Island law applies to this diversity action.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nacquiescence  in  retention  of  possession,  regardless  of  any\r\n\ncondition  expressed between  the  parties  to  the  delivery  or\r\n\nacquiescence and  regardless of  whether the  procurement of  the\r\n\nentrusting or the possessor's disposition of the  goods have been\r\n\nsuch as to  be larcenous under the criminal law.\"  R.I. Gen. Laws\r\n\n  6A-2-403(3).   Under  this provision, a  buyer in  the ordinary\r\n\ncourse of business  will prevail  over the claim  of a party  who\r\n\nentrusted such items to the merchant.  In order for  McKean to be\r\n\nprotected by    6A-2-403, DeWeldon, Ltd. must  have allowed Felix\r\n\nDeWeldon to retain possession of the paintings.  McKean must have\r\n\nbought the paintings in the ordinary course of business.  He must\r\n\nhave  given   value  for   the  paintings,   without  actual   or\r\n\nconstructive  notice of  DeWeldon Ltd.'s  claim  of ownership  to\r\n\nthem.   Finally,  Felix DeWeldon  must  have been  a merchant  as\r\n\ndefined  by R.I.  Gen. Laws    6A-2-104.   Under this  section, a\r\n\nmerchant is one who  has special knowledge or skill and  deals in\r\n\ngoods of the kind  or \"otherwise by  his or her occupation  holds\r\n\nhim  or herself out as having knowledge  or skill peculiar to the\r\n\npractices or goods involved in the transaction. . . .\"  Id.\r                                                                     \r\n\n          Under the facts  found by the district  court, McKean's\r\n\npurchase  of  the  paintings  is  protected  by  the  entrustment\r\n\ndoctrine.  First, DeWeldon, Ltd. entrusted the paintings to Felix\r\n\nDeWeldon.    After  DeWeldon, Ltd.  purchased  the  paintings, it\r\n\nacquiesced  in  Felix  DeWeldon's retention  of  them.   Although\r\n\nDeWeldon, Ltd. made some late efforts to regain possession of the\r\n\npaintings, these efforts  were frustrated by its  own prior grant\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nto Felix  DeWeldon of an option and right of possession until the\r\n\nexpiration of the option.\r\n\n          Second, McKean was  a buyer in  the ordinary course  of\r\n\nbusiness.   Byron informed  McKean that Felix  DeWeldon wished to\r\n\nsell  some paintings.    The  paintings  were  hanging  in  Felix\r\n\nDeWeldon's  home when McKean viewed and subsequently bought them.\r\n\nHe knew that Felix  DeWeldon had sold paintings  out of his  home\r\n\nbefore.  McKean gave value for  the paintings.  In fact, he  paid\r\n\nmore than their appraised value.\r\n\n          McKean had no actual notice  that Felix DeWeldon was no\r\n\nlonger  the true  owner of  the  paintings.   DeWeldon, Ltd.  did\r\n\nnothing to  shield the paintings  in the cloak of  its ownership.\r\n\nIt did  not place  markings on the  paintings, as  Christie's had\r\n\nwhen the paintings were in its possession; it posted no notice of\r\n\nownership  by  or near  the  paintings;  it  failed to  post  the\r\n\ninjunction  it secured against transfer of the paintings by Felix\r\n\nDeWeldon; it  posted, but  then terminated,  a security  guard at\r\n\nDeWeldon's  residence  despite  such  a guard's  being  expressly\r\n\npermitted  in the  injunction;  it  posted  no  warnings  against\r\n\nremoval  of the  paintings from  the  residence.   There were  no\r\n\nmarkings on the paintings or  other notice that Felix DeWeldon no\r\n\nlonger owned the paintings.   The paintings were hanging in Felix\r\n\nDeWeldon's home.\r\n\n          Neither  did McKean  have  any  constructive notice  of\r\n\nanother's ownership interest in the paintings.  The lien recorded\r\n\nby Mr. Panteleakis  did not constitute such  notice because there\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nwas  no way  McKean could  have discovered  it upon  a reasonable\r\n\ninquiry.  It was not granted by Felix DeWeldon.\r\n\n          Third, under  the facts  of this  case, Felix  DeWeldon\r\n\nacted  as a  merchant  within  the meaning  of  the Rhode  Island\r\n\nCommercial  Code.    Under  the  Code,  \"merchant\"  is  given  an\r\n\nexpansive definition. Providence &amp; Worcester R.  Co. v. Sargent &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nGreenleaf, Inc., 802 F.  Supp. 680, 684 n.2  (D.R.I. 1992).   The\r                         \r\n\nCode provides that a merchant is \"one who . . . by his occupation\r\n\nholds himself  out as having  knowledge or skill peculiar  to the\r\n\npractices . . . involved in the transaction  . . . .\"   R.I. Gen.\r\n\nLaws    6A-2-104.  Comment  2 to this section notes that  \"almost\r\n\nevery  person in  business would,  therefore, be  deemed to  be a\r\n\n'merchant'.\"  Id.\r                           \r\n\n          The entrustment  provision of  the UCC  is designed  to\r\n\nenhance the reliability of commercial sales by merchants who deal\r\n\nin the kind of goods sold.  Porter v. Wertz, 421 N.E.2d 500 (N.Y.\r                                                     \r\n\n1981) (art  dealer is  a merchant when  dealing in  goods of  the\r\n\nkind--paintings).  It shifts  the risk of resale  to the one  who\r\n\nleaves his property with the merchant.  Id. at 500-01.

City\r                                              \r\n\n1967).\r\n\n          The  district court  found that  Felix  DeWeldon was  a\r\n\n\"well-known\" artist  whose work was  for sale commercially  and a\r\n\n\"collector.\"  There was art  work all over Felix DeWeldon's home.\r\n\nHe had  recently sold  paintings to a  European buyer.     By his\r\n\noccupation  he held  himself out  as having  knowledge and  skill\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\npeculiar  to art and the art trade.   McKean viewed him as an art\r\n\ndealer.\r\n\n          We conclude from  these facts that Felix DeWeldon was a\r\n\n\"merchant\" within the meaning of the entrustment provision of the\r\n\nUCC as adopted by the Rhode Island Commercial Code.\r\n\n          When  a person knowingly delivers his property into the\r\n\npossession  of a  merchant dealing  in goods  of that  kind, that\r\n\nperson assumes the  risk of the merchant's  acting unscrupulously\r\n\nby  selling   the  property  to  an  innocent   purchaser.    The\r\n\nentrustment provision places  the loss upon the  party who vested\r\n\nthe  merchant with  the  ability to  transfer  the property  with\r\n\napparent good title.  The entrustor in this case, DeWeldon, Ltd.,\r\n\ntook that risk and bears the consequences.\r\n\n                                V.\r\n\n          DeWeldon, Ltd. entrusted three paintings to the care of\r\n\nFelix DeWeldon.   Felix  DeWeldon was a  merchant who  bought and\r\n\nsold paintings.   Robert McKean  was a purchaser in  the ordinary\r\n\ncourse  of  business who  paid  value for  the  paintings without\r\n\nnotice of any  claim of ownership by  another.  Under the  law of\r\n\nRhode  Island, McKean  took good  title  to the  paintings.   The\r\n\njudgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                            affirmed\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n",

The paintings remained on the walls of Beacon Rock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKean viewed the paintings on the walls at Beacon Rock.  The only tags on the back of the paintings were those of Christie's--the auction house.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  McKean inquired of Christie's, and was informed that the paintings had not sold at auction and DeWeldon had \"re-purchased\" them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  McKean paid more than the appraised value of the paintings and Felix DeWeldon gave him a bill of sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June of 1993, a Mr. Panteleakis recorded a UCC lien in Newport, Rhode Island claiming a security interest in the paintings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The lien had been granted by DeWeldon, Ltd. of 646 Bellevue Ave, not by Felix DeWeldon of 145 Harrison Ave. There is no evidence of any recorded interest in the paintings, security or otherwise, having been granted by Felix DeWeldon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 1993, DeWeldon, Ltd. sued Felix DeWeldon seeking possession of the paintings.

Nevertheless, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted by Rhode Island provides that an owner who entrusts items to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him or her power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in the ordinary course of business. R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6A-2-403(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \" 'Entrusting' includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession, regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.\"  R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6A-2-403(3).  Under this provision, a buyer in the ordinary course of business will prevail over the claim of a party who entrusted such items to the merchant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for McKean to be protected by &#167; 6A-2-403, DeWeldon, Ltd. must have allowed Felix DeWeldon to retain possession of the paintings.  McKean must have bought the paintings in the ordinary course of business.  He must have given value for the paintings, without actual or constructive notice of DeWeldon Ltd.'s claim of ownership to them.  Finally, Felix DeWeldon must have been a merchant as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6A-2-104.  Under this section, a merchant is one who has special knowledge or skill and deals in goods of the kind or \"otherwise by his or her occupation holds him or herself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction....\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the facts found by the district court, McKean's purchase of the paintings is protected by the entrustment doctrine.  First, DeWeldon, Ltd. entrusted the paintings to Felix DeWeldon.  After DeWeldon, Ltd. purchased the paintings, it acquiesced in Felix DeWeldon's retention of them.  Although DeWeldon, Ltd. made some late efforts to regain possession of the paintings, these efforts were frustrated by its own prior grant to Felix DeWeldon of an option and right of possession until the expiration of the option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, McKean was a buyer in the ordinary course of business.  Byron informed McKean that Felix DeWeldon wished to sell some paintings.  The paintings were hanging in Felix DeWeldon's home when McKean viewed and subsequently bought them.  He knew that Felix DeWeldon had sold paintings out of his home before.  McKean gave value for the paintings.  In fact, he paid more than their appraised value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKean had no actual notice that Felix DeWeldon was no longer the true owner of the paintings.  DeWeldon, Ltd. did nothing to shield the paintings in the cloak of its ownership.  It did not place markings on the paintings, as Christie's had when the paintings were in its possession;  it posted no notice of ownership by or near the paintings;  it failed to post the injunction it secured against transfer of the paintings by Felix DeWeldon;  it posted, but then terminated, a security guard at DeWeldon's residence despite such a guard's being expressly permitted in the injunction;  it posted no warnings against removal of the paintings from the residence.  There were no markings on the paintings or other notice that Felix DeWeldon no longer owned the paintings.  The paintings were hanging in Felix DeWeldon's home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither did McKean have any constructive notice of another's ownership interest in the paintings.  The lien recorded by Mr. Panteleakis did not constitute such notice because there was no way McKean could have discovered it upon a reasonable inquiry.  It was not granted by Felix DeWeldon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, under the facts of this case, Felix DeWeldon acted as a merchant within the meaning of the Rhode Island Commercial Code.  Under the Code, \"merchant\" is given an expansive definition.  Providence &amp; Worcester R. Co. v. Sargent &amp; Greenleaf, Inc., 802 F.Supp. 680, 684 n. 2 (D.R.I.1992).  The Code provides that a merchant is \"one who ... by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices ... involved in the transaction....\"  R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 6A-2-104.  Comment 2 to this section notes that \"almost every person in business would, therefore, be deemed to be a 'merchant'.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entrustment provision of the UCC is designed to enhance the reliability of commercial sales by merchants who deal in the kind of goods sold.

He had recently sold paintings to a European buyer.  By his occupation he held himself out as having knowledge and skill peculiar to art and the art trade.  McKean viewed him as an art dealer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude from these facts that Felix DeWeldon was a \"merchant\" within the meaning of the entrustment provision of the UCC as adopted by the Rhode Island Commercial Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a person knowingly delivers his property into the possession of a merchant dealing in goods of that kind, that person assumes the risk of the merchant's acting unscrupulously by selling the property to an innocent purchaser.  The entrustment provision places the loss upon the party who vested the merchant with the ability to transfer the property with apparent good title.  The entrustor in this case, DeWeldon, Ltd., took that risk and bears the consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeWeldon, Ltd. entrusted three paintings to the care of Felix DeWeldon.  Felix DeWeldon was a merchant who bought and sold paintings.  Robert McKean was a purchaser in the ordinary course of business who paid value for the paintings without notice of any claim of ownership by another.  Under the law of Rhode Island, McKean took good title to the paintings.

He declared bankruptcy in 1991.  In 1992, DeWeldon, Ltd. purchased all Felix DeWeldon's personal property from the bankruptcy trustee.  In 1993, Nancy Wardell, the sole shareholder of DeWeldon, Ltd., sold all her DeWeldon, Ltd. stock to the Byron Preservation Trust, which in turn sold Felix DeWeldon an option to repurchase the paintings and a contractual right to continue to retain possession of the paintings until the option expired.  At all times, Felix DeWeldon continued to possess and display the paintings at Beacon Rock.  In 1994, his son Byron approached Robert McKean, an acquaintance, and told him that his father was interested in selling some of his paintings.  McKean viewed the paintings at Beacon Rock and subsequently purchased the paintings at issue for $50,000.  DeWeldon, Ltd. sued in district court to recover the paintings.
