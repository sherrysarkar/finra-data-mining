Peppe\r\n\npleaded guilty  to a three-count indictment  charging him and\r\n\nhis   codefendant,   Joseph   S.   Mongiello,   with   making\r\n\nextortionate extensions of credit  and using, and  conspiring\r\n\nto use, extortionate means to collect and attempt  to collect\r\n\nan  extension of credit.   The district court sentenced Peppe\r\n\nto  twenty-seven  months'  incarceration  followed  by  three\r\n\nyears' supervised  release, a  special assessment fee,  and a\r\n\n$10,000 fine.  Peppe  now appeals the imposition of  the fine\r\n\nand   a  condition   of  his  supervised   release  requiring\r\n\nprobation-office  approval prior  to  any  incurring  of  new\r\n\ncredit charges or opening of new credit lines.1\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n           Factual Background and Prior Proceedings\r                       Factual Background and Prior Proceedings\r                                                               \r\n\nA.  Offense Conduct\r                               \r\n\n          We  accept the facts of the offense as set forth in\r\n\nthe  unchallenged portions of the Presentence Report (\"PSR\").\r\n\nSee United States v. Grandmaison, No. 95-1674, slip op. at 2-\r                                            \r\n\n3 (1st Cir. Mar. 1, 1996).\r\n\n          In the  summer of 1993, Peppe  and Mongiello loaned\r\n\nto John Wiltshire,  a self-employed  contractor, $3,000  upon\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  At oral  argument before  this court, Peppe  withdrew his\r\nchallenge   to  the  court's   imposition  of  an  additional\r\ncondition of  supervised release: that Peppe  grant access to\r\nany and all financial  information requested by the probation\r\noffice.  Accordingly, we do not address this argument.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nwhich Wiltshire was  required to  pay 5%  interest per  week.\r\n\nWhen  Wiltshire was late  in making his  loan payments, Peppe\r\n\nand  Mongiello  would intimidate  him  and  his wife  through\r\n\nrepeated,   threatening  telephone  calls.    In  June  1994,\r\n\nWiltshire  temporarily  stopped  making  the  weekly interest\r\n\npayments because he  could no  longer afford them.   In  July\r\n\n1994,  Wiltshire  agreed  to  do some  construction  work  at\r\n\nPeppe's home in return for forgiveness of part of the debt.\r\n\n          On August 1, 1994, Wiltshire contacted  the Federal\r\n\nBureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") about his situation.  By that\r\n\ndate,  he had  paid about  $6,000 in  interest on  the $3,000\r\n\nloan.    As  part  of  the  FBI's  subsequent  investigation,\r\n\nWiltshire tape-recorded telephone conversations  and meetings\r\n\nwith   Peppe   and    Mongiello,   including    conversations\r\n\naccompanying five  additional payments on  the loan.   On one\r\n\nsuch  occasion,   Peppe  referred  to  his   \"cuff  list\"  of\r\n\ndelinquent loan-shark debtors to see how far behind Wiltshire\r\n\nwas.  In October 1994, Wiltshire told Peppe that he would not\r\n\nmake further payments on  the loan and indicated that  he had\r\n\nrelocated himself  and his  wife.  Upon  hearing this,  Peppe\r\n\nbecame very angry and  warned Wiltshire, \"I will catch  up to\r\n\nyou\" and \"I will find you.\"  At the time of his arrest, Peppe\r\n\nhad  in his  possession  a \"cuff  list\"  listing ten  debtors\r\n\noverdue in their payments.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nB.  The Plea Agreement\r                                  \r\n\n          The  parties  agreed  that  Peppe's  plea would  be\r\n\ntendered pursuant to Fed. R.  Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), and that,\r\n\n\"[w]ithin  the  maximum sentence\"  possible  under applicable\r\n\nlaw,  \"the  sentence  to  be   imposed  is  within  the  sole\r\n\ndiscretion of  the sentencing judge.\"   Peppe acknowledged in\r\n\nthe  plea agreement  that he  faced a  maximum penalty  of 20\r\n\nyears'  incarceration and a $250,000 fine on each count.  The\r\n\nagreement stated  that,  under the  United States  Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines, Peppe's Base Offense Level was 20 and the parties\r\n\nwould  recommend to  the  court a  three-level reduction  for\r\n\nPeppe's acceptance  of responsibility,  resulting in a  Total\r\n\nOffense Level of 17.\r\n\nC.  The Presentence Report\r                                      \r\n\n          In  the  PSR,  Peppe's  Total   Offense  Level  was\r\n\ncomputed at 17, his  Criminal History Category at I,  and the\r\n\napplicable  Guideline  imprisonment  range  was  found  to be\r\n\ntwenty-four to thirty months  followed by two to three  years\r\n\nof  supervised  release.   The fine  range was  determined at\r\n\n$5,000 to  $50,000, pursuant  to U.S.S.G.     5E1.2(c)(1) and\r\n\n(2).    While  the  government  contended  that  the  victim,\r\n\nWiltshire, was entitled to  restitution of the interest paid,\r\n\n$6,000, the PSR stated that the issue of granting restitution\r\n\nin  loan-sharking  cases  had  never been  addressed  in  the\r\n\nDistrict  of Massachusetts,  and  relayed the  matter to  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncourt.  Peppe  complained that  the government's  restitution\r\n\nfigure came only  from Wiltshire and was exaggerated,  but he\r\n\ndid  not offer  his  own calculation  and  did not  otherwise\r\n\nobject to that portion of the PSR.\r\n\n          The  PSR  also  included  the  following additional\r\n\nfacts to which  neither party  objected.  Peppe  is a  forty-\r\n\nyear-old high  school graduate with previous  work experience\r\n\nas  a  bartender,  temporary  postal  employee, greyhound-dog\r\n\nowner  and racer,  and employee  at his father's  smoke shop.\r\n\nPeppe and his wife, Jayne Zannino Peppe, have three children,\r\n\nthe  youngest of whom  may have a  serious medical condition.\r\n\nPeppe's wife manages the care of the family and home, working\r\n\npart-time  as  a real  estate  agent.   Peppe's  assets total\r\n\n$24,056.50,   comprised  of,   inter  alia,   bank  accounts,\r                                                      \r\n\nsecurities, life insurance, real estate,  and an automobile.2\r\n\nHis  liabilities total  $50,000, made  up of  loans  from his\r\n\nbrothers  for attorney fees incurred in his defense.  The PSR\r\n\nreports that Peppe has a negative net worth of $25,943.50 and\r\n\na monthly negative cash flow of $193.\r\n\nD.  The Sentencing Hearing\r                                      \r\n\n          The district court adopted the factual findings and\r\n\nSentencing Guideline  applications set forth in the  PSR.  At\r\n\nthe sentencing  hearing,  the district  court  confirmed  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  As of the time of the balance sheet set forth in the PSR,\r\nPeppe no longer owned greyhounds.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nPSR's calculation of Total Offense Level and Guideline ranges\r\n\nfor  the   fine  and  imprisonment  term.     The  government\r\n\nrecommended thirty  months' incarceration, a  fine of  $5,000\r\n\nand  an order of restitution of $6,000.  Peppe responded that\r\n\nrestitution  should  not  be  an  issue  in  sentencing,  and\r\n\nrequested  a hearing should it become a factor.  With respect\r\n\nto restitution, the court stated:\r\n\n          [T]he  record,  frankly,  is   not  clear\r\n          enough   for  me   to  do   anything  but\r\n          speculate concerning the proper  level of\r\n          restitution.    I  decline  to  take  any\r\n          further time before  reaching a  sentence\r\n          in  this case  to  attempt  to fashion  a\r\n          restitutionary  remedy,  particularly  in\r\n          light  of  the  fact  that   there  is  a\r\n          potential for a fine.   And I will impose\r\n          a fine in this case.\r\n\n          The district court  sentenced Peppe to twenty-seven\r\n\nmonths'  imprisonment   on   each   count,   to   be   served\r\n\nconcurrently, followed  by three years of supervised release.\r\n\nThe  court  further imposed  a  $10,000  fine, with  interest\r\n\nwaived,  to  be paid  in installments.    In addition  to the\r\n\nstandard conditions of supervised release,  the court ordered\r\n\nthat Peppe  could  not  \"incur  new credit  charges  or  open\r\n\nadditional  lines of  credit  without prior  approval of  the\r\n\nprobation  officer\"   who,   in   turn,   would   take   into\r\n\nconsideration  Peppe's  compliance   with  the  fine  payment\r\n\nschedule.  At the  conclusion of the sentencing  hearing, the\r\n\ncourt opined:\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          I think I needn't say very much about the\r\n          reasons for  the sentence.   I think  Mr.\r\n          Pep[p]e  understands that this  is one of\r\n          the costs of doing  this kind of business\r\n          and that  there is imposed  in connection\r\n          with those costs a  fine component, and a\r\n          component  [of]  being  taken  away  from\r\n          loved ones at critical times.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Peppe now  argues that the court  erred by imposing\r\n\nthe $10,000  fine and by  prohibiting him from  incurring new\r\n\ncredit charges or opening  additional lines of credit without\r\n\nprior approval  of the  probation office.   Neither challenge\r\n\nwas  raised before  the  sentencing judge,  however, and,  as\r\n\nPeppe concedes, our review  is for plain error only.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Carrozza, 4  F.3d 70, 86-87 (1st Cir.  1993), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 114 S. Ct. 1644 (1994).\r                  \r\n\nA.  Imposition of $10,000 Fine\r                                          \r\n\n          Peppe contends that the  court did not consider his\r\n\nfinancial  resources  and earning  ability  in assessing  the\r\n\n$10,000 fine.  He  points out that his  financial information\r\n\nin the record  is undisputed, and argues that  it establishes\r\n\nboth  his  current   inability  to  pay  the   fine  and  the\r\n\nunlikelihood that  he will be able  to pay it in  the future.\r\n\nPeppe also suggests that  the fine contained a \"restitutional\r\n\ncomponent,\" noting  that its amount  reflects an  approximate\r\n\ncombination of  the government's  recommendation  for a  fine\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n($5,000) and restitution ($6,000), and that the court did not\r\n\nconsider  the  requisite  factors  to  support a  restitution\r\n\nremedy.    He maintains  that,  in  addition to  waiving  the\r\n\ninterest on the fine,  the court should also have  waived the\r\n\nfine  itself   and  imposed  alternative  sanctions  such  as\r\n\ncommunity service.\r\n\n          When imposing a fine and its conditions, a district\r\n\ncourt must  consider, inter alia, \"any  evidence presented as\r                                            \r\n\nto  the defendant's  ability to  pay the fine  (including the\r\n\nability to pay over a period of time) in light of his earning\r\n\ncapacity and  financial resources\"  and \"the burden  that the\r\n\nfine places on  the defendant and his  dependents relative to\r\n\nalternative punishments.\"   U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(d); see  also 18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.    3572(a).    The   defendant  bears  the  burden  of\r\n\ndemonstrating that his case warrants an exception to the rule\r\n\nthat a fine  be imposed.  United  States v. Savoie,  985 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n612,  620 (1st  Cir. 1993);  U.S.S.G.   5E1.2(a)  (\"The court\r\n\nshall  impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant\r\n\nestablishes that he  is unable  to pay and  is not likely  to\r\n\nbecome  able to pay any  fine\").  Moreover,  a district court\r\n\nneed  not  make  express  findings  regarding  a  defendant's\r\n\nfinancial condition  so long as the record  is sufficient for\r\n\nadequate appellate review.

The court's  consideration  of Peppe's  financial\r\n\ncondition  is evident in its  waiver of interest  on the fine\r\n\nand written order  stating that it  \"has determined that  the\r\n\ndefendant  does  not  have  the  ability  to  pay  interest.\"\r\n\nIndeed,  in choosing $10,000, the  court chose a  fine at the\r\n\nlower end of the applicable $5,000 to $50,000 range.\r\n\n          Second, although it is undisputed that Peppe's  net\r\n\nworth and monthly cash  flow are negative, these facts  alone\r\n\ndo  not compel  the  conclusion that  a  fine should  not  be\r\n\nimposed.   Rather, it was Peppe's burden to establish that he\r\n\nwas  not able to pay  the fine, with  or without a reasonable\r\n\ninstallment schedule.  At no time did Peppe offer evidence to\r\n\nestablish his inability to pay, and his inability to pay does\r\n\nnot  follow inexorably  from the  facts in  the record.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Olivier-Diaz,  13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st  Cir. 1993)\r                                         \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n(noting that plain  error will not  be found where  defendant\r\n\nasserts a  fact that he failed to ask the sentencing court to\r\n\nfind, \"unless  the desired  factual finding  is the  only one\r\n\nrationally  supported by the record below.\").  Interestingly,\r\n\nall of Peppe's  debt is owed to family members who funded his\r\n\ndefense costs.   Further, Peppe  does not address  his future\r\n\nability to pay the fine, and given his age, good health,  and\r\n\npast  employment  experience,  he  cannot  complain  in  this\r\n\nregard.\r\n\n          Finally,  Peppe contends  that the  court fashioned\r\n\nthe   fine  to   include  an   impermissible  \"restitutionary\r\n\ncomponent.\"  This argument lacks merit.  The court explicitly\r\n\nstated  that   a  restitutionary   remedy  would   be  purely\r\n\nspeculative, and  simply declined  to take  that route.   The\r\n\ncourt did  not express the  desire to compensate  the victim,\r\n\nWiltshire;  rather, it  expressed the  goal to  punish Peppe.\r\n\nAccordingly, the court imposed the  fine in an amount  higher\r\n\nthan recommended  by the government,  but still at  the lower\r\n\nend of the Guideline  range.  The record shows that Peppe had\r\n\nample  notice  of  both the  potential  for  a  fine and  the\r\n\napplicable fine range, and never claimed the inability to pay\r\n\nany amount.\r\n\n          We find no error -- certainly no plain, or obvious,\r\n\nerror  --  in  imposing  the  $10,000  fine.     We  decline,\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ntherefore, to order any relief sought  by Peppe regarding the\r\n\nfine.\r\n\nB.  Probation Office Approval Prior to Obtaining New Credit\r                                                                       \r\n\n          Peppe  argues  that   requiring  probation   office\r\n\napproval  prior  to  his  incurring  new  credit  charges  or\r\n\nobtaining  additional  lines  of  credit  is  not  reasonably\r\n\nrelated  to  his  offense and  constitutes  an  impermissible\r\n\noccupational restriction that inhibits his  pursuit of lawful\r\n\nbusiness  activity.    He   also  contends  that,  under  the\r\n\nGuidelines, the only purpose for this  condition is to ensure\r\n\ncompliance with a fine payment schedule; accordingly, he asks\r\n\nthis  court  to modify  the  condition  to resemble  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  5E1.2(g).\r\n\n          A  district   court  may  impose  a   condition  of\r\n\nsupervised  release  that  is  \"reasonably related\"  to:  the\r\n\ndefendant's offense, history,  and characteristics; the  need\r\n\nfor   deterrence  from   further  criminal   conduct;  public\r\n\nprotection;  and  effective  correctional  treatment  of  the\r\n\ndefendant.   U.S.S.G.   5D1.3(b);  see also United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nThurlow, 44 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 115 S. Ct.\r                                                             \r\n\n1987   (1995).     Peppe's  offense   conduct  involved   the\r\n\nextortionate  extension  of  credit.   His  \"cuff  lists\"  of\r\n\ndelinquent  loan-shark  debtors,  evidenced  in  the  record,\r\n\nsuggest  that  his  extortionate  lending  activity  was  not\r\n\nlimited to  the identified victim, Wiltshire.   The condition\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nof  prescreening  new credit  charges and  credit lines  is a\r\n\nreasonable  information-gathering  device  for the  probation\r\n\noffice to  monitor Peppe's use  of money; when  Peppe desires\r\n\nnew  credit, the  probation  office  may  inquire as  to  its\r\n\npurpose and planned disbursement.   Moreover, as the district\r\n\ncourt  indicated at  sentencing, the  probation office  could\r\n\nalso use that opportunity  to monitor Peppe's compliance with\r\n\nthe fine  payment schedule.   Therefore, the  condition meets\r\n\nthe  requirements  of    5D1.3(b)  because  it is  reasonably\r\n\nrelated to  Peppe's offense, preventing  his participation in\r\n\nfurther extortionate lending, and ensuring his payment of the\r\n\nfine.\r\n\n          Peppe suggests that  the credit condition  inhibits\r\n\nhis ability to work or  engage in lawful business activities,\r\n\nin derogation of  the requirements  of U.S.S.G.    5F1.5(a).3\r\n\nWe disagree.  First,   5F1.5(a) is inapplicable because Peppe\r\n\nfails  to  explain  how  the court's  condition  affects  his\r\n\nparticipation  in  a   \"specified  occupation,  business,  or\r                                             \r\n\nprofession.\"  Id. (emphasis  added).  Even assuming it  is an\r                             \r\n\n\"occupational restriction\" within the  meaning of   5F1.5, it\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  U.S.S.G.    5F1.5(a) provides  that  a court  may bar  or\r\nlimit a defendant's participation in a \"specified occupation,\r\nbusiness,  or  profession\"   if  it   determines  that   such\r\nparticipation bears a \"reasonably direct relationship\" to the\r\nrelevant offense conduct, and the restriction  \"is reasonably\r\nnecessary to  protect the public  because there is  reason to\r\nbelieve  that, absent  such  restriction, the  defendant will\r\ncontinue to engage in [similar unlawful conduct].\"\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nis appropriate  for many of  the same  reasons that  it is  a\r\n\nproper condition of supervised release under   5D1.3(b).  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nsupra  note 3  (noting  criteria considered  in occupational-\r                 \r\n\nrestriction  condition).  Second, the condition requires only\r\n\nprior approval of the probation office; it is not an absolute\r\n\nbar to incurring credit charges or obtaining new  credit, and\r\n\nit  applies only for the  duration of the supervised release.\r\n\nThus, we do not  see, and Peppe has  not explained, how  this\r\n\ncondition   impermissibly   restricts  his   lawful  business\r\n\nactivities.  \r\n\n          Finally, we  find  Peppe's argument  that  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  5E1.2(g)  prohibits  the  condition   in  his  case  to  be\r\n\ndisingenuous.   See  U.S.S.G.    5E1.2(g)  (providing that  a\r                               \r\n\ndistrict  court  \"may  impose  a  condition  prohibiting  the\r                                                                    \r\n\ndefendant  from  incurring  new  credit  charges  or  opening\r\n\nadditional lines of  credit unless he  is in compliance  with\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe payment schedule\") (emphasis  added).  Here, the district\r                                \r\n\ncourt did not \"prohibit\" Peppe from obtaining credit, it only\r\n\nrequired  prior   approval.    Further,  simply  because  the\r\n\nGuidelines permit the condition in the circumstance reflected\r\n\nin    5E1.2(g) does not mean that a court cannot employ it in\r\n\nother cases under   5D1.3(b), the provision generally guiding\r\n\nconditions  of supervised  release.   Finally, we  decline to\r\n\nmodify the  credit conditions  imposed on Peppe  to \"comport\"\r\n\n(as  Peppe puts it) with  section 5E1.2(g), which would allow\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nPeppe to forego  credit prescreening as  long as he  complied\r\n\nwith  the payment schedule.   That condition is  not what the\r\n\ndistrict court deemed appropriate in its carefully  fashioned\r\n\nsentence,  and we discern no  reason or basis  to disturb the\r\n\ncourt's decision.\r\n\n          The  district court  did  not err  in imposing  the\r\n\ncondition that Peppe obtain prior approval from the probation\r\n\noffice for new credit charges or lines of credit.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          Nothing  more  need be  said.    For the  foregoing\r\n\nreasons,  all of  Peppe's  challenges on  appeal are  without\r\n\nmerit.

Peppe pleaded guilty to a three-count indictment charging him and his codefendant, Joseph S. Mongiello, with making extortionate extensions of credit and using, and conspiring to use, extortionate means to collect and attempt to collect an extension of credit.   The district court sentenced Peppe to twenty-seven months' incarceration followed by three years' supervised release, a special assessment fee, and a $10,000 fine.   Peppe now appeals the imposition of the fine and a condition of his supervised release requiring probation-office approval prior to any incurring of new credit charges or opening of new credit lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Factual Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <p>A. Offense Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We accept the facts of the offense as set forth in the unchallenged portions of the Presentence Report (\"PSR\").   See United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 557-558 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1993, Peppe and Mongiello loaned to John Wiltshire, a self-employed contractor, $3,000 upon which Wiltshire was required to pay 5% interest per week.   When Wiltshire was late in making his loan payments, Peppe and Mongiello would intimidate him and his wife through repeated, threatening telephone calls.   In June 1994, Wiltshire temporarily stopped making the weekly interest payments because he could no longer afford them.   In July 1994, Wiltshire agreed to do some construction work at Peppe's home in return for forgiveness of part of the debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 1994, Wiltshire contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") about his situation.   By that date, he had paid about $6,000 in interest on the $3,000 loan.   As part of the FBI's subsequent investigation, Wiltshire tape-recorded telephone conversations and meetings with Peppe and Mongiello, including conversations accompanying five additional payments on the loan.   On one such occasion, Peppe referred to his \"cuff list\" of delinquent loan-shark debtors to see how far behind Wiltshire was.   In October 1994, Wiltshire told Peppe that he would not make further payments on the loan and indicated that he had relocated himself and his wife.   Upon hearing this, Peppe became very angry and warned Wiltshire, \"I will catch up to you\" and \"I will find you.\"   At the time of his arrest, Peppe had in his possession a \"cuff list\" listing ten debtors overdue in their payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agreed that Peppe's plea would be tendered pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B), and that, \"[w]ithin the maximum sentence\" possible under applicable law, \"the sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion of the sentencing judge.\"   Peppe acknowledged in the plea agreement that he faced a maximum penalty of 20 years' incarceration and a $250,000 fine on each count.   The agreement stated that, under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, Peppe's Base Offense Level was 20 and the parties would recommend to the court a three-level reduction for Peppe's acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a Total Offense Level of 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Presentence Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the PSR, Peppe's Total Offense Level was computed at 17, his Criminal History Category at I, and the applicable Guideline imprisonment range was found to be twenty-four to thirty months followed by two to three years of supervised release.   The fine range was determined at $5,000 to $50,000, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5E1.2(c)(1) and (2).   While the government contended that the victim, Wiltshire, was entitled to restitution of the interest paid, $6,000, the PSR stated that the issue of granting restitution in loan-sharking cases had never been addressed in the District of Massachusetts, and relayed the matter to the court.   Peppe complained that the government's restitution figure came only from Wiltshire and was exaggerated, but he did not offer his own calculation and did not otherwise object to that portion of the PSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR also included the following additional facts to which neither party objected.   Peppe is a forty-year-old high school graduate with previous work experience as a bartender, temporary postal employee, greyhound-dog owner and racer, and employee at his father's smoke shop.   Peppe and his wife, Jayne Zannino Peppe, have three children, the youngest of whom may have a serious medical condition.   Peppe's wife manages the care of the family and home, working part-time as a real estate agent.   Peppe's assets total $24,056.50, comprised of, inter alia, bank accounts, securities, life insurance, real estate, and an automobile.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His liabilities total $50,000, made up of loans from his brothers for attorney fees incurred in his defense.   The PSR reports that Peppe has a negative net worth of $25,943.50 and a monthly negative cash flow of $193.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Sentencing Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the factual findings and Sentencing Guideline applications set forth in the PSR.   At the sentencing hearing, the district court confirmed the PSR's calculation of Total Offense Level and Guideline ranges for the fine and imprisonment term.   The government recommended thirty months' incarceration, a fine of $5,000 and an order of restitution of $6,000.   Peppe responded that restitution should not be an issue in sentencing, and requested a hearing should it become a factor.   With respect to restitution, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>[T]he record, frankly, is not clear enough for me to do anything but speculate concerning the proper level of restitution.   I decline to take any further time before reaching a sentence in this case to attempt to fashion a restitutionary remedy, particularly in light of the fact that there is a potential for a fine.   And I will impose a fine in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Peppe to twenty-seven months' imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release.   The court further imposed a $10,000 fine, with interest waived, to be paid in installments.   In addition to the standard conditions of supervised release, the court ordered that Peppe could not \"incur new credit charges or open additional lines of credit without prior approval of the probation officer\" who, in turn, would take into consideration Peppe's compliance with the fine payment schedule.   At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the court opined:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>I think I needn't say very much about the reasons for the sentence.   I think Mr. Pep[p]e understands that this is one of the costs of doing this kind of business and that there is imposed in connection with those costs a fine component, and a component [of] being taken away from loved ones at critical times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peppe now argues that the court erred by imposing the $10,000 fine and by prohibiting him from incurring new credit charges or opening additional lines of credit without prior approval of the probation office.   Neither challenge was raised before the sentencing judge, however, and, as Peppe concedes, our review is for plain error only.  United States v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 86-87 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1644, 128 L.Ed.2d 365 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Imposition of $10,000 Fine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peppe contends that the court did not consider his financial resources and earning ability in assessing the $10,000 fine.   He points out that his financial information in the record is undisputed, and argues that it establishes both his current inability to pay the fine and the unlikelihood that he will be able to pay it in the future.   Peppe also suggests that the fine contained a \"restitutional component,\" noting that its amount reflects an approximate combination of the government's recommendation for a fine ($5,000) and restitution ($6,000), and that the court did not consider the requisite factors to support a restitution remedy.   He maintains that, in addition to waiving the interest on the fine, the court should also have waived the fine itself and imposed alternative sanctions such as community service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When imposing a fine and its conditions, a district court must consider, inter alia, \"any evidence presented as to the defendant's ability to pay the fine (including the ability to pay over a period of time) in light of his earning capacity and financial resources\" and \"the burden that the fine places on the defendant and his dependents relative to alternative punishments.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(d);  see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(a).   The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that his case warrants an exception to the rule that a fine be imposed.  United States v.

Moreover, a district court need not make express findings regarding a defendant's financial condition so long as the record is sufficient for adequate appellate review.  Savoie, 985 F.2d at 620 (citing United States v. Wilfred Am.  Educ. Corp., 953 F.2d 717, 719-20 (1st Cir.1992)).   When a challenge to the imposition of a fine is fully preserved for appellate review, we review for abuse of discretion.  Savoie, 985 F.2d at 620.   But here, because Peppe did not object below, we review for plain error.  Carrozza, 4 F.3d at 86-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we do not agree with Peppe that the court failed to consider his financial condition when imposing the fine.   The PSR, adopted by the district court, detailed Peppe's assets, liabilities, and monthly cash flow.  Wilfred Am.  Educ. Corp., 953 F.2d at 719-20 (reviewing court will not presume that the court below ignored relevant evidence in the record).   The court's consideration of Peppe's financial condition is evident in its waiver of interest on the fine and written order stating that it \"has determined that the defendant does not have the ability to pay interest.\"   Indeed, in choosing $10,000, the court chose a fine at the lower end of the applicable $5,000 to $50,000 range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, although it is undisputed that Peppe's net worth and monthly cash flow are negative, these facts alone do not compel the conclusion that a fine should not be imposed.   Rather, it was Peppe's burden to establish that he was not able to pay the fine, with or without a reasonable installment schedule.   At no time did Peppe offer evidence to establish his inability to pay, and his inability to pay does not follow inexorably from the facts in the record.   See United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that plain error will not be found where defendant asserts a fact that he failed to ask the sentencing court to find, \"unless the desired factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the record below.\").   Interestingly, all of Peppe's debt is owed to family members who funded his defense costs.   Further, Peppe does not address his future ability to pay the fine, and given his age, good health, and past employment experience, he cannot complain in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Peppe contends that the court fashioned the fine to include an impermissible \"restitutionary component.\"   This argument lacks merit.   The court explicitly stated that a restitutionary remedy would be purely speculative, and simply declined to take that route.   The court did not express the desire to compensate the victim, Wiltshire;  rather, it expressed the goal to punish Peppe.   Accordingly, the court imposed the fine in an amount higher than recommended by the government, but still at the lower end of the Guideline range.   The record shows that Peppe had ample notice of both the potential for a fine and the applicable fine range, and never claimed the inability to pay any amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error--certainly no plain, or obvious, error--in imposing the $10,000 fine.   We decline, therefore, to order any relief sought by Peppe regarding the fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>B. Probation Office Approval Prior to Obtaining New Credit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peppe argues that requiring probation office approval prior to his incurring new credit charges or obtaining additional lines of credit is not reasonably related to his offense and constitutes an impermissible occupational restriction that inhibits his pursuit of lawful business activity.   He also contends that, under the Guidelines, the only purpose for this condition is to ensure compliance with a fine payment schedule;  accordingly, he asks this court to modify the condition to resemble U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may impose a condition of supervised release that is \"reasonably related\" to:  the defendant's offense, history, and characteristics;  the need for deterrence from further criminal conduct;  public protection;  and effective correctional treatment of the defendant.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b);  see also United States v. Thurlow, 44 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct.1987, 131 L.Ed.2d 874 (1995).   Peppe's offense conduct involved the extortionate extension of credit.   His \"cuff lists\" of delinquent loan-shark debtors, evidenced in the record, suggest that his extortionate lending activity was not limited to the identified victim, Wiltshire.   The condition of prescreening new credit charges and credit lines is a reasonable information-gathering device for the probation office to monitor Peppe's use of money;  when Peppe desires new credit, the probation office may inquire as to its purpose and planned disbursement.   Moreover, as the district court indicated at sentencing, the probation office could also use that opportunity to monitor Peppe's compliance with the fine payment schedule.   Therefore, the condition meets the requirements of &#167; 5D1.3(b) because it is reasonably related to Peppe's offense, preventing his participation in further extortionate lending, and ensuring his payment of the fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peppe suggests that the credit condition inhibits his ability to work or engage in lawful business activities, in derogation of the requirements of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5F1.5(a).<sup>3</sup>  We disagree.   First, &#167; 5F1.5(a) is inapplicable because Peppe fails to explain how the court's condition affects his participation in a \"specified occupation, business, or profession.\"   Id. (emphasis added).   Even assuming it is an \"occupational restriction\" within the meaning of &#167; 5F1.5, it is appropriate for many of the same reasons that it is a proper condition of supervised release under &#167; 5D1.3(b).   See supra note 3 (noting criteria considered in occupational-restriction condition).   Second, the condition requires only prior approval of the probation office;  it is not an absolute bar to incurring credit charges or obtaining new credit, and it applies only for the duration of the supervised release.   Thus, we do not see, and Peppe has not explained, how this condition impermissibly restricts his lawful business activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we find Peppe's argument that U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(g) prohibits the condition in his case to be disingenuous.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(g) (providing that a district court \"may impose a condition prohibiting the defendant from incurring new credit charges or opening additional lines of credit unless he is in compliance with the payment schedule \") (emphasis added).   Here, the district court did not \"prohibit\" Peppe from obtaining credit, it only required prior approval.   Further, simply because the Guidelines permit the condition in the circumstance reflected in &#167; 5E1.2(g) does not mean that a court cannot employ it in other cases under &#167; 5D1.3(b), the provision generally guiding conditions of supervised release.   Finally, we decline to modify the credit conditions imposed on Peppe to \"comport\" (as Peppe puts it) with section 5E1.2(g), which would allow Peppe to forego credit prescreening as long as he complied with the payment schedule.   That condition is not what the district court deemed appropriate in its carefully fashioned sentence, and we discern no reason or basis to disturb the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not err in imposing the condition that Peppe obtain prior approval from the probation office for new credit charges or lines of credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing more need be said.

Peppe pleaded guilty to a three-count indictment charging him and his codefendant, Joseph S.

The district court sentenced Peppe to twenty-seven months' incarceration followed by three years' supervised release, a special assessment fee, and a $10,000 fine.   Peppe now appeals the imposition of the fine and a condition of his supervised release requiring probation-office approval prior to any incurring of new credit charges or opening of new credit lines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Factual Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <p>A.

See United States v. Grandmaison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196611\"><a href=\"/opinion/196611/united-states-v-grandmaison/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 557-558 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1993, Peppe and Mongiello loaned to John Wiltshire, a self-employed contractor, $3,000 upon which Wiltshire was required to pay 5% interest per week.   When Wiltshire was late in making his loan payments, Peppe and Mongiello would intimidate him and his wife through repeated, threatening telephone calls.   In June 1994, Wiltshire temporarily stopped making the weekly interest payments because he could no longer afford them.   In July 1994, Wiltshire agreed to do some construction work at Peppe's home in return for forgiveness of part of the debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 1, 1994, Wiltshire contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") about his situation.   By that date, he had paid about $6,000 in interest on the $3,000 loan.   As part of the FBI's subsequent investigation, Wiltshire tape-recorded telephone conversations and meetings with Peppe and Mongiello, including conversations accompanying five additional payments on the loan.   On one such occasion, Peppe referred to his \"cuff list\" of delinquent loan-shark debtors to see how far behind Wiltshire was.   In October 1994, Wiltshire told Peppe that he would not make further payments on the loan and indicated that he had relocated himself and his wife.   Upon hearing this, Peppe became very angry and warned Wiltshire, \"I will catch up to you\" and \"I will find you.\"   At the time of his arrest, Peppe had in his possession a \"cuff list\" listing ten debtors overdue in their payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agreed that Peppe's plea would be tendered pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B), and that, \"[w]ithin the maximum sentence\" possible under applicable law, \"the sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion of the sentencing judge.\"   Peppe acknowledged in the plea agreement that he faced a maximum penalty of 20 years' incarceration and a $250,000 fine on each count.   The agreement stated that, under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, Peppe's Base Offense Level was 20 and the parties would recommend to the court a three-level reduction for Peppe's acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a Total Offense Level of 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Presentence Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the PSR, Peppe's Total Offense Level was computed at 17, his Criminal History Category at I, and the applicable Guideline imprisonment range was found to be twenty-four to thirty months followed by two to three years of supervised release.   The fine range was determined at $5,000 to $50,000, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 5E1.2(c)(1) and (2).   While the government contended that the victim, Wiltshire, was entitled to restitution of the interest paid, $6,000, the PSR stated that the issue of granting restitution in loan-sharking cases had never been addressed in the District of Massachusetts, and relayed the matter to the court.   Peppe complained that the government's restitution figure came only from Wiltshire and was exaggerated, but he did not offer his own calculation and did not otherwise object to that portion of the PSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR also included the following additional facts to which neither party objected.   Peppe is a forty-year-old high school graduate with previous work experience as a bartender, temporary postal employee, greyhound-dog owner and racer, and employee at his father's smoke shop.   Peppe and his wife, Jayne Zannino Peppe, have three children, the youngest of whom may have a serious medical condition.   Peppe's wife manages the care of the family and home, working part-time as a real estate agent.   Peppe's assets total $24,056.50, comprised of, inter alia, bank accounts, securities, life insurance, real estate, and an automobile.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His liabilities total $50,000, made up of loans from his brothers for attorney fees incurred in his defense.   The PSR reports that Peppe has a negative net worth of $25,943.50 and a monthly negative cash flow of $193.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Sentencing Hearing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the factual findings and Sentencing Guideline applications set forth in the PSR.   At the sentencing hearing, the district court confirmed the PSR's calculation of Total Offense Level and Guideline ranges for the fine and imprisonment term.   The government recommended thirty months' incarceration, a fine of $5,000 and an order of restitution of $6,000.   Peppe responded that restitution should not be an issue in sentencing, and requested a hearing should it become a factor.   With respect to restitution, the court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>[T]he record, frankly, is not clear enough for me to do anything but speculate concerning the proper level of restitution.   I decline to take any further time before reaching a sentence in this case to attempt to fashion a restitutionary remedy, particularly in light of the fact that there is a potential for a fine.   And I will impose a fine in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Peppe to twenty-seven months' imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release.   The court further imposed a $10,000 fine, with interest waived, to be paid in installments.   In addition to the standard conditions of supervised release, the court ordered that Peppe could not \"incur new credit charges or open additional lines of credit without prior approval of the probation officer\" who, in turn, would take into consideration Peppe's compliance with the fine payment schedule.   At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the court opined:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>I think I needn't say very much about the reasons for the sentence.   I think Mr. Pep[p]e understands that this is one of the costs of doing this kind of business and that there is imposed in connection with those costs a fine component, and a component [of] being taken away from loved ones at critical times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peppe now argues that the court erred by imposing the $10,000 fine and by prohibiting him from incurring new credit charges or opening additional lines of credit without prior approval of the probation office.   Neither challenge was raised before the sentencing judge, however, and, as Peppe concedes, our review is for plain error only.  United States v.

He points out that his financial information in the record is undisputed, and argues that it establishes both his current inability to pay the fine and the unlikelihood that he will be able to pay it in the future.   Peppe also suggests that the fine contained a \"restitutional component,\" noting that its amount reflects an approximate combination of the government's recommendation for a fine ($5,000) and restitution ($6,000), and that the court did not consider the requisite factors to support a restitution remedy.   He maintains that, in addition to waiving the interest on the fine, the court should also have waived the fine itself and imposed alternative sanctions such as community service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When imposing a fine and its conditions, a district court must consider, inter alia, \"any evidence presented as to the defendant's ability to pay the fine (including the ability to pay over a period of time) in light of his earning capacity and financial resources\" and \"the burden that the fine places on the defendant and his dependents relative to alternative punishments.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(d);  see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(a).

He also contends that, under the Guidelines, the only purpose for this condition is to ensure compliance with a fine payment schedule;  accordingly, he asks this court to modify the condition to resemble U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(g).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may impose a condition of supervised release that is \"reasonably related\" to:  the defendant's offense, history, and characteristics;  the need for deterrence from further criminal conduct;  public protection;  and effective correctional treatment of the defendant.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b);  see also United States v. Thurlow, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195843\"><a href=\"/opinion/195843/united-states-v-thurlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct.1987, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></span> (1995).   Peppe's offense conduct involved the extortionate extension of credit.   His \"cuff lists\" of delinquent loan-shark debtors, evidenced in the record, suggest that his extortionate lending activity was not limited to the identified victim, Wiltshire.   The condition of prescreening new credit charges and credit lines is a reasonable information-gathering device for the probation office to monitor Peppe's use of money;  when Peppe desires new credit, the probation office may inquire as to its purpose and planned disbursement.   Moreover, as the district court indicated at sentencing, the probation office could also use that opportunity to monitor Peppe's compliance with the fine payment schedule.   Therefore, the condition meets the requirements of &#167; 5D1.3(b) because it is reasonably related to Peppe's offense, preventing his participation in further extortionate lending, and ensuring his payment of the fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Peppe suggests that the credit condition inhibits his ability to work or engage in lawful business activities, in derogation of the requirements of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5F1.5(a).<sup>3</sup>  We disagree.   First, &#167; 5F1.5(a) is inapplicable because Peppe fails to explain how the court's condition affects his participation in a \"specified occupation, business, or profession.\"   Id. (emphasis added).   Even assuming it is an \"occupational restriction\" within the meaning of &#167; 5F1.5, it is appropriate for many of the same reasons that it is a proper condition of supervised release under &#167; 5D1.3(b).   See supra note 3 (noting criteria considered in occupational-restriction condition).   Second, the condition requires only prior approval of the probation office;  it is not an absolute bar to incurring credit charges or obtaining new credit, and it applies only for the duration of the supervised release.   Thus, we do not see, and Peppe has not explained, how this condition impermissibly restricts his lawful business activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we find Peppe's argument that U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(g) prohibits the condition in his case to be disingenuous.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5E1.2(g) (providing that a district court \"may impose a condition prohibiting the defendant from incurring new credit charges or opening additional lines of credit unless he is in compliance with the payment schedule \") (emphasis added).   Here, the district court did not \"prohibit\" Peppe from obtaining credit, it only required prior approval.   Further, simply because the Guidelines permit the condition in the circumstance reflected in &#167; 5E1.2(g) does not mean that a court cannot employ it in other cases under &#167; 5D1.3(b), the provision generally guiding conditions of supervised release.   Finally, we decline to modify the credit conditions imposed on Peppe to \"comport\" (as Peppe puts it) with section 5E1.2(g), which would allow Peppe to forego credit prescreening as long as he complied with the payment schedule.   That condition is not what the district court deemed appropriate in its carefully fashioned sentence, and we discern no reason or basis to disturb the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not err in imposing the condition that Peppe obtain prior approval from the probation office for new credit charges or lines of credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing more need be said.   For the foregoing reasons, all of Peppe's challenges on appeal are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At oral argument before this court, Peppe withdrew his challenge to the court's imposition of an additional condition of supervised release:  that Peppe grant access to any and all financial information requested by the probation office.
