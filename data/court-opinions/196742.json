Because  the district court failed to make findings\r\n\nof fact  and  conclusions of  law sufficient  to support  its\r\n\ndecision as required by Fed. R. Civ. P.  52(a), we modify the\r\n\ninjunction and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                         Background1\r                                     Background\r                                               \r\n\n          TEC manufactures  a series  of conveyors  under the\r\n\nmodel  name \"Ultraline,\"  which it  markets primarily  to the\r\n\nplastics processing industry.   The  conveyors are  generally\r\n\nused  to transport lightweight  plastic products from molding\r\n\nmachines in  which  they are  formed  to other  machines  for\r\n\npackaging.  TEC sells  the Ultraline conveyors under the  TEC\r\n\nname through independent sales representatives.  In addition,\r\n\nTEC authorizes an independent distributor,  Injection Molders\r\n\nSupply,  Inc.   (\"IMS\"),  to  advertise,  promote   and  sell\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Our recitation of the  facts is hampered by the  district\r\ncourt's  failure   to  make  any  findings   in  issuing  the\r\ninjunction.    To  provide  context, we  draw  the  following\r\nstatement  from what  we perceive  as essentially  undisputed\r\nfacts.   The statement is  not intended to  be binding on the\r\ndistrict court.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nUltraline conveyors under the IMS tradename through IMS's own\r\n\nproduct   catalogues.    In   1994,  combined   domestic  and\r\n\ninternational  sales of  Ultraline  conveyors exceeded  2,000\r\n\nunits, generating revenues of approximately $3 million.\r\n\n          Budget  has competed  with TEC  and  other conveyor\r\n\nmanufacturers in the plastics  processing industry market for\r\n\nover five  years.   Budget markets its  conveyors exclusively\r                                \r\n\nthrough direct-catalogue sales.   About January 1995,  Budget\r\n\ndecided  to   modify  the  design  of  its  primary  line  of\r\n\nconveyors.    Consequently, Budget  soon  began  to market  a\r\n\nredesigned conveyor  under the  \"Supraline\"  model name  that\r\n\nclosely resembled  TEC's Ultraline  conveyor.  Budget  labels\r\n\neach Supraline conveyor with the name \"Budget Molders Supply,\r\n\nInc.\"  in several  different places  on the  machine.   While\r\n\nthese  Budget labels  cannot be  seen in  every advertisement\r\n\nphotograph of  a Supraline  conveyor included in  the record,\r\n\neach Supraline advertisement prominently features  the Budget\r\n\nname (although not necessarily on the pictured conveyor), and\r\n\nseveral include the statement \"Made in the USA by Budget.\"\r\n\n          It   appears  largely   undisputed  that   the  two\r\n\nconveyors, when  placed side by side,  are strikingly similar\r\n\nin  appearance.  Many of  the similarities shared  by the two\r\n\nmachines,  however,  are  to  some  extent  functional.    In\r\n\naddition,  the  record  includes several  advertisements  for\r\n\nconveyors  sold by companies other than TEC or Budget.  These\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nconveyors,   at  least   as   they  are   presented  in   the\r\n\nadvertisements, also appear somewhat similar to the Ultraline\r\n\nand  Supraline  conveyors.     Moreover,  apparently  several\r\n\ncompanies  other than  TEC or  Budget incorporate  the suffix\r\n\n\"line\"  in the  model  names of  their respective  conveyors.\r\n\nBudget   notes  that,   in   addition   to  \"Ultraline\"   and\r\n\n\"Supraline,\" other model names  for conveyors marketed to the\r\n\nplastics processing industry  include \"A-line,\"  \"Flex-line,\"\r\n\n\"Slim-line,\" \"Omni-line,\" and \"Direct-line.\"\r\n\n          On  July  12, 1995,  TEC  brought  this action  for\r\n\ntrademark infringement under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act,\r\n\n15  U.S.C.   1125(a).   In its complaint,  TEC alleges, inter\r                                                                         \r\n\nalia,  that the trade dress  of its Ultraline  conveyors is a\r                \r\n\nwell-established mark in the industry and that, by developing\r\n\nand  marketing  its Supraline  conveyors, Budget  intended to\r\n\nexploit the goodwill  associated with that  trade dress.   On\r\n\nJuly 21, 1995,  the district  court held a  hearing on  TEC's\r\n\nrequest for  preliminary injunctive relief.   At the hearing,\r\n\nan Ultraline and a Supraline conveyor  were made available to\r\n\nthe district court for review.\r\n\n          At the  close of  the hearing, the  court indicated\r\n\nthat \"it  believed the products are  confusingly similar\" and\r\n\nthat,  therefore, it  was  \"inclined to  enter  some sort  of\r\n\ninjunctive relief.\"  Nonetheless, the court declined to enter\r\n\na ruling  at that time and  urged the parties to  resolve the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nmatter  themselves.

See Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  52(a);  Knapp  Shoes, Inc.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., 15 F.3d 1222, 1228 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                    \r\n\n          The  requirements of  Rule  52(a)  are intended  to\r\n\nassure   that   the   district   court    gives   appropriate\r\n\nconsideration to all essential relevant factors  and provides\r\n\nan  adequate basis  for  meaningful appellate  review of  its\r\n\ndecision.  See  generally 9A  Charles A. Wright  &amp; Arthur  R.\r                                     \r\n\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure    2751, at 478-80 (2d\r                                                  \r\n\ned. 1994).   The rule, however, is not intended to change the\r\n\npreliminary nature  of the  proceeding; in  the context  of a\r\n\npreliminary injunction motion,  the district court's findings\r\n\nneed not be overly detailed, and  they do not bind the  court\r\n\nin subsequent proceedings.  See Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 862\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir. 1988).  Moreover, the absence of Rule\r\n\n52(a)  findings  and conclusions  will  not be  fatal  in all\r\n\ncases.   We may overlook the defect, if our own review of the\r\n\nrecord substantially  eliminates all  reasonable doubt  as to\r\n\nthe  basis  of  the  district  court's  decision.

April  2, 1996)  (failure to adhere  to requirements  of\r\n\nRule  52(a) is  harmless  error where  undisputed documentary\r\n\nevidence  combined with district court's extensive discussion\r\n\nof  other  findings  and  conclusions   adequately  clarifies\r\n\notherwise unexplained finding of irreparable harm).\r\n\n          In this  case, the district court  made no explicit\r\n\nfindings of  fact  or conclusions  of law  in granting  TEC's\r\n\nrequest  for a  preliminary  injunction.   In its  three-page\r\n\nwritten order, the court merely recited the traditional four-\r\n\nprong preliminary injunction  test and summarily  stated that\r\n\nTEC had met its burden in establishing it.  The transcript of\r\n\nthe relatively brief hearing on TEC's motion, provides little\r\n\nfurther  insight into  the district  court's reasoning.   The\r\n\ntotal  extent  of the  court's  oral  findings following  the\r\n\nhearing is limited to its statement that \"it believed the two\r\n\nproducts were confusingly similar.\"   In the context of  this\r\n\ncase, such  minimal findings do not provide an adequate basis\r\n\nfor appellate review.\r\n\n          Moreover, our  own review of the  relatively sparse\r\n\nrecord does not allow us to affirm the district court's order\r\n\nin the absence of Rule 52(a) findings.  Suffice it to say, we\r\n\nbelieve  that the  pertinent issues  are close  and that  the\r\n\nevidence  in the record does  not compel a  ruling for either\r\n\nside.  Indeed,  in a case  such as this  one, where a  proper\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nevaluation  of  the  plaintiff's  claim  requires  a  careful\r\n\nbalancing  of  a  number  of nondispositive  factors  by  the\r\n\ndistrict  court, the  absence of  any subsidiary  findings of\r\n\nfact or  conclusions of  law renders it  virtually impossible\r\n\nfor this court to do anything  but speculate as to the  basis\r\n\nof the district court's ruling.  Accordingly, because  we are\r\n\nunable to  engage in  meaningful appellate review,  we remand\r\n\nthe case to the  district court for further findings  of fact\r\n\nand conclusions of law.

(\"TEC\").  Because the district court failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to support its decision as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), we modify the injunction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TEC manufactures a series of conveyors under the model name \"Ultraline,\" which it markets primarily to the plastics processing industry.   The conveyors are generally used to transport lightweight plastic products from molding machines in which they are formed to other machines for packaging.   TEC sells the Ultraline conveyors under the TEC name through independent sales representatives.   In addition, TEC authorizes an independent distributor, Injection Molders Supply, Inc.  (\"IMS\"), to advertise, promote and sell Ultraline conveyors under the IMS tradename through IMS's own product catalogues.   In 1994, combined domestic and international sales of Ultraline conveyors exceeded 2,000 units, generating revenues of approximately $3 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Budget has competed with TEC and other conveyor manufacturers in the plastics processing industry market for over five years.   Budget markets its conveyors exclusively through direct-catalogue sales.   About January 1995, Budget decided to modify the design of its primary line of conveyors.   Consequently, Budget soon began to market a redesigned conveyor under the \"Supraline\" model name that closely resembled TEC's Ultraline conveyor.   Budget labels each Supraline conveyor with the name \"Budget Molders Supply, Inc.\" in several different places on the machine.   While these Budget labels cannot be seen in every advertisement photograph of a Supraline conveyor included in the record, each Supraline advertisement prominently features the Budget name (although not necessarily on the pictured conveyor), and several include the statement \"Made in the USA by Budget.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears largely undisputed that the two conveyors, when placed side by side, are strikingly similar in appearance.   Many of the similarities shared by the two machines, however, are to some extent functional.   In addition, the record includes several advertisements for conveyors sold by companies other than TEC or Budget.   These conveyors, at least as they are presented in the advertisements, also appear somewhat similar to the Ultraline and Supraline conveyors.   Moreover, apparently several companies other than TEC or Budget incorporate the suffix \"line\" in the model names of their respective conveyors.   Budget notes that, in addition to \"Ultraline\" and \"Supraline,\" other model names for conveyors marketed to the plastics processing industry include \"A-line,\" \"Flex-line,\" \"Slim-line,\" \"Omni-line,\" and \"Direct-line.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 1995, TEC brought this action for trademark infringement under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).   In its complaint, TEC alleges, inter alia, that the trade dress of its Ultraline conveyors is a well-established mark in the industry and that, by developing and marketing its Supraline conveyors, Budget intended to exploit the goodwill associated with that trade dress.   On July 21, 1995, the district court held a hearing on TEC's request for preliminary injunctive relief.   At the hearing, an Ultraline and a Supraline conveyor were made available to the district court for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the hearing, the court indicated that \"it believed the products are confusingly similar\" and that, therefore, it was \"inclined to enter some sort of injunctive relief.\"   Nonetheless, the court declined to enter a ruling at that time and urged the parties to resolve the matter themselves.   Eventually, on August 1, 1995, the district court entered an order enjoining Budget from, inter alia,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>manufacturing, distributing, promoting, advertising, and/or selling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>1) the horizontal, inclined and variable inclined Budget Supraline Conveyors;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>2) any other conveyor which is likely to cause confusion or mistake in the minds of the public or to deceive purchasers into the belief that the defendant's goods are the plaintiff's goods or are affiliated with or sponsored by the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Budget now appeals from this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on a preliminary injunction motion, a district court must ask whether the moving party has established that (1) it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) there exists, absent the injunction, a significant risk of irreparable harm, (3) the balance of hardships tilts in its favor, and (4) granting the injunction will not negatively affect the public interest.   See, e.g., Hypertherm, Inc. v. Precision Prods., Inc., 832 F.2d 697, 699 n. 2 (1st Cir.1987).   Though the district court enjoys considerable discretion in applying this test, its decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction must be supported by adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law.   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a);  Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., 15 F.3d 1222, 1228 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirements of Rule 52(a) are intended to assure that the district court gives appropriate consideration to all essential relevant factors and provides an adequate basis for meaningful appellate review of its decision.   See generally 9A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2571, at 478-80 (2d ed. 1994).   The rule, however, is not intended to change the preliminary nature of the proceeding;  in the context of a preliminary injunction motion, the district court's findings need not be overly detailed, and they do not bind the court in subsequent proceedings.   See Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 862 F.2d 890, 895 (1st Cir.1988).   Moreover, the absence of Rule 52(a) findings and conclusions will not be fatal in all cases.   We may overlook the defect, if our own review of the record substantially eliminates all reasonable doubt as to the basis of the district court's decision.   See New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assoc. v. Flynn, 751 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir.1984) (citing Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 292, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1792, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982));  Conservation Law Found., Inc. v. Busey, 79 F.3d 1250, 1271 (1st Cir.1996) (failure to adhere to requirements of Rule 52(a) is harmless error where undisputed documentary evidence combined with district court's extensive discussion of other findings and conclusions adequately clarifies otherwise unexplained finding of irreparable harm).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court made no explicit findings of fact or conclusions of law in granting TEC's request for a preliminary injunction.   In its three-page written order, the court merely recited the traditional four-prong preliminary injunction test and summarily stated that TEC had met its burden in establishing it.   The transcript of the relatively brief hearing on TEC's motion, provides little further insight into the district court's reasoning.   The total extent of the court's oral findings following the hearing is limited to its statement that \"it believed the two products were confusingly similar.\"   In the context of this case, such minimal findings do not provide an adequate basis for appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, our own review of the relatively sparse record does not allow us to affirm the district court's order in the absence of Rule 52(a) findings.   Suffice it to say, we believe that the pertinent issues are close and that the evidence in the record does not compel a ruling for either side.   Indeed, in a case such as this one, where a proper evaluation of the plaintiff's claim requires a careful balancing of a number of nondispositive factors by the district court, the absence of any subsidiary findings of fact or conclusions of law renders it virtually impossible for this court to do anything but speculate as to the basis of the district court's ruling.   Accordingly, because we are unable to engage in meaningful appellate review, we remand the case to the district court for further findings of fact and conclusions of law.   See Allied Mktg. Group, Inc. v. CDL Mktg., Inc., 878 F.2d 806, 813-14 (5th Cir.1989) (remand for findings in trade dress infringement action);  Inverness Corp. v. Whitehall Labs., 819 F.2d 48, 50-51 (2d Cir.1987) (same);  cf. Knapp Shoes, 15 F.3d at 1228-29 (decision to dissolve preliminary injunction in unfair competition case vacated for lack of detailed findings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court will have to apply the four-part preliminary injunction test and set forth the basis for its ruling on each prong.   In this case, TEC alleges that Budget has impermissibly copied the trade dress of its Ultraline conveyor in violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).   To establish such a violation, TEC must prove (1) that its design is inherently distinctive or has acquired a secondary meaning, and (2) that there is a likelihood that prospective purchasers of conveyors will be confused as to the source of the Budget conveyor.   See Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 2757-58, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992);  Mana Prods., Inc. v. Columbia Cosmetics Mfg., Inc., 65 F.3d 1063, 1068 (2d Cir.1995);  Duraco Prods., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enters., Ltd., 40 F.3d 1431, 1439 (3d Cir.1994). Whether a violation ultimately exists will also depend on the functionality of the copied design.   See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. at 2757-58.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In addressing TEC's likelihood of success, the district court should make subsidiary findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to explain its evaluation of the evidence with respect to each of these three factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we think that on remand the district court should also give specific consideration to Budget's claim that, even if the injunction was rightly entered, the second paragraph is overbroad.

For the moment, we leave the preliminary injunction in place, but modify the order such that the injunction will expire two months from the issuance of this court's mandate, absent further action by the district court.

Because the district court failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to support its decision as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), we modify the injunction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TEC manufactures a series of conveyors under the model name \"Ultraline,\" which it markets primarily to the plastics processing industry.   The conveyors are generally used to transport lightweight plastic products from molding machines in which they are formed to other machines for packaging.   TEC sells the Ultraline conveyors under the TEC name through independent sales representatives.   In addition, TEC authorizes an independent distributor, Injection Molders Supply, Inc.  (\"IMS\"), to advertise, promote and sell Ultraline conveyors under the IMS tradename through IMS's own product catalogues.   In 1994, combined domestic and international sales of Ultraline conveyors exceeded 2,000 units, generating revenues of approximately $3 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Budget has competed with TEC and other conveyor manufacturers in the plastics processing industry market for over five years.   Budget markets its conveyors exclusively through direct-catalogue sales.   About January 1995, Budget decided to modify the design of its primary line of conveyors.   Consequently, Budget soon began to market a redesigned conveyor under the \"Supraline\" model name that closely resembled TEC's Ultraline conveyor.   Budget labels each Supraline conveyor with the name \"Budget Molders Supply, Inc.\" in several different places on the machine.   While these Budget labels cannot be seen in every advertisement photograph of a Supraline conveyor included in the record, each Supraline advertisement prominently features the Budget name (although not necessarily on the pictured conveyor), and several include the statement \"Made in the USA by Budget.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears largely undisputed that the two conveyors, when placed side by side, are strikingly similar in appearance.   Many of the similarities shared by the two machines, however, are to some extent functional.   In addition, the record includes several advertisements for conveyors sold by companies other than TEC or Budget.   These conveyors, at least as they are presented in the advertisements, also appear somewhat similar to the Ultraline and Supraline conveyors.   Moreover, apparently several companies other than TEC or Budget incorporate the suffix \"line\" in the model names of their respective conveyors.   Budget notes that, in addition to \"Ultraline\" and \"Supraline,\" other model names for conveyors marketed to the plastics processing industry include \"A-line,\" \"Flex-line,\" \"Slim-line,\" \"Omni-line,\" and \"Direct-line.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 1995, TEC brought this action for trademark infringement under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).   In its complaint, TEC alleges, inter alia, that the trade dress of its Ultraline conveyors is a well-established mark in the industry and that, by developing and marketing its Supraline conveyors, Budget intended to exploit the goodwill associated with that trade dress.   On July 21, 1995, the district court held a hearing on TEC's request for preliminary injunctive relief.   At the hearing, an Ultraline and a Supraline conveyor were made available to the district court for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the close of the hearing, the court indicated that \"it believed the products are confusingly similar\" and that, therefore, it was \"inclined to enter some sort of injunctive relief.\"   Nonetheless, the court declined to enter a ruling at that time and urged the parties to resolve the matter themselves.   Eventually, on August 1, 1995, the district court entered an order enjoining Budget from, inter alia,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>manufacturing, distributing, promoting, advertising, and/or selling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>1) the horizontal, inclined and variable inclined Budget Supraline Conveyors;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>2) any other conveyor which is likely to cause confusion or mistake in the minds of the public or to deceive purchasers into the belief that the defendant's goods are the plaintiff's goods or are affiliated with or sponsored by the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Budget now appeals from this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on a preliminary injunction motion, a district court must ask whether the moving party has established that (1) it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) there exists, absent the injunction, a significant risk of irreparable harm, (3) the balance of hardships tilts in its favor, and (4) granting the injunction will not negatively affect the public interest.   See, e.g., Hypertherm, Inc. v. Precision Prods., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496779\"><a href=\"/opinion/496779/hypertherm-inc-v-precision-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 699 n. 2 (1st Cir.1987).   Though the district court enjoys considerable discretion in applying this test, its decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction must be supported by adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law.   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a);  Knapp Shoes, Inc. v. Sylvania Shoe Mfg. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195201\"><a href=\"/opinion/195201/knapp-v-sylvania-shoe/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span>, 1228 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirements of Rule 52(a) are intended to assure that the district court gives appropriate consideration to all essential relevant factors and provides an adequate basis for meaningful appellate review of its decision.   See generally 9A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2571, at 478-80 (2d ed. 1994).   The rule, however, is not intended to change the preliminary nature of the proceeding;  in the context of a preliminary injunction motion, the district court's findings need not be overly detailed, and they do not bind the court in subsequent proceedings.   See Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515441\"><a href=\"/opinion/515441/salim-aoude-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 895 (1st Cir.1988).   Moreover, the absence of Rule 52(a) findings and conclusions will not be fatal in all cases.   We may overlook the defect, if our own review of the record substantially eliminates all reasonable doubt as to the basis of the district court's decision.   See New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assoc. v. Flynn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445647\"><a href=\"/opinion/445647/new-hampshire-motor-transport-association-v-richard-m-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.1984) (citing Pullman-Standard v. Swint, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110698\"><a href=\"/opinion/110698/pullman-standard-v-swint/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 292, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110698\"><a href=\"/opinion/110698/pullman-standard-v-swint/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Busey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715637\"><a href=\"/opinion/715637/conservation-law-foundation-inc-v-james-busey-administrator-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span>, 1271 (1st Cir.1996) (failure to adhere to requirements of Rule 52(a) is harmless error where undisputed documentary evidence combined with district court's extensive discussion of other findings and conclusions adequately clarifies otherwise unexplained finding of irreparable harm).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court made no explicit findings of fact or conclusions of law in granting TEC's request for a preliminary injunction.   In its three-page written order, the court merely recited the traditional four-prong preliminary injunction test and summarily stated that TEC had met its burden in establishing it.   The transcript of the relatively brief hearing on TEC's motion, provides little further insight into the district court's reasoning.   The total extent of the court's oral findings following the hearing is limited to its statement that \"it believed the two products were confusingly similar.\"   In the context of this case, such minimal findings do not provide an adequate basis for appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, our own review of the relatively sparse record does not allow us to affirm the district court's order in the absence of Rule 52(a) findings.   Suffice it to say, we believe that the pertinent issues are close and that the evidence in the record does not compel a ruling for either side.   Indeed, in a case such as this one, where a proper evaluation of the plaintiff's claim requires a careful balancing of a number of nondispositive factors by the district court, the absence of any subsidiary findings of fact or conclusions of law renders it virtually impossible for this court to do anything but speculate as to the basis of the district court's ruling.   Accordingly, because we are unable to engage in meaningful appellate review, we remand the case to the district court for further findings of fact and conclusions of law.   See Allied Mktg. Group, Inc. v. CDL Mktg., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525591\"><a href=\"/opinion/525591/allied-marketing-group-inc-dba-sweepstakes-clearinghouse-v-cdl/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 813-14 (5th Cir.1989) (remand for findings in trade dress infringement action);  Inverness Corp. v.

Knapp Shoes, 15 F.3d at 1228-29 (decision to dissolve preliminary injunction in unfair competition case vacated for lack of detailed findings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court will have to apply the four-part preliminary injunction test and set forth the basis for its ruling on each prong.   In this case, TEC alleges that Budget has impermissibly copied the trade dress of its Ultraline conveyor in violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).   To establish such a violation, TEC must prove (1) that its design is inherently distinctive or has acquired a secondary meaning, and (2) that there is a likelihood that prospective purchasers of conveyors will be confused as to the source of the Budget conveyor.

Taco Cabana, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 769, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whether a violation ultimately exists will also depend on the functionality of the copied design.   See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. at 2757-58.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In addressing TEC's likelihood of success, the district court should make subsidiary findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to explain its evaluation of the evidence with respect to each of these three factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we think that on remand the district court should also give specific consideration to Budget's claim that, even if the injunction was rightly entered, the second paragraph is overbroad.   Similar language has been disapproved in John H. Harland Co. v. Clarke Checks, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421224\"><a href=\"/opinion/421224/john-h-harland-company-cross-appellant-v-clarke-checks-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span>, 984-85 (11th Cir.1983).   See also 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition &#167; 8.01[c] (1995).   There is no compelling reason for us to resolve the issue at this time, and we express no view on the merits of this overbreadth claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we remand the case to the district court for further findings of fact and conclusions of law consistent with this opinion.   For the moment, we leave the preliminary injunction in place, but modify the order such that the injunction will expire two months from the issuance of this court's mandate, absent further action by the district court.   See Allied Mktg., 878 F.2d at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Our recitation of the facts is hampered by the district court's failure to make any findings in issuing the injunction.   To provide context, we draw the following statement from what we perceive as essentially undisputed facts.   The statement is not intended to be binding on the district court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The order also enjoins Budget \"from producing and/or distributing ... any advertising or promotional materials which depict the Supraline Conveyor or any other product which is confusingly similar to the Ultraline Conveyor.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We find it unnecessary to decide at this juncture whether functionality is an element of the plaintiff's claim or an affirmative defense to be raised by the defendant.
