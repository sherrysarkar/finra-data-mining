This particular\r\n\npassage  revolves  around  the  constitutionality  of  the  Child\r\n\nSupport  Recovery Act  (CSRA), 18  U.S.C.    228 (1994),  and the\r\n\nfederal government's authority, if any, to collect restitutionary\r\n\npayments ordered under the  CSRA by recourse to the  Federal Debt\r\n\nCollection Procedure Act (FDCPA),  28 U.S.C.    3001-3308 (1994).\r\n\nThe CSRA issue is new  to us and the FDCPA issue has  not, to our\r\n\nknowledge, been addressed by any court of appeals.  After sorting\r\n\nthrough  these  and  other  arcana,  we  reject  the  defendant's\r\n\nchallenge to his criminal conviction and sentence, holding, among\r\n\nother  things, that  Congress did  not exceed  the bounds  of its\r\n\nconstitutional power  in enacting  the CSRA.    Turning to  post-\r\n\nconviction  events, we  hold  that the  federal government  lacks\r\n\nauthority  to proceed against a \"deadbeat dad\" by using the FDCPA\r\n\nas an instrument  for enforcing a restitutionary  order issued in\r\n\nconnection with an antecedent criminal conviction.\r\n\nI.  SETTING THE STAGE\r          I.  SETTING THE STAGE\r\n\n          In October 1990 a Georgia state court entered  a decree\r\n\nending Sandra  Taylor's marriage to defendant-appellant  Frank P.\r\n\nBongiorno,  granting   Taylor  custody  of  the   couple's  minor\r\n\ndaughter, and directing  Bongiorno (a  physician specializing  in\r\n\nbariatric  surgery)  to pay  $5,000 per  month in  child support.\r\n\nShortly    thereafter,   mother   and    daughter   repaired   to\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nMassachusetts.  When Bongiorno  subsequently sought to modify the\r\n\nchild  support award,  Taylor counterclaimed  on the  ground that\r\n\nBongiorno  had failed  to  make the  payments  stipulated in  the\r\n\noriginal  decree.   In  September  1992 the  Georgia  court found\r\n\nBongiorno in contempt  for failing  to pay upward  of $75,000  in\r\n\nmandated child support and directed that he be incarcerated until\r\n\nhe had purged  the contempt.   Bongiorno avoided immurement  only\r\n\nbecause he had accepted  a position in Michigan and  the contempt\r\n\norder did not operate extraterritorially.\r\n\n          Once in Michigan,  Bongiorno made sporadic payments  of\r\n\nchild  support despite the fact  that his new  post paid $200,000\r\n\nper year.  In March 1993 a Michigan state court domesticated  the\r\n\nGeorgia support order  and authorized garnishment  of Bongiorno's\r\n\nwages  to satisfy  the accumulated  arrearage.   Soon thereafter,\r\n\nBongiorno  quit his  job  and paid  only  $500 a  month  in child\r\n\nsupport from June to December 1993.  In early 1994 Bongiorno went\r\n\nto  work for the  State of Michigan.   That May  a Michigan state\r\n\ncourt  issued an order enforcing the Georgia support award to the\r\n\nextent of $300 per week.1   Bongiorno failed to satisfy even this\r\n\nmodest impost.\r\n\n          Approximately  one  year  later  the  federal  behemoth\r\n\nstirred; the  United States charged Bongiorno  with violating the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Differences  in  state  law  explain  this  ceiling.    The\r\nMichigan court applied Michigan's child support guidelines, Mich.\r\nComp.  Laws    552.519  (1988), to  determine  a current  support\r\nobligation  and  then  added  a  premium to  be  applied  against\r\nBongiorno's accumulated arrearages.  Neither the propriety of the\r\nceiling nor the Michigan court's treatment of the Georgia court's\r\ndecree is at issue here.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nCSRA.     Because   Bongiorno's   minor   daughter  has   resided\r\n\ncontinuously in Massachusetts from  1990 forward (albeit with her\r\n\ngrandmother  for much  of  that time),  the government  preferred\r\n\ncharges  in that  district.   Bongiorno  moved unsuccessfully  to\r\n\ndismiss  the indictment on the ground that the CSRA represents an\r\n\nunconstitutional exercise of  Congress' power under  the Commerce\r\n\nClause.  At an ensuing bench trial, the district court determined\r\n\nthat Bongiorno had possessed the ability to pay $5,000 monthly in\r\n\nthe 1992-1993  time frame, but that  he had chosen not  to do so.\r\n\nConsequently, the court found Bongiorno guilty of willful failure\r\n\nto  pay  child  support  and  sentenced  him  to  five  years  of\r\n\nprobation.   As  a condition  of probation,  the court  imposed a\r\n\nwork-release  arrangement,  directing Bongiorno  to  spend up  to\r\n\ntwelve hours  per day in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for\r\n\nthe first  year of his  probation.  As  a further condition,  the\r\n\ncourt  ordered  restitution  in the  sum  of  $220,000 (a  figure\r\n\napproximating the total arrearage then outstanding).\r\n\n          Not  content with its  apparent victory, the government\r\n\ncommenced  a civil  proceeding  under the  FDCPA  as a  means  of\r\n\nenforcing  the  restitutionary  order.    After  some  procedural\r\n\nwrangling, the  court granted  the government's motion  to attach\r\n\nBongiorno's wages and disburse the proceeds.\r\n\n          Bongiorno filed  timely appeals  in both cases,  and we\r\n\nheard the appeals in  tandem.  We now  affirm the conviction  and\r\n\nsentence  in the criminal case,  but reverse the  judgment in the\r\n\ncivil case.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nII.  THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CHILD SUPPORT RECOVERY ACT\r          II.  THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CHILD SUPPORT RECOVERY ACT\r\n\n          Bongiorno challenges his conviction principally  on the\r\n\nground that the CSRA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress'\r\n\nauthority  under  the   Commerce  Clause.    We  review  de  novo\r\n\nconstitutional challenges to federal statutes.  See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 471-72 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                    \r\n\n                  A.  The CSRA and Its Prologue.\r                            A.  The CSRA and Its Prologue.\r                                                         \r\n\n          In 1992 Congress focused on the importance of financial\r\n\nsupport from non-custodial  parents as a means  of combatting the\r\n\ngrowing poverty  of single-parent families.   The House Judiciary\r\n\nCommittee  observed  that  of  $16.3  billion  in  child  support\r\n\npayments  due in  1989, only  $11.2 billion  was paid,  leaving a\r\n\nshortfall  of  approximately  $5  billion to  be  offset  largely\r\n\nthrough government assistance.   See H.R. Rep. No. 102-771,  at 5\r                                              \r\n\n(1992).   The Committee  concluded that  \"the  annual deficit  in\r\n\nchild support payments remains unacceptably high,\" especially \"in\r\n\ninterstate  collection  cases, where  enforcement  of  support is\r\n\nparticularly  difficult.\"   Id.   To illustrate  this point,  the\r                                         \r\n\nCommittee noted  that one-third of all  uncollected child support\r\n\nobligations  involved non-custodial  fathers living out  of state\r\n\nand that roughly fifty-seven percent of the custodial  parents in\r\n\nsuch situations received  support payments \"occasionally,  seldom\r\n\nor never.\"  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          Because   Congress   doubted   the    states'   ability\r\n\nefficaciously to enforce support orders beyond their own borders,\r\n\nsee  id.  at  6  (recognizing that  \"interstate  extradition  and\r                  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nenforcement in fact remains a tedious, cumbersome and slow method\r\n\nof collection\"),  it devised a  federal solution hoping  that the\r\n\nnew  law    the  CSRA    would  prevent delinquent  parents  from\r\n\n\"mak[ing] a mockery of State law by fleeing across State lines to\r\n\navoid  enforcement  actions by  State  courts  and child  support\r\n\nagencies.\"  138 Cong. Rec. H7324, H7326 (daily ed.  Aug. 4, 1992)\r\n\n(statement  of Rep.  Hyde).   In  final  form the  statute  makes\r\n\nwillful  failure  \"to pay  a  past  due  support obligation  with\r\n\nrespect to a child who resides in another State\" a federal crime.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   228(a).  A \"past due support obligation\" is an amount\r\n\ndetermined under  a state  court order  that either  has remained\r\n\nunpaid for more than one year or is greater than $5,000.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n   228(d)(1).   The  law  subjects  violators  to  a  panoply  of\r\n\npunishments, including imprisonment, fines, and restitution.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.   228(b) &amp; (c).\r             \r\n\n                     B.

The Commerce Clause.\r                                                      \r\n\n          The Commerce Clause  bestows upon  Congress the  power,\r\n\ninter  alia,  to  \"regulate Commerce  .  .  .  among the  several\r                     \r\n\nStates.\"   U.S. Const., art. I,   8, cl. 3.  The appellant claims\r\n\nthat the  CSRA   which in  his case has the  effect of regulating\r\n\nthe nonpayment  of Georgia-imposed child support obligations owed\r\n\nby a Michigan resident  to a child domiciled in  Massachusetts2  \r\n\ndoes not fall within the ambit of this constitutional grant.  The\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Technically, child support is  owed to the custodial parent\r\nfor  the  benefit of  the minor  child.   For  simplicity's sake,\r\nhowever,  we choose to reduce the triangle to a straight line and\r\ntreat the obligation as if it were owed directly to the minor.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nSupreme Court has identified three general categories of activity\r\n\nthat  lawfully can be regulated  under the Commerce  Clause:  (1)\r\n\nactivities  that  involve  use  of  the  channels  of  interstate\r\n\ncommerce, (2) activities that implicate the  instrumentalities of\r\n\ninterstate commerce  (including persons or  things in  interstate\r\n\ncommerce), and  (3) activities  that have a  substantial relation\r\n\nto,  or substantially  affect, interstate  commerce.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 1629-30 (1995); Perez v.

In\r\n\nother words, because paying court-ordered child support occurs in\r\n\ninterstate commerce  when the obligated parent  and the dependent\r\n\nchild  reside   in  different  states,  the   underlying  support\r\n\nobligation is  subject to  regulation under the  Commerce Clause.\r\n\nAccord United States v.

For starters,  he\r\n\nprotests  that  the  obligation  to  pay  child  support  is  not\r\n\n\"commerce\" in any meaningful  sense.  That cry is  drowned out by\r\n\nthe broadcast definitions of  the term used by the  Supreme Court\r\n\nfrom the early days of the Republic, see, e.g., Gibbons v. Ogden,\r                                                                          \r\n\n22 U.S.  (9 Wheat.) 1, 189-96 (1824), as refreshed by more recent\r\n\nSupreme Court  jurisprudence, see, e.g., Heart  of Atlanta Motel,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc. v.

The Court\r\n\nhas  long   read  the  Commerce  Clause   to  reach  transactions\r\n\nconcerning  intangibles.   See,  e.g.,  United  States v.

Because compliance with such support orders requires\r\n\nthe  regular movement  of money  and communications  across state\r\n\nlines, such   transactions fall  within the scope  of permissibly\r\n\nregulated  intercourse.   See  Hampshire,  95 F.3d  at  1003; see\r                                                                           \r\n\ngenerally Comment, Making Parents  Pay:  Interstate Child Support\r                                                                           \r\n\nEnforcement  After [Lopez],  144  U.

It  follows inexorably that  Congress lawfully can  pass\r\n\nlegislation  designed  to   prevent  the   frustration  of   such\r\n\ninterstate  transactions.   See,  e.g., Allenberg  Cotton Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPittman,  419 U.S.  20,  34  (1974)  (holding that  Congress  can\r                 \r\n\nprevent the obstruction of interstate commerce by obviating state\r\n\nlaws); Heart of Atlanta  Motel, 379 U.S. at 275-76  (holding that\r                                        \r\n\nCongress has power to remove impediments to interstate commerce).\r\n\n          The CSRA is such a law.  It regulates the nonpayment of\r\n\ninterstate  child  support obligations.    Because  child support\r\n\norders  that require a parent in one  state to make payments to a\r\n\nperson in another state are functionally equivalent to interstate\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ncontracts,  see  Sage,  92  F.3d  at  106,  such  obligations are\r                               \r\n\n\"things\" in  interstate commerce.   Thus,  it is  appropriate for\r\n\nCongress   to   enact  legislation   that   will   prevent  their\r\n\nnonfulfillment.  On this  basis, the CSRA is a  valid exercise of\r\n\ncongressional power under the Commerce Clause.  See Hampshire, 95\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 1003-04 (upholding  the constitutionality of the CSRA  on\r\n\nthe ground that it regulates \"what is essentially nonpayment of a\r\n\ndebt where  the  judgment creditor  and  judgment debtor  are  in\r\n\ndifferent states\");  Mussari, 95 F.3d  at 790 (reaching  the same\r                                      \r\n\nconclusion and observing that a  delinquent parent's \"intentional\r\n\nrefusal to satisfy the debt is as much an obstruction of commerce\r\n\nbetween the states  as any act of extortion  made unlawful by the\r\n\nHobbs  Act\");  Sage,   92  F.3d  at  105-06  (reaching  the  same\r                             \r\n\nconclusion and  observing that Congress \"surely  has power [under\r\n\nthe Commerce  Clause] to prevent the frustration of an obligation\r\n\nto engage in interstate commerce\").\r\n\n          The appellant makes  two last-ditch  arguments on  this\r\n\npoint.  First, he  posits that cases such as  Hampshire, Mussari,\r                                                                          \r\n\nand Sage went  awry because they did not recognize  that the CSRA\r                  \r\n\nis different from other federal  statutes enacted under the aegis\r\n\nof the  Commerce Clause.   The difference,  he says, is  that the\r\n\nunderlying  payment   obligation      the  child   support  order\r\n\nsimpliciter   is  a creature of state law.   This circumstance is\r\n\nfribbling.    South-Eastern  Underwriters  illustrates  that  the\r                                                   \r\n\nstate-law origins of an  obligation do not preclude  the exercise\r\n\nof  congressional power  under the  Commerce  Clause.   The Court\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nthere held, 322 U.S. at 546-47, that a fire insurance transaction\r\n\nacross state lines constituted commerce among the several states,\r\n\nnotwithstanding that  the insurance policy itself  was a personal\r\n\ncontract  subject to state law.  The same principle obtains here:\r\n\nalthough the underlying child support order is a product of state\r\n\nlaw, the  delinquent parent's location vis- -vis  the minor child\r\n\ncreates interstate nexus  in the  form of an  obligation to  make\r\n\nregular  payments  across state  boundaries.    Indeed, the  CSRA\r\n\napplies only when the  state-imposed child support order develops\r                      \r\n\nan interstate character, necessitating  the sending of money from\r\n\none state to another by the obligor.  When that occurs, the child\r\n\nsupport  obligation  lies  in  interstate  commerce,  subject  to\r\n\nfederal  regulation,   and  Congress  may  act   to  prevent  its\r\n\nfrustration.\r\n\n          The appellant's second argument posits that uncollected\r\n\nsupport  payments  have  too  tenuous  an  impact  on  interstate\r\n\ncommerce  to  justify the  exercise  of  congressional authority.\r\n\nThis argument  relies heavily on Lopez, a case in which the Court\r                                                \r\n\nstruck  down the Gun-Free School  Zones Act (GFSZA),  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n922(q)(1)(A),  which criminalized  the possession of  firearms in\r\n\nlocal school  zones.  Holding  that Congress  exceeded its  power\r\n\nunder  the Commerce Clause when it enacted the statute, the Court\r\n\nreasoned  that gun  possession  in a  local  school zone  is  not\r\n\neconomic activity of a type that substantially affects interstate\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\ncommerce.   See Lopez, 115 S.  Ct. at 1634.   Lopez is inapposite\r                                                             \r\n\nhere.3  The Lopez majority  considered only the third, \"affecting\r                           \r\n\ninterstate  commerce,\"  branch   of  Commerce  Clause  authority,\r\n\ndismissing the first two bases as patently inapplicable.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 1630.   Here, however, we  have no occasion to  decide whether\r\n\nunpaid child  support substantially affects  interstate commerce;\r\n\nwe  instead  uphold the  CSRA  under the  second  Commerce Clause\r\n\ncategory   because   it   regulates   things   (namely,   payment\r\n\nobligations) in interstate commerce.\r\n\n          There is another, more basic reason why Lopez does  not\r                                                                 \r\n\nassist the  appellant's cause.   The concerns articulated  by the\r\n\nLopez  Court simply are  not implicated by  the CSRA.   The Lopez\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt observed that the GFSZA by its terms had no relation to any\r\n\nsort of economic enterprise, and that neither the statute nor its\r\n\nlegislative  history  contained  express  congressional  findings\r\n\npurporting to show the regulated activity's effects on interstate\r\n\ncommerce.   See id. at 1630-32.  In contrast, the CSRA relates to\r                             \r\n\neconomic  transactions, and the  enacting Congress made explicit,\r\n\nwell-documented findings regarding the economic effect of  unpaid\r\n\nchild support  upon interstate commerce.   See, e.g.,  supra Part\r                                                                      \r\n\nII(A).  In the same vein,  the Lopez Court made much of  the fact\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3To the extent  that the  appellant relies on  a quartet  of\r\ndistrict court decisions purposing to strike down the CSRA on the\r\nauthority of  Lopez, his reliance is misplaced.  Two of them have\r                             \r\nbeen reversed by  the Ninth  Circuit.  See  Mussari, 95 F.3d  787\r                                                             \r\n(reversing  United States v. Mussari, 894 F. Supp. 1360 (D.

Such  an element  is conspicuously\r               \r\n\npresent  here,  for   the  CSRA  by   its  terms  provides   that\r\n\njurisdiction will attach only  if child support obligations cross\r\n\nstate lines.

We have found  the presence\r\n\nof  such a jurisdictional element  to be a  powerful argument for\r\n\ndistinguishing Lopez in other cases, see, e.g., United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nDiSanto, 86  F.3d 1238, 1245  (1st Cir. 1996)  (upholding federal\r                 \r\n\narson statute,  18  U.S.C.     844(i)); United  States  v.

This claim hinges on his contention  that the CSRA\r\n\nfalls  beyond Congress'  competence because it  concerns domestic\r\n\nrelations (an area traditionally within the states' domain).   We\r\n\nreject the claim out of hand.\r\n\n          The Tenth Amendment declares that \"powers not delegated\r\n\nto the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to\r\n\nthe  States, are reserved to  the States respectively,  or to the\r\n\npeople.\"   U.S. Const. amend. X.  The amendment is not applicable\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nto situations in which  Congress properly exercises its authority\r\n\nunder an enumerated constitutional power.  See New York v. United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates,  505 U.S. 144, 156  (1992).  Inasmuch  as Congress passed\r                \r\n\nthe CSRA pursuant  to the  valid exercise of  such an  enumerated\r\n\npower  (the power  to regulate  interstate commerce),  that tenet\r\n\ngoverns here.   Accord Hampshire,  95 F.3d at  1004; Mussari,  95\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d at 791.\r\n\n          What is  more, a  Tenth Amendment attack  on a  federal\r\n\nstatute  cannot  succeed  without  three ingredients:    (1)  the\r\n\nstatute must regulate the \"States as States,\" (2) it must concern\r\n\nattributes of state  sovereignty, and (3)  it must  be of such  a\r\n\nnature that compliance with it would impair a state's ability \"to\r\n\nstructure   integral   operations   in   areas   of   traditional\r\n\ngovernmental  functions.\"   Hodel  v. Virginia  Surface Mining  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nReclam.

It  does not interfere with state law.\r\n\nTo the  contrary, the  CSRA comes  into play only  after a  state\r\n\ncourt issues a  child support order, and it does  not authorize a\r\n\nfederal court to revise the  underlying decree.  Because Congress\r\n\nsucceeded  in drafting the CSRA \"to  strengthen, not to supplant,\r\n\nState enforcement efforts,\" 138 Cong. Rec. at H7326 (statement of\r\n\nRep. Hyde), the law withstands Tenth Amendment scrutiny.\r\n\n          In this  wise, the appellant's analogy  to the domestic\r\n\nrelations exception to the federal courts' diversity jurisdiction\r\n\nis  bootless.   The CSRA  contemplates criminal  prosecutions (in\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nwhich federal jurisdiction runs nationwide, see 18 U.S.C.    3231\r                                                         \r\n\n(1994);  see also DiSanto, 86  F.3d at 1246),  not civil actions;\r                                   \r\n\nand,  insofar as civil analogues might  be helpful, the existence\r\n\nof the CSRA itself  by analogy supplies an independent  basis for\r\n\nfederal jurisdiction because CSRA cases are cases \"arising under\"\r\n\na federal  statute, and thus  more evocative of 28  U.S.C.   1331\r\n\nthan of 28 U.S.C.   1332.\r\n\n          This leaves  only federalism and comity.   However, the\r\n\nappellant's emphasis  on these aspirational doctrines  cannot tip\r\n\nthe  balance.    While  federalism  and  comity  are  matters  of\r\n\nlegitimate concern,  they are not  grounds upon which  courts may\r\n\ndeclare federal statutes unconstitutional.\r\n\n              D.

Appellate judges are not clairvoyants,\r\n\nand it is surpassingly difficult for  us to make something out of\r\n\nnothing.  Cf.

THE LEGALITY OF THE SENTENCE\r          III.  THE LEGALITY OF THE SENTENCE\r\n\n          The   appellant   contends   that   the   \"intermittent\r\n\nconfinement\" condition of his  probation exceeds the maximum term\r\n\nof imprisonment authorized by the statute of conviction.  Because\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4We  have considered  all  the  points,  constitutional  and\r\nnonconstitutional, to which the appellant alludes  in challenging\r\nhis  conviction.   None  have the  potential  to justify  relief.\r\nThose  that  we  have  not  specifically  identified  are  either\r\nunpreserved, or unworthy of discussion, or both.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nBongiorno did not raise this contention in the district court, we\r\n\nreview it  only for plain error.  See United States v. Olano, 507\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 725, 731-32 (1993); Taylor, 54 F.3d at 972.\r                                         \r\n\n          Bongiorno is a  first offender who, under the CSRA, can\r\n\nbe  imprisoned for  no more  than six  months.   See 18  U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n228(b)(1).  Nevertheless, a sentencing court can impose probation\r\n\nfor up  to five years, see  18 U.S.C.   3561(a)  &amp; (c)(2) (1994),\r                                    \r\n\nand, as a condition of probation, the court in its discretion may\r\n\nrequire a defendant  to \"remain in  the custody of the  Bureau of\r\n\nPrisons  during nights,  weekends,  or other  intervals of  time,\r\n\ntotaling  no more  than the  lesser of  one year  or the  term of\r\n\nimprisonment authorized for the offense, during the first year of\r\n\nthe  term  of  probation.\"    18  U.S.C.     3563(b)(11)  (1994).\r\n\nInvoking  this  discretionary  power, the  trial  court sentenced\r\n\nBongiorno to five years of probation, on condition that he remain\r\n\nin  custody  for twelve  hours per  day  during the  first twelve\r\n\nmonths of the probationary  term.  Judge Keeton reasoned  that if\r\n\n\"the defendant [were]  in the  custody of the  Bureau of  Prisons\r\n\ntwelve hours during  each night, that total time in  a year would\r\n\nbe  six months\"  and  therefore would  not  exceed the  statutory\r\n\nmaximum.\r\n\n          On  appeal     the  district court  having  stayed  the\r\n\noperation of  the intermittent confinement condition    Bongiorno\r\n\nfaults the  judge's reasoning.  He bases his argument principally\r\n\non  the \"Schedule  of  Substitute Punishments\"  contained in  the\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nfederal sentencing  guidelines.5  But, the  sentencing guidelines\r\n\ndo not affect this case; a first offense for a willful failure to\r\n\npay  child  support  is  a  Class  B  misdemeanor  to  which  the\r\n\nguidelines do not apply.  See U.S.S.G.  2J1.1, comment. (n.2).6\r                                       \r\n\n          Moving beyond the guidelines, the  appellant's position\r\n\nis  also  unsound because  it rests  on  an interpretation  of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   3563(b)(11)  that offends a  bedrock maxim of  statutory\r\n\nconstruction:  all words and clauses in a statute are intended to\r\n\nhave meaning and  ought to be  given effect.   See United  States\r                                                                           \r\n\nDep't of Treasury v.

We\r\n\nwill  not  lightly  encroach upon  congressional  prerogative  by\r\n\nreading  words out of a  statute, see United  States v. Victoria-\r                                                                           \r\n\nPeguero,  920 F.2d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n932  (1991),  and there  is  no  warrant  for  doing so  in  this\r\n\ninstance.7\r\n\n          In all events,  the appellant did  not raise the  point\r\n\nbelow,  and we  discern no  plain error.   The  appellant himself\r\n\nconcedes that straight imprisonment for  six months would be more\r\n\nonerous  than intermittent confinement for one year.  At the same\r\n\ntime, the  lower  court's work-release  arrangement advances  the\r\n\nCSRA's primary objective of encouraging child support payments by\r\n\naffording  the   appellant  an   opportunity   to  practice   his\r\n\nprofession.    Given  these  verities,  it  is evident  that  the\r\n\nsentencing order works no injustice.  It follows that the alleged\r\n\ninterpretive  error cannot amount to plain error.  See Olano, 507\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 732; Taylor, 54 F.3d at 973.\r                             \r\n\nIV.  THE GRASP OF THE FEDERAL DEBT COLLECTION PROCEDURE ACT\r          IV.  THE GRASP OF THE FEDERAL DEBT COLLECTION PROCEDURE ACT\r\n\n          We turn now to the appeal in the civil case.  That case\r\n\nbegan  when the  United States  invoked the  FDCPA and  sought to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The  appellant also  asseverates  that  the district  court\r\nfailed  to  satisfy  the  statutory  stricture  that  requires  a\r\ndistrict  court,  among  other   things,  to  impose  a  sentence\r\nsufficient but not greater than necessary to reflect the severity\r\nof  the offense, promote respect for the law, and afford adequate\r\ndeterrence.  See  18 U.S.C.   3553(a)(1)-(2).   This asseveration\r                          \r\nis  meritless.   The sentence  artfully balances  the appellant's\r\npersistent  disregard  of  child   support  obligations  and  the\r\ndesirability  of deterrence against his need for liberty if he is\r\nto earn the money to which his minor daughter is entitled.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\ncompel Bongiorno to pay the arrearage owed as back child support.\r\n\nThe government assumed  that since Bongiorno had  been ordered to\r\n\nmake restitution of this sum as part of the punishment imposed in\r\n\nthe  criminal case,  it had  access to  the FDCPA  as a  means of\r\n\ncollecting the debt.  The district court honored the government's\r\n\nassumption  and granted  a  writ  of  garnishment.    On  appeal,\r\n\nBongiorno maintains that the  court should have defenestrated the\r\n\ncivil action because  a restitution order issued pursuant  to the\r\n\nCSRA is not a \"debt\" within the meaning of the FDCPA.  We agree.\r\n\n                          A.  The FDCPA.\r                                    A.

No.  101-647, 104 Stat. 4933,\r\n\neffective May 29, 1991, thus creating a framework under which the\r\n\nUnited  States might more  efficiently collect debts  owed to it.\r\n\nThe framework includes procedures that the government can utilize\r\n\nto recover on, or secure, such debts, and to that extent relieves\r\n\nthe  federal sovereign's  need to  rely on  a patchwork  of state\r\n\nlaws.  See H.R. Rep.  No. 101-736, at 23-25 (1990),  reprinted in\r                                                                           \r\n\n1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6472, 6631-33; see also Selbe v.

Consistent  with this goal, Congress  \"defined [`debt']\r\n\nbroadly  to include amounts owing to the United States on account\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nof a  direct loan  or loan insured  or guaranteed  by the  United\r\n\nStates  as  well  as  other amounts  originally  due  the  United\r\n\nStates.\"   Id. at 28, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6636.

This approach  squares\r\n\nneatly with the statute  and its legislative history.   The types\r\n\nand kinds of debts  enumerated in section 3002(3)    for example,\r\n\n\"a direct loan,\" an \"insured or guaranteed\" loan, an amount owing\r\n\nas an  unpaid \"fee\" or  \"duty\"   seem to  contemplate payments in\r\n\nwhich  the  government  has  a  direct   pecuniary  stake.    The\r\n\nlegislative  history sounds much the  same theme.   See H.R. Rep.\r                                                                 \r\n\nNo. 101-736, supra, at 23, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6631.\r                            \r\n\n                   B.

The Status of the Debt.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Mindful  of the statutory  definitions, the legislative\r\n\nhistory,  and the way in which courts have approached the problem\r\n\nof determining which debts are within the FDCPA's grasp and which\r\n\nare not, we conclude that inclusion necessitates an inquiry aimed\r\n\nat determining to whom the debt  is owed and to whose benefit the\r\n\nproceeds of the  debt will inure  when it is  paid.  At the  very\r\n\nleast, a debt cannot qualify if both parts of  this inquiry point\r\n\ntoward  exclusion:  a debt cannot be eligible for inclusion under\r\n\nthe FDCPA  if the United States  is neither the formal  owner nor\r\n\nthe direct beneficiary of it.  In all events, the debt must clear\r\n\nan additional  hurdle:  it must  be one that, in  the parlance of\r\n\nthe  statute, \"is  not  owing  under  the  terms  of  a  contract\r\n\noriginally  entered into by  only persons  other than  the United\r\n\nStates.\"  28 U.S.C.   3002(3).9\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9In passing  the FDCPA, Congress  evinced a clear  intent to\r\nexclude  private transactions     debts created  under (and  thus\r\ngoverned by) state law, and to which the United States was not an\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n          To be sure,  the district court  made no such  inquiry,\r\n\nbut instead  allowed the government's  application for a  writ of\r\n\ngarnishment  in a  margin  order after  striking the  appellant's\r\n\npleadings.  Before us, however, the government has not raised any\r\n\nprocedural objections or technical defenses.  Rather, it concedes\r\n\nthat  it can  employ  the FDCPA  only  if the  restitution  order\r\n\nconstitutes  a debt  within  the  meaning  of  the  FDCPA.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAppellee's Brief at 9.  The  parties have briefed and argued this\r\n\nissue  on the  merits without  reservation, and  it is  therefore\r\n\nwithin our  proper province to determine  whether the restitution\r\n\norder  that the  government  seeks to  enforce  comes within  the\r\n\npenumbra of the FDCPA.\r\n\n          The  government's affirmative  answer to  this question\r\n\nleans  heavily on  the majority  opinion in  NLRB v.  E.D.P. Med.\r                                                                           \r\n\nComputer Sys.,  Inc., 6 F.3d 951  (2d Cir. 1993).   In that case,\r                              \r\n\nthe Second Circuit considered whether a  backpay award decreed by\r\n\nthe National  Labor Relations  Board (NLRB) to  remedy an  unfair\r\n\nlabor practice constituted a debt to the United States within the\r\n\npurview of the  FDCPA.  The  panel divided over  the issue.   The\r\n\nmajority started by holding that the award was a debt due  to the\r\n\nfederal  government since it had been imposed on the defendant by\r\n\na federal agency:\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\noriginal party   from the grasp of the  FDCPA.

In this vein,\r                        \r\na main proponent of the bill emphasized that to warrant inclusion\r\nthe  transaction underlying  the debt  must be  one in  which the\r\ngovernment was  a direct, original  participant.   See 136  Cong.\r                                                                \r\nRec. H13288, supra.

The Board serves as more  than a\r\n          mere  conduit when it  initiates an action to\r\n          collect a backpay award.\r\n\nId.  at 955.  Having  stated this proposition,  the majority then\r             \r\n\nskimmed over  the beneficial ownership aspect,  gave great weight\r\n\nto the fact that without federal intervention the award could not\r\n\nbe  collected,10 and ruled that the FDCPA  applied.

See  29 U.S.C.    151-169 (1994).   In such\r                                   \r\ncircumstances,  the NLRB is the  only entity empowered  by law to\r\nenforce  the   award.     See  Amalgamated  Utility   Workers  v.\r                                                                       \r\nConsolidated   Edison   Co.,   309  U.S.   261,   264-70   (1940)\r                                     \r\n(interpreting 29 U.S.C.   160(a)).\r\n\n     11The appellant's  ex-wife and minor daughter have available\r\nmechanisms to enforce the CSRA restitution order, see 18 U.S.C.  \r                                                               \r\n3663(h)  (1994) (providing that an order of restitution in a CSRA\r\ncase may  be enforced either by the United States or \"by a victim\r\nnamed  in the  order\"),  as  well  as  the  child  support  order\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nguidance for us than does the majority opinion.  While there  may\r\n\nbe a somewhat stronger  argument for regarding a debt as owing to\r\n\nthe  United States if the  federal government is  the only entity\r\n\nable  to recover it (the E.D.P. scenario), the decision to extend\r                                         \r\n\nthe FDCPA to such a situation is a decision properly reserved for\r\n\nthe  legislative  branch.    Because  the  statute,  as  written,\r\n\ncontains  no  language  suggesting  that  all  debts  subject  to\r\n\nexclusive federal  enforcement are  included within the  grasp of\r\n\nthe FDCPA,  we find the position taken  by the E.D.P. majority to\r                                                               \r\n\nbe unsatisfactory.\r\n\n          The  force of  Judge  Walker's opinion  is  but one  of\r\n\nseveral factors that influence our judgment.  The  most important\r\n\nfactor is the language and purpose of the statute itself.  Nearly\r\n\nas  telling is a mature  but still viable  precedent.  Forty-five\r\n\nyears  ago, the  Supreme  Court  wrestled  with  a  very  similar\r\n\nquestion  under the Bankruptcy Act.   See Nathanson  v. NLRB, 344\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 25 (1952).   The  statutory scheme that  the Court  pondered\r\n\nused  a concept  of    public debt  that  bears a  strong  family\r\n\nresemblance to the  concept that  fuels the FDCPA.   It  provided\r\n\nthat, with exceptions  not relevant here,  \"debts owing to .  . .\r\n\nthe United  States\"  would  \"have  priority, in  advance  of  the\r\n\npayment of dividends  to creditors.\"   11 U.S.C.    104(a)  (West\r\n\nSupp.  1952) (repealed 1978).   The  precise question  before the\r\n\nNathanson Court was whether  an NLRB award for backpay was a debt\r                   \r\n\nowing  to the United States  (and, thus, entitled  to priority in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nunderlying it.\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nbankruptcy).  The Court  acknowledged that the NLRB was  an agent\r\n\nof  the  United  States and  a  creditor  (being  the only  party\r\n\nentitled to enforce the claim), but stated that it did not follow\r\n\nthat the debt was  owing to the United States  within the meaning\r\n\nof the Bankruptcy Act.   344 U.S. at 27.  Priority  in bankruptcy\r\n\nwas intended \"to secure an adequate revenue to sustain the public\r\n\nburthens and  discharge the public debts,\"  yet granting priority\r\n\nin  this  instance would  not  further  those  goals because  the\r\n\nbeneficiaries  of the claim were  private persons.   Id. at 27-28\r                                                                  \r\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  On this  basis,\r\n\nthe Court concluded  that the  debt was  not owed  to the  United\r\n\nStates  in the relevant sense  and therefore was  not entitled to\r\n\nthe statutory priority.  See id. at 28.\r                                          \r\n\n          Nathanson bears a close affinity to this case.  For one\r                             \r\n\nthing, the language of the FDCPA parallels that of the bankruptcy\r\n\nprovision  discussed  in  Nathanson.    For  another  thing,  the\r                                             \r\n\nlegislative  purpose underlying  the  FDCPA is  analogous to  the\r\n\nlegislative purpose  distilled by the Nathanson  Court.  Congress\r                                                         \r\n\nenacted  the FDCPA to relieve  the strain on  the federal deficit\r\n\ncreated  by persistent  nonpayment of  debts owed  to the  United\r\n\nStates.     See  H.R.  Rep.  No.  101-736,  supra,  at  23,  1990\r                                                           \r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N.  at 6631.   This  mirrors the  congressional concern\r\n\nthat drove the bankruptcy  priority provision which the Nathanson\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt was called upon  to construe.  See  Nathanson, 344 U.S.  at\r                                                             \r\n\n27-28.    Accordingly,  in  both  the FDCPA  and  the  bankruptcy\r\n\nmilieux, the  statutory mechanism does not  serve the legislative\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\npurpose  except  when  it operates  in  regard  to  a debt  whose\r\n\nrecovery will  directly augment  the public  coffers.   Since the\r\n\ndynamic in  this  case tracks  the dynamic  that was  at work  in\r\n\nNathanson   the relation  of the government's beneficial interest\r                   \r\n\nin  the debt  to the  statutory scheme  is very  much the  same  \r\n\nNathanson's ratio decidendi controls our deliberations.\r                                     \r\n\n          The force  of this conclusion is  not dissipated merely\r\n\nbecause the  government secured the restitutionary  order.  After\r\n\nall, Nathanson instructs us to look beyond such formalities.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at 28  (explaining that a  court must refuse  to treat as  an\r             \r\n\nincluded  debt \"a claim which the United States is collecting for\r\n\nthe benefit of  a private party\").  In  this case, the government\r\n\nis not the holder  of the debt in  any legally cognizable  sense,\r\n\nand it seeks to collect restitution not to its own behoof but for\r\n\nthe benefit of a  private party (Bongiorno's daughter).   Because\r\n\nthe  order  of  restitution here     like  the  backpay award  in\r\n\nNathanson    involves no direct pecuniary interest of the federal\r                   \r\n\nsovereign, it does not create  a debt owing to the  United States\r\n\nwithin the meaning of the FDCPA.\r\n\n          The  government  also tries  to  dodge  this bullet  by\r\n\ntouting its  indirect interest  in the award.   It tells  us that\r                               \r\n\npublic  assistance substitutes for most  of the $5 billion annual\r\n\nshortfall  in  unpaid child  support, and  that  there is  thus a\r\n\ndemonstrable public  interest in enforcing  restitutionary orders\r\n\nissued  in CSRA cases.  We  agree that this is  an area of public\r\n\nconcern, but  that is beside the  point.  A similar  sort of \"for\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nthe general good\"  argument was  made to, and  dismissed by,  the\r\n\nNathanson  Court.   See  id.  (rejecting  the argument  that  the\r                                      \r\n\ngovernment's  abiding   interest  in  eliminating   unfair  labor\r\n\npractices warranted stretching the statute to secure a preference\r\n\nin payment for backpay  awards).  The sockdolager, of  course, is\r\n\nthat  Bongiorno's daughter is not  on the welfare  rolls.  Hence,\r\n\nthe government has failed  to show any direct  pecuniary interest\r\n\nof a kind  that would render this debt collectible  by the United\r\n\nStates under the FDCPA.\r\n\n          The government has  one last  shot in its  sling:   the\r\n\nFDCPA  specifically mentions \"restitution\"  among the  classes of\r\n\nincluded  debt, see 28 U.S.C.   3002(3)(B) (quoted supra note 8),\r                                                                  \r\n\nand  the  government posits  that we  need  not look  beyond this\r\n\nlabel.   The argument  will not wash.   The FDCPA  does not state\r\n\nthat every order  of restitution,  no more than  every \"rent\"  or\r                    \r\n\nevery  type of  \"reimbursement,\"  constitutes  an included  debt.\r\n\nRather,   the   text  limits   the  statute's   applicability  to\r\n\nrestitution  that implicates  a  \"source of  indebtedness to  the\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).\r                              \r\n\n          This   added  language  reintroduces   the  concept  of\r\n\nbenefit.    Some  restitutionary  orders create  debts  that  owe\r\n\nbeneficially  to the federal government  and thus fall within the\r\n\npurview of the FDCPA.   A prototypical  case is United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGelb,  783  F.  Supp.   748  (E.D.N.Y.  1991).

Since that statute declares\r\n\nthat a convicted person  must \"forfeit to the United  States\" any\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nill-gotten  gains, see  18 U.S.C.    1963(a) (1994),  the federal\r                                \r\n\ngovernment is the direct beneficiary of the restitution order and\r\n\nthe order thus creates a  debt collectible under the FDCPA.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGelb, 783  F. Supp.  at 752.    But other  types of  restitution,\r              \r\n\nwhich,  when  paid,  will  not  increase  public  revenues  (say,\r\n\nrestitution  to an  individual victim  of a  crime), do  not come\r\n\nwithin the statutory encincture.   In short, we cannot  isolate a\r\n\nsingle word     \"restitution\"    and  conclude that  every  order\r\n\nbearing that label automatically  falls within the FDCPA's grasp.\r\n\nThe  federal   government  may  collect  under   the  FDCPA  only\r\n\nrestitution that is  \"owing to the United  States.\"  28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n3002(3).\r\n\n          We  end where  we began.   Because  restitution ordered\r\n\nunder  the  CSRA  is  not  owed  to  the   United  States  in  an\r\n\neconomically meaningful sense, the  government cannot utilize the\r\n\nFDCPA  as a vehicle for collecting such  awards.  On this view of\r\n\nthe case, we do not  reach the question of whether the  debt must\r\n\nbe considered  as private in  character (and thus  ineligible for\r\n\ninclusion  under the FDCPA on  that basis) because  a state court\r\n\norder created  the underlying child support  obligation, and both\r\n\nthe obligor and obligee are private parties.12\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12We note in passing that a cogent argument can  be made for\r\nthe proposition that  what started as a debt  owed by one private\r\nparty (Bongiorno)  to another (Taylor, on behalf  of the couple's\r\ndaughter) remains so in  its collection, and that the  peripheral\r\ninvolvement  of  the  federal  government  does  not  change  the\r\nobligation's  inherently private character.   Indeed, the belated\r\nfederal entry into this situation bears a striking resemblance to\r\nthe  \"failed  thrift\"  example   that  Chairman  Brooks  used  to\r\nillustrate  a debt that would be excluded from the FDCPA's grasp.\r                                                   \r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          Because  the government  sued  under  an  inappropriate\r\n\nstatute, we must reverse the judgment in the civil case.  This is\r\n\nnot to say, however, that the appellant can thumb his nose at the\r\n\nrestitution  order.  Payment of restitution is a condition of his\r\n\nprobation,  and  the  government   has  adequate  remedies  if  a\r\n\nconvicted defendant  flouts a condition of probation.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n18 U.S.C.    3663(g), 3583(e) (1994).   The government, moreover,\r\n\ncan attempt to collect  the restitution order by resort  to other\r\n\ncivil  remedies, see  28  U.S.C.    3003(b)  (providing that  the\r                              \r\n\nUnited  States retains  its authority under  laws other  than the\r\n\nFDCPA to collect debts owed to the  government); see also Fed.

But  to allow\r                                                  \r\n\nthe federal government  to proceed  under the FDCPA  for no  more\r\n\npersuasive reason than that collecting the debt serves the public\r\n\ninterest  would cavalierly  consign Nathanson  to the  scrap heap\r                                                       \r\n\nand, in the bargain, expand the FDCPA's scope without limitation.\r\n\nWe are not at liberty to chart so free-wheeling a course.\r\n\nV.

This particular\r\n\npassage  revolves  around  the  constitutionality  of  the  Child\r\n\nSupport  Recovery Act  (CSRA), 18  U.S.C.    228 (1994),  and the\r\n\nfederal government's authority, if any, to collect restitutionary\r\n\npayments ordered under the  CSRA by recourse to the  Federal Debt\r\n\nCollection Procedure Act (FDCPA),  28 U.S.C.    3001-3308 (1994).\r\n\nThe CSRA issue is new  to us and the FDCPA issue has  not, to our\r\n\nknowledge, been addressed by any court of appeals.  After sorting\r\n\nthrough  these  and  other  arcana,  we  reject  the  defendant's\r\n\nchallenge to his criminal conviction and sentence, holding, among\r\n\nother  things, that  Congress did  not exceed  the bounds  of its\r\n\nconstitutional power  in enacting  the CSRA.    Turning to  post-\r\n\nconviction  events, we  hold  that the  federal government  lacks\r\n\nauthority  to proceed against a \"deadbeat dad\" by using the FDCPA\r\n\nas an instrument  for enforcing a restitutionary  order issued in\r\n\nconnection with an antecedent criminal conviction.\r\n\nI.  SETTING THE STAGE\r          I.  SETTING THE STAGE\r\n\n          In October 1990 a Georgia state court entered  a decree\r\n\nending Sandra  Taylor's marriage to defendant-appellant  Frank P.\r\n\nBongiorno,  granting   Taylor  custody  of  the   couple's  minor\r\n\ndaughter, and directing  Bongiorno (a  physician specializing  in\r\n\nbariatric  surgery)  to pay  $5,000 per  month in  child support.\r\n\nShortly    thereafter,   mother   and    daughter   repaired   to\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nMassachusetts.  When Bongiorno  subsequently sought to modify the\r\n\nchild  support award,  Taylor counterclaimed  on the  ground that\r\n\nBongiorno  had failed  to  make the  payments  stipulated in  the\r\n\noriginal  decree.   In  September  1992 the  Georgia  court found\r\n\nBongiorno in contempt  for failing  to pay upward  of $75,000  in\r\n\nmandated child support and directed that he be incarcerated until\r\n\nhe had purged  the contempt.   Bongiorno avoided immurement  only\r\n\nbecause he had accepted  a position in Michigan and  the contempt\r\n\norder did not operate extraterritorially.\r\n\n          Once in Michigan,  Bongiorno made sporadic payments  of\r\n\nchild  support despite the fact  that his new  post paid $200,000\r\n\nper year.  In March 1993 a Michigan state court domesticated  the\r\n\nGeorgia support order  and authorized garnishment  of Bongiorno's\r\n\nwages  to satisfy  the accumulated  arrearage.   Soon thereafter,\r\n\nBongiorno  quit his  job  and paid  only  $500 a  month  in child\r\n\nsupport from June to December 1993.  In early 1994 Bongiorno went\r\n\nto  work for the  State of Michigan.   That May  a Michigan state\r\n\ncourt  issued an order enforcing the Georgia support award to the\r\n\nextent of $300 per week.1   Bongiorno failed to satisfy even this\r\n\nmodest impost.\r\n\n          Approximately  one  year  later  the  federal  behemoth\r\n\nstirred; the  United States charged Bongiorno  with violating the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Differences  in  state  law  explain  this  ceiling.    The\r\nMichigan court applied Michigan's child support guidelines, Mich.\r\nComp.  Laws    552.519  (1988), to  determine  a current  support\r\nobligation  and  then  added  a  premium to  be  applied  against\r\nBongiorno's accumulated arrearages.  Neither the propriety of the\r\nceiling nor the Michigan court's treatment of the Georgia court's\r\ndecree is at issue here.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nCSRA.     Because   Bongiorno's   minor   daughter  has   resided\r\n\ncontinuously in Massachusetts from  1990 forward (albeit with her\r\n\ngrandmother  for much  of  that time),  the government  preferred\r\n\ncharges  in that  district.   Bongiorno  moved unsuccessfully  to\r\n\ndismiss  the indictment on the ground that the CSRA represents an\r\n\nunconstitutional exercise of  Congress' power under  the Commerce\r\n\nClause.  At an ensuing bench trial, the district court determined\r\n\nthat Bongiorno had possessed the ability to pay $5,000 monthly in\r\n\nthe 1992-1993  time frame, but that  he had chosen not  to do so.\r\n\nConsequently, the court found Bongiorno guilty of willful failure\r\n\nto  pay  child  support  and  sentenced  him  to  five  years  of\r\n\nprobation.   As  a condition  of probation,  the court  imposed a\r\n\nwork-release  arrangement,  directing Bongiorno  to  spend up  to\r\n\ntwelve hours  per day in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for\r\n\nthe first  year of his  probation.  As  a further condition,  the\r\n\ncourt  ordered  restitution  in the  sum  of  $220,000 (a  figure\r\n\napproximating the total arrearage then outstanding).\r\n\n          Not  content with its  apparent victory, the government\r\n\ncommenced  a civil  proceeding  under the  FDCPA  as a  means  of\r\n\nenforcing  the  restitutionary  order.    After  some  procedural\r\n\nwrangling, the  court granted  the government's motion  to attach\r\n\nBongiorno's wages and disburse the proceeds.\r\n\n          Bongiorno filed  timely appeals  in both cases,  and we\r\n\nheard the appeals in  tandem.  We now  affirm the conviction  and\r\n\nsentence  in the criminal case,  but reverse the  judgment in the\r\n\ncivil case.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nII.  THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CHILD SUPPORT RECOVERY ACT\r          II.  THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CHILD SUPPORT RECOVERY ACT\r\n\n          Bongiorno challenges his conviction principally  on the\r\n\nground that the CSRA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress'\r\n\nauthority  under  the   Commerce  Clause.    We  review  de  novo\r\n\nconstitutional challenges to federal statutes.  See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

The House Judiciary\r\n\nCommittee  observed  that  of  $16.3  billion  in  child  support\r\n\npayments  due in  1989, only  $11.2 billion  was paid,  leaving a\r\n\nshortfall  of  approximately  $5  billion to  be  offset  largely\r\n\nthrough government assistance.   See H.R. Rep. No. 102-771,  at 5\r                                              \r\n\n(1992).   The Committee  concluded that  \"the  annual deficit  in\r\n\nchild support payments remains unacceptably high,\" especially \"in\r\n\ninterstate  collection  cases, where  enforcement  of  support is\r\n\nparticularly  difficult.\"   Id.   To illustrate  this point,  the\r                                         \r\n\nCommittee noted  that one-third of all  uncollected child support\r\n\nobligations  involved non-custodial  fathers living out  of state\r\n\nand that roughly fifty-seven percent of the custodial  parents in\r\n\nsuch situations received  support payments \"occasionally,  seldom\r\n\nor never.\"  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          Because   Congress   doubted   the    states'   ability\r\n\nefficaciously to enforce support orders beyond their own borders,\r\n\nsee  id.  at  6  (recognizing that  \"interstate  extradition  and\r                  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nenforcement in fact remains a tedious, cumbersome and slow method\r\n\nof collection\"),  it devised a  federal solution hoping  that the\r\n\nnew  law    the  CSRA    would  prevent delinquent  parents  from\r\n\n\"mak[ing] a mockery of State law by fleeing across State lines to\r\n\navoid  enforcement  actions by  State  courts  and child  support\r\n\nagencies.\"  138 Cong. Rec. H7324, H7326 (daily ed.  Aug. 4, 1992)\r\n\n(statement  of Rep.  Hyde).   In  final  form the  statute  makes\r\n\nwillful  failure  \"to pay  a  past  due  support obligation  with\r\n\nrespect to a child who resides in another State\" a federal crime.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   228(a).  A \"past due support obligation\" is an amount\r\n\ndetermined under  a state  court order  that either  has remained\r\n\nunpaid for more than one year or is greater than $5,000.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n   228(d)(1).

It  follows inexorably that  Congress lawfully can  pass\r\n\nlegislation  designed  to   prevent  the   frustration  of   such\r\n\ninterstate  transactions.

It regulates the nonpayment of\r\n\ninterstate  child  support obligations.    Because  child support\r\n\norders  that require a parent in one  state to make payments to a\r\n\nperson in another state are functionally equivalent to interstate\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ncontracts,  see  Sage,  92  F.3d  at  106,  such  obligations are\r                               \r\n\n\"things\" in  interstate commerce.   Thus,  it is  appropriate for\r\n\nCongress   to   enact  legislation   that   will   prevent  their\r\n\nnonfulfillment.  On this  basis, the CSRA is a  valid exercise of\r\n\ncongressional power under the Commerce Clause.  See Hampshire, 95\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 1003-04 (upholding  the constitutionality of the CSRA  on\r\n\nthe ground that it regulates \"what is essentially nonpayment of a\r\n\ndebt where  the  judgment creditor  and  judgment debtor  are  in\r\n\ndifferent states\");  Mussari, 95 F.3d  at 790 (reaching  the same\r                                      \r\n\nconclusion and observing that a  delinquent parent's \"intentional\r\n\nrefusal to satisfy the debt is as much an obstruction of commerce\r\n\nbetween the states  as any act of extortion  made unlawful by the\r\n\nHobbs  Act\");  Sage,   92  F.3d  at  105-06  (reaching  the  same\r                             \r\n\nconclusion and  observing that Congress \"surely  has power [under\r\n\nthe Commerce  Clause] to prevent the frustration of an obligation\r\n\nto engage in interstate commerce\").\r\n\n          The appellant makes  two last-ditch  arguments on  this\r\n\npoint.  First, he  posits that cases such as  Hampshire, Mussari,\r                                                                          \r\n\nand Sage went  awry because they did not recognize  that the CSRA\r                  \r\n\nis different from other federal  statutes enacted under the aegis\r\n\nof the  Commerce Clause.   The difference,  he says, is  that the\r\n\nunderlying  payment   obligation      the  child   support  order\r\n\nsimpliciter   is  a creature of state law.   This circumstance is\r\n\nfribbling.    South-Eastern  Underwriters  illustrates  that  the\r                                                   \r\n\nstate-law origins of an  obligation do not preclude  the exercise\r\n\nof  congressional power  under the  Commerce  Clause.   The Court\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nthere held, 322 U.S. at 546-47, that a fire insurance transaction\r\n\nacross state lines constituted commerce among the several states,\r\n\nnotwithstanding that  the insurance policy itself  was a personal\r\n\ncontract  subject to state law.  The same principle obtains here:\r\n\nalthough the underlying child support order is a product of state\r\n\nlaw, the  delinquent parent's location vis- -vis  the minor child\r\n\ncreates interstate nexus  in the  form of an  obligation to  make\r\n\nregular  payments  across state  boundaries.    Indeed, the  CSRA\r\n\napplies only when the  state-imposed child support order develops\r                      \r\n\nan interstate character, necessitating  the sending of money from\r\n\none state to another by the obligor.  When that occurs, the child\r\n\nsupport  obligation  lies  in  interstate  commerce,  subject  to\r\n\nfederal  regulation,   and  Congress  may  act   to  prevent  its\r\n\nfrustration.\r\n\n          The appellant's second argument posits that uncollected\r\n\nsupport  payments  have  too  tenuous  an  impact  on  interstate\r\n\ncommerce  to  justify the  exercise  of  congressional authority.\r\n\nThis argument  relies heavily on Lopez, a case in which the Court\r                                                \r\n\nstruck  down the Gun-Free School  Zones Act (GFSZA),  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n922(q)(1)(A),  which criminalized  the possession of  firearms in\r\n\nlocal school  zones.  Holding  that Congress  exceeded its  power\r\n\nunder  the Commerce Clause when it enacted the statute, the Court\r\n\nreasoned  that gun  possession  in a  local  school zone  is  not\r\n\neconomic activity of a type that substantially affects interstate\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\ncommerce.   See Lopez, 115 S.  Ct. at 1634.   Lopez is inapposite\r                                                             \r\n\nhere.3  The Lopez majority  considered only the third, \"affecting\r                           \r\n\ninterstate  commerce,\"  branch   of  Commerce  Clause  authority,\r\n\ndismissing the first two bases as patently inapplicable.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 1630.   Here, however, we  have no occasion to  decide whether\r\n\nunpaid child  support substantially affects  interstate commerce;\r\n\nwe  instead  uphold the  CSRA  under the  second  Commerce Clause\r\n\ncategory   because   it   regulates   things   (namely,   payment\r\n\nobligations) in interstate commerce.\r\n\n          There is another, more basic reason why Lopez does  not\r                                                                 \r\n\nassist the  appellant's cause.   The concerns articulated  by the\r\n\nLopez  Court simply are  not implicated by  the CSRA.   The Lopez\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt observed that the GFSZA by its terms had no relation to any\r\n\nsort of economic enterprise, and that neither the statute nor its\r\n\nlegislative  history  contained  express  congressional  findings\r\n\npurporting to show the regulated activity's effects on interstate\r\n\ncommerce.   See id. at 1630-32.  In contrast, the CSRA relates to\r                             \r\n\neconomic  transactions, and the  enacting Congress made explicit,\r\n\nwell-documented findings regarding the economic effect of  unpaid\r\n\nchild support  upon interstate commerce.   See, e.g.,  supra Part\r                                                                      \r\n\nII(A).

The  CSRA passes  this\r\n\ntest  with flying colors.  It  does not interfere with state law.\r\n\nTo the  contrary, the  CSRA comes  into play only  after a  state\r\n\ncourt issues a  child support order, and it does  not authorize a\r\n\nfederal court to revise the  underlying decree.  Because Congress\r\n\nsucceeded  in drafting the CSRA \"to  strengthen, not to supplant,\r\n\nState enforcement efforts,\" 138 Cong. Rec. at H7326 (statement of\r\n\nRep. Hyde), the law withstands Tenth Amendment scrutiny.\r\n\n          In this  wise, the appellant's analogy  to the domestic\r\n\nrelations exception to the federal courts' diversity jurisdiction\r\n\nis  bootless.   The CSRA  contemplates criminal  prosecutions (in\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nwhich federal jurisdiction runs nationwide, see 18 U.S.C.    3231\r                                                         \r\n\n(1994);  see also DiSanto, 86  F.3d at 1246),  not civil actions;\r                                   \r\n\nand,  insofar as civil analogues might  be helpful, the existence\r\n\nof the CSRA itself  by analogy supplies an independent  basis for\r\n\nfederal jurisdiction because CSRA cases are cases \"arising under\"\r\n\na federal  statute, and thus  more evocative of 28  U.S.C.   1331\r\n\nthan of 28 U.S.C.   1332.\r\n\n          This leaves  only federalism and comity.   However, the\r\n\nappellant's emphasis  on these aspirational doctrines  cannot tip\r\n\nthe  balance.    While  federalism  and  comity  are  matters  of\r\n\nlegitimate concern,  they are not  grounds upon which  courts may\r\n\ndeclare federal statutes unconstitutional.\r\n\n              D.

Nevertheless, a sentencing court can impose probation\r\n\nfor up  to five years, see  18 U.S.C.   3561(a)  &amp; (c)(2) (1994),\r                                    \r\n\nand, as a condition of probation, the court in its discretion may\r\n\nrequire a defendant  to \"remain in  the custody of the  Bureau of\r\n\nPrisons  during nights,  weekends,  or other  intervals of  time,\r\n\ntotaling  no more  than the  lesser of  one year  or the  term of\r\n\nimprisonment authorized for the offense, during the first year of\r\n\nthe  term  of  probation.\"    18  U.S.C.     3563(b)(11)  (1994).\r\n\nInvoking  this  discretionary  power, the  trial  court sentenced\r\n\nBongiorno to five years of probation, on condition that he remain\r\n\nin  custody  for twelve  hours per  day  during the  first twelve\r\n\nmonths of the probationary  term.  Judge Keeton reasoned  that if\r\n\n\"the defendant [were]  in the  custody of the  Bureau of  Prisons\r\n\ntwelve hours during  each night, that total time in  a year would\r\n\nbe  six months\"  and  therefore would  not  exceed the  statutory\r\n\nmaximum.\r\n\n          On  appeal     the  district court  having  stayed  the\r\n\noperation of  the intermittent confinement condition    Bongiorno\r\n\nfaults the  judge's reasoning.  He bases his argument principally\r\n\non  the \"Schedule  of  Substitute Punishments\"  contained in  the\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nfederal sentencing  guidelines.5  But, the  sentencing guidelines\r\n\ndo not affect this case; a first offense for a willful failure to\r\n\npay  child  support  is  a  Class  B  misdemeanor  to  which  the\r\n\nguidelines do not apply.

THE GRASP OF THE FEDERAL DEBT COLLECTION PROCEDURE ACT\r          IV.  THE GRASP OF THE FEDERAL DEBT COLLECTION PROCEDURE ACT\r\n\n          We turn now to the appeal in the civil case.  That case\r\n\nbegan  when the  United States  invoked the  FDCPA and  sought to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The  appellant also  asseverates  that  the district  court\r\nfailed  to  satisfy  the  statutory  stricture  that  requires  a\r\ndistrict  court,  among  other   things,  to  impose  a  sentence\r\nsufficient but not greater than necessary to reflect the severity\r\nof  the offense, promote respect for the law, and afford adequate\r\ndeterrence.  See  18 U.S.C.   3553(a)(1)-(2).   This asseveration\r                          \r\nis  meritless.   The sentence  artfully balances  the appellant's\r\npersistent  disregard  of  child   support  obligations  and  the\r\ndesirability  of deterrence against his need for liberty if he is\r\nto earn the money to which his minor daughter is entitled.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\ncompel Bongiorno to pay the arrearage owed as back child support.\r\n\nThe government assumed  that since Bongiorno had  been ordered to\r\n\nmake restitution of this sum as part of the punishment imposed in\r\n\nthe  criminal case,  it had  access to  the FDCPA  as a  means of\r\n\ncollecting the debt.  The district court honored the government's\r\n\nassumption  and granted  a  writ  of  garnishment.    On  appeal,\r\n\nBongiorno maintains that the  court should have defenestrated the\r\n\ncivil action because  a restitution order issued pursuant  to the\r\n\nCSRA is not a \"debt\" within the meaning of the FDCPA.

At the  very\r\n\nleast, a debt cannot qualify if both parts of  this inquiry point\r\n\ntoward  exclusion:  a debt cannot be eligible for inclusion under\r\n\nthe FDCPA  if the United States  is neither the formal  owner nor\r\n\nthe direct beneficiary of it.  In all events, the debt must clear\r\n\nan additional  hurdle:  it must  be one that, in  the parlance of\r\n\nthe  statute, \"is  not  owing  under  the  terms  of  a  contract\r\n\noriginally  entered into by  only persons  other than  the United\r\n\nStates.\"  28 U.S.C.   3002(3).9\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9In passing  the FDCPA, Congress  evinced a clear  intent to\r\nexclude  private transactions     debts created  under (and  thus\r\ngoverned by) state law, and to which the United States was not an\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\n          To be sure,  the district court  made no such  inquiry,\r\n\nbut instead  allowed the government's  application for a  writ of\r\n\ngarnishment  in a  margin  order after  striking the  appellant's\r\n\npleadings.

In this vein,\r                        \r\na main proponent of the bill emphasized that to warrant inclusion\r\nthe  transaction underlying  the debt  must be  one in  which the\r\ngovernment was  a direct, original  participant.

The Board serves as more  than a\r\n          mere  conduit when it  initiates an action to\r\n          collect a backpay award.\r\n\nId.  at 955.  Having  stated this proposition,  the majority then\r             \r\n\nskimmed over  the beneficial ownership aspect,  gave great weight\r\n\nto the fact that without federal intervention the award could not\r\n\nbe  collected,10 and ruled that the FDCPA  applied.

While there  may\r\n\nbe a somewhat stronger  argument for regarding a debt as owing to\r\n\nthe  United States if the  federal government is  the only entity\r\n\nable  to recover it (the E.D.P. scenario), the decision to extend\r                                         \r\n\nthe FDCPA to such a situation is a decision properly reserved for\r\n\nthe  legislative  branch.    Because  the  statute,  as  written,\r\n\ncontains  no  language  suggesting  that  all  debts  subject  to\r\n\nexclusive federal  enforcement are  included within the  grasp of\r\n\nthe FDCPA,  we find the position taken  by the E.D.P. majority to\r                                                               \r\n\nbe unsatisfactory.\r\n\n          The  force of  Judge  Walker's opinion  is  but one  of\r\n\nseveral factors that influence our judgment.  The  most important\r\n\nfactor is the language and purpose of the statute itself.  Nearly\r\n\nas  telling is a mature  but still viable  precedent.  Forty-five\r\n\nyears  ago, the  Supreme  Court  wrestled  with  a  very  similar\r\n\nquestion  under the Bankruptcy Act.   See Nathanson  v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105037\"><a href=\"/opinion/105037/nathanson-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span>\r                                                                      \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1952).   The  statutory scheme that  the Court  pondered\r\n\nused  a concept  of    public debt  that  bears a  strong  family\r\n\nresemblance to the  concept that  fuels the FDCPA.   It  provided\r\n\nthat, with exceptions  not relevant here,  \"debts owing to .  . .\r\n\nthe United  States\"  would  \"have  priority, in  advance  of  the\r\n\npayment of dividends  to creditors.\"   11 U.S.C.    104(a)  (West\r\n\nSupp.  1952) (repealed 1978).   The  precise question  before the\r\n\nNathanson Court was whether  an NLRB award for backpay was a debt\r                   \r\n\nowing  to the United States  (and, thus, entitled  to priority in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nunderlying it.\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nbankruptcy).  The Court  acknowledged that the NLRB was  an agent\r\n\nof  the  United  States and  a  creditor  (being  the only  party\r\n\nentitled to enforce the claim), but stated that it did not follow\r\n\nthat the debt was  owing to the United States  within the meaning\r\n\nof the Bankruptcy Act.   344 U.S. at 27.  Priority  in bankruptcy\r\n\nwas intended \"to secure an adequate revenue to sustain the public\r\n\nburthens and  discharge the public debts,\"  yet granting priority\r\n\nin  this  instance would  not  further  those  goals because  the\r\n\nbeneficiaries  of the claim were  private persons.   Id. at 27-28\r                                                                  \r\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  On this  basis,\r\n\nthe Court concluded  that the  debt was  not owed  to the  United\r\n\nStates  in the relevant sense  and therefore was  not entitled to\r\n\nthe statutory priority.  See id. at 28.\r                                          \r\n\n          Nathanson bears a close affinity to this case.  For one\r                             \r\n\nthing, the language of the FDCPA parallels that of the bankruptcy\r\n\nprovision  discussed  in  Nathanson.    For  another  thing,  the\r                                             \r\n\nlegislative  purpose underlying  the  FDCPA is  analogous to  the\r\n\nlegislative purpose  distilled by the Nathanson  Court.  Congress\r                                                         \r\n\nenacted  the FDCPA to relieve  the strain on  the federal deficit\r\n\ncreated  by persistent  nonpayment of  debts owed  to the  United\r\n\nStates.     See  H.R.  Rep.  No.  101-736,  supra,  at  23,  1990\r                                                           \r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N.  at 6631.   This  mirrors the  congressional concern\r\n\nthat drove the bankruptcy  priority provision which the Nathanson\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt was called upon  to construe.  See  Nathanson, 344 U.S.  at\r                                                             \r\n\n27-28.    Accordingly,  in  both  the FDCPA  and  the  bankruptcy\r\n\nmilieux, the  statutory mechanism does not  serve the legislative\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\npurpose  except  when  it operates  in  regard  to  a debt  whose\r\n\nrecovery will  directly augment  the public  coffers.   Since the\r\n\ndynamic in  this  case tracks  the dynamic  that was  at work  in\r\n\nNathanson   the relation  of the government's beneficial interest\r                   \r\n\nin  the debt  to the  statutory scheme  is very  much the  same  \r\n\nNathanson's ratio decidendi controls our deliberations.\r                                     \r\n\n          The force  of this conclusion is  not dissipated merely\r\n\nbecause the  government secured the restitutionary  order.  After\r\n\nall, Nathanson instructs us to look beyond such formalities.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at 28  (explaining that a  court must refuse  to treat as  an\r             \r\n\nincluded  debt \"a claim which the United States is collecting for\r\n\nthe benefit of  a private party\").  In  this case, the government\r\n\nis not the holder  of the debt in  any legally cognizable  sense,\r\n\nand it seeks to collect restitution not to its own behoof but for\r\n\nthe benefit of a  private party (Bongiorno's daughter).   Because\r\n\nthe  order  of  restitution here     like  the  backpay award  in\r\n\nNathanson    involves no direct pecuniary interest of the federal\r                   \r\n\nsovereign, it does not create  a debt owing to the  United States\r\n\nwithin the meaning of the FDCPA.\r\n\n          The  government  also tries  to  dodge  this bullet  by\r\n\ntouting its  indirect interest  in the award.   It tells  us that\r                               \r\n\npublic  assistance substitutes for most  of the $5 billion annual\r\n\nshortfall  in  unpaid child  support, and  that  there is  thus a\r\n\ndemonstrable public  interest in enforcing  restitutionary orders\r\n\nissued  in CSRA cases.  We  agree that this is  an area of public\r\n\nconcern, but  that is beside the  point.  A similar  sort of \"for\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nthe general good\"  argument was  made to, and  dismissed by,  the\r\n\nNathanson  Court.   See  id.  (rejecting  the argument  that  the\r                                      \r\n\ngovernment's  abiding   interest  in  eliminating   unfair  labor\r\n\npractices warranted stretching the statute to secure a preference\r\n\nin payment for backpay  awards).  The sockdolager, of  course, is\r\n\nthat  Bongiorno's daughter is not  on the welfare  rolls.  Hence,\r\n\nthe government has failed  to show any direct  pecuniary interest\r\n\nof a kind  that would render this debt collectible  by the United\r\n\nStates under the FDCPA.\r\n\n          The government has  one last  shot in its  sling:   the\r\n\nFDCPA  specifically mentions \"restitution\"  among the  classes of\r\n\nincluded  debt, see 28 U.S.C.   3002(3)(B) (quoted supra note 8),\r                                                                  \r\n\nand  the  government posits  that we  need  not look  beyond this\r\n\nlabel.   The argument  will not wash.   The FDCPA  does not state\r\n\nthat every order  of restitution,  no more than  every \"rent\"  or\r                    \r\n\nevery  type of  \"reimbursement,\"  constitutes  an included  debt.\r\n\nRather,   the   text  limits   the  statute's   applicability  to\r\n\nrestitution  that implicates  a  \"source of  indebtedness to  the\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States.\"  Id. (emphasis supplied).\r                              \r\n\n          This   added  language  reintroduces   the  concept  of\r\n\nbenefit.    Some  restitutionary  orders create  debts  that  owe\r\n\nbeneficially  to the federal government  and thus fall within the\r\n\npurview of the FDCPA.   A prototypical  case is United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nGelb,  783  F.  Supp.   748  (E.D.N.Y.  1991).    Gelb   involved\r                                                                \r\n\nrestitution under the RICO statute.   Since that statute declares\r\n\nthat a convicted person  must \"forfeit to the United  States\" any\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nill-gotten  gains, see  18 U.S.C.    1963(a) (1994),  the federal\r                                \r\n\ngovernment is the direct beneficiary of the restitution order and\r\n\nthe order thus creates a  debt collectible under the FDCPA.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGelb, 783  F. Supp.  at 752.    But other  types of  restitution,\r              \r\n\nwhich,  when  paid,  will  not  increase  public  revenues  (say,\r\n\nrestitution  to an  individual victim  of a  crime), do  not come\r\n\nwithin the statutory encincture.   In short, we cannot  isolate a\r\n\nsingle word     \"restitution\"    and  conclude that  every  order\r\n\nbearing that label automatically  falls within the FDCPA's grasp.\r\n\nThe  federal   government  may  collect  under   the  FDCPA  only\r\n\nrestitution that is  \"owing to the United  States.\"  28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n3002(3).\r\n\n          We  end where  we began.   Because  restitution ordered\r\n\nunder  the  CSRA  is  not  owed  to  the   United  States  in  an\r\n\neconomically meaningful sense, the  government cannot utilize the\r\n\nFDCPA  as a vehicle for collecting such  awards.  On this view of\r\n\nthe case, we do not  reach the question of whether the  debt must\r\n\nbe considered  as private in  character (and thus  ineligible for\r\n\ninclusion  under the FDCPA on  that basis) because  a state court\r\n\norder created  the underlying child support  obligation, and both\r\n\nthe obligor and obligee are private parties.12\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12We note in passing that a cogent argument can  be made for\r\nthe proposition that  what started as a debt  owed by one private\r\nparty (Bongiorno)  to another (Taylor, on behalf  of the couple's\r\ndaughter) remains so in  its collection, and that the  peripheral\r\ninvolvement  of  the  federal  government  does  not  change  the\r\nobligation's  inherently private character.   Indeed, the belated\r\nfederal entry into this situation bears a striking resemblance to\r\nthe  \"failed  thrift\"  example   that  Chairman  Brooks  used  to\r\nillustrate  a debt that would be excluded from the FDCPA's grasp.\r                                                   \r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          Because  the government  sued  under  an  inappropriate\r\n\nstatute, we must reverse the judgment in the civil case.  This is\r\n\nnot to say, however, that the appellant can thumb his nose at the\r\n\nrestitution  order.  Payment of restitution is a condition of his\r\n\nprobation,  and  the  government   has  adequate  remedies  if  a\r\n\nconvicted defendant  flouts a condition of probation.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n18 U.S.C.    3663(g), 3583(e) (1994).   The government, moreover,\r\n\ncan attempt to collect  the restitution order by resort  to other\r\n\ncivil  remedies, see  28  U.S.C.    3003(b)  (providing that  the\r                              \r\n\nUnited  States retains  its authority under  laws other  than the\r\n\nFDCPA to collect debts owed to the  government); see also Fed.

Rec. H13288 (quoted supra p. 21).\r                                                 \r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nappellant's  conviction and  sentence.   We therefore  affirm the\r\n\njudgment in the criminal case.  The civil case, however, yields a\r\n\ndiametrically opposite outcome.   Because the federal  government\r\n\ndoes  not have a direct  pecuniary interest in  the avails of the\r\n\nrestitutionary order, we hold that the  order is not a debt owing\r\n\nto  the United  States subject  to collection under  the FDCPA.13\r\n\nThe government's  ancillary civil action ought  therefore to have\r\n\nbeen dismissed.\r\n\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.
