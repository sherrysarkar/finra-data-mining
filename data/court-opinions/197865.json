Alfred J. Hassey died on June 3,\r\n1990, from a stroke he had suffered soon after undergoing a\r\ncolonoscopy at the West Roxbury Veterans Administration Hospital. \r\nHis daughter, Jean Mitchell, as Administratrix of his estate, filed\r\nthis wrongful death action on behalf of her mother, siblings, and\r\nherself against his treating physicians, Drs. Carl Berg and Marc\r\nSilver, as well as against the United States of America, the owner\r\nof the Hospital.  After dismissing the claims against the\r\nindividual defendants and holding a bench trial on the remaining\r\nclaims, the trial judge found the United States liable and awarded\r\ndamages to the decedent's widow, but not to his children.  Both the\r\nUnited States and the Administratrix, on behalf of the decedent's\r\nchildren, cross-appealed.  We affirm, with one minor clarification. \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nMr. Hassey had been diagnosed in 1985 with atrial\r\nfibrillation, a heart condition that often causes an increase in\r\nthe rate at which blood clots are formed.  His doctors therefore\r\nprescribed the use of Coumadin, an anticoagulant medication, in\r\norder to help prevent the formation of blood clots.  Mr. Hassey had\r\nalso suffered from colon cancer, which was treated by a\r\nhemicolonectomy in 1983.  The operation was successful and he\r\nremained asymptomatic until the end of his life.  Nevertheless, he\r\nwas required to undergo prophylactic colonoscopies approximately\r\nevery two years to detect any recurrence of the cancer.  In June of\r\n1988, Mr. Hassey underwent a colonoscopy at the Hospital.  He was\r\ntaken off Coumadin three days prior to the operation, and instead\r\ngiven Heparin, another anticoagulant.  Coumadin therapy was\r\nrestarted the same day he was discharged from the Hospital.  He\r\nreported no ill effects from this operation.\r\nTwo years later, Mr. Hassey was due for another\r\ncolonoscopy.  Without reviewing his medical chart or medical\r\nhistory, Mr. Hassey's physicians, Drs. Carl Berg and Jacques Van\r\nDam, instructed him to discontinue his Coumadin therapy starting\r\nfive days prior to his colonoscopy.   Mr. Hassey stopped taking\r\nCoumadin six days before the procedure, on April 17, 1990.  He was\r\nadmitted to the Hospital on April 22, 1990, and on the following\r\nday, Drs. Berg and Van Dam performed the colonoscopy.  During the\r\noperation, a suspicious polyp was located and removed by \"hot\"\r\nbiopsy, pursuant to which the surgeons cauterized the intestinal\r\nwall from which the polyp had been removed.  The polyp was later\r\ndetermined to be pre-cancerous.  Mr. Hassey was discharged on that\r\nsame day by Hospital physician Dr. Marc Silver, and instructed to\r\nrestart the Coumadin therapy after five days.\r\nAs scheduled, Mr. Hassey restarted the Coumadin therapy\r\non April 28, 1990, eleven days after he had stopped taking the\r\nmedication.  That was the longest period of time that he had been\r\noff Coumadin since he was first prescribed its use.  The following\r\nday, Mr. Hassey was re-admitted to the Hospital because he was\r\nexperiencing weakness in the right side of his body and had\r\ndifficulty speaking.  He suffered a massive cerebral vascular\r\naccident: in lay terms, a stroke.  One month later, Mr. Hassey died\r\nfrom complications arising from the stroke.\r\nIn her role as Administratrix of the Estate of Alfred J.\r\nHassey, Jean Mitchell filed the instant suit against Drs. Berg and\r\nSilver, as well as against the United States of America, the owner\r\nof the Hospital.  The complaint, which alleged that the defendants'\r\nnegligence was the proximate cause of Mr. Hassey's death, was\r\nbrought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.  2671-80,\r\nand the Massachusetts wrongful death statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\r\n229,  1-2.  The complaint specifically alleged that the\r\ndefendants violated their duty of care to the decedent by keeping\r\nhim off Coumadin for an excessive period of time.  The complaint\r\nfurther alleged that the discontinuation of the Coumadin therapy\r\nwas the proximate cause of the stroke that ultimately led to\r\nMr. Hassey's death.  Before trial, the Administratrix and the\r\nUnited States stipulated that the United States would be\r\nsubstituted, in place of Drs. Silver and Berg, as the sole party\r\ndefendant.  See 28 U.S.C.  2679(d)(1).\r\nDuring the bench trial, four expert witnesses testified\r\nas to the nature and causes of Mr. Hassey's death, two on behalf of\r\nthe Administratrix, and two on behalf of the United States. \r\nMr. Hassey's relatives also testified as to the emotional impact\r\nthat his death had upon them.  After the trial, the district judge\r\nfound that the United States was liable to Evelyn Hassey in that\r\nits employees \"failed to use the care and skill of an average\r\nqualified specialist taking into account the advances in their\r\nprofession in their care and treatment of Alfred Hassey.\"  The\r\ndistrict judge awarded Mrs. Evelyn Hassey $300,000 for her loss,\r\nbut awarded nothing to the Administratrix or to the decedent's\r\nchildren.  Various post-judgment motions were submitted to and\r\nrejected by the district court.  Both the United States and the\r\nAdministratrix now appeal from the judgment of the district court.\r\n           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52, \"[i]n all actions tried\r\nupon the facts without a jury,\" the trial court's \"[f]indings of\r\nfact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be\r\nset aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given\r\nto the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of\r\nthe witnesses.\"  See Sullivan v. Young Bros. &amp; Co., Inc., 91 F.3d\r\n242, 246-47 (1st Cir. 1996); Irving v. United States, 49 F.3d 830,\r\n835 (1st Cir. 1995); Cumpiano v. Banco Santander Puerto Rico, 902\r\nF.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).  Similarly, review of decisions to\r\nadmit expert testimony is for abuse of discretion.  See General\r\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 118 S. Ct. 512 (1997).  On the other hand, the\r\ntrial court's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.  See Damonv. Sun Company, Inc., 87 F.3d 1467, 1471 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n             APPLICABLE LAW\r\nThe district court's jurisdiction over this complaint was\r\npremised on 28 U.S.C.  1346(b)(1), which provides that:\r\nthe district courts . . . shall have\r\nexclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on\r\nclaims against the United States, for\r\nmoney damages, . . . for personal injury\r\nor death caused by the negligent or\r\nwrongful act or omission of any employee\r\nof the Government while acting within the\r\nscope of his office or employment, under\r\ncircumstances where the United States, if\r\na private person, would be liable to the\r\nclaimant in accordance with the law of the\r\nplace where the act or omission occurred.\r\n\nThus, with some exceptions not relevant to this case, the standard\r\nof liability applicable to a suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act\r\nis provided by the law of the state in which the tort occurred. \r\nSee 28 U.S.C.  1346(b)(1) and 2674.   \r\nBecause the tort occurred in Massachusetts, that state's\r\nlaw applies.  The Administratrix brought suit under the\r\nMassachusetts wrongful death statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229,  2,\r\nwhich provides that \"[a] person who by his negligence causes the\r\ndeath of a person . . . shall be liable in damages,\" and also that\r\n\"[a] person shall be liable for the negligence or the willful,\r\nwanton or reckless act of his agents or servants while engaged in\r\nhis business to the same extent and subject to the same limits as\r\nhe would be liable under this section for his own act.\"  In\r\nwrongful death actions based on death because of negligence, the\r\nsubstantive standard of liability is provided by the Massachusetts\r\ncommon law of torts, which we discuss below.\r\n                ANALYSIS\r\nBoth the plaintiff and the defendant have appealed from\r\nthe judgment below.  The finding of liability is challenged only by\r\nthe defendant, while both plaintiff and defendant seek review of\r\nthe award of damages.  We first address the appeal from the finding\r\nof liability.\r\nI.  Liability for Medical Malpractice\r\nA.  Application of the standard of liability\r\nThe negligence alleged in this case is medical\r\nmalpractice.  Under Massachusetts tort law, a plaintiff in a\r\nmedical malpractice suit bears the burden of proving by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence that a physician-patient relationship\r\nexisted between the physician and the injured party, that the\r\nphysician breached his or her duty of care, and that the breach was\r\nthe proximate cause of the injury.  See Blood v. Lea, 530 N.E.2d\r\n344, 347 (Mass. 1988); see also Poyser v. United States, 602 F.\r\nSupp. 436, 438 (D. Mass. 1984); Berardi v. Menicks, 164 N.E.2d 544,\r\n546 (Mass. 1960).  Generally, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice\r\naction may carry his or her burden of proof on the issues of\r\nnegligence and causation only with the assistance of expert\r\ntestimony.   See Harlow v. Chin, 545 N.E.2d 602, 605 (Mass. 1989)\r\n(expert testimony generally required to prove causation); Forlanov. Hughes, 471 N.E.2d 1315, 1319 (Mass. 1984) (expert medical\r\nopinion generally required to prove breach of duty of care).  A\r\nphysician is held to the standard of care and skill of the average\r\npractitioner of the medical specialty in question, taking into\r\naccount the advances in the profession.  See Poyser, 602 F. Supp.\r\nat 438-39 (citing Brune v. Belinkoff, 235 N.E.2d 793, 798 (Mass.\r\n1968)).  Proof of the element of causation, which is an issue of\r\nfact, depends on whether it is more probable than not that the\r\ndeath was the result of the physician's negligence.  See Harlow,\r\n545 N.E.2d at 605.  Here it must be emphasized that: \r\n[w]hile the plaintiff is not bound to\r\nexclude every other possibility of cause\r\nfor his injury except that of the\r\nnegligence of the defendant, he is\r\nrequired to show by evidence a greater\r\nlikelihood that it came from an act of\r\nnegligence for which the defendant is\r\nresponsible than from a cause for which\r\nthe defendant is not liable.\r\n\nForlano, 471 N.E.2d at 1319 (citations omitted).\r\nThe defendant argues that the district court erred as a\r\nmatter of law by evaluating its actions under a strict liability\r\nrather than negligence standard of care.  The United States points\r\nto certain isolated statements made by the trial judge during trial\r\nthat, it claims, establish that he applied a strict liability\r\nstandard of care.  We disagree.  The comments in question were\r\nvague and do not necessarily establish that the judge applied the\r\nwrong standard of care.  Indeed, in his findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law, the trial judge relied on expert medical\r\nopinion in determining that Mr. Hassey's treating physicians \r\nprovided negligent medical care, and that their negligence was a\r\nproximate cause of his death.\r\nB. Admission of statistical evidence\r\nThe United States complains that the district court erred\r\nin refusing to admit or consider the testimony of one of its\r\nmedical experts on the statistics concerning the risk of stroke\r\nversus the risk of bleeding.  We reject this assignment of error. \r\nThe trial judge ultimately did not refuse to admit this testimony. \r\nAlthough he did, at first, resist the admission of the statistical\r\nevidence, on the following day the trial judge proceeded to hear\r\nthe testimony in question.  The defendant's invitation to reverse\r\nthe judgment below is thus based on its speculative conclusion that\r\nthe absence of a discussion of statistical evidence in the judge's\r\nfindings of fact \"clearly indicate[s]\" that he did not consider\r\nthis evidence because he was biased against its use.  We decline\r\nthe invitation to engage in such speculation.\r\nC. Admission of expert testimony\r\nThe United States also claims that the judgment below\r\nmust be reversed insofar as it rested on the plaintiff's expert\r\ntestimony, which it contends should have been excluded by the\r\ndistrict court under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Chemicals, 509 U.S. 579\r\n(1993).  We reject this argument, too.  The baseline for\r\napproaching questions of the admissibility of evidence is Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 402, which provides that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is\r\nadmissible,\" except as otherwise provided by the Constitution,\r\nlaws, or rules of the court.  Evidence is relevant if it has \"any\r\ntendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence\r\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\nthan it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 401.  As the\r\nSupreme Court noted, \"the Rule's basic standard of relevance thus\r\nis a liberal one.\"  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 587.  \r\nWith regard to expert testimony, the rules of evidence\r\nspecifically provide:\r\nIf scientific, technical, or other\r\nspecialized knowledge will assist the\r\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence\r\nor to determine a fact in issue, a witness\r\nqualified as an expert by knowledge,\r\nskill, experience, training, or education,\r\nmay testify thereto in the form of an\r\nopinion or otherwise.\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 702.  In Daubert, which interpreted Rule 702, the\r\nSupreme Court held that when a trial judge is faced with the\r\ndecision to accept or reject a proffer of expert scientific\r\ntestimony, the judge must determine:\r\nwhether the expert is proposing to testify\r\nto (1) scientific  knowledge that (2) will\r\nassist the trier of fact to understand or\r\ndetermine a fact in issue.  This entails a\r\npreliminary assessment of whether the\r\nreasoning or methodology underlying the\r\ntestimony is scientifically valid and of\r\nwhether that reasoning and methodology\r\nproperly can be applied to the facts in\r\nissue.\r\n\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 592; see also Vadala v. Teledyne Indus., Inc.,\r\n44 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 1995).  Of course, there is a third,\r\nimplicit consideration: \"[t]he trial court first must determine\r\nwhether the putative expert is qualified by knowledge, skill,\r\nexperience, training, or education.\"  See Ed Peters Jewelry Co.,\r\nInc. v. C &amp; J Jewelry Co., Inc., 124 F.3d 252, 259 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(quoting Bogosian v. Mercedes Benz of N. Am., Inc., 104 F.3d 472,\r\n476 (1st Cir. 1997)); cf. Rohde v. Lawrence General Hosp., 614\r\nN.E.2d 686, 688 (Mass. App. Ct. 1993).  Finally, we note that a\r\ndistrict court enjoys substantial discretion to decide whether to\r\nadmit or exclude relevant expert testimony.  See General Elec. Co.,\r\n118 S. Ct. 512; Bogosian, 104 F.3d at 479.\r\nThere is no dispute over the professional qualifications\r\nof the plaintiff's expert witnesses, Drs. Barry Singer and Howard\r\nAdler.  The first issue is thus whether the testimony offered by\r\nthe plaintiff's expert witnesses was relevant - i.e., whether the\r\ntestimony could \"assist the trier of fact to understand or\r\ndetermine a fact in issue.\"  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592.  The issue\r\nbefore the judge was whether Mr. Hassey's treating physicians acted\r\naccording to the standard of care and skill of the average member\r\nof a practitioner of their medical specialty, taking into account\r\nthe advances in the profession, when they adjusted Mr. Hassey's\r\nanticoagulant levels before and after the colonoscopy.  \r\nThe experts for both parties testified that during a\r\ncolonoscopy, if a polyp is detected, the surgeon normally performs\r\na polypectomy (a type of biopsy), cutting off the polyp for\r\nexamination.  The experts also agreed that anticoagulants can\r\nincrease the risk of bleeding from wounds and retard their healing. \r\nThus, to allow the clotting factors of a colonoscopy patient on\r\nCoumadin therapy to return to normal so as to permit adequate\r\nhealing of his or her intestinal tissue, such a patient is required\r\nto be off Coumadin for a period of time.  The longer the period\r\nduring which the patient is not taking Coumadin, however, the\r\ngreater the risk that he or she will suffer a stroke.   The proper\r\nlength of time to keep a colonoscopy patient off Coumadin therefore\r\ndepends on a balancing between the risk of bleeding and the risk of\r\nstroke.\r\nThe testimony offered by Drs. Singer and Adler was\r\ncertainly relevant to the issue at trial.  Dr. Singer, an internist\r\nwith specialties in hematology and oncology, testified that he had\r\nsubstantial experience in the use of Coumadin, and that he had\r\nperformed several colonoscopies earlier in his career.  He also\r\ntestified that he had been consulted over 100 times by\r\ngastroenterologists seeking advice on the proper treatment for\r\npatients on anticoagulant medication who were scheduled to undergo\r\ncolonoscopies.  Similarly, Dr. Adler, an internist with a specialty\r\nin gastroenterology, testified that he has performed at least\r\ntwenty thousand colonoscopies, as well as numerous biopsies,\r\nincluding polypectomies.  He further testified that he was familiar\r\nwith the risk of bleeding associated with these procedures, and\r\nwith the standard of care expected of gastroenterologists in\r\nadjusting anticoagulant levels for patients undergoing\r\ncolonoscopies.  We find no error in the district judge's\r\ndetermination that the testimony provided by both of these experts\r\nwould assist him in understanding and determining the facts at\r\nissue in this case.\r\nNevertheless, the United States challenges the\r\nadmissibility of the opinions of these experts on the basis that\r\nsuch testimony was not reliable.  With regard to Dr. Singer, the\r\ndefendant claims that he was not qualified to testify about the\r\ndefendants' treatment of Mr. Hassey because he is not a specialist\r\nin gastroenterology, and that he could not provide a reliable\r\nopinion on the risk of stroke as compared to the risk of bleed\r\nbecause he admitted during trial that he had no direct knowledge of\r\nthe risk of bleeding from a colonoscopy during which a polypectomy\r\nwas performed.  \r\nWe disagree.  First of all, the Government is simply\r\nwrong to suggest that Dr. Singer was not qualified to testify\r\nmerely because he was not a gastroenterologist.  \"The fact that the\r\nphysician is not a specialist in the field in which he is giving\r\nhis opinion affects not the admissibility of his opinion but the\r\nweight the jury may place on it.\"  Payton v. Abbott Labs, 780 F.2d\r\n147, 155 (1st Cir. 1985); cf. Letch v. Daniels, 514 N.E.2d 675, 677\r\n(Mass. 1987) (\"A medical expert need not be a specialist in the\r\narea concerned nor be practicing in the same field as the\r\ndefendant.\")\r\nMoreover, the specific testimony offered by Dr. Singer\r\nwas within his area of expertise.  He testified that cardiologists\r\nand hematologists are very much aware of the relative benefits and\r\nrisks arising from the use of anticoagulants such as Coumadin, and\r\nthe effects of their discontinuation.  Dr. Singer explained that\r\nwhen a patient who has been taking Coumadin for several years is\r\ntaken off the medication, that patient will enter a\r\nhypercoagulative state in which the rate at which clots are\r\nproduced is greatly increased.  Dr. Singer also testified that\r\nCoumadin takes about three days after it is restarted to have any\r\neffect on clot formation.  Furthermore, Dr. Singer noted that he\r\nwas familiar with the standard of care for gastroenterologists\r\nbecause he had been consulted by gastroenterologists on more than\r\n100 occasions on the appropriate treatment for colonoscopy patients\r\nwho are on anticoagulant therapy.\r\nThe United States makes much of the fact that Dr. Singer\r\nadmitted that he did not know how the risk of bleeding would vary\r\ndepending on whether a hot or cold biopsy had been performed.  As\r\nother witnesses explained, biopsies can be \"cold\" or \"hot,\" the\r\nmain difference being that during hot biopsies, the flesh is\r\ncauterized afterwards to minimize bleeding immediately after the\r\noperation.  Patients undergoing hot biopsies, however, are at risk\r\nfor delayed bleeding between seven and fourteen days after the\r\noperation, when the scab that formed over the cauterized tissue\r\nfalls away.  The defendant argues that Dr. Singer's admission\r\nestablishes that his opinion -- that the risk of bleeding was less\r\nthan the risk of stroke -- was personal speculation unsupported by\r\nany knowledge, training or experience and thus lacked a reliable\r\nfactual foundation.\r\nThe inference is unwarranted.  A review of the trial\r\ntranscript indicates that Dr. Singer merely stated that he could\r\nnot quantify the risk of bleeding from a biopsy.  In the context of\r\nthe question, \"risk\" referred to the likelihood of bleeding, not\r\nits severity.  Dr. Singer also testified, however, that he knew\r\nthat the risk of bleeding was generally lower than the risk of\r\nstroke in terms of severity because only a tiny fraction of\r\npatients undergoing biopsies die as a result of these procedures. \r\nIn his opinion, the danger posed by keeping a patient off Coumadin\r\nfor 11 days, with the attendant increase in the rate of clot\r\nproduction, is a greatly increased risk that the patient will\r\nsuffer a stroke, which often leads to brain damage and death.  It\r\nwas not necessary for Dr. Singer to be able to specify in numerical\r\nterms the likelihood that a biopsy patient would bleed after an\r\noperation in order to support his opinion that the risk that a\r\npatient would suffer a stroke clearly exceeded the danger posed by\r\nthe possibility of post-operative bleeding, and thus that\r\nanticoagulants should be restarted sooner than the defendants did\r\nwith Mr. Hassey. \r\nThe United States also objects to Dr. Adler's testimony,\r\nwhich it also claims was unreliable and therefore should have been\r\nexcluded under Daubert.  Dr. Adler testified that he would have\r\nrestarted anticoagulant therapy several days before Mr. Hassey's\r\nphysicians did.  The defendant's main complaint is that Dr. Adler\r\nrendered his opinion without first reading the transcripts of the\r\nphysicians' depositions or certain parts of the medical record,\r\nincluding the post-operative report prepared by Dr. Berg.  This\r\ncomplaint would be valid only if the parts of the record that\r\nDr. Adler did not read contained information that was unavailable\r\nin the parts that he did read.  In fact, Dr. Adler's evaluation of\r\nthe pathologist's report allowed him to study the nature of the\r\nincisions made by the defendants in the course of the biopsy.  This\r\nreport is at least as reliable a basis for his opinion as the\r\nreport prepared by the treating physicians.\r\nThe defendant also argues that there was a discrepancy\r\nbetween the treatment that Drs. Adler and Singer would have\r\nrecommended for Mr. Hassey.  We fail to see how this discrepancy\r\nshould render Dr. Adler's testimony inadmissible.  To the\r\ncontrary, although couched in Daubert terms, this argument is a\r\nthinly veiled challenge to the district court's determination of\r\nthe credibility and soundness of Dr. Adler's opinion.  \"The fact\r\nthat defendant was able to undercut some of the research basis for\r\nthe doctors' opinions does not affect the admissibility of those\r\nopinions.  If the factual underpinnings of their opinions were in\r\nfact weak, that was a matter affecting the weight and credibility\r\nof their testimony.\"  Payton, 780 F.2d at 156 (citing Coleman v.\r\nDeMinico, 730 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 1984)); cf. Baker v. Commercial\r\nUnion Ins. Co., 416 N.E.2d 187, 190 (1981) (\"The question whether\r\nthe basis of the doctor's opinion is sound goes to the weight of\r\nthe evidence, not its admissibility.\")  The finder of fact's\r\ndeterminations of credibility, and of the weight of the evidence in\r\ngeneral, are not disturbed on appeal except for clear error.  A\r\nfinding of fact is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is\r\nleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\r\nmade.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573\r\n(1985).  Thus, a credibility determination is clearly erroneous\r\nonly when it is based on testimony that was inherently implausible,\r\ninternally inconsistent, or critically impeached.  See Keller v.\r\nUnited States, 38 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir. 1994).  \r\nDr. Adler's testimony was admissible and the court was\r\nentitled to rely on it: it was plainly plausible, internally\r\nconsistent (it was partly inconsistent with Dr. Singer's testimony,\r\nnot with his own), and was not critically impeached.  More\r\ngenerally, the parties presented conflicting expert testimony from\r\nmedical specialists on the issue of whether the defendants'\r\ndecision to keep Mr. Hassey off Coumadin for more than ten days was\r\na breach of the applicable standard of medical care and the\r\nproximate cause of his death.  After reviewing the record below,\r\nincluding the transcripts of the trial, we find the evidence before\r\nthe district judge to be sufficient to permit him to find that\r\nDrs. Berg, Van Dam, and Silver were negligent in their treatment of\r\nMr. Hassey, and that their negligence was a proximate cause of his\r\ndeath.\r\nD. Denial of the Motion for New Trial\r\nThe United States argues that a new trial was required\r\nbecause the plaintiff failed to provide any credible evidence that\r\nthe risk of stroke was greater than the risk of bleeding, or that\r\nMr. Hassey would not have had a stroke had the Coumadin therapy\r\nbeen restarted earlier.  We disagree, for reasons already amply\r\nexplored above.     E. Denial of the Motion for Mistrial\r\nPlaintiff's counsel filed a motion requesting certain\r\nconclusions of law, including a suggested award of damages.  The\r\nUnited States argues that since the claim was for pain, suffering,\r\nand related subjective damages, the suggestion was a direct\r\nviolation of Massachusetts law, which allegedly prohibits counsel\r\nfrom requesting that a finder of fact enter a specific subjective\r\namount for unliquidated damage claims.  \r\nThe request for mistrial was properly denied.  First, a\r\nclaim under section 2 of the wrongful death statute includes\r\ncompensation not only for unliquidated damage claims, but also for\r\nliquidated damage claims, such as loss of income, which are not\r\nsubject to the alleged prohibition.  Furthermore, the\r\n\"prohibition\" on suggestions as to the amount of awards for\r\nunliquidated damage claims is not a true prohibition, but rather\r\nonly a strong recommendation.  See, e.g., Goldstein v. Gontarz, 309\r\nN.E.2d 196, 207 n.15 (1974) (\"We agree with recent suggestions that\r\nin most cases where the damages are unliquidated and rest with the\r\njury, the trial judge would be better advised to withhold the ad\r\ndamnum from the jury than to read the figure and then attempt to\r\nnegate its effect with an instruction.\") (emphasis added). \r\nMoreover, a review of the relevant case law indicates this rule has\r\nonly been applied to jury trials.  In addition to the lack of\r\nprecedent, we see no reason why Massachusetts would choose to\r\nextend the rule to bench trials, particularly since judges, unlike\r\njuries, are expected to be able to avoid being unduly influenced by\r\ncounsel.  Here, not only was the trial a bench trial, but it was\r\nthe trial judge himself who requested an estimate of the amount of\r\ndamages that should be awarded.\r\nF. Denial of the Motion for Reconsideration\r\nIn September of 1996, an article was published in the\r\nJournal of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy which contained the results\r\nof a nationwide survey of gastroenterologists to determine the\r\naverage standard of practice with respect to the management of\r\nantiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, including Coumadin, when\r\nperforming diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures,\r\nincluding colonoscopies.  See C.E. Angueira, et al.,\r\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy in Patients Taking Antiplatelet Agents\r\nand Anticoagulants: Survey of ASGE Members, 44 J. of\r\nGastrointestinal Endoscopy, No. 3, at 309 (1996).  The following\r\nmonth, the Government filed a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2)\r\nfor relief from judgment, claiming that the article constituted\r\n\"new evidence\" that directly contradicted the district court's\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.  The district court denied\r\nthe motion, and the United States now argues that the denial was an\r\nabuse of discretion.\r\nA motion under Rule 60(b)(2) for \"new trial on the ground\r\nof newly discovered evidence requires proof of the following\r\nelements:\" \r\n(1)  The evidence has been discovered since the trial;\r\n(2)  The evidence could not by due diligence have been\r\n   discovered earlier by the movant[;]\r\n(3)  The evidence is not merely cumulative or\r\n   impeaching;  and\r\n(4)  The evidence is of such nature that it would\r\n   probably change the result if a new trial is\r\n   granted.\r\n\nRaymond v. Raymond Corp., 938 F.2d 1518, 1527 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(quoting Nickerson v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co., 900 F.2d 412, 417 (1st\r\nCir. 1990)).  A district court's ruling on a motion under Rule\r\n60(b) will only be overturned for an abuse of discretion. SeeRaymond, 938 F.2d at 1527; Nickerson, 900 F.2d at 416; Duffy v.\r\nClippinger, 857 F.2d 877, 879 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\nThere are two problems with the defendant's argument. \r\nThe first is that it is by no means clear that this article\r\nconstitutes \"newly discovered evidence\" for purposes of Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 60(b).  Although the trial was held on May 1-3, 1996,\r\napproximately four months before the article was published, an\r\nabstract of the article had been available since 1993.  A more\r\ndiligent effort to research the relevant medical literature by the\r\ndefendant should have produced the abstract. \r\nThe second and more important problem is that the\r\nevidence would not be likely to change the result of the trial. \r\nThe United States has retained as experts some of the authors of\r\nthe article, one of whom would testify that, based on the survey,\r\nhe thought that 60% of the gastroenterologists in the United States\r\nwould have restarted Coumadin after a colonoscopy within 7 days or\r\nless.  The proposed expert would also testify that there are no\r\npublished guidelines at present that would assist endoscopists in\r\nmanaging patients on anticoagulant therapy during the period of\r\ntime following a colonoscopy, and that most endoscopists are\r\ntherefore using their own judgment or criteria in managing such\r\npatients.  \r\nThis evidence would not have required the trial judge to\r\nreach a different result.  As a general matter, the article, and\r\nthe expert's testimony, are based on a survey to which only 38.5%\r\nof ASGE members responded, a response rate which was described by\r\nthe authors of the article as \"less than ideal.\"  Moreover, the\r\nresponses were based on generalized questions, such as the length\r\nof time the gastroenterologists would wait before restarting\r\nCoumadin after a therapeutic colonoscopy (i.e., one during which a\r\nbiopsy or polypectomy was performed) in patients suffering from\r\nconditions such as atrial fibrillation.  The answers to these\r\nquestions are not definitive because they did not take into\r\nconsideration the particulars of a patient's medical history, even\r\nthough the experts testifying before the trial judge agreed that\r\nsuch particulars are indispensable in determining the proper\r\ntreatment to be followed.  As for the proposed testimony regarding\r\nthe lack of published guidelines, the fact remains that\r\ngastroenterologists cannot close their eyes to the standard of care\r\nappropriate to other specialties when performing procedures within\r\ntheir own that impact upon other specialties.  \r\nThe trial judge heard testimony from specialists in\r\nhematology and gastroenterology who indicated that Mr. Hassey\r\nshould not have been kept off Coumadin as long as he was, and\r\nexplained in detail why they thought so.  We think it improbable\r\nthat the proposed evidence would have resulted in a different\r\noutcome.\r\nII.  Distribution of the Damages\r\nBoth the Administratrix and the Government appeal from\r\nthe district court's award of damages.  The Administratrix argues\r\nthat the district court erred as a matter of both law and fact in\r\ndenying Mr. Hassey's adult children's claims for compensation under\r\nthe Massachusetts wrongful death statute.  The United States, in\r\nturn, argues that the district court did not err in not awarding\r\ndamages to the decedent's children because they are adults who were\r\nno longer financially dependent upon their father and are therefore\r\nnot entitled to recover under the statute.  The Government also\r\nargues, however, that insofar as the district court awarded damages\r\nto Mr. Hassey's widow, rather than to the Administratrix, the\r\ndistrict court acted without subject matter jurisdiction. \r\nSection 2 of the wrongful death statute provides, in\r\npertinent part, that:\r\n[a] person who . . . by his negligence\r\ncauses the death of a person . . . shall\r\nbe liable in damages in the amount of . .\r\n. the fair monetary value of the decedent\r\nto the persons entitled to receive the\r\ndamages recovered, as provided in section\r\n[1], including but not limited to\r\ncompensation for the loss of the\r\nreasonably expected net income, services,\r\nprotection, care, assistance, society,\r\ncompanionship, comfort, guidance, counsel,\r\nand advice of the decedent to the persons\r\nentitled to the damages recovered.\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 229,  2.  Section 2 further provides that \"[a]\r\nperson shall be liable for the negligence . . . of his agents or\r\nservants while engaged in his business to the same extent and\r\nsubject to the same limits as he would be liable under this section\r\nfor his own act.\"  Section 1, which independently provides for a\r\ntype of premises liability, also specifies that:\r\n[i]f the deceased shall have been survived\r\nby a wife or husband and by more than one\r\nchild surviving either in person or by\r\nissue, then one third to the use of such\r\nsurviving spouse and two thirds to the use\r\nof such surviving children or their issue\r\nby right of representation.\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 229,  1(3).\r\n\"The plain language of the statute permits recovery for\r\nthose losses akin to loss of consortium.\"  Schultz v. Grogean, 548\r\nN.E.2d 180, 181 (Mass. 1990).  However, \"the first clause of\r\nsection 2 limits recovery to a class of persons.  It provides for\r\nrecovery of compensatory damages by 'the persons entitled to\r\nreceive the damages recovered' and limits the class to those\r\npersons 'as provided in section [1].'\"  See Burt v. Meyer, 508\r\nN.E.2d 598, 602 (Mass. 1987) (adopting interpretation proposed in\r\nGuy v. Johnson, 448 N.E.2d 1142, 1144-45 (Mass. App. Ct. 1983)). \r\nIf the class of presumptive takers, as defined in section 1, is to\r\nrecover under section 2, they must then prove that the decedent had\r\nmonetary value to them.  See Burt, 508 N.E.2d at 602; Guy, 448\r\nN.E.2d at 1144.    \r\nWe find no support in Massachusetts statutory or case law\r\nfor the United States' contention that adult children must be\r\nfinancially dependent upon their decedent in order to be entitled\r\nto recover damages under section 2 of the wrongful death statute. \r\nTo the contrary, the plain language of section 1(3) of the wrongful\r\ndeath statute makes the surviving spouse and children presumptive\r\ntakers without mentioning any requirement that they be dependent. \r\nMoreover, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has approved\r\nthe award of damages to relatives who were not financially\r\ndependent upon the decedent.  See Santos v. Lumbermen's Mut. Cas.\r\nCo., 556 N.E.2d 983, 988 n.10 (Mass. 1990) (parents of deceased\r\nadult unmarried child may recover damages under section 2 as \"next\r\nof kin\" for purposes of section 1); Schultz, 548 N.E.2d at 182\r\n(same); cf. Bratcher v. Galusha, 627 N.E.2d 908 (Mass. 1994)\r\n(father of deceased adult married child was not entitled to recover\r\ndamages under section 2 because, under section 1, the surviving\r\nspouse was the only presumptive taker); Norman v. Massachusetts Bay\r\nTransp. Auth., 529 N.E.2d 139, 142 (Mass. 1988) (noting, in dicta,\r\nthat if child had died rather than merely been injured, parents\r\nwould have been entitled to recover under section 2 for loss of\r\nconsortium); Guy, 448 N.E.2d at 1145 (father of deceased minor\r\nchild was presumptive taker under section 1).  Similarly, at least\r\none federal district court has explicitly decided that adult\r\nchildren are presumptive takers in a claim under section 2 for the\r\ndeath of their parent.  See Knowlton v. Spillane, 137 F.R.D. 196,\r\n197 (D. Mass. 1991); cf. Poyser v. United States, 602 F. Supp. 436\r\n(D. Mass. 1984) (mother of a minor daughter was a presumed taker\r\nunder section 1(4)).  \r\nIndeed, a situation identical to this case seems to have\r\narisen in Burt v. Meyer, 508 N.E.2d 598 (Mass. 1987).  After the\r\ntrial of the wrongful death action brought by the executrix of the\r\nestate of the decedent, the jury awarded, inter alia, $174,000 in\r\ncompensatory damages for the benefit of the widow, and $20,000 for\r\nthe benefit of each of the decedent's four children by a previous\r\nmarriage.  On appeal, the adult children of the decedent argued\r\nthat the distribution of an award under section 2 was subject to\r\nthe constraints of section 1, which they claimed entitled them to\r\ntwo thirds of the entire award.  The Supreme Judicial Court\r\nrejected this argument, holding that a presumptive taker is\r\nentitled to nothing beyond what it is proven at trial he or she\r\nlost as a result of the decedent's death.  More importantly,\r\nhowever, the Court affirmed the original award to the children. \r\nAlthough the Court's decision does not specifically state that the\r\nchildren were non-dependent adults, that fact could fairly be\r\ninferred.\r\nNevertheless, we affirm the trial judge's award of\r\ndamages.  The trial judge heard testimony from all of Mr. Hassey's\r\nchildren as to their relationship with him and the effect that his\r\ndeath has had upon them.  The fact that the judge did so even after\r\nthe Government had vigorously argued that the children were not\r\nentitled to recover under section 2 indicates that the judge\r\ncorrectly understood that Mr. Hassey's children were presumptive\r\ntakers under section 1.\r\nAfter hearing the children's testimony, the trial judge\r\nstill chose to award them nothing.   Upon reviewing the relevant\r\nportion of the trial transcript, we find that it would not have\r\nbeen error for the trial judge to find that the loss suffered by\r\nthe decedent's children did not exceed such grief, anguish, and\r\nbereavement as one may normally expect upon the death of a parent. \r\nAs the Administratrix admits in her brief, recovery under section\r\n2 \"was not intended to include components of 'grief, anguish and\r\nbereavement of the survivors.'\"  MacCuish v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G.,\r\n494 N.E.2d 390, 398 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986).\r\nFinally, although the United States is technically\r\ncorrect in pointing out that the trial judge should have awarded\r\ndamages to the Administratrix, rather than to Mrs. Hassey, the\r\nerror is merely one of form.  Pursuant to section 2 of the statute,\r\n\"[d]amages under this section shall be recovered in an action of\r\ntort by the executor or administrator of the deceased.\"  However,\r\n\"the procedural framework of the wrongful death statute, through\r\nwhich an administrator brings an action on behalf of the next of\r\nkin, [does not make] each person who has suffered consortium-like\r\ndamages any less injured.  To hold otherwise would elevate form\r\nover substance, looking less at the question, 'who is injured,' and\r\nmore at the question, 'who is technically bringing the suit.'\" \r\nSantos, 556 N.E.2d at 988.\r\nThe Supreme Judicial Court has therefore approved of\r\nverdicts awarding different amounts to each person recovering under\r\nsection 2.  See Burt, 508 N.E.2d at 602 ($174,000 for widow and\r\n$20,000 for each child); Guy, 448 N.E.2d at 1145 ($37,786.06 for\r\nmother and $103.41 for father).  Indeed, in Guy, the Court approved\r\nof the decision of the probate judge to distribute the award of\r\ncompensatory damages obtained in a wrongful death suit in\r\naccordance with the jury verdict.  \r\nThe trial judge in this case, therefore, did not err in\r\ndetermining the specific amount that Mrs. Evelyn Hassey was\r\nentitled to receive.  Instead, the only error he committed was to\r\nenter judgment in her name, rather than in the name of the\r\nAdministratrix.  The error is easily corrected.  We thus resolve to\r\nmodify the judgment to clarify that the nominal recipient of the\r\naward is the Administratrix of the Estate of Alfred J. Hassey, for\r\nthe benefit of Evelyn Hassey.  Of course, when the assets of the\r\nestate are distributed, the probate judge will distribute the\r\ncompensatory damages awarded in this suit in accordance with the\r\ntrial judge's findings.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment entered\r\nby the district court, as modified by this opinion.\r\n",

Hassey died on June 3, 1990, from a stroke he had suffered soon after undergoing a colonoscopy at the West Roxbury Veterans Administration Hospital.  His daughter, Jean Mitchell, as Administratrix of his estate, filed this wrongful death action on behalf of her mother, siblings, and herself against his treating physicians, Drs. Carl Berg and Marc Silver, as well as against the United States of America, the owner of the Hospital.  After dismissing the claims against the individual defendants and holding a bench trial on the remaining claims, the trial judge found the United States liable and awarded damages to the decedent's widow, but not to his children.  Both the United States and the Administratrix, on behalf of the decedent's children, cross-appealed.  We affirm, with one minor clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Hassey had been diagnosed in 1985 with atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that often causes an increase in the rate at which blood clots are formed.  His doctors therefore prescribed the use of Coumadin, an anticoagulant medication, in order to help prevent the formation of blood clots.  Mr. Hassey had also suffered from colon cancer, which was treated by a hemicolonectomy in 1983.  The operation was successful and he remained asymptomatic until the end of his life.  Nevertheless, he was required to undergo prophylactic colonoscopies approximately every two years to detect any recurrence of the cancer.  In June of 1988, Mr. Hassey underwent a colonoscopy at the Hospital.  He was taken off Coumadin three days prior to the operation, and instead given Heparin, another anticoagulant.  Coumadin therapy was restarted the same day he was discharged from the Hospital.  He reported no ill effects from this operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years later, Mr. Hassey was due for another colonoscopy.  Without reviewing his medical chart or medical history, Mr. Hassey's physicians, Drs. Carl Berg and Jacques Van Dam, instructed him to discontinue his Coumadin therapy starting five days prior to his colonoscopy.  Mr. Hassey stopped taking Coumadin six days before the procedure, on April 17, 1990.  He was admitted to the Hospital on April 22, 1990, and on the following day, Drs. Berg and Van Dam performed the colonoscopy.  During the operation, a suspicious polyp was located and removed by \"hot\" biopsy, pursuant to which the surgeons cauterized the intestinal wall from which the polyp had been removed.  The polyp was later determined to be pre-cancerous.  Mr. Hassey was discharged on that same day by Hospital physician Dr. Marc Silver, and instructed to restart the Coumadin therapy after five days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As scheduled, Mr. Hassey restarted the Coumadin therapy on April 28, 1990, eleven days after he had stopped taking the medication.  That was the longest period of time that he had been off Coumadin since he was first prescribed its use.  The following day, Mr. Hassey was re-admitted to the Hospital because he was experiencing weakness in the right side of his body and had difficulty speaking.  He suffered a massive cerebral vascular accident:  in lay terms, a stroke.  One month later, Mr. Hassey died from complications arising from the stroke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her role as Administratrix of the Estate of Alfred J. Hassey, Jean Mitchell filed the instant suit against Drs. Berg and Silver, as well as against the United States of America, the owner of the Hospital.  The complaint, which alleged that the defendants' negligence was the proximate cause of Mr. Hassey's death, was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2671-80, and the Massachusetts wrongful death statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 229, &#167;&#167; 1-2.  The complaint specifically alleged that the defendants violated their duty of care to the decedent by keeping him off Coumadin for an excessive period of time.  The complaint further alleged that the discontinuation of the Coumadin therapy was the proximate cause of the stroke that ultimately led to Mr. Hassey's death.  Before trial, the Administratrix and the United States stipulated that the United States would be substituted, in place of Drs. Silver and Berg, as the sole party defendant.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the bench trial, four expert witnesses testified as to the nature and causes of Mr. Hassey's death, two on behalf of the Administratrix, and two on behalf of the United States.  Mr. Hassey's relatives also testified as to the emotional impact that his death had upon them.  After the trial, the district judge found that the United States was liable to Evelyn Hassey in that its employees \"failed to use the care and skill of an average qualified specialist taking into account the advances in their profession in their care and treatment of Alfred Hassey.\"   The district judge awarded Mrs. Evelyn Hassey $300,000 for her loss, but awarded nothing to the Administratrix or to the decedent's children.  Various post-judgment motions were submitted to and rejected by the district court.

See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b)(1) and 2674.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the tort occurred in Massachusetts, that state's law applies.  The Administratrix brought suit under the Massachusetts wrongful death statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 229, &#167; 2, which provides that \"[a] person who by his negligence causes the death of a person ... shall be liable in damages,\" and also that \"[a] person shall be liable for the negligence or the willful, wanton or reckless act of his agents or servants while engaged in his business to the same extent and subject to the same limits as he would be liable under this section for his own act.\"   In wrongful death actions based on death because of negligence, the substantive standard of liability is provided by the Massachusetts common law of torts, which we discuss below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the plaintiff and the defendant have appealed from the judgment below.  The finding of liability is challenged only by the defendant, while both plaintiff and defendant seek review of the award of damages.  We first address the appeal from the finding of liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Liability for Medical Malpractice</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Application of the standard of liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The negligence alleged in this case is medical malpractice.  Under Massachusetts tort law, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a physician-patient relationship existed between the physician and the injured party, that the physician breached his or her duty of care, and that the breach was the proximate cause of the injury.  See Blood v. Lea, 403 Mass. 430, 530 N.E.2d 344, 347 (1988);  see also Poyser v. United States, 602 F.Supp. 436, 438 (D.Mass.1984);  Berardi v. Menicks, 340 Mass. 396, 164 N.E.2d 544, 546 (1960).  Generally, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action may carry his or her burden of proof on the issues of negligence and causation only with the assistance of expert testimony.  See Harlow v. Chin, 405 Mass. 697, 545 N.E.2d 602, 605 (Mass.1989) (expert testimony generally required to prove causation);  Forlano v. Hughes, 393 Mass. 502, 471 N.E.2d 1315, 1319 (1984) (expert medical opinion generally required to prove breach of duty of care).  A physician is held to the standard of care and skill of the average practitioner of the medical specialty in question, taking into account the advances in the profession.  See Poyser, 602 F.Supp. at 438-39 (citing Brune v. Belinkoff, 354 Mass. 102, 235 N.E.2d 793, 798 (1968)).  Proof of the element of causation, which is an issue of fact, depends on whether it is more probable than not that the death was the result of the physician's negligence.  See Harlow, 545 N.E.2d at 605.   Here it must be emphasized that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>[w]hile the plaintiff is not bound to exclude every other possibility of cause for his injury except that of the negligence of the defendant, he is required to show by evidence a greater likelihood that it came from an act of negligence for which the defendant is responsible than from a cause for which the defendant is not liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forlano, 471 N.E.2d at 1319 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by evaluating its actions under a strict liability rather than negligence standard of care.  The United States points to certain isolated statements made by the trial judge during trial that, it claims, establish that he applied a strict liability standard of care.  We disagree.  The comments in question were vague and do not necessarily establish that the judge applied the wrong standard of care.  Indeed, in his findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial judge relied on expert medical opinion in determining that Mr. Hassey's treating physicians provided negligent medical care, and that their negligence was a proximate cause of his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of statistical evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States complains that the district court erred in refusing to admit or consider the testimony of one of its medical experts on the statistics concerning the risk of stroke versus the risk of bleeding.  We reject this assignment of error.  The trial judge ultimately did not refuse to admit this testimony.  Although he did, at first, resist the admission of the statistical evidence, on the following day the trial judge proceeded to hear the testimony in question.  The defendant's invitation to reverse the judgment below is thus based on its speculative conclusion that the absence of a discussion of statistical evidence in the judge's findings of fact \"clearly indicate[s]\" that he did not consider this evidence because he was biased against its use.  We decline the invitation to engage in such speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Admission of expert testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States also claims that the judgment below must be reversed insofar as it rested on the plaintiff's expert testimony, which it contends should have been excluded by the district court under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).  We reject this argument, too.  The baseline for approaching questions of the admissibility of evidence is Fed.R.Evid. 402, which provides that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible,\" except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, laws, or rules of the court.  Evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 401.  As the Supreme Court noted, \"the Rule's basic standard of relevance thus is a liberal one.\"  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 587, 113 S.Ct. at 2793-94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to expert testimony, the rules of evidence specifically provide:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 702.  In Daubert, which interpreted Rule 702, the Supreme Court held that when a trial judge is faced with the decision to accept or reject a proffer of expert scientific testimony, the judge must determine:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.  This entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning and methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796;  see also Vadala v. Teledyne Indus., Inc., 44 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir.1995).  Of course, there is a third, implicit consideration:  \"[t]he trial court first must determine whether the putative expert is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\"   See Ed Peters Jewelry Co., Inc. v. C &amp; J Jewelry Co., Inc., 124 F.3d 252, 259 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting Bogosian v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc., 104 F.3d 472, 476 (1st Cir.1997));  cf.  Rohde v. Lawrence General Hosp., 34 Mass.App.Ct. 584, 614 N.E.2d 686, 688 (1993).  Finally, we note that a district court enjoys substantial discretion to decide whether to admit or exclude relevant expert testimony.  See General Elec. Co., 522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512;  Bogosian, 104 F.3d at 479.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute over the professional qualifications of the plaintiff's expert witnesses, Drs. Barry Singer and Howard Adler.  The first issue is thus whether the testimony offered by the plaintiff's expert witnesses was relevant--i.e., whether the testimony could \"assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\"  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. at 2796.   The issue before the judge was whether Mr. Hassey's treating physicians acted according to the standard of care and skill of the average member of a practitioner of their medical specialty, taking into account the advances in the profession, when they adjusted Mr. Hassey's anticoagulant levels before and after the colonoscopy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The experts for both parties testified that during a colonoscopy, if a polyp is detected, the surgeon normally performs a polypectomy (a type of biopsy), cutting off the polyp for examination.  The experts also agreed that anticoagulants can increase the risk of bleeding from wounds and retard their healing.  Thus, to allow the clotting factors of a colonoscopy patient on Coumadin therapy to return to normal so as to permit adequate healing of his or her intestinal tissue, such a patient is required to be off Coumadin for a period of time.  The longer the period during which the patient is not taking Coumadin, however, the greater the risk that he or she will suffer a stroke.  The proper length of time to keep a colonoscopy patient off Coumadin therefore depends on a balancing between the risk of bleeding and the risk of stroke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony offered by Drs. Singer and Adler was certainly relevant to the issue at trial.  Dr. Singer, an internist with specialties in hematology and oncology, testified that he had substantial experience in the use of Coumadin, and that he had performed several colonoscopies earlier in his career.  He also testified that he had been consulted over 100 times by gastroenterologists seeking advice on the proper treatment for patients on anticoagulant medication who were scheduled to undergo colonoscopies.  Similarly, Dr. Adler, an internist with a specialty in gastroenterology, testified that he has performed at least twenty thousand colonoscopies, as well as numerous biopsies, including polypectomies.  He further testified that he was familiar with the risk of bleeding associated with these procedures, and with the standard of care expected of gastroenterologists in adjusting anticoagulant levels for patients undergoing colonoscopies.  We find no error in the district judge's determination that the testimony provided by both of these experts would assist him in understanding and determining the facts at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the United States challenges the admissibility of the opinions of these experts on the basis that such testimony was not reliable.  With regard to Dr. Singer, the defendant claims that he was not qualified to testify about the defendants' treatment of Mr. Hassey because he is not a specialist in gastroenterology, and that he could not provide a reliable opinion on the risk of stroke as compared to the risk of bleed because he admitted during trial that he had no direct knowledge of the risk of bleeding from a colonoscopy during which a polypectomy was performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  First of all, the Government is simply wrong to suggest that Dr. Singer was not qualified to testify merely because he was not a gastroenterologist.  \"The fact that the physician is not a specialist in the field in which he is giving his opinion affects not the admissibility of his opinion but the weight the jury may place on it.\"  Payton v. Abbott Labs, 780 F.2d 147, 155 (1st Cir.1985);  cf.  Letch v. Daniels, 401 Mass. 65, 514 N.E.2d 675, 677 (1987) (\"A medical expert need not be a specialist in the area concerned nor be practicing in the same field as the defendant.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the specific testimony offered by Dr. Singer was within his area of expertise. He testified that cardiologists and hematologists are very much aware of the relative benefits and risks arising from the use of anticoagulants such as Coumadin, and the effects of their discontinuation.  Dr. Singer explained that when a patient who has been taking Coumadin for several years is taken off the medication, that patient will enter a hypercoagulative state in which the rate at which clots are produced is greatly increased.  Dr. Singer also testified that Coumadin takes about three days after it is restarted to have any effect on clot formation.  Furthermore, Dr. Singer noted that he was familiar with the standard of care for gastroenterologists because he had been consulted by gastroenterologists on more than 100 occasions on the appropriate treatment for colonoscopy patients who are on anticoagulant therapy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States makes much of the fact that Dr. Singer admitted that he did not know how the risk of bleeding would vary depending on whether a hot or cold biopsy had been performed.  As other witnesses explained, biopsies can be \"cold\" or \"hot,\" the main difference being that during hot biopsies, the flesh is cauterized afterwards to minimize bleeding immediately after the operation.  Patients undergoing hot biopsies, however, are at risk for delayed bleeding between seven and fourteen days after the operation, when the scab that formed over the cauterized tissue falls away.  The defendant argues that Dr. Singer's admission establishes that his opinion--that the risk of bleeding was less than the risk of stroke--was personal speculation unsupported by any knowledge, training or experience and thus lacked a reliable factual foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inference is unwarranted.  A review of the trial transcript indicates that Dr. Singer merely stated that he could not quantify the risk of bleeding from a biopsy.  In the context of the question, \"risk\" referred to the likelihood of bleeding, not its severity.  Dr. Singer also testified, however, that he knew that the risk of bleeding was generally lower than the risk of stroke in terms of severity because only a tiny fraction of patients undergoing biopsies die as a result of these procedures.  In his opinion, the danger posed by keeping a patient off Coumadin for 11 days, with the attendant increase in the rate of clot production, is a greatly increased risk that the patient will suffer a stroke, which often leads to brain damage and death.  It was not necessary for Dr. Singer to be able to specify in numerical terms the likelihood that a biopsy patient would bleed after an operation in order to support his opinion that the risk that a patient would suffer a stroke clearly exceeded the danger posed by the possibility of post-operative bleeding, and thus that anticoagulants should be restarted sooner than the defendants did with Mr. Hassey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States also objects to Dr. Adler's testimony, which it also claims was unreliable and therefore should have been excluded under Daubert.   Dr. Adler testified that he would have restarted anticoagulant therapy several days before Mr. Hassey's physicians did.  The defendant's main complaint is that Dr. Adler rendered his opinion without first reading the transcripts of the physicians' depositions or certain parts of the medical record, including the post-operative report prepared by Dr. Berg.  This complaint would be valid only if the parts of the record that Dr. Adler did not read contained information that was unavailable in the parts that he did read.  In fact, Dr. Adler's evaluation of the pathologist's report allowed him to study the nature of the incisions made by the defendants in the course of the biopsy.  This report is at least as reliable a basis for his opinion as the report prepared by the treating physicians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant also argues that there was a discrepancy between the treatment that Drs. Adler and Singer would have recommended for Mr. Hassey.  We fail to see how this discrepancy should render Dr. Adler's testimony inadmissible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  To the contrary, although couched in Daubert terms, this argument is a thinly veiled challenge to the district court's determination of the credibility and soundness of Dr. Adler's opinion.  \"The fact that defendant was able to undercut some of the research basis for the doctors' opinions does not affect the admissibility of those opinions.  If the factual underpinnings of their opinions were in fact weak, that was a matter affecting the weight and credibility of their testimony.\"  Payton, 780 F.2d at 156 (citing Coleman v. DeMinico, 730 F.2d 42, 47 (1st Cir.1984));  cf.  Baker v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 382 Mass. 347, 416 N.E.2d 187, 190 (1981) (\"The question whether the basis of the doctor's opinion is sound goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\")   The finder of fact's determinations of credibility, and of the weight of the evidence in general, are not disturbed on appeal except for clear error.  A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).  Thus, a credibility determination is clearly erroneous only when it is based on testimony that was inherently implausible, internally inconsistent, or critically impeached.  See Keller v. United States, 38 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Adler's testimony was admissible and the court was entitled to rely on it:  it was plainly plausible, internally consistent (it was partly inconsistent with Dr. Singer's testimony, not with his own), and was not critically impeached.  More generally, the parties presented conflicting expert testimony from medical specialists on the issue of whether the defendants' decision to keep Mr. Hassey off Coumadin for more than ten days was a breach of the applicable standard of medical care and the proximate cause of his death.  After reviewing the record below, including the transcripts of the trial, we find the evidence before the district judge to be sufficient to permit him to find that Drs. Berg, Van Dam, and Silver were negligent in their treatment of Mr. Hassey, and that their negligence was a proximate cause of his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Denial of the Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States argues that a new trial was required because the plaintiff failed to provide any credible evidence that the risk of stroke was greater than the risk of bleeding, or that Mr. Hassey would not have had a stroke had the Coumadin therapy been restarted earlier.  We disagree, for reasons already amply explored above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Denial of the Motion for Mistrial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's counsel filed a motion requesting certain conclusions of law, including a suggested award of damages.  The United States argues that since the claim was for pain, suffering, and related subjective damages, the suggestion was a direct violation of Massachusetts law, which allegedly prohibits counsel from requesting that a finder of fact enter a specific subjective amount for unliquidated damage claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request for mistrial was properly denied.  First, a claim under section 2 of the wrongful death statute includes compensation not only for unliquidated damage claims, but also for liquidated damage claims, such as loss of income, which are not subject to the alleged prohibition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Furthermore, the \"prohibition\" on suggestions as to the amount of awards for unliquidated damage claims is not a true prohibition, but rather only a strong recommendation.  See, e.g., Goldstein v. Gontarz, 364 Mass. 800, 309 N.E.2d 196, 207 n. 15 (1974) (\"We agree with recent suggestions that in most cases where the damages are unliquidated and rest with the jury, the trial judge would be better advised to withhold the ad damnum from the jury than to read the figure and then attempt to negate its effect with an instruction.\")  (emphasis added).  Moreover, a review of the relevant case law indicates this rule has only been applied to jury trials.  In addition to the lack of precedent, we see no reason why Massachusetts would choose to extend the rule to bench trials, particularly since judges, unlike juries, are expected to be able to avoid being unduly influenced by counsel.  Here, not only was the trial a bench trial, but it was the trial judge himself who requested an estimate of the amount of damages that should be awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Denial of the Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 1996, an article was published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy which contained the results of a nationwide survey of gastroenterologists to determine the average standard of practice with respect to the management of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, including Coumadin, when performing diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures, including colonoscopies.  See C.E. Angueira, et al., Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in Patients Taking Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants:  Survey of ASGE Members, 44 J. of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, No. 3, at 309 (1996).  The following month, the Government filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) for relief from judgment, claiming that the article constituted \"new evidence\" that directly contradicted the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The district court denied the motion, and the United States now argues that the denial was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion under Rule 60(b)(2) for \"new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence requires proof of the following elements:\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The evidence has been discovered since the trial;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The evidence could not by due diligence have been discovered earlier by the movant[;]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) The evidence is of such nature that it would probably change the result if a new trial is granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raymond v. Raymond Corp., 938 F.2d 1518, 1527 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting Nickerson v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co., 900 F.2d 412, 417 (1st Cir.1990)).  A district court's ruling on a motion under Rule 60(b) will only be overturned for an abuse of discretion.  See Raymond, 938 F.2d at 1527;  Nickerson, 900 F.2d at 416;  Duffy v. Clippinger, 857 F.2d 877, 879 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two problems with the defendant's argument.  The first is that it is by no means clear that this article constitutes \"newly discovered evidence\" for purposes of Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).  Although the trial was held on May 1-3, 1996, approximately four months before the article was published, an abstract of the article had been available since 1993.  A more diligent effort to research the relevant medical literature by the defendant should have produced the abstract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and more important problem is that the evidence would not be likely to change the result of the trial.  The United States has retained as experts some of the authors of the article, one of whom would testify that, based on the survey, he thought that 60% of the gastroenterologists in the United States would have restarted Coumadin after a colonoscopy within 7 days or less.  The proposed expert would also testify that there are no published guidelines at present that would assist endoscopists in managing patients on anticoagulant therapy during the period of time following a colonoscopy, and that most endoscopists are therefore using their own judgment or criteria in managing such patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence would not have required the trial judge to reach a different result.  As a general matter, the article, and the expert's testimony, are based on a survey to which only 38.5% of ASGE members responded, a response rate which was described by the authors of the article as \"less than ideal.\"   Moreover, the responses were based on generalized questions, such as the length of time the gastroenterologists would wait before restarting Coumadin after a therapeutic colonoscopy (i.e., one during which a biopsy or polypectomy was performed) in patients suffering from conditions such as atrial fibrillation.  The answers to these questions are not definitive because they did not take into consideration the particulars of a patient's medical history, even though the experts testifying before the trial judge agreed that such particulars are indispensable in determining the proper treatment to be followed.  As for the proposed testimony regarding the lack of published guidelines, the fact remains that gastroenterologists cannot close their eyes to the standard of care appropriate to other specialties when performing procedures within their own that impact upon other specialties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge heard testimony from specialists in hematology and gastroenterology who indicated that Mr. Hassey should not have been kept off Coumadin as long as he was, and explained in detail why they thought so.  We think it improbable that the proposed evidence would have resulted in a different outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Distribution of the Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Administratrix and the Government appeal from the district court's award of damages.  The Administratrix argues that the district court erred as a matter of both law and fact in denying Mr. Hassey's adult children's claims for compensation under the Massachusetts wrongful death statute.  The United States, in turn, argues that the district court did not err in not awarding damages to the decedent's children because they are adults who were no longer financially dependent upon their father and are therefore not entitled to recover under the statute.  The Government also argues, however, that insofar as the district court awarded damages to Mr. Hassey's widow, rather than to the Administratrix, the district court acted without subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2 of the wrongful death statute provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>[a] person who ... by his negligence causes the death of a person ... shall be liable in damages in the amount of ... the fair monetary value of the decedent to the persons entitled to receive the damages recovered, as provided in section , including but not limited to compensation for the loss of the reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice of the decedent to the persons entitled to the damages recovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.

Grogean, 406 Mass. 364, 548 N.E.2d 180, 181 (1990).  However, \"the first clause of section 2 limits recovery to a class of persons.  It provides for recovery of compensatory damages by 'the persons entitled to receive the damages recovered' and limits the class to those persons 'as provided in section .' \" See Burt v. Meyer, 400 Mass. 185, 508 N.E.2d 598, 602 (1987) (adopting interpretation proposed in Guy v. Johnson, 15 Mass.App.Ct. 757, 448 N.E.2d 1142, 1144-45 (1983)).  If the class of presumptive takers, as defined in section 1, is to recover under section 2, they must then prove that the decedent had monetary value to them.  See Burt, 508 N.E.2d at 602;  Guy, 448 N.E.2d at 1144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no support in Massachusetts statutory or case law for the United States' contention that adult children must be financially dependent upon their decedent in order to be entitled to recover damages under section 2 of the wrongful death statute.  To the contrary, the plain language of section 1(3) of the wrongful death statute makes the surviving spouse and children presumptive takers without mentioning any requirement that they be dependent.  Moreover, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has approved the award of damages to relatives who were not financially dependent upon the decedent.  See Santos v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 408 Mass. 70, 556 N.E.2d 983, 988 n. 10 (1990) (parents of deceased adult unmarried child may recover damages under section 2 as \"next of kin\" for purposes of section 1);  Schultz, 548 N.E.2d at 182 (same);  cf.  Bratcher v. Galusha, 417 Mass. 28, 627 N.E.2d 908 (1994) (father of deceased adult married child was not entitled to recover damages under section 2 because, under section 1, the surviving spouse was the only presumptive taker);  Norman v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 403 Mass. 303, 529 N.E.2d 139, 142 (1988) (noting, in dicta, that if child had died rather than merely been injured, parents would have been entitled to recover under section 2 for loss of consortium);  Guy, 448 N.E.2d at 1145 (father of deceased minor child was presumptive taker under section 1).  Similarly, at least one federal district court has explicitly decided that adult children are presumptive takers in a claim under section 2 for the death of their parent.  See Knowlton v. Spillane, 137 F.R.D. 196, 197 (D.Mass.1991);  cf.  Poyser v. United States, 602 F.Supp. 436 (D.Mass.1984) (mother of a minor daughter was a presumed taker under section 1(4)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, a situation identical to this case seems to have arisen in Burt v. Meyer, 400 Mass. 185, 508 N.E.2d 598 (1987).  After the trial of the wrongful death action brought by the executrix of the estate of the decedent, the jury awarded, inter alia, $174,000 in compensatory damages for the benefit of the widow, and $20,000 for the benefit of each of the decedent's four children by a previous marriage.  On appeal, the adult children of the decedent argued that the distribution of an award under section 2 was subject to the constraints of section 1, which they claimed entitled them to two thirds of the entire award.  The Supreme Judicial Court rejected this argument, holding that a presumptive taker is entitled to nothing beyond what it is proven at trial he or she lost as a result of the decedent's death.  More importantly, however, the Court affirmed the original award to the children.  Although the Court's decision does not specifically state that the children were non-dependent adults, that fact could fairly be inferred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we affirm the trial judge's award of damages.  The trial judge heard testimony from all of Mr. Hassey's children as to their relationship with him and the effect that his death has had upon them.  The fact that the judge did so even after the Government had vigorously argued that the children were not entitled to recover under section 2 indicates that the judge correctly understood that Mr. Hassey's children were presumptive takers under section 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing the children's testimony, the trial judge still chose to award them nothing.  Upon reviewing the relevant portion of the trial transcript, we find that it would not have been error for the trial judge to find that the loss suffered by the decedent's children did not exceed such grief, anguish, and bereavement as one may normally expect upon the death of a parent.  As the Administratrix admits in her brief, recovery under section 2 \"was not intended to include components of 'grief, anguish and bereavement of the survivors.' \"  MacCuish v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 22 Mass.App.Ct. 380, 494 N.E.2d 390, 398 (1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although the United States is technically correct in pointing out that the trial judge should have awarded damages to the Administratrix, rather than to Mrs. Hassey, the error is merely one of form.  Pursuant to section 2 of the statute, \"[d]amages under this section shall be recovered in an action of tort by the executor or administrator of the deceased.\"   However, \"the procedural framework of the wrongful death statute, through which an administrator brings an action on behalf of the next of kin, [does not make] each person who has suffered consortium-like damages any less injured.  To hold otherwise would elevate form over substance, looking less at the question, 'who is injured,' and more at the question, 'who is technically bringing the suit.' \"  Santos, 556 N.E.2d at 988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court has therefore approved of verdicts awarding different amounts to each person recovering under section 2.  See Burt, 508 N.E.2d at 602 ($174,000 for widow and $20,000 for each child);  Guy, 448 N.E.2d at 1145 ($37,786.06 for mother and $103.41 for father).  Indeed, in Guy, the Court approved of the decision of the probate judge to distribute the award of compensatory damages obtained in a wrongful death suit in accordance with the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge in this case, therefore, did not err in determining the specific amount that Mrs. Evelyn Hassey was entitled to receive.  Instead, the only error he committed was to enter judgment in her name, rather than in the name of the Administratrix.  The error is easily corrected.  We thus resolve to modify the judgment to clarify that the nominal recipient of the award is the Administratrix of the Estate of Alfred J. Hassey, for the benefit of Evelyn Hassey.  Of course, when the assets of the estate are distributed, the probate judge will distribute the compensatory damages awarded in this suit in accordance with the trial judge's findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment entered by the district court, as modified by this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We set out the facts in the light most favorable to the trial court's findings of fact.

We note that the Supreme Judicial Court has adopted Daubert \"in concept,\" but unlike a federal court, it reviews de novo a trial court's ruling on the admissibility of scientific expert testimony.  See Commonwealth v. Vao Sok, 425 Mass. 787, 683 N.E.2d 671, 677 (1997)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A claim under section 2 includes but is \"not limited to compensation for the loss of the reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice of the decedent.\"  Mass.

Gen. Laws ch. 229, &#167; 1 (emphasis added).  Until 1975, damages under section 2 were also assessed with reference to the degree of negligence of the defendant.  Since the 1975 amendment, however, damages under section 2 are assessed with reference to the \"fair monetary value of the decedent to the persons entitled to receive the damages recovered.\"   As the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted, one \"can surmise that when [section] 2 was revised to introduce the compensatory principle of recovery, less than enough attention was paid to the compatibility of [section] 1.\"  Guy v. Johnson, 15 Mass.App.Ct. 757, 448 N.E.2d 1142, 1144 (1983).

Hassey died on June 3, 1990, from a stroke he had suffered soon after undergoing a colonoscopy at the West Roxbury Veterans Administration Hospital.  His daughter, Jean Mitchell, as Administratrix of his estate, filed this wrongful death action on behalf of her mother, siblings, and herself against his treating physicians, Drs. Carl Berg and Marc Silver, as well as against the United States of America, the owner of the Hospital.  After dismissing the claims against the individual defendants and holding a bench trial on the remaining claims, the trial judge found the United States liable and awarded damages to the decedent's widow, but not to his children.  Both the United States and the Administratrix, on behalf of the decedent's children, cross-appealed.  We affirm, with one minor clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Hassey had been diagnosed in 1985 with atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that often causes an increase in the rate at which blood clots are formed.  His doctors therefore prescribed the use of Coumadin, an anticoagulant medication, in order to help prevent the formation of blood clots.  Mr. Hassey had also suffered from colon cancer, which was treated by a hemicolonectomy in 1983.  The operation was successful and he remained asymptomatic until the end of his life.  Nevertheless, he was required to undergo prophylactic colonoscopies approximately every two years to detect any recurrence of the cancer.  In June of 1988, Mr. Hassey underwent a colonoscopy at the Hospital.  He was taken off Coumadin three days prior to the operation, and instead given Heparin, another anticoagulant.  Coumadin therapy was restarted the same day he was discharged from the Hospital.  He reported no ill effects from this operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years later, Mr. Hassey was due for another colonoscopy.  Without reviewing his medical chart or medical history, Mr. Hassey's physicians, Drs. Carl Berg and Jacques Van Dam, instructed him to discontinue his Coumadin therapy starting five days prior to his colonoscopy.  Mr. Hassey stopped taking Coumadin six days before the procedure, on April 17, 1990.  He was admitted to the Hospital on April 22, 1990, and on the following day, Drs. Berg and Van Dam performed the colonoscopy.  During the operation, a suspicious polyp was located and removed by \"hot\" biopsy, pursuant to which the surgeons cauterized the intestinal wall from which the polyp had been removed.  The polyp was later determined to be pre-cancerous.  Mr. Hassey was discharged on that same day by Hospital physician Dr. Marc Silver, and instructed to restart the Coumadin therapy after five days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As scheduled, Mr. Hassey restarted the Coumadin therapy on April 28, 1990, eleven days after he had stopped taking the medication.  That was the longest period of time that he had been off Coumadin since he was first prescribed its use.  The following day, Mr. Hassey was re-admitted to the Hospital because he was experiencing weakness in the right side of his body and had difficulty speaking.  He suffered a massive cerebral vascular accident:  in lay terms, a stroke.  One month later, Mr. Hassey died from complications arising from the stroke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her role as Administratrix of the Estate of Alfred J. Hassey, Jean Mitchell filed the instant suit against Drs. Berg and Silver, as well as against the United States of America, the owner of the Hospital.  The complaint, which alleged that the defendants' negligence was the proximate cause of Mr. Hassey's death, was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2671-80, and the Massachusetts wrongful death statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 229, &#167;&#167; 1-2.  The complaint specifically alleged that the defendants violated their duty of care to the decedent by keeping him off Coumadin for an excessive period of time.  The complaint further alleged that the discontinuation of the Coumadin therapy was the proximate cause of the stroke that ultimately led to Mr. Hassey's death.  Before trial, the Administratrix and the United States stipulated that the United States would be substituted, in place of Drs. Silver and Berg, as the sole party defendant.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2679(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the bench trial, four expert witnesses testified as to the nature and causes of Mr. Hassey's death, two on behalf of the Administratrix, and two on behalf of the United States.  Mr. Hassey's relatives also testified as to the emotional impact that his death had upon them.  After the trial, the district judge found that the United States was liable to Evelyn Hassey in that its employees \"failed to use the care and skill of an average qualified specialist taking into account the advances in their profession in their care and treatment of Alfred Hassey.\"   The district judge awarded Mrs. Evelyn Hassey $300,000 for her loss, but awarded nothing to the Administratrix or to the decedent's children.  Various post-judgment motions were submitted to and rejected by the district court.  Both the United States and the Administratrix now appeal from the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52, \"[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury,\" the trial court's \"[f]indings of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\"   See Sullivan v.

Generally, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action may carry his or her burden of proof on the issues of negligence and causation only with the assistance of expert testimony.  See Harlow v.

A physician is held to the standard of care and skill of the average practitioner of the medical specialty in question, taking into account the advances in the profession.  See Poyser, 602 F.Supp. at 438-39 (citing Brune v.

Proof of the element of causation, which is an issue of fact, depends on whether it is more probable than not that the death was the result of the physician's negligence.  See Harlow, 545 N.E.2d at 605.   Here it must be emphasized that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>[w]hile the plaintiff is not bound to exclude every other possibility of cause for his injury except that of the negligence of the defendant, he is required to show by evidence a greater likelihood that it came from an act of negligence for which the defendant is responsible than from a cause for which the defendant is not liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forlano, 471 N.E.2d at 1319 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by evaluating its actions under a strict liability rather than negligence standard of care.  The United States points to certain isolated statements made by the trial judge during trial that, it claims, establish that he applied a strict liability standard of care.  We disagree.  The comments in question were vague and do not necessarily establish that the judge applied the wrong standard of care.  Indeed, in his findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial judge relied on expert medical opinion in determining that Mr. Hassey's treating physicians provided negligent medical care, and that their negligence was a proximate cause of his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of statistical evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States complains that the district court erred in refusing to admit or consider the testimony of one of its medical experts on the statistics concerning the risk of stroke versus the risk of bleeding.  We reject this assignment of error.  The trial judge ultimately did not refuse to admit this testimony.  Although he did, at first, resist the admission of the statistical evidence, on the following day the trial judge proceeded to hear the testimony in question.  The defendant's invitation to reverse the judgment below is thus based on its speculative conclusion that the absence of a discussion of statistical evidence in the judge's findings of fact \"clearly indicate[s]\" that he did not consider this evidence because he was biased against its use.  We decline the invitation to engage in such speculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Admission of expert testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States also claims that the judgment below must be reversed insofar as it rested on the plaintiff's expert testimony, which it contends should have been excluded by the district court under Daubert v.

The baseline for approaching questions of the admissibility of evidence is Fed.R.Evid. 402, which provides that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible,\" except as otherwise provided by the Constitution, laws, or rules of the court.  Evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 401.

Finally, we note that a district court enjoys substantial discretion to decide whether to admit or exclude relevant expert testimony.  See General Elec.

Barry Singer and Howard Adler.  The first issue is thus whether the testimony offered by the plaintiff's expert witnesses was relevant--i.e., whether the testimony could \"assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\"  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. at 2796.   The issue before the judge was whether Mr. Hassey's treating physicians acted according to the standard of care and skill of the average member of a practitioner of their medical specialty, taking into account the advances in the profession, when they adjusted Mr. Hassey's anticoagulant levels before and after the colonoscopy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The experts for both parties testified that during a colonoscopy, if a polyp is detected, the surgeon normally performs a polypectomy (a type of biopsy), cutting off the polyp for examination.  The experts also agreed that anticoagulants can increase the risk of bleeding from wounds and retard their healing.  Thus, to allow the clotting factors of a colonoscopy patient on Coumadin therapy to return to normal so as to permit adequate healing of his or her intestinal tissue, such a patient is required to be off Coumadin for a period of time.  The longer the period during which the patient is not taking Coumadin, however, the greater the risk that he or she will suffer a stroke.  The proper length of time to keep a colonoscopy patient off Coumadin therefore depends on a balancing between the risk of bleeding and the risk of stroke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony offered by Drs. Singer and Adler was certainly relevant to the issue at trial.  Dr. Singer, an internist with specialties in hematology and oncology, testified that he had substantial experience in the use of Coumadin, and that he had performed several colonoscopies earlier in his career.  He also testified that he had been consulted over 100 times by gastroenterologists seeking advice on the proper treatment for patients on anticoagulant medication who were scheduled to undergo colonoscopies.  Similarly, Dr. Adler, an internist with a specialty in gastroenterology, testified that he has performed at least twenty thousand colonoscopies, as well as numerous biopsies, including polypectomies.  He further testified that he was familiar with the risk of bleeding associated with these procedures, and with the standard of care expected of gastroenterologists in adjusting anticoagulant levels for patients undergoing colonoscopies.  We find no error in the district judge's determination that the testimony provided by both of these experts would assist him in understanding and determining the facts at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the United States challenges the admissibility of the opinions of these experts on the basis that such testimony was not reliable.  With regard to Dr. Singer, the defendant claims that he was not qualified to testify about the defendants' treatment of Mr. Hassey because he is not a specialist in gastroenterology, and that he could not provide a reliable opinion on the risk of stroke as compared to the risk of bleed because he admitted during trial that he had no direct knowledge of the risk of bleeding from a colonoscopy during which a polypectomy was performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  First of all, the Government is simply wrong to suggest that Dr. Singer was not qualified to testify merely because he was not a gastroenterologist.  \"The fact that the physician is not a specialist in the field in which he is giving his opinion affects not the admissibility of his opinion but the weight the jury may place on it.\"  Payton v. Abbott Labs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462588\"><a href=\"/opinion/462588/brenda-payton-v-abbott-labs-eli-lilly-and-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.1985);  cf.  Letch v. Daniels, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985285/letch-v-daniels/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1985285\"><a href=\"/opinion/1985285/letch-v-daniels/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 677 (1987) (\"A medical expert need not be a specialist in the area concerned nor be practicing in the same field as the defendant.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the specific testimony offered by Dr. Singer was within his area of expertise. He testified that cardiologists and hematologists are very much aware of the relative benefits and risks arising from the use of anticoagulants such as Coumadin, and the effects of their discontinuation.  Dr. Singer explained that when a patient who has been taking Coumadin for several years is taken off the medication, that patient will enter a hypercoagulative state in which the rate at which clots are produced is greatly increased.  Dr. Singer also testified that Coumadin takes about three days after it is restarted to have any effect on clot formation.  Furthermore, Dr. Singer noted that he was familiar with the standard of care for gastroenterologists because he had been consulted by gastroenterologists on more than 100 occasions on the appropriate treatment for colonoscopy patients who are on anticoagulant therapy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States makes much of the fact that Dr. Singer admitted that he did not know how the risk of bleeding would vary depending on whether a hot or cold biopsy had been performed.  As other witnesses explained, biopsies can be \"cold\" or \"hot,\" the main difference being that during hot biopsies, the flesh is cauterized afterwards to minimize bleeding immediately after the operation.  Patients undergoing hot biopsies, however, are at risk for delayed bleeding between seven and fourteen days after the operation, when the scab that formed over the cauterized tissue falls away.  The defendant argues that Dr. Singer's admission establishes that his opinion--that the risk of bleeding was less than the risk of stroke--was personal speculation unsupported by any knowledge, training or experience and thus lacked a reliable factual foundation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inference is unwarranted.  A review of the trial transcript indicates that Dr. Singer merely stated that he could not quantify the risk of bleeding from a biopsy.  In the context of the question, \"risk\" referred to the likelihood of bleeding, not its severity.  Dr. Singer also testified, however, that he knew that the risk of bleeding was generally lower than the risk of stroke in terms of severity because only a tiny fraction of patients undergoing biopsies die as a result of these procedures.  In his opinion, the danger posed by keeping a patient off Coumadin for 11 days, with the attendant increase in the rate of clot production, is a greatly increased risk that the patient will suffer a stroke, which often leads to brain damage and death.  It was not necessary for Dr. Singer to be able to specify in numerical terms the likelihood that a biopsy patient would bleed after an operation in order to support his opinion that the risk that a patient would suffer a stroke clearly exceeded the danger posed by the possibility of post-operative bleeding, and thus that anticoagulants should be restarted sooner than the defendants did with Mr. Hassey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States also objects to Dr. Adler's testimony, which it also claims was unreliable and therefore should have been excluded under Daubert.   Dr. Adler testified that he would have restarted anticoagulant therapy several days before Mr. Hassey's physicians did.  The defendant's main complaint is that Dr. Adler rendered his opinion without first reading the transcripts of the physicians' depositions or certain parts of the medical record, including the post-operative report prepared by Dr. Berg.  This complaint would be valid only if the parts of the record that Dr. Adler did not read contained information that was unavailable in the parts that he did read.  In fact, Dr. Adler's evaluation of the pathologist's report allowed him to study the nature of the incisions made by the defendants in the course of the biopsy.  This report is at least as reliable a basis for his opinion as the report prepared by the treating physicians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant also argues that there was a discrepancy between the treatment that Drs. Adler and Singer would have recommended for Mr. Hassey.  We fail to see how this discrepancy should render Dr. Adler's testimony inadmissible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  To the contrary, although couched in Daubert terms, this argument is a thinly veiled challenge to the district court's determination of the credibility and soundness of Dr. Adler's opinion.  \"The fact that defendant was able to undercut some of the research basis for the doctors' opinions does not affect the admissibility of those opinions.  If the factual underpinnings of their opinions were in fact weak, that was a matter affecting the weight and credibility of their testimony.\"  Payton, 780 F.2d at 156 (citing Coleman v.

A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 573, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, a credibility determination is clearly erroneous only when it is based on testimony that was inherently implausible, internally inconsistent, or critically impeached.  See Keller v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195675\"><a href=\"/opinion/195675/keller-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Adler's testimony was admissible and the court was entitled to rely on it:  it was plainly plausible, internally consistent (it was partly inconsistent with Dr. Singer's testimony, not with his own), and was not critically impeached.  More generally, the parties presented conflicting expert testimony from medical specialists on the issue of whether the defendants' decision to keep Mr. Hassey off Coumadin for more than ten days was a breach of the applicable standard of medical care and the proximate cause of his death.  After reviewing the record below, including the transcripts of the trial, we find the evidence before the district judge to be sufficient to permit him to find that Drs. Berg, Van Dam, and Silver were negligent in their treatment of Mr. Hassey, and that their negligence was a proximate cause of his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Denial of the Motion for New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States argues that a new trial was required because the plaintiff failed to provide any credible evidence that the risk of stroke was greater than the risk of bleeding, or that Mr. Hassey would not have had a stroke had the Coumadin therapy been restarted earlier.  We disagree, for reasons already amply explored above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Denial of the Motion for Mistrial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's counsel filed a motion requesting certain conclusions of law, including a suggested award of damages.  The United States argues that since the claim was for pain, suffering, and related subjective damages, the suggestion was a direct violation of Massachusetts law, which allegedly prohibits counsel from requesting that a finder of fact enter a specific subjective amount for unliquidated damage claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request for mistrial was properly denied.  First, a claim under section 2 of the wrongful death statute includes compensation not only for unliquidated damage claims, but also for liquidated damage claims, such as loss of income, which are not subject to the alleged prohibition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Furthermore, the \"prohibition\" on suggestions as to the amount of awards for unliquidated damage claims is not a true prohibition, but rather only a strong recommendation.  See, e.g., Goldstein v. Gontarz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2015454\"><a href=\"/opinion/2015454/goldstein-v-gontarz/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2015454\"><a href=\"/opinion/2015454/goldstein-v-gontarz/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 207 n. 15 (1974) (\"We agree with recent suggestions that in most cases where the damages are unliquidated and rest with the jury, the trial judge would be better advised to withhold the ad damnum from the jury than to read the figure and then attempt to negate its effect with an instruction.\")  (emphasis added).  Moreover, a review of the relevant case law indicates this rule has only been applied to jury trials.  In addition to the lack of precedent, we see no reason why Massachusetts would choose to extend the rule to bench trials, particularly since judges, unlike juries, are expected to be able to avoid being unduly influenced by counsel.  Here, not only was the trial a bench trial, but it was the trial judge himself who requested an estimate of the amount of damages that should be awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Denial of the Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 1996, an article was published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy which contained the results of a nationwide survey of gastroenterologists to determine the average standard of practice with respect to the management of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, including Coumadin, when performing diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures, including colonoscopies.  See C.E. Angueira, et al., Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in Patients Taking Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants:  Survey of ASGE Members, 44 J. of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, No. 3, at 309 (1996).  The following month, the Government filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) for relief from judgment, claiming that the article constituted \"new evidence\" that directly contradicted the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The district court denied the motion, and the United States now argues that the denial was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion under Rule 60(b)(2) for \"new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence requires proof of the following elements:\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The evidence has been discovered since the trial;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The evidence could not by due diligence have been discovered earlier by the movant[;]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) The evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) The evidence is of such nature that it would probably change the result if a new trial is granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raymond v.

A district court's ruling on a motion under Rule 60(b) will only be overturned for an abuse of discretion.  See Raymond, 938 F.2d at 1527;  Nickerson, 900 F.2d at 416;  Duffy v. Clippinger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511961\"><a href=\"/opinion/511961/mary-t-duffy-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-brendan/\"><span class=\"volume\">857</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span>, 879 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two problems with the defendant's argument.  The first is that it is by no means clear that this article constitutes \"newly discovered evidence\" for purposes of Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).  Although the trial was held on May 1-3, 1996, approximately four months before the article was published, an abstract of the article had been available since 1993.  A more diligent effort to research the relevant medical literature by the defendant should have produced the abstract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second and more important problem is that the evidence would not be likely to change the result of the trial.  The United States has retained as experts some of the authors of the article, one of whom would testify that, based on the survey, he thought that 60% of the gastroenterologists in the United States would have restarted Coumadin after a colonoscopy within 7 days or less.  The proposed expert would also testify that there are no published guidelines at present that would assist endoscopists in managing patients on anticoagulant therapy during the period of time following a colonoscopy, and that most endoscopists are therefore using their own judgment or criteria in managing such patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence would not have required the trial judge to reach a different result.  As a general matter, the article, and the expert's testimony, are based on a survey to which only 38.5% of ASGE members responded, a response rate which was described by the authors of the article as \"less than ideal.\"   Moreover, the responses were based on generalized questions, such as the length of time the gastroenterologists would wait before restarting Coumadin after a therapeutic colonoscopy (i.e., one during which a biopsy or polypectomy was performed) in patients suffering from conditions such as atrial fibrillation.  The answers to these questions are not definitive because they did not take into consideration the particulars of a patient's medical history, even though the experts testifying before the trial judge agreed that such particulars are indispensable in determining the proper treatment to be followed.  As for the proposed testimony regarding the lack of published guidelines, the fact remains that gastroenterologists cannot close their eyes to the standard of care appropriate to other specialties when performing procedures within their own that impact upon other specialties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge heard testimony from specialists in hematology and gastroenterology who indicated that Mr. Hassey should not have been kept off Coumadin as long as he was, and explained in detail why they thought so.  We think it improbable that the proposed evidence would have resulted in a different outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Distribution of the Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the Administratrix and the Government appeal from the district court's award of damages.  The Administratrix argues that the district court erred as a matter of both law and fact in denying Mr. Hassey's adult children's claims for compensation under the Massachusetts wrongful death statute.  The United States, in turn, argues that the district court did not err in not awarding damages to the decedent's children because they are adults who were no longer financially dependent upon their father and are therefore not entitled to recover under the statute.  The Government also argues, however, that insofar as the district court awarded damages to Mr. Hassey's widow, rather than to the Administratrix, the district court acted without subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2 of the wrongful death statute provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>[a] person who ... by his negligence causes the death of a person ... shall be liable in damages in the amount of ... the fair monetary value of the decedent to the persons entitled to receive the damages recovered, as provided in section , including but not limited to compensation for the loss of the reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice of the decedent to the persons entitled to the damages recovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass.

If the class of presumptive takers, as defined in section 1, is to recover under section 2, they must then prove that the decedent had monetary value to them.

To the contrary, the plain language of section 1(3) of the wrongful death statute makes the surviving spouse and children presumptive takers without mentioning any requirement that they be dependent.  Moreover, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has approved the award of damages to relatives who were not financially dependent upon the decedent.  See Santos v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas.

Similarly, at least one federal district court has explicitly decided that adult children are presumptive takers in a claim under section 2 for the death of their parent.  See Knowlton v. Spillane, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></span>, 197 (D.Mass.1991);  cf.  Poyser v.

After the trial of the wrongful death action brought by the executrix of the estate of the decedent, the jury awarded, inter alia, $174,000 in compensatory damages for the benefit of the widow, and $20,000 for the benefit of each of the decedent's four children by a previous marriage.  On appeal, the adult children of the decedent argued that the distribution of an award under section 2 was subject to the constraints of section 1, which they claimed entitled them to two thirds of the entire award.  The Supreme Judicial Court rejected this argument, holding that a presumptive taker is entitled to nothing beyond what it is proven at trial he or she lost as a result of the decedent's death.  More importantly, however, the Court affirmed the original award to the children.  Although the Court's decision does not specifically state that the children were non-dependent adults, that fact could fairly be inferred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, we affirm the trial judge's award of damages.  The trial judge heard testimony from all of Mr. Hassey's children as to their relationship with him and the effect that his death has had upon them.  The fact that the judge did so even after the Government had vigorously argued that the children were not entitled to recover under section 2 indicates that the judge correctly understood that Mr. Hassey's children were presumptive takers under section 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing the children's testimony, the trial judge still chose to award them nothing.  Upon reviewing the relevant portion of the trial transcript, we find that it would not have been error for the trial judge to find that the loss suffered by the decedent's children did not exceed such grief, anguish, and bereavement as one may normally expect upon the death of a parent.  As the Administratrix admits in her brief, recovery under section 2 \"was not intended to include components of 'grief, anguish and bereavement of the survivors.' \"  MacCuish v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 22 Mass.App.Ct. 380, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2033337\"><a href=\"/opinion/2033337/maccuish-v-volkswagenwerk-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 398 (1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although the United States is technically correct in pointing out that the trial judge should have awarded damages to the Administratrix, rather than to Mrs. Hassey, the error is merely one of form.  Pursuant to section 2 of the statute, \"[d]amages under this section shall be recovered in an action of tort by the executor or administrator of the deceased.\"   However, \"the procedural framework of the wrongful death statute, through which an administrator brings an action on behalf of the next of kin, [does not make] each person who has suffered consortium-like damages any less injured.  To hold otherwise would elevate form over substance, looking less at the question, 'who is injured,' and more at the question, 'who is technically bringing the suit.' \"  Santos, 556 N.E.2d at 988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court has therefore approved of verdicts awarding different amounts to each person recovering under section 2.  See Burt, 508 N.E.2d at 602 ($174,000 for widow and $20,000 for each child);  Guy, 448 N.E.2d at 1145 ($37,786.06 for mother and $103.41 for father).  Indeed, in Guy, the Court approved of the decision of the probate judge to distribute the award of compensatory damages obtained in a wrongful death suit in accordance with the jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge in this case, therefore, did not err in determining the specific amount that Mrs. Evelyn Hassey was entitled to receive.  Instead, the only error he committed was to enter judgment in her name, rather than in the name of the Administratrix.  The error is easily corrected.  We thus resolve to modify the judgment to clarify that the nominal recipient of the award is the Administratrix of the Estate of Alfred J. Hassey, for the benefit of Evelyn Hassey.  Of course, when the assets of the estate are distributed, the probate judge will distribute the compensatory damages awarded in this suit in accordance with the trial judge's findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment entered by the district court, as modified by this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We set out the facts in the light most favorable to the trial court's findings of fact.

Vao Sok, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></span>, 677 (1997)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A claim under section 2 includes but is \"not limited to compensation for the loss of the reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice of the decedent.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229, &#167; 2</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Liability under section 1 is imposed when \"the life of a person is lost by reason of a defect or a want of repair of or a want of a sufficient railing in or upon a way, causeway or bridge, the county, city, town or person by law obliged to repair the same shall, if it or he had previous reasonable notice of the defect or want of repair or want of railing, be liable in damages not exceeding four thousand dollars, to be assessed with reference to the degree of culpability of the defendant.  \"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 229, &#167; 1 (emphasis added).  Until 1975, damages under section 2 were also assessed with reference to the degree of negligence of the defendant.  Since the 1975 amendment, however, damages under section 2 are assessed with reference to the \"fair monetary value of the decedent to the persons entitled to receive the damages recovered.\"   As the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted, one \"can surmise that when [section] 2 was revised to introduce the compensatory principle of recovery, less than enough attention was paid to the compatibility of [section] 1.\"  Guy v. Johnson, 15 Mass.App.Ct. 757, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2080267\"><a href=\"/opinion/2080267/guy-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span>, 1144 (1983).  That lack of attention has given rise to some of the interpretive problems discussed in the text above</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The four children are full siblings.  The two male children's surname, like their father's, is Meyer, but the two female children's surnames are Burt and Croteau, respectively.  The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the two female children were married.  If so, they were adults and thus presumably no longer financially dependent on their father</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Appeals Court noted that although the version of the wrongful death statute that was originally passed by the Massachusetts legislature provided for recovery of fair compensation for grief, anguish, and bereavement, that provision was deleted from the bill before it was signed into law.
