Acevedo-Cruz on brief for appellant.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney (Chief, Criminal\nDivision), and Stella J. Song, Special Assistant United States\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        March 8, 2002\n\f\f         SELYA, Circuit Judge. On April 28, 2001, United States\n\nNavy personnel arrested defendant-appellant Juan Carlos Guzman\n\nfor trespassing on the premises of Camp Garcia, a military\n\ninstallation located on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico.1        The\n\ngovernment   thereafter    filed    an    information   charging    the\n\nappellant, inter alia, with two Class B misdemeanors:          count 1\n\n— knowingly entering upon a naval installation for a purpose\n\nprohibited by law without first having obtained permission from\n\nthe commanding officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1382; and\n\ncount 2 — assault on a naval officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 111(a)(1).     A third count, which accused the appellant of\n\nassaulting   a   United   States   Deputy    Marshal,   was   abandoned\n\nmidstream and need not concern us.\n\n         The appellant moved to dismiss the charges due to\n\noutrageous government misconduct.        The district court decided to\n\ntake evidence on this motion and withheld an immediate ruling.\n\nOn June 13, 2001, the court conducted a bench trial that doubled\n\nin brass as an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss.\n\nThe court denied the motion, found the appellant guilty on both\n\nremaining counts, and imposed concurrent sentences of forty-five\n\n\n\n    1There is some confusion in the record as to the correct\nspelling of the appellant's surname (which appears variously as\n\"Guzman\" or \"Cuzman\"). We employ the spelling that appears in\nboth the indictment and the district court docket.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fdays' imprisonment on count 1 and ninety days' imprisonment on\n\ncount 2.     This timely appeal followed.\n\n            The    appellant          assigns    error       only    to     the    district\n\ncourt's denial of his motion to dismiss.                         The facts touching\n\nupon this motion are largely undisputed.                      On April 27, 2001, the\n\nNavy, consistent with a previous announcement, commenced battle-\n\npreparedness exercises, including simulated bombing, near the\n\nisland of Vieques.         A swarm of protesters appeared.                    About fifty\n\nof them, including the appellant, tore down a portion of the\n\nfence that marked the perimeter of Camp Garcia and entered the\n\nbase without permission.               Once inside, they engaged in various\n\nforms of disruptive conduct.              For his part, the appellant hurled\n\nrocks that hit and injured at least one petty officer.\n\n            The next day, the appellant again entered the base\n\nillegally.       This time, naval security personnel apprehended him\n\n(along with approximately twenty other protesters).                           Pursuant to\n\nroutine    procedure,          they    handcuffed        all    the       detainees     and\n\ntransported       them    by    truck     to    a     holding       area.         Processing\n\nproceeded along standard lines.                 The regimen included searching\n\neach   detainee,         completing      necessary           paperwork,       and     taking\n\nphotographs.\n\n            At    the     holding      area,     two    officers          recognized    the\n\nappellant    as    a     rock-thrower          from    the    previous       day.      They\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fpromptly classified him as a security risk and segregated him\n\nfrom the other detainees.         Naval personnel placed him on his\n\nknees with his cuffed hands against a wall and guarded him until\n\nhe was called for processing.        The appellant was kept in this\n\nposition for, at most, seventy minutes.\n\n            The appellant was barefoot and clad in shorts when\n\narrested.    The floor of the yard in which he was held was of\n\ncement construction, and the venue was exposed to the elements\n\n(including    the    midday   tropical    sun).      At    one   point,    the\n\nappellant asked to be taken inside the detention center, but his\n\nrequest was denied.\n\n            The appellant was one of the last persons processed.\n\nThe government asserts, without contradiction, that this was\n\nbecause   security    personnel   were    awaiting    the   arrival       of   a\n\nspecial agent of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to\n\nconduct an investigation of the assault that had occurred on the\n\nprevious day.     After all the detainees (including the appellant)\n\nhad been processed, they were transported to Roosevelt Roads\n\nNaval Station (about a two-hour boat ride) and arraigned there\n\nby a magistrate judge.\n\n            The   appellant    premises    his     claim    of   outrageous\n\ngovernment misconduct on these events.            In his counsel's words,\n\nthe pat-down search of his clothing and body \"can only be\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fcharacterized     a[s]    offensive,      unnecessary        and   brutal.\"\n\nAppellant's Br. at 12.        Forcing him to kneel, barefooted, on a\n\ncement floor, with his handcuffed hands over his head, for more\n\nthan one hour, amounted to \"torture.\"           Id. at 13.    This inhumane\n\ntreatment was all the worse because he received no food or\n\nwater,2 and was afforded no rest.          Based on this view of the\n\nrecord, the appellant argued below — as he does before us — that\n\nthe charges against him should be dismissed to sanction the\n\ngovernment and deter it from inflicting such indignities upon\n\nprisoners in the future.\n\n          The    district     court,    after    hearing     the   evidence,\n\ndetermined that the conduct of the arresting officers was not\n\noutrageous, and refused to dismiss the charges.                It observed\n\nthat the appellant \"didn't get arrested for not praying in\n\nchurch; [he] got arrested for rock throwing, hurting people, and\n\nfor trespassing.\"    While the court indicated some disapproval of\n\nthe   Navy's    course   of   conduct    and     acknowledged      that   the\n\nconsequences to the appellant were not \"pleasant,\" it concluded\n\nthat no valid basis existed for dismissal of the charges.                 The\n\ncourt grounded this conclusion on its finding that the Navy's\n\n\n\n\n      2\n     The record contains no indication that                  the   appellant\nrequested food or water during this period.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fhandling of the matter did not \"involv[e] extreme physical or\n\npsychological abuse to the defendant.\"\n\n          The     district    court's     ultimate    conclusion      that    the\n\ngovernment was not guilty of misconduct sufficient to justify\n\ndismissal of the charges engenders de novo review.                       United\n\nStates v. Nunez, 146 F.3d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1998); United States\n\nv. Diggs, 8 F.3d 1520, 1523 (10th Cir. 1993).                       The court's\n\nfactual findings, however, are reviewable only for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          In rare and extreme circumstances, a federal court has\n\nthe authority to dismiss criminal charges as a sanction for\n\ngovernment misconduct.        United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423,\n\n431-32 (1973); United States v. Mosley, 965 F.2d 906, 911 (10th\n\nCir. 1992); see also Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484,\n\n491-95   (1976)    (affirming       the   existence    of    the     outrageous\n\ngovernmental misconduct doctrine articulated by the Russell\n\nCourt) (dictum).      But the law frowns on the exoneration of a\n\ndefendant for reasons unrelated to his guilt or innocence, and,\n\naccordingly,    the   power    to   dismiss   charges       based    solely   on\n\ngovernment misconduct must be used sparingly.               See United States\n\nv. Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (warning that \"[p]otent\n\nelixirs should not be casually dispensed\").            It follows that the\n\noutrageous government misconduct doctrine is reserved for the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fmost appalling and egregious situations.          See United States v.\n\nBarbosa, 271 F.3d 438, 469 (3d Cir. 2001).          At the very least,\n\nthe defendant must show that the challenged conduct violates\n\ncommonly accepted norms of fundamental fairness and is shocking\n\nto the universal sense of justice.         Russell, 411 U.S. at 432;\n\nNunez, 146 F.3d at 38; United States v. Matiz, 14 F.3d 79, 82\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Here,   the   challenged    conduct   does    not   cross   the\n\nextremely high threshold of the outrageous government misconduct\n\ndoctrine.    The Navy was faced with large numbers of protesters,\n\nin a tense atmosphere.      The appellant had committed a crime of\n\nviolence — throwing rocks at naval personnel — and posed obvious\n\nsafety concerns.     The surroundings were fairly primitive, and\n\ncircumstances forced the Navy to improvise.        Such considerations\n\nmatter.     See Santana, 6 F.3d at 6 (\"What shocks the conscience\n\nin a given situation may be acceptable, although perhaps grim or\n\nunpleasant, under a different set of circumstances.\").           Finally,\n\nthe actions of which the appellant complains did not compromise\n\nhis defense or prejudice his case.         This is a consideration of\n\nsome moment.    See United States v. Voigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1066 (3d\n\nCir. 1996); see also Santana, 6 F.3d at 11 (explaining that\n\nfederal   courts    ordinarily   should    \"refrain      from   using   the\n\nsupervisory power to conform executive conduct to judicially\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fpreferred    norms     by   dismissing   charges,   absent     cognizable\n\nprejudice to a particular defendant\").\n\n            We need go no further.       In this instance, the trial\n\ncourt's factual findings are solidly anchored in the record, and\n\nits legal conclusion follows logically from those findings.\n\nWhile the naval personnel involved in this incident             certainly\n\ncould have been more considerate in their handling of detainees,\n\nthe measures that they took were roughly proportionate to the\n\ncontext in which the detention occurred.         In all events, nothing\n\nabout the officers' conduct was so clearly intolerable or so\n\noffensive   to   the   universal   sense   of   justice   as   to   warrant\n\njettisoning the charges.        What transpired here was not pretty,\n\nbut to call it \"brutal torture,\" Appellant's Br. at 7, is to\n\nelevate hyperbole over common sense.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

A third count, which accused the appellant of assaulting a United States Deputy Marshal, was abandoned midstream and need not concern us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant moved to dismiss the charges due to outrageous government misconduct. The district court decided to take evidence on this motion and withheld an immediate ruling. On June 13, 2001, the court conducted a bench trial that doubled in brass as an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss. The court denied the motion, found the appellant guilty on both remaining counts, and imposed concurrent sentences of forty-five days' imprisonment on count 1 and ninety days' imprisonment on count 2. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant assigns error only to the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss. The facts touching upon this motion are largely undisputed. On April 27, 2001, the Navy, consistent with a previous announcement, commenced battle-preparedness exercises, including simulated bombing, near the island of Vieques. A swarm of protesters appeared. About fifty of them, including the appellant, tore down a portion of the fence that marked the perimeter of Camp Garcia and entered the base without permission. Once inside, they engaged in various forms of disruptive conduct. For his part, the appellant hurled rocks that hit and injured at least one petty officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, the appellant again entered the base illegally. This time, naval security personnel apprehended him (along with approximately twenty other protesters). Pursuant to routine procedure, they handcuffed all the detainees and transported them by truck to a holding area. Processing proceeded along standard lines. The regimen included searching each detainee, completing necessary paperwork, and taking photographs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the holding area, two officers recognized the appellant as a rock-thrower from the previous day. They promptly classified him as a security risk and segregated him from the other detainees. Naval personnel placed him on his knees with his cuffed hands against a wall and guarded him until he was called for processing. The appellant was kept in this position for, at most, seventy minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was barefoot and clad in shorts when arrested. The floor of the yard in which he was held was of cement construction, and the venue was exposed to the elements (including the midday tropical sun). At one point, the appellant asked to be taken inside the detention center, but his request was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was one of the last persons processed. The government asserts, without contradiction, that this was because security personnel were awaiting the arrival of a special agent of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to conduct an investigation of the assault that had occurred on the previous day. After all the detainees (including the appellant) had been processed, they were transported to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station (about a two-hour boat ride) and arraigned there by a magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant premises his claim of outrageous government misconduct on these events. In his counsel's words, the pat-down search of his clothing and body \"can only be characterized a[s] offensive, unnecessary and brutal.\" Appellant's Br. at 12. Forcing him to kneel, barefooted, on a cement floor, with his handcuffed hands over his head, for more than one hour, amounted to \"torture.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13. This inhumane treatment was all the worse because he received no food or water,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and was afforded no rest. Based on this view of the record, the appellant argued below &#8212; as he does before us &#8212; that the charges against him should be dismissed to sanction the government and deter it from inflicting such indignities upon prisoners in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after hearing the evidence, determined that the conduct of the arresting officers was not outrageous, and refused to dismiss the charges. It observed that the appellant \"didn't get arrested for not praying in church; [he] got arrested for rock throwing, hurting people, and for trespassing.\" While the court indicated some disapproval of the Navy's course of conduct and acknowledged that the consequences to the appellant were not \"pleasant,\" it concluded that no valid basis existed for dismissal of the charges. The court grounded this conclusion on its finding that the Navy's handling of the matter did not \"involv[e] extreme physical or psychological abuse to the defendant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's ultimate conclusion that the government was not guilty of misconduct sufficient to justify dismissal of the charges engenders de novo review. <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span> (1976) (affirming the existence of the outrageous governmental misconduct doctrine articulated by the <i>Russell</i> Court) (dictum). But the law frowns on the exoneration of a defendant for reasons unrelated to his guilt or innocence, and, accordingly, the power to dismiss charges based solely on government misconduct must be used sparingly. <i>See United States v. Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654192\"><a href=\"/opinion/654192/united-states-v-rafael-santana-and-francis-fuentes/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (warning that \"[p]otent elixirs should not be casually dispensed\"). It follows that the outrageous government misconduct doctrine is reserved for the most appalling and egregious situations. <i>See United States v. Barbosa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775561\"><a href=\"/opinion/775561/united-states-v-luis-humberto-barbosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 469 (3d Cir.2001). At the very least, the defendant must show that the challenged conduct violates commonly accepted norms of fundamental fairness and is shocking to the universal sense of justice. <i>Russell,</i> 411 U.S. at 432, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108768\"><a href=\"/opinion/108768/united-states-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Navy was faced with large numbers of protesters, in a tense atmosphere. The appellant had committed a crime of violence &#8212; throwing rocks at naval personnel &#8212; and posed obvious safety concerns. The surroundings were fairly primitive, and circumstances forced the Navy to improvise. Such considerations matter. <i>See Santana,</i> 6 F.3d at 6 (\"What shocks the conscience in a given situation may be acceptable, although perhaps grim or unpleasant, under a different set of circumstances.\"). Finally, the actions of which the appellant complains did not compromise his defense or prejudice his case. This is a consideration of some moment. <i>See United States v. Voigt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722380\"><a href=\"/opinion/722380/united-states-v-john-voigt/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span>, 1066 (3d Cir.1996); <i>see also Santana,</i> 6 F.3d at 11 (explaining that federal courts ordinarily should \"refrain from using the supervisory power to conform executive conduct to judicially preferred norms by dismissing charges, absent cognizable prejudice to a particular defendant\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. In this instance, the trial court's factual findings are solidly anchored in the record, and its legal conclusion follows logically from those findings. While the naval personnel involved in this incident certainly could have been more considerate in their handling of detainees, the measures that they took were roughly proportionate to the context in which the detention occurred. In all events, nothing about the officers' conduct was so clearly intolerable or so offensive to the universal sense of justice as to warrant jettisoning the charges.
