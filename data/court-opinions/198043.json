D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Joseph S. Berman and Berman &amp; Dowell on brief for appellant.\r\n Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, Jonathan A. Toof and\r\nF. Mark Terison, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJuly 1, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we perceive no merit in defendant's appellate\r\narguments.  Particularly, the district court considered the\r\nappropriate factors in revoking defendant's supervised release\r\nand in imposing a term of imprisonment.  We will not second-\r\nguess the district court's assessment of witness credibility\r\nand resolution of the conflicting evidence as to the time of\r\nthe sexual assault.  The upward departure was amply supported\r\nby the record and reasonable in degree.  We decline to address\r\nthe constitutional arguments that defendant raises for the\r\nfirst time on appeal.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
