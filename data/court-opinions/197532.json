For  the following reasons, we  find that appellants'\r\n\ncontentions lack merit.\r\n\n          1.    Damages.   First,  \"[w]e  generally  will not\r                                   \r\n\nreview  a  party's  contention  that  the  damages  award  is\r\n\nexcessive or insufficient where the party has failed to allow\r\n\nthe  district court  to rule  on  the matter.\"   O'Connor  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHuard, 117 F.3d  12, 18 (1st Cir. 1997).  The record reflects\r                 \r\n\nthat  the district  court  was never  provided  with such  an\r\n\nopportunity.   In  any event,  the  only evidence  appellants\r\n\npresent in support of their  claim that the damages award was\r\n\ntoo  low is new  evidence.   Of course,  this court  does not\r\n\nconsider  arguments or evidence not presented to the district\r\n\ncourt.   Matthews v.  Marsh, 755 F.2d  182, 183-84  (1st Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1985).\r\n\n          2.   Joseph  Doe's Dismissal.  We  think that  what\r                                                  \r\n\nappellants really  are  complaining  about  is  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  denial  of  their   motion  to  substitute   \"Robert\r\n\nConstine\" for  \"Joseph Doe,\"  which we treat  as a  motion to\r\n\namend  the complaint  to  add an  additional  defendant.   We\r\n\nreview the denial  of such a motion for  abuse of discretion.\r\n\nResolution Trust  Corp. v. Gold,  30 F.3d 251, 253  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1994).  \"[U]nseemly delay, in combination with other factors,\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmay warrant denial  of a suggested amendment.\"   Quaker State\r                                                                         \r\n\nOil Refining  Corp. v. Garrity  Oil Co., 884 F.2d  1510, 1517\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n          Here,  appellants  waited  to  move  to  amend  the\r\n\ncomplaint  for about one year after  the other police officer\r\n\ninvolved in Hideko's  arrest had been identified.   In such a\r\n\nsituation, \"the movant[s]  ha[ve] the burden of  showing some\r                                  \r\n\nvalid reason for  [their] neglect and delay.\"   Grant v. News\r                                                                         \r\n\nGroup Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995).  Appellants\r                              \r\n\ndo  not present  such reasons.    First, to  the extent  that\r\n\nappellants allege  that the  actions of  their prior  counsel\r\n\ncontributed to the  delay in moving  to amend the  complaint,\r\n\nappellants  are  bound by  the  acts  or omissions  of  their\r\n\nattorneys.  United States v.  One Lot of $25,721 in Currency,\r                                                                        \r\n\n938 F.2d 1417, 1422 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          Second,  the  record  reveals  that  after  counsel\r\n\nwithdrew,  it was appellants'  own inaction which  caused the\r\n\nfurther  delay.    Such inaction  cannot  constitute  a valid\r\n\nreason.   See  Hayes v.  New  England Millwork  Distributors,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc.,  602 F.2d  15, 20 (1st  Cir. 1979).   In any  event, we\r                \r\n\nthink  that both  the court and  the police  defendants would\r\n\nhave been  prejudiced by the  addition of a new  defendant so\r\n\nlate  in the  case because  discovery  would have  had to  be\r\n\nreopened.  See Grant, 55 F.3d at 5-6.\r                                \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          3.    Motion  of  Francis  M.  Roache  for  Summary\r                                                                         \r\n\nJudgment.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in\r                    \r\n\ndenying appellants' request for more time in which to conduct\r\n\nthe discovery  necessary to  oppose this  motion because  the\r\n\nrecord  reveals that  prior  to the  motion,  ample time  had\r\n\nexisted  for such  discovery.   See Price  v.  General Motors\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., 931 F.2d 162, 164  (1st Cir. 1991) (a party  must show\r                 \r\n\n\"good  cause\" for  the failure  to  have conducted  discovery\r\n\nearlier).   Further, \"[a]  court may  grant summary  judgment\r\n\ndespite  an opposing party's claim that discovery would yield\r\n\nadditional facts  where the  opposing party  has not  alleged\r\n\nspecific   facts  that   could  be  developed   through  such\r\n\ndiscovery.\"  Taylor v. Gallagher, 737 F,2d 134, 137 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1984).  Appellants alleged no such facts here.\r\n\n          We  have  reviewed  the  remainder  of  appellants'\r\n\narguments and can  find no reason to disturb  the judgment of\r\n\nthe district court.  Affirmed.\r                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",

In any  event, we\r                \r\n\nthink  that both  the court and  the police  defendants would\r\n\nhave been  prejudiced by the  addition of a new  defendant so\r\n\nlate  in the  case because  discovery  would have  had to  be\r\n\nreopened.  See Grant, 55 F.3d at 5-6.\r                                \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          3.    Motion  of  Francis  M.  Roache  for  Summary\r                                                                         \r\n\nJudgment.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in\r                    \r\n\ndenying appellants' request for more time in which to conduct\r\n\nthe discovery  necessary to  oppose this  motion because  the\r\n\nrecord  reveals that  prior  to the  motion,  ample time  had\r\n\nexisted  for such  discovery.

General Motors\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559875\"><a href=\"/opinion/559875/herbert-w-price-etc-v-general-motors-corporation-herbert-w-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164  (1st Cir. 1991) (a party  must show\r                 \r\n\n\"good  cause\" for  the failure  to  have conducted  discovery\r\n\nearlier).   Further, \"[a]  court may  grant summary  judgment\r\n\ndespite  an opposing party's claim that discovery would yield\r\n\nadditional facts  where the  opposing party  has not  alleged\r\n\nspecific   facts  that   could  be  developed   through  such\r\n\ndiscovery.\"  Taylor v.
